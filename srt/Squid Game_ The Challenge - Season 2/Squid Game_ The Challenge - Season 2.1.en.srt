1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,360
<i>I promised myself going into this game</i>

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>that there would be no line</i>
<i>that I wouldn't be willing to cross.</i>

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,880
<i>I think it is important to be liked,</i>

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>especially in this game.</i>

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,440
<i>If you make enemies, then now</i>
<i>you have a target on your back, right?</i>

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,600
<i>In this game,</i>
<i>loyalty can get you pretty far,</i>

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,680
<i>but I mean,</i>
<i>betrayal could win you $4.56 million.</i>

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>Death is smiling at all of us.</i>

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,640
<i>Except for one.</i>

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,600
<i>And all everybody else can do,</i>
<i>really, is just smile back.</i>

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,160
<i>Smile!</i>

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,240
- <i>Yo!</i>
- <i>We in the dorms!</i>

13
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,160
- We in the dorms! Oh!
- We in, baby! We in!

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,160
Whoo!

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,160
Yeah.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Yeah!

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,440
Dad, this is crazy!

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,640
Wow!

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,080
This is my daughter.
This… Everybody, this is my daughter.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Dad, stop. You're embarrassing me.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,840
456 players.

22
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,600
There's no way that there's enough beds
for 456 people right now.

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,240
Something is up, though.

24
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,600
Now the games really begin.

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,200
Players, welcome to Squid Game.

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,960
While here, you will compete in games

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,200
and face a number of tests.

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,640
With the first starting now.

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,360
What?

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,840
Now they're getting serious.

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
This test will require two volunteers

32
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
to step forward.

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
This is wild.

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,920
- Don't step forward. Don't step forward.
- No, no, no. No.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
What if it's immunity?

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,840
- So you wanna do it?
- No.

37
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,720
It's too early. I don't think we should.

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,360
Bro, what do we do? Do we go up or not?

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
- Dad.
- No, I wanna see.

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,880
- I just wanna see.
- We're fine! We're fine!

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,320
It's never good, Dad, no.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,960
- No, we're not.
- I just wanna see.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,280
- We're not going.
- Then-- Then don't worry about it.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,960
Just be careful, cousin.
Nobody steps up, usually they--

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,520
- I know.
- That's the problem.

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm scared
that they're gonna do something.

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,040
No one else is stepping up.
No one else is stepping up.

48
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's do it. Let's do it!

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,080
They got somebody.

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,720
Good. There go the twins.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
- We've got this, yeah?
- Yeah.

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Player 432, please stand on the X.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,240
Player 431, please stand on the O.

54
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,760
This could be the last time I see you.
And if it is…

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,240
Good luck.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,360
All other players must now divide equally

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,600
into X's and O's.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,560
It's time to go, boys.

59
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,400
All right, man. We got you.

60
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,080
- Jacob.
- Jacob!

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,440
Come on!

62
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,400
Remember, this is easy, baby.
This is easy. It's easy.

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
You got it.

64
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,560
X's, follow the staff into the White Room.

65
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,960
O's, remain here in the dorm.

66
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Whoa.

67
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
What is this?

68
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,720
<i>What is this?</i>

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
<i>What is this? What is this? What do we do?</i>

70
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,440
- This is the White Room.
- What does that mean?

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,480
What does that mean?
Oh, we have X's there. We have an X.

72
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,840
<i>Attention, players.</i>

73
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
<i>Only one room will survive this test.</i>

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
<i>The other will be eliminated.</i>

75
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,720
What? Come on!

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,920
We got this, we got this.
Lock in, lock in, lock in.

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
<i>This test is simple.</i>

78
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,160
<i>All you need to do is count.</i>

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,120
What? Count, count. One, two.

80
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,360
<i>Player 432, player 431,</i>

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,960
<i>shortly, a timer will begin.</i>

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,200
<i>When your room believes</i>
<i>456 seconds have elapsed,</i>

83
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,160
<i>you must push the button.</i>

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
Come on. Okay.

85
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,440
<i>The room closest to 456 will survive.</i>

86
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,720
- We got this.
- We got you.

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,480
<i>The other room will be eliminated.</i>

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,920
Who's confident in counting?

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,360
431, 431. Ask if anybody's
a musician in the group.

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,760
- He counts to 100 perfectly.
- This is one thing that I trained.

91
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,760
He's a musician.

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
I can't hear everyone
when they're speaking.

93
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
They're gonna get us killed.
These bitches are gonna get me killed.

94
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
Please. Can we just stop talking, yeah?

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
All right, guys, shut up! Come on. Listen.

96
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,000
Why don't we use people's bodies?

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,160
When he gets to ten,
somebody goes to the wall.

98
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,280
- When he gets to 20--
- I think that's too complicated.

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Everyone, stop! It is seven minutes.

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,480
Lock in.
Think about what you gave to be here.

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,640
Let him do it. We're gonna win this
with faith and belief in each other.

102
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,680
We got this!

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,760
<i>Let's get it! Come on!</i>

104
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,280
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.</i>

105
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,480
Guys, we can't communicate
if everyone's talking.

106
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,480
We got a nurse back there.
She does the counts.

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,680
We-- She does the compressions.
She knows it.

108
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,880
Nineteen, twenty.

109
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,520
Bring the nurse. Is she confident?

110
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,240
One, two.

111
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
Nobody is stepping up to the plate.

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,720
It's a lot of weight
to have everybody's fate in your hands.

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,480
But I save lives for a living,

114
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,640
and I have people's fate
in my hands every day,

115
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
so I believe that I can do it.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,760
Okay, group. Let me tell you something.

117
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
We are counting for all of you.

118
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Please do not blame us
if we do not make it.

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,480
- No, no, no, no.
- We believe in you!

120
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's keep the confidence.
Let's keep-- You got this, you got this.

121
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,400
All right, so here's the idea, right?

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,080
He's gonna keep time for us.

123
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,840
And so he's a-- a musician, so he's gonna
give you a good reference point.

124
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,320
Yeah, that's good.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,080
- Mike, you got this.
- I got it.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,000
- One at a time. Take it calm.
- I'm good at this.

127
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,400
- You do this for a living.
- I do.

128
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
- This is for all of us, bro.
- I've got great timing.

129
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,200
I believe in you. That's why we chose you.

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,760
We gotta make sure they're on--
They're on the right pace.

131
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,360
I know. We'll count back here.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,680
But he needs to have one person
give him the command.

133
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,080
- I know.
- If someone talks out loud, we're done.

134
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
- I know.
- So that's what we have to tell him.

135
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,120
- Tell him to listen to one person.
- All right, I will.

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
- But we just gotta stay back--
- Listen to one person!

137
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,320
We gotta stay back and just let them talk.

138
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,320
<i>Attention, players.</i>

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,280
We're good, we're good.

140
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,040
<i>Your time…</i>

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,920
<i>starts…</i>

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,840
<i>now.</i>

143
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,120
One, two, three, four, and…

144
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,520
…five, six…

145
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
Ready?

146
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,160
One, two, three,

147
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,840
four, five…

148
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,320
…six, seven, eight, nine…

149
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, my God,
why has she only just started counting?

150
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,160
…58, 59, 160, 161…

151
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,960
Being in a band, I've had
the opportunity to play for huge crowds,

152
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,280
but the feeling in this room
is so overwhelming.

153
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,280
There's so much on the line.

154
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,160
…71, 72…

155
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Are we going too slow?

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,440
…74, 75, 76,

157
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,880
77, 78, 79…

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
I'm nervous.

159
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,800
This is brutal. This is brutal.

160
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,720
…183, 184…

161
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,000
My own destiny
is in my own hand at this point,

162
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,160
but I have to trust me,
trust my instincts,

163
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,560
so I believe in me.

164
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,480
…54, 55…

165
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
Is she slow?

166
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,480
She seems too slow, I think.

167
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
…40, 41, 42…

168
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,240
…298, 299, 300, 301, 302,

169
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
303, 304…

170
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
- They're speeding up.
- It's because they're getting excited.

171
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,920
…307…

172
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,840
…42, 43…

173
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,800
She's going way too slow.
Can you tell him that? Tell him.

174
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,480
- Slow.
- Slow?

175
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,640
Yes!

176
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
100%?

177
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,040
100%!

178
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,440
I don't know who to listen to right now.

179
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,800
Do I listen to the nurse?
Do I listen to the crowd?

180
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,280
There is so much pressure.

181
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,320
<i>We're not going out like this.</i>

182
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,200
<i>You have the lives</i>
<i>of over 200 people in your hands.</i>

183
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,400
<i>The blue O's have to focus up right now,</i>

184
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,320
<i>get it together,</i>
<i>and we gotta send those red X's home.</i>

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,520
…three, four, five…

186
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,080
…451, 452, 453…

187
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,480
What is this guy doing?

188
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,720
What are you doing?

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,280
Oh, my God!

190
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,640
Sit!

191
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,400
…36, 37…

192
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,560
…45, 46, 47,

193
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,040
48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53…

194
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
…54, 55…

195
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
Now!

196
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,000
…48, 49, 50…

197
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
Push it, push it, push it, push it.

198
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,800
No. No!

199
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,840
Stop.

200
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
Push it, push it, push it!

201
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,400
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

202
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,960
- X!
- X! X! X! X! X!

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,800
That's the red team! That's them.

204
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,400
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

205
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,520
Don't worry, they'll be leaving soon.
Get off my bed. Stop.

206
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
Get your feet off my bed.

207
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
<i>Attention, players.</i>

208
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,680
<i>The result of the first test</i>
<i>is as follows.</i>

209
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Please, please, please, please, please.
Dear Lord Jesus.

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,400
<i>One room was out by two seconds.</i>

211
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,440
- Ooh!
<i>- The other by 12 seconds.</i>

212
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,840
No!

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,720
<i>Baby, you understand me now</i>

214
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,320
<i>If sometimes you see that I'm mad </i>

215
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,840
<i>Don't you know no one alive</i>
<i>Can always be an angel?</i>

216
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
<i>When everything goes wrong</i>
<i>You see some bad </i>

217
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,120
<i>But I'm just a soul </i>

218
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,720
<i>Whose intentions are good </i>

219
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,560
<i>Please don't let me be misunderstood</i>

220
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,400
<i>If I seem edgy, I want you to know </i>

221
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,320
<i>I never mean to take it out… </i>

222
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
We did it!

223
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,160
432! 432! 432! 432!

224
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,960
I've lost my brother in this game.

225
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,880
And this is not what I wanted to happen.

226
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,720
<i>Player 431.</i>

227
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,320
<i>As you were brave enough to volunteer,</i>

228
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,880
you will survive this test.

229
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,040
<i>But your survival comes</i>

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
<i>at a price.</i>

231
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,680
Oh, my God.

232
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,360
- It's exciting. Like, this is our home.
- I know. Isn't that wild?

233
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,800
Like, this is our home.

234
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,360
- Zoe, I got yours.
- No. I'm over there with the girls.

235
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,680
We're in the middle. We're spreading out.

236
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,560
- Okay.
- It's… It will be better.

237
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm there with Emily, T…

238
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,680
- Okay.
- …and another girl.

239
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,320
- Okay, you sure? Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

240
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,840
God, that was so epic, dude.
Oh, my God, man.

241
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,520
And you know what's gonna happen?

242
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,320
People are gonna start
coming up to you for sure,

243
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,080
um, about an alliance. You're gonna have
to figure out what you're gonna say.

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,560
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna be for--

245
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm gonna go in 40 alliances if I have to.

246
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,480
- That's it.
- That's true.

247
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,400
Yeah, I'll just say--

248
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
We're gonna work it
till we can't work it no more.

249
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,040
- How you holding up?
- It's hard, because--

250
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,880
Yeah, you've gone against your brother.

251
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,800
You made a decision together
to do what you did.

252
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
We did wanna be together the whole time.

253
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,120
Come here, man. Bless your heart.

254
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,160
It's deep, man. I really feel bad for him,

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,640
but I'm gonna do it for him now.

256
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm doing it for him now.
So, if I win, it's 50-50.

257
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,680
You're here, and he isn't, right?

258
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,840
- Yeah. At least one of us is here.
- Absolutely.

259
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,440
Back in 2022, I, um, had a seizure.

260
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
And…

261
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,320
Raul, he--

262
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,600
he basically caught me in the air
whilst I was having this seizure.

263
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,600
It was tough because, um, he's in my arms,

264
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,400
his breathing's slowing down,

265
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,880
his eyes have gone
to the back of his head,

266
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,400
they're yellow, he's foaming blood, and…

267
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,840
uh, I thought he was dead.

268
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,560
We found out that he had a brain tumor

269
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,720
and was told
that he might have one year to live.

270
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,720
I-- I don't know
what I would've done if that was the case.

271
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,960
After two weeks,
I got sat down by the doctor, and he said,

272
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,960
"You're gonna be completely fine.
It's just a benign brain tumor."

273
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,520
"Would you like to get it out or not?"

274
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,080
Which I couldn't believe.
I was just like, "Yes, please."

275
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,280
I remember when we left the hospital room,
me and my family just hugged,

276
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,840
and the whole hospital just realized
something was going on,

277
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,360
and it was good news,
so they were just clapping and stuff,

278
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
and we were just like,
"This is good news."

279
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,200
It was the best moment of my life, really.

280
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,080
- Oh, it's happening.
- Here we go.

281
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh, my God!

282
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,400
Why is he here?

283
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
<i>Player 431,</i>

284
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,840
<i>as you were brave enough to volunteer,</i>
<i>you may now reenter the dorm.</i>

285
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,640
That's great!

286
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,880
Yes!

287
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,000
All right, guys.

288
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,560
This is my twin, Raul.

289
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,040
Mate, it's been a bit of a mission.

290
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,000
Come on!

291
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
X! X! X! X! X! X!

292
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,560
X! X! X! X! X! X! X! X!

293
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,920
<i>Right.</i>

294
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,880
Just act normal. Just act like…

295
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
Yeah, everyone's looking at us.

296
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,880
Just, like, laugh.

297
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
- Like, man. Like, just act.
- Oh, my God.

298
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,760
- What have you got to say?
- I've got a mission.

299
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm very scared someone
might get eliminated tonight

300
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,040
because Raul just got back in.

301
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,960
The twin?

302
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,320
Yeah. I'm scared
that something bad might happen to me.

303
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,720
Do you think
they're about to eliminate somebody?

304
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Genuinely, they might.

305
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm on a mission
to find three people to eliminate.

306
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,480
I basically have an hour
to eliminate three people.

307
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,840
I have to basically go up to them
and say their number and say,

308
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,280
"Good luck in the game."

309
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,120
But if I don't, Jacob, this is the thing,
if I don't do it…

310
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
- Yeah?
- Then we get out.

311
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,760
My tactic is to find someone that's, like,
got bad intentions with money

312
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,920
or a good strategy plan I see as a threat.

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I need to find three good targets

314
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
with reasons I think
are worthy of elimination.

315
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,080
You're the twin, man.
You made it back. How you feel?

316
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,520
I just hope I don't raise suspicion
because I don't wanna get caught.

317
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,840
If you win, what do you reckon
you'll do with the money?

318
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,360
Bro, I couldn't even think about it.
I-- I can't even… That's a lot of money.

319
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,400
One of my daughters is autistic,
and I homeschool her right now.

320
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,800
So the first thing I would do

321
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,800
is put the money towards the funding
for school that we can't afford now.

322
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,080
- Wow.
- That's really why I'm here. Honestly.

323
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
- That's really-- That's amazing.
- That's really why I'm here.

324
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,960
- We lost my grandfather to leukemia.
- Really? Damn, man.

325
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,960
So I'd love to…
Bro, if I can be 23 years old

326
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,520
and give a big, like, millions
to leukemia research…

327
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,560
- Mate, that sounds like a good cause.
- That's game-changing, bro. You know?

328
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,160
Every single answer is just too pure.

329
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm not eliminating someone that needs
the money that much. I can't do that.

330
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,440
What are you gonna do with the money?

331
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,120
Honestly, I would rent
a super yacht for like a week,

332
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
and I would take me
and all my friends out,

333
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,360
and we would just party.

334
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,600
That's the first thing I would do,
then I'd give to charities.

335
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,640
But first thing I would do,
party super hard with my friends.

336
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,520
Boom. I feel like I have found
a good reason to eliminate player 107.

337
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
107. We've got to find her.

338
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,440
There, bro. The stairs, behind you.

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,840
Got her now. With glasses, braids?

340
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,840
There. We need to get this done, mate.

341
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
Let's sit next to her.

342
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
- How's it going?
- What's up, brother?

343
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,040
Good.

344
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,880
Player 107. Good luck in the game, yeah.

345
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,240
Something's amiss.

346
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,160
I think we're missing…
There's, like, one bed.

347
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,840
No, there's three missing.

348
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,960
So, there's too many beds?
Or too few beds?

349
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,120
There's too few beds.

350
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,120
- Well, I hope we're safe.
- Me too.

351
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,480
I don't wanna get eliminated
because of something stupid.

352
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,680
The threats right now is 432, 431.

353
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,520
I think they're actually doing
a challenge.

354
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,680
There's a weird vibe.
There's a weird vibe.

355
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,280
I'm even scared to go back out there,

356
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,680
'cause I don't even want
my number to be seen.

357
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,960
I don't trust either of the twins,
actually, I'll say. The British ones.

358
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh, we gotta get rid of 'em.
We should get rid of them.

359
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,960
Let's just all agree to get 'em out, dude.

360
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,560
I've definitely got
my eyes peeled for 431.

361
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,800
I don't know how he survived.

362
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,920
I'm suspicious.

363
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,960
First opportunity I get,
they're going straight under the bus.

364
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,360
He's just another rung on my ladder
to four and a half million dollars.

365
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I'm on team Jonti,
and it's not recruiting.

366
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,680
This is our fate.
If we don't do this, we're out.

367
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,520
Stay focused.

368
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,720
I'm thinking what I'm gonna do
with the money. What are you thinking?

369
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
- I'm not… I have ideas. I'm engaged.
- Be honest, yeah.

370
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,320
I'll give myself and my fiancée…
We're big nerds.

371
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
So we wanna have a <i>Star Wars </i>wedding.

372
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
That's cool, man.
That's actually got me thinking.

373
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,000
That wedding's gonna be so cool.

374
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,600
I mean, I like <i>Star Wars,</i>

375
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,440
but if it's me and my brother
or them that has to get eliminated,

376
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm choosing us.

377
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,360
- What do you reckon? You got it?
- Yeah, it's gonna be quite savage.

378
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,280
Who is it?

379
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,240
100.

380
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Okay.

381
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,760
He's gonna spend his money
on a <i>Star Wars </i>wedding.

382
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I think my fiancée would describe me
as very kind-hearted.

383
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Very sweet, very funny.

384
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,520
She loves when I giggle.

385
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Um, she loves how excited I get
about silly, fun things.

386
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,320
Uh, I am crying.

387
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,720
Um…

388
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,080
All my life, I've always known
that I wanted a funny, cute redhead

389
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,240
who makes me so happy,

390
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,240
uh, who has a good heart,
who's beautiful, a nerd.

391
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,760
And that's exactly what I got with her.

392
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,880
Ready?

393
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,480
What do you do?

394
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,320
I d-- I'm a personal trainer.

395
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,760
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, yeah.

396
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,120
I was telling him
about your <i>Star Wars </i>wedding.

397
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,440
- Yeah. I've really thought about this.
- Yeah.

398
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,480
And what I wanna do
is, um, rent out Disneyland.

399
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,480
And what we wanna do-- what I wanna do

400
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,680
is have full droids, like, give
the rings and shit like that.

401
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,800
That's insane, man.
That's a good dream come true.

402
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,040
Yeah. I mean, like…

403
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,040
Like, my brain's like…

404
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,720
If I somehow win the money,
I have, like, one million to my parents.

405
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,320
A million is, like, for me and Rachel,
just, like, do what we need to do.

406
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,480
And a million is, like,
for the best wedding we can have.

407
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,000
Because my whole job as her fiancé

408
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,360
is to make sure she knows
that she's loved, cared for.

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
- So, yeah.
- That's sick, man.

410
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
- I'm so happy you're here, dude.
- Thank you.

411
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
- Good to meet you.
- I'm happy you're here.

412
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,280
Thank you, man. Cheers.

413
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,800
I can't do it, man. He was too nice.

414
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>A couple of people we've never met,</i>

415
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,040
they're like,
"Oh, you're the father-daughter team."

416
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,600
And they're like, "We heard about you."
And I'm like, "That could be bad, right?"

417
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,840
We're all making friends, you know?
So it's cool. What about your daughter?

418
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,000
She made any friends or no?

419
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
She's over there
talking to a group of girls.

420
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,280
She's scouting. Good.

421
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,160
You've got to stop.

422
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,080
There he goes.

423
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,120
I love it so much.

424
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,200
The social aspect
of playing this game is twofold.

425
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,760
One, it's for your own sanity,

426
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,760
and two, you have to get
people to like you

427
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,120
when it comes down
to continuing in the game.

428
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,240
I've really tried really, really hard
to try to meet everybody.

429
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,800
It's amazing how well
you get to know people,

430
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,800
how fast you get to know 'em
in this environment.

431
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,080
He's driving me insane.

432
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,160
I'm gonna have a chat with my dad
and tell him to back off everyone.

433
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,480
- Oh, he's doing fine.
- No!

434
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,960
Just a wee bit.

435
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,800
My dad just has a pretty big personality.

436
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,560
He is super social.

437
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,600
He could talk to a brick wall,

438
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,720
and definitely, like,
puts a target on our backs,

439
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,560
and that just makes me nervous.

440
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,760
Marlon? Curt, nice to meet you.

441
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,080
Player 432,

442
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>you and your brother</i>
<i>have five minutes to make your choice.</i>

443
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,880
My God, panic is starting to set in.

444
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
If Raul doesn't get this right,
our time is over.

445
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
The pressure's on.

446
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,080
But I need to keep calm,
and let's get this done.

447
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,120
Let's get on it, yeah?

448
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
Come on. We got to think about us, yeah?

449
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,400
Look at them right there.

450
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,480
They scheming and being messy.

451
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,360
You know the identical twins,
what about them?

452
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,400
It's two people.

453
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,000
For a good reason,
'cause it's an alliance, you know?

454
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,680
If it's an alliance, it's a strategy.

455
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,920
If somebody has the opportunity

456
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,760
to eliminate you and me,
they're gonna take that opportunity.

457
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,960
I don't know.
We don't really talk to anybody, though.

458
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,680
But they might see that as a threat.

459
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,800
70% of these people don't even know
our names or, like, our numbers.

460
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,280
- You know the dad and daughter?
- No!

461
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,120
Mate, it's either them or us.

462
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,360
Dad, I really think
you have to chill a little bit.

463
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,560
Zoe, you wanna be in the biggest alliance.

464
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,680
All I'm asking is to tone it down a notch

465
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,760
with the running around
and, like, being the first up.

466
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,000
I am not the first up.

467
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,920
- Yes, you are.
- Okay, it's fine.

468
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,560
- We need to get this done, mate.
- Ready?

469
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,280
Let's do it.

470
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm not saying
having an alliance is a bad thing.

471
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,560
I'm just asking you
to tone down the theatrics.

472
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
- I'm not being theatrical.
- How's it going? Good to see you guys.

473
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,120
All right? What's up?

474
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,760
Well, I don't know what's going on.

475
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,160
There's so much luck in this game.
Like, so much luck.

476
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,760
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- I just hope that we get through, innit?

477
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,240
Player 285, good luck in the game.
Player 286, good luck in the game.

478
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,840
- You too.
- Damn.

479
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,080
- Yeah, we'll make it.
- We're all still here.

480
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,160
Honestly, I feel so bad.

481
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,680
They have no clue.

482
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,080
But then again, eliminating three people,
it doesn't matter to me.

483
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,840
The fact that I just saved us
means the world.

484
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,320
Oh, there's a square.

485
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,320
Don't squares kill 'em?
Or no, that's triangles.

486
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Players, here are the results so far.

487
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,560
Out of 456 players,

488
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,680
227 have been eliminated.

489
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,320
No.

490
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,720
Oh, my God.

491
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,440
Yo!

492
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,480
- Yeah!
- Here we go.

493
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,800
There it goes. There it goes.

494
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,760
Yeah! Oh, my God. That's a lot of money.

495
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,520
<i>Mucho dinero.</i>

496
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,520
Oh, my God.

497
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,960
Wow.

498
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,200
The current total stands at $2.27 million.

499
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,000
Chump change. Chump change!

500
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,120
You know what? Let's get this done, yeah?

501
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,640
- Man…
- Let's get this done, bro.

502
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,640
However, earlier today,
a player was given a test of character.

503
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,120
They were presented
with a choice to sacrifice themselves

504
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,760
or secretly mark
three fellow players for elimination.

505
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,200
Oh, no.

506
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,240
That's okay, that's okay.

507
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,080
I hope it's not you.
That would be just so annoying.

508
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,640
They chose to eliminate.

509
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,680
What? What?

510
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,600
- No!
- What?

511
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,320
<i>Player 107, eliminated.</i>

512
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,440
We might be a target.

513
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,000
I literally just told you,
for the past 20 minutes, we were a target.

514
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,840
I'm getting nervous again.

515
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
Oh, my God.

516
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,120
<i>Player 285, player 286.</i>

517
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>Eliminated.</i>

518
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,600
I thought it was gonna be me, legit.

519
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,800
I was looking down.
I was like, "Here we go."

520
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,040
I was kinda accepting it
'cause I've already experienced

521
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,680
thinking I was getting eliminated.
I was like, "I can do it again."

522
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,520
You think that's what
the twin had to do to come back?

523
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,000
It's either he goes
or eliminate three people,

524
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
and then he can come back in?

525
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,760
I think I figured it out.
431, that actually voted them three out.

526
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,000
That's how he came back.

527
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,840
He got rid of three people
to save himself.

528
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,280
Honestly, I think it might be 431.

529
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
He's just very good at his-- at acting.

530
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,040
It makes me a little suspicious
about the twins.

531
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,040
We just got here today,
and it's getting cutthroat.

532
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
But then again, only one player can win,

533
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,560
so it's game time.

534
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,600
Attention, players,
the next game is about to begin.

535
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
No.

536
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,920
Okay.

537
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,880
Please follow the staff to the game hall.

538
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh, my God.

539
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,200
Oh, it is on like <i>Donkey Kong Country 64</i>.

540
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Oh, it's just…

541
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,480
It's a white room.

542
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,000
What are we doing, guys?
I don't know what's going on.

543
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,760
I don't wanna be too close to the front.

544
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,440
What are we doing?

545
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
Something foul is afoot.

546
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
<i>Attention, players.</i>

547
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,680
<i>Please divide into groups of ten.</i>

548
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,320
<i>You have two minutes.</i>

549
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,240
What are you… What should we do?

550
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,680
- Separate.
- Okay.

551
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,520
- Good luck. Hey, good luck.
- I'm gonna separate, but I don't…

552
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,280
- Separate from your dad.
- Yeah.

553
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,080
Do you need one?
I'll take it. I'll take it.

554
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,960
Sweet. Welcome to the group.

555
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,400
Not a bad team. Not a bad team.

556
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,280
I think all our team's
gonna make it. We got it. I believe in us.

557
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,480
How many do you have?

558
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,720
- Like eight. We got another one.
- Okay, I'll come. Yeah.

559
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,880
Perla, you with us? Hi, there's five.

560
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,920
- Where's your bro?
- We're separating.

561
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,920
- Okay. Yeah?
- You're separating?

562
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
I get it. I get you.

563
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,200
But we'll… We'll see each other
in the dorm.

564
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,880
I'm here with my brother, player 283.

565
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,520
He did say, "Let's split up,"

566
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,560
because we don't know
what the game is about to be.

567
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,720
And so, I'd just rather us be
in different groups

568
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,240
and not have to face each other

569
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
than be in the same group
and face each other.

570
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,920
This feels good.
This feels good, this feels good.

571
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,960
Hands in. Listen. Fate brought
us together. We're gonna win this.

572
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,440
We're coming out of this room alive.
All right, guys? Let's go.

573
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,400
370, where'd your daughter go?

574
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,520
- Right there.
- Okay.

575
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,520
- We separated.
- Smart.

576
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,360
It's hard to divide from him.

577
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
- But I think it's the right thing.
- I know. Yeah.

578
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,200
Repeat after me. I deserve to be here.

579
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,640
I deserve to be here.

580
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,160
Everything I've done in my life
has led me to be here.

581
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,800
Everything I've done in my life
has led me to be here.

582
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,200
Let's get it.

583
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Let's go!

584
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,080
We are winning.

585
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,360
- We're winning. We're winning.
- Yes.

586
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,600
Mindset is everything, guys.
We already won.

587
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,880
This is a good group.

588
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,720
It's a good frickin' group.

589
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,480
I definitely would describe myself
as spoiled,

590
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,840
and a lot of people
look at that so negatively.

591
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,280
And me and my brother were spoiled rotten,

592
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,920
and we're really good people.

593
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,720
Just because you get a little bit spoiled
doesn't mean you're gonna be rotten.

594
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Sometimes the person's just rotten.

595
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,640
Ultimately, I know

596
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,880
I would always get what I want
most of the time.

597
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,840
It-- Honestly, it was my dad
that would say no sometimes,

598
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,440
but Mom always tried to get me everything.

599
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,960
So, yeah, I would say
I get everything I want.

600
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,000
Even now. Still.

601
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,800
I have very good gut feelings
all the time,

602
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
and I knew we were gonna win X,
and we're gonna win.

603
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,680
<i>Attention, players.</i>

604
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,280
<i>Will the first group follow the staff</i>
<i>into the game hall?</i>

605
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,240
Oh, my gosh.

606
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,000
- This looks insane.
- Yeah, I knew it.

607
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,480
Dude, this is sick.

608
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,000
- Oh, my…
- No way.

609
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,480
- What?
- Oh, my gosh.

610
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,560
- You gotta be joking.
- Totally not what we were expecting.

611
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,520
<i>Attention, players.</i>

612
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,680
<i>The game you will be playing</i>
<i>is a Six-Legged Pentathlon.</i>

613
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,280
<i>Your group will be divided into two teams.</i>

614
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,440
This is crazy, man.

615
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,240
How are we-- How are we dividing, guys?

616
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,360
I don't know.

617
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,600
- It's gonna be up to them.
- No.

618
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,200
- Oh, no, man.
- No way. No way!

619
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,880
Oh, this is…

620
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,920
Okay. Come on.

621
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,040
The guard slices us down the middle,

622
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,960
but I am a firm believer,

623
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,360
if you're always comfortable,
you'll never grow.

624
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,640
So discomfort is so important,

625
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,040
and I'm ready to grow.

626
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,240
<i>The first team to finish will survive.</i>

627
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,480
<i>The other will be…</i>

628
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,040
<i>…eliminated.</i>

629
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,080
<i>Each team will have</i>
<i>their legs tied together.</i>

630
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,800
<i>Each player will play a mini-game.</i>

631
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,800
<i>The first game is Ball in a Cup.</i>

632
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,040
- What have you got? The cup?
- Uh, I can do the cup.

633
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,080
<i>The second game is Flying Stone.</i>

634
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,400
Yeah, I'mma just toss it
underhand sideways.

635
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,360
The most confident you are,
just do it that way.

636
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,080
<i>The third game is Gong-gi.</i>

637
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,640
So you throw one up, pick up one--

638
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,560
If you know the secret,
you're gonna do it.

639
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,320
This is not cool.
This is not cool. This is not cool.

640
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,160
Just gotta be better than them.
That's all.

641
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,280
Just believe in yourself.

642
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,240
<i>The fourth game is House of Cards.</i>

643
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,120
Cards is gonna be one
of the difficult ones.

644
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,160
Who can do the tower?

645
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,360
I mean, I did that as, like… I've done it.

646
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,160
If you have the wisdom, you're good.

647
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,880
- Cards, you've done it before?
- Yep.

648
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,360
- Confident?
- Yeah.

649
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,640
<i>The fifth game is Jegi.</i>

650
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,280
I can do the kicks.
It's three kicks, right?

651
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,240
Just lean forward.

652
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,400
Trust. I played soccer since I was…
I couldn't even tell you. In high school.

653
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,360
<i>Attention, players.</i>
<i>Please take your place on the start line.</i>

654
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,920
Remember, this is $5 million.
We locked in, all right?

655
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,960
Do not look at them.
Do not look at them. Just go.

656
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,280
Just lock in.

657
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,160
I am so confident.
They are so nervous over there.

658
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,680
They're so quiet.

659
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,120
We are ready.
We are pumped and ready to win this game.

660
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Hold it, hold it.

661
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,520
- I can't wait to hug y'all after this.
- I know.

662
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,360
- Let's-- Let's pop that group.
- I know.

663
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,360
Let's go, baby. I can't wait.

664
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,880
<i>The team</i>
<i>to finish first will pass this game.</i>

665
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,920
<i>The losers will be eliminated.</i>

666
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,960
<i>Remember, every second counts.</i>

667
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,320
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

668
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,400
Forward!

669
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,680
One, two. One, two.

670
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,280
- Go, go, go.
- Jump.

671
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,800
- Slo-- Guys! Slow-- Look.
- What do you wanna say?

672
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,640
Way too big of steps, guys. Small steps.

673
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,280
Jump. Jump. Jump.

674
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,520
- One, two.
- You guys are taking too big of steps.

675
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,000
- One, two.
- Guys, guys.

676
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,840
- Come on. Two.
- Guys. Wait, guys.

677
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,360
- We need to just slow it down.
- Let's think for a second.

678
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,080
- This foot needs to come up.
- This needs to come. Let's reset.

679
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,040
- Jump. Stop.
- Go for it.

680
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
- You got this.
- You're okay. Take your time.

681
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,840
- Take your time.
- Give her space. Take your time.

682
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,600
You're good. You're close.

683
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,960
You're so close. Yeah.

684
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,920
One, two. One, two.

685
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,400
Let's go. Come on.

686
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,640
You've got it.

687
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,040
We got it. We got it.

688
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,600
Let's go. You got this.

689
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,480
- Good try, good try. You got it.
- Take your time.

690
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,840
You're good. You're right there.
You're hitting the rim.

691
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,240
It's a hard game. You're good.

692
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,680
- Nice!
- All right.

693
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,240
Three, two, one, and jump.

694
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,720
Jump. Jump. Jump.

695
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,840
You got it.

696
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,360
- Jump. Jump.
- Good try. You good.

697
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,680
Just keep your eye on the ball.

699
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,520
Oh.

700
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,360
Jump. Jump. Jump.

701
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,520
- Nice.
- Nice.

702
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,440
- Ready? Three, two, one.
- Yes.

703
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,760
One, two. One…

704
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,320
You got this, man.
Take it easy. Take your time.

705
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,600
- Ooh!
- On three, two, one.

706
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,520
And jump.

707
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
One, two. One, two.

708
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,080
What a relief. On to the toss.

709
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,880
I do not care what happens
with the other team.

710
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,640
All I know is we need to beat them.

711
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,320
- Jump.
- Let's get it here.

712
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,480
Can you reach it?

713
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,040
- All right. Let's go.
- Ready?

714
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,480
Everybody turn around.

715
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,280
We got this. Come on, Harry.
Come on, Harry. Come on, baby.

716
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,280
- Yeah!
- Yes!

717
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,120
- Ready?
- One, two.

718
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,920
One, two. One, two.

719
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
- Jump. Jump.
- Okay.

720
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,720
Okay, take your time, man. You got close.

721
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,480
Ah!

722
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,920
- It's okay.
- Three, two, one, and jump.

723
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,720
One, two. One, two.

724
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,000
- All right. You need closer? You good?
- Yeah, n-- I--

725
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,040
- Can we all bend down?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

726
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,680
Jump. Jump.

727
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,240
- Okay. Ready?
- A little bit lighter, maybe.

728
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,160
- It's okay.
- Three, two.

729
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,960
I believe in you, okay? Come on.

730
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,560
I have my mom in my head,
just saying, "Syd, you got this, girl."

731
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,240
"You got this."

732
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm gonna make you proud, Mama, I swear.

733
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,160
Small steps.

734
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,680
Okay, and backwards.

735
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,640
Three, two, one, and jump.

736
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
Sorry. Start again, start again.

737
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,880
Nice and slow, backwards.
You can do this. We can do this.

738
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,320
- You gotta throw higher.
- Okay, thank you.

739
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,600
- Guys, please give advice if you see…
- Gotta throw higher. Gotta throw higher.

740
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,640
I'm in a panic.

741
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,840
I am in a full, full panic right now.

742
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,960
Back, right. Right, left.

743
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,880
Right, left. Right, left.

744
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,120
- Shit!
- Good try, good try, good try.

745
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,080
- Nice and calm, nice and calm. Lift.
- Lift, back.

746
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,600
I have to get my team past.
I'm not gonna be the one

747
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,720
that gets these guys out.

748
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,960
These guys aren't gonna go home
because of me. Like, I'm gonna get it.

749
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,240
This is happening.
We're gonna get through.

750
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,760
Yes!

751
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,920
- Three, two, one, and jump.
- Big jumps, big jumps.

752
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,520
Okay, remember, just go straight up.

753
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,160
- You're good, you're good.
- Jump. Jump. Jump.

754
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,800
I've practiced this. I know how to do it.

755
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,480
But when you've got the lives
of four people in your hands,

756
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,080
the pressure is insane.

757
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,480
That's nice.

758
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,120
- Take your time.
- Slow down.

759
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,960
- There you go.
- Let him lock in.

760
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,280
Yeah! Nice.

761
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,280
Good try, good try. That's a good try.

762
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,240
Jacob is nailing this.

763
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,480
He's getting them catch
after catch after catch.

764
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,400
He has got this.

765
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,680
- Nice, okay.
- Okay, this as well.

766
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,200
- Yeah!
- Nice. Okay, ready?

767
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,040
- Let's see. Count of three.
- Three, two, one, and jump.

768
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,240
Yes! Yes, come on, Syd.

769
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,360
- Yes!
- Come on.

770
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,000
Right, everyone, be quiet.

771
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,960
Calm down.

772
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
She's got it, she's got it, she's got it.

773
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,120
Make the base a little wider.
That's good, that's perfect.

774
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Yes! Come on, Syd.

775
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,160
Good try, good try. You're good.

776
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,640
Been a minute since you played
with cards, huh? You're fine.

777
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,560
Good job. Good job.

778
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,520
That's it.
Now, just-- just-- just carefully.

779
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,040
Just take your time, breathe.

780
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,920
We got time. We got time, girlfriend.

781
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You're doing great.

782
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,680
Yes, Syd.

783
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,160
- Yes!
- Come on, Syd. Come on.

784
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,960
Really gentle. Really gentle, okay?

785
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,560
- Oof. You're good. Set it back up.
- That's okay.

786
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,600
Syd, you-- you got this. It's okay.

787
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,000
You got this. This is your game.

788
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,560
Gently, really gently.
And then we're back.

789
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,240
- Yep. Go ahead.
- Perfect.

790
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,320
Do you wanna wipe your fingers?

791
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,000
My fingers are fine.

792
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,840
That's good.

793
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,640
They're struggling. You got it.

794
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,320
- My God.
- You got it, Syd.

795
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,880
Place it on your hand,
the back of your hand. Catch it.

796
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,840
I know I have to do it,

797
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,800
and I will do it for my team,

798
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,160
for myself, for my mom!

799
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
- Yes!
- Yes! Syd, let's go!

800
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,440
Good stuff.

801
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,080
…two. One, two.

802
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,600
Everyone, quiet.

803
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,360
Appreciate it. You kept calm.

804
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,720
- Ooh. Ah!
- Pick 'em up. Don't-- Listen.

805
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,080
There's $4.5 million on the line.

806
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,360
If she can't build this house of cards,
it-- it-- it's over for us.

807
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,240
Everything I worked so hard for,

808
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,920
everything-- everything that brought me
to this point is done.

809
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,560
No, a bit further apart.

810
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,960
Just-- Just-- Just wait.
You're shaking. You're shaking.

811
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,040
Just calm down, okay?
You're-- You're fine.

812
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,640
Okay, you're thinking about it too much.
Your body's reacting to your head.

813
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,040
Just relax, okay?

814
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,320
Get the cards away from you
so you don't pull it near…

815
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,160
What?

816
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,440
- Yes!
- Go, go, go!

817
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Three, two, one, and jump!

818
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,040
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

819
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,640
Jump! Jump!

820
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,560
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

821
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,960
Three, just three.

822
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,920
Be careful, man.

823
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,480
You got this, you got this.

824
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,040
Yes!

825
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,120
- Three, two, one!
- Jump to the finish line!

826
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,520
- Run, run, run.
- Jump!

827
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,680
$4.56 million!

828
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,360
And they lost 'cause of me.

829
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,400
Jump. Jump.

830
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,600
Yeah!

831
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,920
Sorry, guys.

832
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,240
- No, no, no, no.
- You're okay, Syd. Hey.

833
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,200
You did amazing.

834
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,600
- I'm sorry.
- Yes!

835
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,880
Guys, I'm sorry.

836
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,400
This moment will haunt me forever.

837
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,680
<i>Player 016, player 182,</i>

838
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,040
<i>player 220, player 235,</i>

839
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,520
<i>player 163, eliminated.</i>

840
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,520
- Oh, my gosh! Great job.
- Great job!

841
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,880
- My gosh.
- My God.

842
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,320
Get us unshackled, ASAP.

843
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,640
- I've lost my shoe.
- Oh, my God.

844
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,200
Yes!

845
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,480
First one! First one!

846
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,480
Come on! First one, man!

847
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,800
- We did it!
- Oh, my God!

848
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,400
We're the only ones here.

849
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,320
- We're the only ones here, man.
- Dude, my God, that was intense.

850
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,680
<i>We locked in!</i>

851
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,400
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

852
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,800
Let's go.

853
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,040
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

854
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,640
One step, two…

855
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,560
Step, step.

856
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,600
A, B.

857
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,040
This is insane.

858
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,480
These are kids' games,

859
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,920
but they're impossible
when everyone is relying on you.

860
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,920
You're almost there.

861
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,960
It is pressure. So much pressure.

862
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,960
Take one deep breath in and hold it.

863
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,920
I just have to breathe
and get through this moment.

864
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,960
Yeah!

865
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,120
- Yes!
- Yes!

866
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,880
- Yes!
- Yes.

867
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,440
- Yes!
- Let's go!

868
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,840
- Ready, go!
- One.

869
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,360
The tension is next-level.

870
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,280
These games are wild.

871
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,560
Almost.

872
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,000
- You gotta be kidding me!
- Here we go.

873
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,400
My life in this game
revolves around player 089,

874
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,600
and he keeps missing.

875
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,800
It's okay, it's okay.

876
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,040
We cannot mess up this early.
We have to stay in the race.

877
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,280
Bah!

878
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,920
You got it.

879
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,240
- Whoo!
- Yes.

880
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,840
Yes!

881
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,240
- Yes!
- One…

882
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,880
Let's go. Three, two, one…

883
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,320
Yes. Yes!

884
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,440
One, two.

885
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,680
Yes! Even though he was
struggling, it got done.

886
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,880
Stop looking at them.

887
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,320
We are catching up.

888
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,640
- Attaboy.
- One…

889
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,040
My heart has never pounded so hard.
Then Gong-gi comes.

890
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,440
You got this, Mike.

891
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,040
We all know it's the hardest game.

892
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,400
In the back of my mind,
"Thank God it's not me."

893
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,440
- Dude, it's hard. I know, it's so…
- I-- I-- Shh!

894
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,360
You got it.

895
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,880
One, two. One…

896
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,000
- Yeah!
- One, two.

897
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,200
Oh, my God, they won.

898
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,200
One, two. One…

899
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,200
Oh, my God.

900
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,160
There's $4.56 million on the line.

901
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,080
Yes!

902
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Don't worry about them.

903
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,960
Yes!

904
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,440
Yes! Good job.

905
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,560
One…

906
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,440
I'm losing my mind. I'm terrified
my whole team is gonna go home.

907
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,880
And we still have to get
through House of Cards.

908
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,480
- One.
- Knee down.

909
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,080
One, down.

910
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,000
Okay.

911
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,760
I know the game so well.
This is hard. This is really hard.

912
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,600
This game is not getting done with speed
so it has to be done with patience.

913
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,520
So I have to, like, breathe,
and I have to have trust.

914
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,440
Good, good.

915
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,440
Let's win this.

916
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,440
One, two, three.

917
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,760
Let's go! Whoo!

918
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,880
We have just taken the lead,

919
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,600
which seemed impossible earlier,

920
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,120
and now we have the real chance.

921
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,080
I should've let you know
that I-- I shake a lot.

922
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,280
I'm nervous, okay?

923
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,320
This game is tense. It's overwhelming.

924
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,600
This is rough. It's not looking good.

925
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,200
I know there's nothing I can do
to win it for us.

926
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,480
Guys, I sh-- I-- This is on me.

927
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,000
- One, two. One, two.
- Let's go! Let's go!

928
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,040
One simple decision lost the game,

929
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,160
and it was me choosing House of Cards.

930
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,280
I'm so sorry, you guys.

931
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,600
- No.
- It's fine. It's fine.

932
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,720
- I'm so sorry.
- Okay, it's all right.

933
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,520
Whoo!

934
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,840
…B, A, B…

935
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,720
It's game time for me. I hope
I can do this. I hope I can do this.

936
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,040
Come on, soccer. Come on, soccer.

937
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,000
Come on, you got this.

938
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,120
You got this.

939
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,360
- Yes!
- Yes!

940
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,040
- Yes!
- Hey! Hey, we gotta go.

941
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,840
A, B, A, B, A, B…

942
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,560
- Two, three…
- Yes!

943
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,080
Yes!

944
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,480
We have got to win this.

945
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,240
I just wanna get back in the dorm
and see if my brother Jeffrey's there.

946
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,120
…two. One…

947
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,920
We did it! We just won Pentathlon.

948
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,320
Oh, my God! I'm here. We're here.

949
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,160
<i>You did it.</i>

950
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,640
- <i>You all did it!</i>
- <i>We all did amazing.</i>

951
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,920
Wait, wait, wait.

952
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,280
Oh, Mike's here.

953
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,320
Yes!

954
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,200
Oh, they made it! They made it.

955
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,200
All the groups are coming back
into the room,

956
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,720
and it's just super exciting,

957
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
but I am freaking out
because Zoe's not back.

958
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,200
It's like being at Disneyland,
and you lose track of your kid.

959
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,160
I'm getting more anxious.

960
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,200
Hey. I'm… First off, I'm Mark.

961
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,080
- Hi, I'm Curt.
- I know you're stressing out right now.

962
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,400
Yeah, my daughter. Yeah.

963
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,560
Is she… Has her group appeared yet?

964
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,840
- No.
- I believe she's gonna come.

965
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,720
- Thank you. Thank you, bud.
- Um…

966
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,040
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

967
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,200
Zoe is my competitive one.

968
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,720
She's a, um…

969
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,800
She's a Denver Bronco cheerleader
for the NFL.

970
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,080
She's extremely driven.

971
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,480
I would say my dad
is more of a risk-taker than me.

972
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,040
I think, for him, he thinks,

973
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,160
"High-- High risk, high reward."

974
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,920
But he is the most lovable,
kind, genuine person,

975
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,240
and there's just something so special

976
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,480
about a father-daughter relationship.

977
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,800
He's-- He's just the best.

978
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,840
The other kids will always say,
oh, Zoe's my favorite.

979
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,600
I don't have a favorite.

980
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,600
Zoe and I just happen to be
a little on the adventurous side.

981
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,880
Um, for example, we went…

982
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,880
Four years ago, we went
to base camp at Mount Everest.

983
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,080
So Zoe and I will do crazy things.

984
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,920
It's exciting to see them grow and to…

985
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,080
And to see how well they're--
they're maturing up and growing up.

986
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,280
And-- And we call it "adulting."
And they're adulting up.

987
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,280
Do you see your daughter?

988
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,720
Uh, she hasn't come yet. Yet.

989
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,040
So, why'd you name your daughter Zoe?

990
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,920
That's a really Greek name.
I have a lot of family members named--

991
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,160
Because, um, my wife and I had,
um, a son that was born.

992
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,080
Our first son, Colin.

993
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,400
Um, and unfortunately,
he was born with, um… with a defect.

994
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,680
So when he was born, he couldn't breathe,
and, um, he turned blue.

995
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
- I'm so sorry.
- And then there's no crying.

996
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,640
So,

997
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,720
we buried Colin.

998
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,240
So we had Zoe,

999
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,560
and we named her Zoe
because it means "life."

1000
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,200
- "Life."
- And Zoe is very… very…

1001
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,480
She's the-- She's my kid
that will do crazy things. And…

1002
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,840
- There you are.
- Here we are.

1003
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,960
- I'm so happy you're in here.
- Oh, thank--

1004
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
And I can't wait to see
that your daughter comes out.

1005
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,840
I'll be devastated if she doesn't make it.

1006
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,760
I know. Like, I can't imagine.

1007
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,600
Oh, it looks like
maybe someone's coming in.

1008
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,720
- Oh, let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go see, let's go see.

1009
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,680
Ah, shit.

1010
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,400
Oh, this is it.

1011
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,240
- Is this her?
- This is it, buddy.

1012
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,960
They're gonna show us your Zoe.

1013
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,280
Just breathe. Stay calm.

1014
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,360
Guys, we got this.
Teamwork makes the dream work, eh?

1015
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,920
Yeah, that's for sure.

1016
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,600
Is that her? Is that her?

1017
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,720
I'm feeling helpless.

1018
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,520
It's my baby girl, and I'm going to cry.

1019
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,360
She's right there. Right there.

1020
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,600
Come on, Curt. Come on, Curt.
I'm praying for your daughter, brother.

1021
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,720
I can't control the situation.

1022
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,880
I don't want to see her go home

1023
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,880
on a big screen in front of everybody.

1024
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,800
Listen, all we can do is do our best.
Be you and don't think too much.

1025
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,600
Everybody, stay calm.
