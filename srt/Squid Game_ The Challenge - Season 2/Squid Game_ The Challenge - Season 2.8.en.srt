1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,360
As I'm standing
across from player 183, I'm nervous.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,280
Am I blindly trusting
what everyone's saying,

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,520
or am I really about to take him down?

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
<i>The next player to be eliminated is…</i>

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,240
<i>player 409.</i>

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Did anybody actually think it was me?

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,320
Did anybody believe her?

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,000
I just took this person out

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,600
that is… …a sweet, kind person.

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,960
I didn't think player 409
would consider me a threat.

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
I just wanted to make it
to the next round,

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,560
so I chose the player
I thought would least suspect me.

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,360
I just-- Now I feel guilty
for placing it there,

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,680
but I would've felt guilty
placing it on anybody's desk.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,120
<i>Players, put on your blindfolds.</i>

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm thinking
of giving the box to player 361

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,840
simply because she seemed nervous
in previous rounds,

18
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,360
and I also just don't think
that she's gonna be the best interrogator.

19
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,680
We were on good terms,

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,040
but I gotta look out for myself
at this point in the game.

21
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,360
<i>Players, please remove your blindfolds.</i>

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm just sad.

23
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,560
It just sucks.

24
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,080
I have played a fair and just game.

25
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
I have been genuine.

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm feeling very stressed,

27
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,240
and it's hard for me to gauge
who has done this to me.

28
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,280
All right, y'all.

29
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,080
Any…

30
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,880
I can't do that to you.

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,000
You know I wouldn't do that to you, Faith.

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
It wasn't me, Faith.

33
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
I wouldn't do that.

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,240
Hey, guys, this is hard.

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
This is a hard game.

36
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
- You swear you wouldn't do me like that?
- I wouldn't do that to you.

37
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,080
I'm a cop,
and something is off about player 183.

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,880
He's very serious.
There's not a single smile on his face.

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
That's a stressed man right there.

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
That's a man that's stressed.

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,200
That's a man that just did something
that maybe he didn't wanna do

42
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,480
or maybe he knows
he shouldn't have done, but…

43
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
I clock him. I clock him immediately.

44
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
You're friends, who y'all think it was?

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
Look at how everybody's been acting.
Who's acting different now?

46
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

47
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Steven?

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,880
I think it's 50-50.

49
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
50-50 between who?

50
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,720
AJ and Vanessa.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,080
Vanessa, I don't wanna think
you'd do me like that.

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,760
Karma's real.

53
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,360
- Karma is real. I'm telling you--
- Do you believe in karma?

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,560
- I do, and it wasn't me.
- You believe in karma.

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,440
- It wasn't me.
- Okay.

56
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,280
It wasn't me, Faith.

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,480
If I'm being honest, earlier today,

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,480
I woke up with a gut feeling.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
Player 412,

60
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,520
I think that you might be playing
more strategically than we're aware of.

61
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,640
What do y'all think?

62
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,000
I think-- I think
you should follow your gut.

63
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Yeah, me too.

64
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,240
All right, I gotta stick with it.
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
- That's okay.
- Player 412.

66
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,400
- I don't think that's-- No, no.
- Wait. No.

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,160
- That's your decision.
- No, no, no. You don't get to do that.

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,640
And then say that.
Who do you think it was?

69
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,480
I do not trust player 183,

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,480
and 361 is my best friend here.

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,440
But if I'm wrong,

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,400
that player's still in the game,
and then I'll be targeted next.

73
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
Faith, go with your gut.
You've been right about-- I don't know.

74
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,800
It's very hard
to read people in a situation

75
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,800
where everything
is so high anxiety and high tension.

76
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,200
All I can do is hope and pray,

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,480
but I feel terrified in this moment.

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,280
I think the player that gave me
the gift box is player 412.

79
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,680
I didn't wanna have to do this,

80
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,680
but you kinda have to turn
your backs on everyone

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
and look out for yourself in <i>Squid Game.</i>

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,440
- I'm sorry if not.
- It's okay. It's okay.

83
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,480
<i>The next player to be eliminated is…</i>

84
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,320
I said I didn't think it was her, man.

85
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,320
<i>…player 361.</i>

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,480
I wish I would've fought,
fought, fought, fought harder.

87
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,880
It's just something about player 183.
He's just not sitting right.

88
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,520
He took out my girl, he's next.
He's next now.

89
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,120
<i>Players, please put on your blindfolds.</i>

90
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,280
<i>Players, please remove your blindfolds.</i>

91
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,680
Either somebody sees me as a threat

92
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,280
or somebody sees me
as somebody who's untrustworthy.

93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
You got this.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,200
But I need to figure this out fast.

95
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,840
I have to be able to put up
the biggest fight for my life.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,960
As messed up as this may be,

97
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,560
and to take a page out of Kate's book,

98
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,040
I want the person
who chose me to feel bad.

99
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
I feel like I could bring

100
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,840
at least some emotion out of somebody,

101
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,000
to where I could actually say,
"You did it."

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,920
I'll just tell y'all a story. Um…

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,800
A story about the saddest
and most happiest day of my life.

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,440
Uh, it was when I found out
I was gonna be a dad, actually.

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,000
And the first person
I wanted to tell was my grandmother.

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,880
She raised me with my mother.

107
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,040
I didn't have my dad in my life
so I was always alone.

108
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,640
She always picked me up from school.

109
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,360
And I broke the news to her,
and she was so excited.

110
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,720
She was happy, ecstatic.

111
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,040
So I go back home.

112
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,680
Next thing you know, five o'clock
in the morning, she passed away.

113
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
She never got to meet my daughters.

114
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,760
So with that being said, tell you
what I'd do with the money if I did win.

115
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,560
Was gonna get
a life insurance policy for my daughters.

116
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,880
I just want my daughters
to be safe and to be okay.

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,040
That's a good dad.

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,320
Yeah, that's what we all want,
don't we, as parents?

119
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,440
So it just baffles me when someone decided
to put this down on me.

120
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,920
- I know it's not these two for a fact.
- Nah.

121
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Trinity, I don't think
you would pull that stunt on me.

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,440
Trinity would be good at poker.

123
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
He'd be really good. It's hard to tell.

124
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,800
- 183.
- Sorry about your story, man.

125
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,400
- It's okay.
- Wasn't me.

126
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,520
I understand.

127
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,640
- But you have the most experience in this.
- I do.

128
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,680
The best poker face
that I could possibly imagine.

129
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,400
This is my poker face.

130
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,080
Yeah, this is your profession.

131
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,560
- And we haven't really talked either, so…
- Just recently.

132
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,760
Just recently. You seem very comfortable.

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,800
- But it wasn't me.
- Wasn't you?

134
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
- It wasn't me.
- Okay.

135
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't be like the other girl
who picked me, and get shot. It wasn't me.

136
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,800
Immediately, I'm thinking Steven.

137
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,080
Because I'm probably
his biggest competition

138
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
in the game right now, but it's weird.

139
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
From someone
who is the best possible poker face,

140
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,440
for some reason,
I'm not feeling it from him.

141
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,080
Either he's really good at what he does,

142
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,520
or something is incredibly off here.

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
412, do you…

144
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,480
Any reason why
you would put this box on my desk?

145
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,640
I have no reason
to put that box on your desk.

146
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,280
If you had, what would you come up with?

147
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
I would say you're the biggest threat.

148
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,320
Biggest threat. 327?

149
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,240
Yeah.

150
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,240
If you was to put this box on my desk,
what would have been the reason?

151
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,640
Her reason.

152
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Is it because I'm another parent,
and I will fight just as hard as you?

153
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,840
Maybe.

154
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,840
- Maybe?
- I feel like Kate seems really confident.

155
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,040
What was your first gut telling you?

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,160
- My gut?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,160
327, and 017.

158
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
It's between you two, for a fact.

159
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,120
I'm looking at 327,

160
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,440
and there's a slight change
in her face when I pick 017.

161
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,560
I don't know if I'm reading this wrong,
but it looks like that's a sigh of relief.

162
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,760
327?

163
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,560
Would you take my daughter's dream away,
or would you rather face me in the end,

164
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,520
and make it an honest game
of-- of parents?

165
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,680
Would you do me dirty
right here, right now?

166
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,440
I would do what it takes
to look after my son.

167
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,520
Okay.

168
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,840
I think the player who put
the box on my desk is player 327.

169
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,280
All I could do is pray to God,

170
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,200
pray to my grandma,

171
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,720
and I hope that it is 327,

172
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,000
because I don't wanna go home yet.

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm too close.

174
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,200
<i>The next player to be eliminated is…</i>

175
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,400
<i>player 318.</i>

176
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,040
The Circle of Trust, it's a heartbreaker,

177
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,240
and nobody wants to be
the one breaking the hearts.

178
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,520
And so, the only way
to get through it is choose wisely.

179
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
When player 318 asked me why I chose him,

180
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,560
I responded to him in honesty, saying,

181
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
"Because you're the biggest threat."

182
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,360
But not anymore.

183
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,120
<i>Players, please remove your blindfolds.</i>

184
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Oh, thank God.

185
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,560
I've already been forced
to eliminate two people.

186
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,960
Why am I in this situation?

187
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,920
Wasn't me.

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,920
I have my core group of people
that I should feel safe with,

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,760
but there's questions there.

190
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,800
Would you eliminate me?

191
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,160
A couple of seconds ago,
you said it was between Vanessa and I too.

192
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,440
That's 'cause I did think that.

193
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,360
- Trinity?
- No.

194
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,360
- No?
- Mm-mmm.

195
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,960
Who would you have picked?

196
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,800
You wouldn't know. I'm not answering that.

197
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
- Exactly.
- Mmm.

198
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
It would be a strategic move for you
to take me out too.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,320
- I mean, why not?
- How so?

200
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
- How so?
- I mean, why not?

201
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,080
'Cause you would think
I wouldn't expect you.

202
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,320
I wouldn't do that to you.

203
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,640
I think it's definitely that side.
That's what my gut is saying.

204
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,200
How about you?

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,160
- No.
- Hmm.

206
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,080
It's not me, babes.

207
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,360
You're wasting your time right here
if you wanna stay in this race.

208
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I think it's over there. I really do.

209
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,760
I keep coming back to you, Trinity.

210
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,320
I mean, I don't know
who else you would pick here.

211
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,160
I can't-- I feel like I really can't read
anybody in the room right now.

212
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,320
It's between player 398 and 183.

213
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm not positive, but it's just a feeling.

214
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
I think the player that gave me

215
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,520
the gift box

216
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,560
was player 398.

217
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,360
I just have a feeling.

218
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,240
<i>The next player to be eliminated is…</i>

219
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,000
<i>player 412.</i>

220
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,240
At this point,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

221
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,000
There can only be one winner.

222
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,560
So, I've got no regrets.

223
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,120
So wrong.

224
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,360
<i>Players, the game is now over.</i>

225
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,840
What?

226
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,840
- What?
- Oh, my God.

227
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,440
Lord.

228
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,320
- Oh, my God.
- Ov-- Over?

229
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,120
Kate, you thought it was somebody
on this side? I heard y'all say that.

230
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,040
- Never once did I accuse anybody.
- Huh?

231
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,400
She was trying to help her friend.
Don't take it personal.

232
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,080
I'm not. I'm just asking a question.

233
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,480
I thought it was that side
'cause they had alliances.

234
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,560
- We were all trying to help.
- I didn't put a box on a single desk.

235
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
- Me either. At all.
- Really?

236
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,760
- Me neither.
- Like, a single person's desk.

237
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,360
Wow, I did one.

238
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,880
I know. I know which one you--
Did you do Faith?

239
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,440
- Yeah, I knew it!
- I knew it.

240
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,600
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

241
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,600
I do feel really bad about that.

242
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,080
I was feeling guilty about that one,
so I just admitted it

243
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
'cause I wasn't gonna lie blatantly
like that.

244
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
Now 412, I wasn't gonna admit that one

245
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,720
because nobody else said
they eliminated anybody

246
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,920
or had to do anything.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,760
So why should I admit all of the truths?

248
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,680
I wanted to tell her so bad,
but I didn't wanna be wrong.

249
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
Same.

250
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,160
I saw you because you're happy, smiley,
and then all of a sudden you serious.

251
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,920
Player 183 has just admitted
he put a box on 361's desk.

252
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,880
That's not smart to let me know that.

253
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,800
I don't-- I don't know
why you let me know that.

254
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,520
Yeah, that was stupid. That was stupid.

255
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,040
'Cause now you gotta go.

256
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,240
- What the heck?
- Wow.

257
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,440
Oh, my God.

258
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,320
It is empty in here because of people.

259
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,720
This is weird. This is so weird.

260
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,600
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, here we go.

261
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,120
- Yeah.
- Wow.

262
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Whoa. Single digits.

263
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,600
- Single digits is crazy.
- Wow.

264
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,840
I'm feeling great. I'm in the top six.

265
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,160
From 456 to only six.

266
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,720
That being said, I gotta be ready
for anything and everything.

267
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Relaxing in this game
is not an option at all.

268
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
At all.

269
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
- Goddamn. Goddamn.
- Y'all, we got a one-in-six chance.

270
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,920
That's kinda crazy.

271
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,120
There it is.

272
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,240
Let's keep this thing going.

273
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,800
Somehow I'm here, but I'm getting worried.

274
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,080
After Circle of Trust,
everyone probably thinks I'm a threat,

275
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,000
especially player 302.

276
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
I know she's never liked me.

277
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
Her energy towards me has always been off.

278
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
I'm just gonna keep being true to myself.

279
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,160
Um, so we'll just see how that plays out.

280
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,920
What'd you guys think of Circle of Trust?
Were you like, "Damn, this sucks?"

281
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,680
- Of course, it sucked.
- It did, yeah.

282
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Do you think you would've
been a great interrogator?

283
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
I think so.
Did you put it on, um, AJ's box?

284
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,600
I didn't put it on anyone else.

285
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,240
Who do you think put it on AJ?
She was the last to get eliminated.

286
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,760
- AJ? I mean, did you do it?
- I didn't go a single time.

287
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,240
Everybody-- Everybody says
they didn't do--

288
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,040
Who do you think then?
That's what I asked.

289
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
- I couldn't tell on that one.
- You don't know?

290
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,120
Yeah, I was helping her. I couldn't tell.

291
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,480
Who did-- Who did you put?

292
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,480
Who'd I put what?

293
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,640
- I don't believe you.
- Who'd I put what?

294
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,680
You put-- I think you put
a box on someone's desk.

295
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,800
- Okay, well, let's find out then.
- Okay, we will. All right.

296
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm just calmly just staring at him.

297
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,920
And he is uncomfortable.

298
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,280
Only a guilty man's
gonna be uncomfortable.

299
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,520
- Why you looking at me so hard?
- We're having a conversation.

300
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,320
You've never looked me in the eyes.

301
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,120
I've always looked you in the eyes.

302
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,680
Now it's all about mind games.
I'm in my element now.

303
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,160
I can actually come out of my shell
and be my true self.

304
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
I don't mind making people uncomfortable,
I don't mind making people nervous.

305
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,560
I don't mind letting people know
that I don't trust it.

306
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,760
Thanks, Steven.
I make you uncomfortable or something?

307
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,520
Yeah, this whole time,
you've been kinda coming at me with this.

308
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,920
- I just don't appreciate that energy.
- Just staring at you?

309
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,840
No, no, with this.
When you've done that to me,

310
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,840
and I think it's just,
like, really disrespectful.

311
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,320
I just think that you keep coming,

312
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
and like, every time
somebody says something,

313
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,440
you're trying to remind people,
"Oh, it's just a game."

314
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,960
Don't cut me off.
Don't dismiss me. I don't like that.

315
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,920
I try to forget a lot of my childhood,
but I mean, it's a part of me.

316
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,320
My mother did the best she could,
but I mean,

317
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,840
we did what we had to do back then.

318
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,280
There was time, many times,
we were homeless.

319
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
Even so, my mother made sure she knew

320
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,120
that I knew that I was loved,

321
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,720
and, uh, she did--
she did the best she could and she…

322
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,760
Even when I didn't believe in myself,
she believed in me.

323
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,640
Even when, uh, my grades weren't
the best in school,

324
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,920
she still told me I was-- I was smart.

325
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,080
She told me I was beautiful,
and eventually, I started to believe her.

326
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,320
I tried harder in school
and, um, graduated college.

327
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,640
I was a double major,
and I graduated at top 5%

328
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
of my college graduating class.

329
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,520
I obtained
my law enforcement certification

330
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,680
while full-time in college,
so I'm very capable.

331
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,280
You know, I was--
I was a detective for four years,

332
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,120
law enforcement for seven years in total.

333
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,000
I was investigator of the year before.

334
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,440
I don't know. Now, thanks to my mother,
I feel-- I feel invincible.

335
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,760
My mom told me that there's
not anything that I can't do, and--

336
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
and I believe her.

337
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,040
Dude, we gotta talk
about who we trust in this game.

338
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
We do.

339
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,400
And I tell you what,
you're the only person that I--

340
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,520
- Hmm?
- I trust definitely, like 100%.

341
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,280
So who-- who's at the top of your list
that you don't trust?

342
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,080
183.

343
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,480
I know we gotta continue
to have each other's back.

344
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,600
- Yeah.
- And…

345
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,920
Yeah, 'cause something isn't…
Something's brewing, I feel like.

346
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,880
Yeah, you can sense
that everybody's playing nice,

347
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,800
but, like, it's…

348
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,600
How do you feel about 017?

349
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,840
- I guess--
- I'm having a hard time with her.

350
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,760
I don't know.

351
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm not saying that, you know,
she's bad, she's a bad person,

352
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
but I just-- I just don't know
if I can trust her.

353
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,120
Yeah.

354
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,600
I think she's maybe playing both sides
'cause she has nobody.

355
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,760
Yeah.

356
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,080
God, please, please, God.

357
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,200
Give me the strength,

358
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,480
give me your awesome strength
to get through the rest of this game.

359
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,640
With you, I can do all.

360
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,440
I have been in many situations in my life

361
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,080
where I feel like a lot of people
just would've given up and quit.

362
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,600
I grew up in an all-fishing family,

363
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,880
uh, but when it came to wanting to do that
as a career, as a profession,

364
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,400
um, I really thought that I would be able
to initially do that with my father.

365
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,680
When I asked him if he would hire me,

366
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,920
he, you know, kind of laughed,

367
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,920
and said, "Vanessa, you're a woman."

368
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,600
Like, "No, I-- I cannot hire you."

369
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,040
And I used that moment,

370
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,920
um, as-- as motivation and drive.

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,840
I worked my God-loving ass off,

372
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,480
uh, for many, many years,
and it's beautiful how life works

373
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,280
because things finally came
full circle for me.

374
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,600
And last year,

375
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,040
my father, uh, finally asked me
to fish with him.

376
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,960
And, uh…

377
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,920
working so hard for that approval,

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,920
and then finally having it
come to fruition is-- is just…

379
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,920
It's indescribable.

380
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,920
We're gonna have to make a decision.

381
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,480
Once it's, like, down to this many people,

382
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,200
it's just kinda, like, alliances
are there, but…

383
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,080
I think she's playing
quite a good game actually.

384
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
- She's sharp. She's sharp.
- She's sharp.

385
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,920
Like, if we have to go teams,
I wanna grab her, and then it's us three.

386
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,040
- Yeah.
- You know, that would be my-- my plan.

387
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,240
- If the-- If we do have a three-on-three.
- If we get that opportunity.

388
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,480
And it's not from a place of--

389
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,680
- Yeah, it's just a game.
- …malice or bad intent.

390
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
- We're trying to win the game.
- It's a game. Our hands are forced.

391
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
I have an alliance with 327,

392
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,160
but that only means so much
when there's six people left because…

393
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,400
you gotta eliminate people.

394
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,800
I would say there's probably an alliance
with 302 and 072.

395
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,280
So I'm not really feeling
the most comfortable.

396
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,880
That being said, 327 is the only person
I feel like I can tell something to.

397
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,240
She has never turned her back on me.

398
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,120
So I feel like I can tell her anything.

399
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,760
I had tough times, like, in my own way
when I was growing up,

400
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,400
and, like, nobody thought
I was gonna be successful. So…

401
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,520
And I knew that.

402
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,320
And I was like… And I've always been
determined to be successful,

403
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,680
I've always been a hard worker.

404
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,360
And that then enabled me, uh,
an opportunity to play more poker.

405
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,880
You can make a lot of money gambling.

406
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,320
When did you play your first poker game?

407
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,440
I was in debt
'cause I was dating this girl,

408
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,200
I was just making bad decisions,
trying to make the relationship work.

409
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,200
It was toxic. I got into debt,

410
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,040
55 grand in credit card debt.

411
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,080
Wow!

412
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,440
Yeah, I went and played in one tournament,
and I won 57 grand.

413
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,280
- I was like, "Thank you, Lord."
- But see, how is that not addictive?

414
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,840
How do you not just then go,
"Yeah, it's for the next game--"

415
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, that's when it all started.
Yeah, yeah.

416
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,000
And so I paid it all, wiped it out.

417
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I was like,
"Never gonna go into debt again!"

418
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
- And I never have.
- Yeah.

419
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,560
But then two years ago,

420
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,120
I got second in the-- the championship,
the main event.

421
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,680
For 6.5 million.

422
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,320
- How much did you get?
- Six point… Oh, 6.5.

423
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,080
You-- Yeah, but how much did you take?

424
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,240
I was second place with 6.5.

425
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,360
- Six--
- But taxes and everything, I got less.

426
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,680
- Oh, my God.
- But, yeah. Yeah.

427
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,720
- So you have won…
- First place was 12 million.

428
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,320
- So you have won this amount of money.
- Yeah, I have. Yeah.

429
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,760
I'm… I'm shocked.

430
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,880
And of course my thoughts are,
"Well, why are you here?"

431
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,600
Surely, that's enough.

432
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,560
- Last two.
- Yeah. That would be great.

433
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,520
- That would be fun.
- If we do that, we can--

434
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,080
- Yeah.
- We can work out a deal.

435
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,120
I'll send you a million,
you can send me a million.

436
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
- No, you don't need it. I'm joking.
- Wow!

437
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,680
Now, I know.

438
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
"I'm coming for you!"
No, I'm just kidding.

439
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,200
- I'm gonna pee real quick.
- Okay.

440
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,480
- I'll see you. Bye!
- See you up there. Bye, Kate.

441
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,400
If he has that much money,
can I even trust him?

442
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,840
I kinda feel like it'd be nice
that one person's got my back

443
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,200
right until the end.

444
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,520
But that was the one thing
my kids said to me.

445
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
"Don't trust anyone."

446
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,520
4.56! You okay?

447
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah, I'm just praying.

448
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,840
Thinking about winning?

449
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,040
I have so-- so much
to be thankful about right now.

450
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,040
I know, look at where you're at, bro.

451
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,520
Yeah. I was just thinking about, like,

452
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,240
this is just more than just a game.
It's, like, this is a commentary on life.

453
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,880
How many people come… touch your life
for you to, like, move forward?

454
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
I've deviated from my-- from God
for a long time

455
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,040
because churches don't work for me.

456
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,600
And that's okay. I…

457
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,440
Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you a story.

458
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,880
- I got baptized four times.
- Damn.

459
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,400
Yeah, my mom was like…
She made sure it was every…

460
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,960
But-- But the thing is,
it's like, what I realized,

461
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,040
and this could be me
being young or whatever.

462
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,520
I just realized, like, it's more
about the relationship than the religion.

463
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,640
- Yeah, I know.
- You feel me?

464
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,240
He will bring
the people you need at the right time.

465
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,240
I just care for other people.
I always tell people, like,

466
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,760
I'd rather other people be okay
and I have to suffer for them,

467
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
if that makes sense.

468
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,360
Just because I know--

469
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,800
I know the pain of, like, being, like,
you know, not financially stable.

470
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,440
I know the headache of it.

471
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,120
And the world-- the way
that the world is going,

472
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,800
it's going in a place
where I-- I hate to see it.

473
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,120
You know what I mean? So if--

474
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,240
After this experiment,

475
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,600
I hope I will be able
to change the world in a trajectory

476
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,320
where it's gonna be
at least a little bit better of a place

477
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,160
where it's not as,
you know, corrupt and evil.

478
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,320
And hopefully,
I can shine a light to people.

479
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Hopefully, I can be that light for people,

480
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,120
and they can just see me
and be like, "Man,

481
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,080
I'm glad he's doing what he's doing."
You know what I'm saying?

482
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,320
Bro, I'm sorry,
but, like, I really hope one of you,

483
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,960
if it's not me, I hope it's one of you.

484
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,600
- Same, girl.
- All I'm gonna say.

485
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,280
That's what I was thinking low-key.
If it's not me, one of y'all.

486
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,600
I-- I need more Black millionaires.

487
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm tired-- That's my truth.

488
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,440
I know for my alliance right now,

489
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,720
it's just me and player 302, Dajah.

490
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,320
No matter what, like, the only time
we will go against each other

491
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,440
is when we have to.

492
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,720
And the same goes for player 398.
I want the best for him.

493
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,320
He's somebody that I feel like,
if he wins the money,

494
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,360
he would do great things with it.

495
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,360
Oh, no.

496
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,280
Let's go! Oh.

497
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,560
No way!

498
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,360
No way! It's-- It's the tuxedos!

499
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,520
- Ooh, no way!
- What is it?

500
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,880
- What is it? What is it?
- Tuxedos!

501
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,920
We're getting the-- the-- the suits!

502
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,880
No, it's not. No, it's not.
Calm down, calm down.

503
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,040
Why are you guys so excited? There's five.

504
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,880
- There's something bad.
- There's only five.

505
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,680
- There's only five of 'em.
- No freaking way.

506
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,720
But there's five boxes.

507
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,120
Attention, players.
It's time for your next game.

508
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,720
Shuffleboard.

509
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,000
Gosh.

510
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,120
Which will be played here, now.

511
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,720
Ooh.

512
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,640
Please split yourselves
into two groups of three.

513
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,520
Dang.

514
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
How do you guys wanna do that?

515
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
- I feel like I know how it's gonna go.
- Yeah.

516
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
Yeah, we already know
how it's gonna go. Let's do it.

517
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,600
I don't get along with player 302.
I mean, she's just very abrasive and…

518
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,840
It's just annoying to be around
someone that-- that's that negative.

519
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,400
Like, I just-- I don't stand for it.
You do you.

520
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,600
Go over there.
I'll be over here. Don't talk to me.

521
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,960
Pick-- Pick whoever you want.
I'm gonna be with Perla.

522
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,480
Where do you feel you'd wanna go?

523
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,400
Yeah, y'all can choose where you wanna go.

524
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,360
If you feel like you wanna be
with these girls, I understand.

525
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,800
- You don't wanna be with us?
- I do.

526
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,880
- Yeah, I'll be-- I'll be over here.
- Okay, that's what I-- Yeah.

527
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,120
Please take the puck
that corresponds to your number.

528
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,040
Ooh.

529
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,280
<i>You must slide your puck,</i>

530
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,480
<i>landing as close as possible</i>
<i>to the pink line.</i>

531
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
However, cross the line,

532
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,720
and you will be instantly eliminated.

533
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,080
Whoever lands furthest away
will be at risk of elimination.

534
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,080
Holy moly.

535
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,040
You will compete
against the players in your group.

536
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,160
Player 072, please take your shot.

537
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,760
I hate that I have to go first.

538
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,760
If I go too hard
and then I go over the line, then I'm out.

539
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,400
If I go too short, then I'm out too.

540
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,360
That is so much pressure,

541
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,120
and I'm scared right now.

542
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,360
Good luck, Perla.

543
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,320
- Pretty good.
- That was good.

544
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,120
Player 302, please take your shot.

545
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,280
Good luck, Dajah.

546
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Thank you.

547
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Mmm.

548
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,280
Ooh, that is not a good shot.

549
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,440
All 398 has to do is step up,

550
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,000
do me a solid, and just pass that puck.

551
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,280
302 is gonna be
one step closer to elimination.

552
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,520
Player 398,
you were furthest from the line

553
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,480
and remain at risk of elimination.

554
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,600
Player 183, please take your shot.

555
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,360
I'm not nervous at all.
I'm very confident.

556
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,240
I've played shuffleboard before.

557
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,080
This is my type of game.

558
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,840
He might overshoot
because he saw us undershoot.

559
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,880
I hope so.

560
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,760
I'm like,
"Please, please, please, please."

561
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,760
Good luck.

562
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,040
That's a clean shot.

563
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,200
Damn.

564
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,440
I'm safe.
That was definitely a winning shot.

565
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,360
- That was good.
- That was good.

566
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,920
I hope they knock his out.

567
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,480
- Good luck. You got it.
- Good luck, Kate.

568
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,240
Come on, kids. Let's do this.

569
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,720
Damn!

570
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,440
You guys are not making this easy.

571
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,400
Nice work.

572
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,720
- I don't know. I think it's too close.
- Good luck.

573
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Oof.

574
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,680
Oof, oof.

575
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,640
I don't think that's good.

576
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,560
Nice work.

577
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,440
Oh, jeez.

578
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
She better knock him out.

579
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,040
Knock him out.

580
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,800
Ooh!

581
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,520
Player 327,

582
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
you were furthest from the line.

583
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,880
You will now go head-to-head
with player 398.

584
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,440
Beat him. Beat him.

585
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,080
Whoever loses will be eliminated.

586
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,600
Player 327 will play first.

587
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
Guys, if I go,

588
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,360
good luck to all of you.

589
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,600
- Good luck.
- Thank you all for your friendship.

590
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,120
- Good luck, Kate.
- Love you.

591
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,640
398 threw it quite short on the first go,

592
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,080
so I'm thinking if I can try

593
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,360
and push it a little bit further
than I did,

594
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm in with a chance.

595
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,760
Come on, Jesus,
one more game, one more game.

596
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,560
It's a good throw.

597
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,800
It is what it is.

598
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,720
Yeah.

599
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
Take your time, Trinity.

600
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,800
Take your time, Trinity. Light work.

601
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,960
Should have gone harder.

602
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,640
Too short.

603
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,280
- You got this, Trin.
- Good luck, Trinity.

604
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,760
I do wish
I wasn't playing Kate, player 327.

605
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,200
She's here to win the money for her son.

606
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,920
But whatever happens,
win or lose, it's in God's hands.

607
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,600
Oh, my God.

608
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
I can't tell.

609
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,760
Wow.

610
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
I don't know.

611
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,920
Yeah.

612
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,960
- Who?
- It's like this.

613
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,000
- Holy shit.
- It seems that close.

614
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,520
It's like that close.
When I lined up with it, though…

615
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,240
Mmm.

616
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,520
<i>Player 327…</i>

617
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,800
<i>…eliminated.</i>

618
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,240
Thank you, Jesus.

619
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,600
So what's the deal here now, guys?

620
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,200
<i>Congratulations, players.</i>

621
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,800
<i>You have survived and are the final five.</i>

622
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,560
Final five. Give us something good
for a chance. Let's go.

623
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,920
<i>Please take a box and collect your reward.</i>

624
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,120
Thank you.

625
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,760
I never thought I'd get this far.

626
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm thinking I ain't got a job
once I get back

627
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,840
because they didn't think
I was gonna be gone this long.

628
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,440
I know I used all my sick days,

629
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,800
but hey, if I win 4.56 million,

630
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,400
I do not mind
if I ain't got a job going back.

631
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>You may now open your reward.</i>

632
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,680
Ey, ey, ey. Yo, guys.

633
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,320
- Oh! Okay!
- Oh!

634
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,120
Talk to me nice
or don't talk to me at all.

635
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,040
That's crazy.

636
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,960
Like, can y'all believe
we made it to the tuxedos?

637
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,840
- Oh, my God.
- Tuxedos, bro!

638
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,200
Oh, man.

639
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,600
It feels surreal but also reachable

640
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,640
that I could be the winner of this game.

641
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,400
To finally be so close to it feels like…

642
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,200
Every time I think about it,
I get goosebumps, basically.

643
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
Didn't think I'd see
my number on the tux, but…

644
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600
Your new favorite number.

645
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,000
Here we are. Seriously though.

646
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:59,480
Now to make it to final five,
losing at this stage would be, uh…

647
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,240
devastating.

648
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,320
I want it. And I want it so badly.

649
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,440
I feel like Abraham Lincoln.

650
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,200
- Yeah.
- I feel like Geor--

651
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,200
I feel like one of those rich people.
I feel like Elon Musk.

652
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,960
"Like one of those rich people."
Hey, you might be one of them rich people.

653
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,760
There's still work to be done.

654
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,920
Only one of us can win,
so we'll see what happens next.

655
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Hopefully, I am the last one in the suit,
if you know what I mean, so…

656
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,560
Yeah, I feel
like I should dress like this every day.

657
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
That's too much. I can't.

658
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,520
Nah, like…

659
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm gonna start walking around like this.

660
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I am feeling
on top of the world right now.

661
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,960
I mean, finalist, black tux,
it couldn't get any better than this.

662
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,560
There's only four other people
standing in my way

663
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,840
of four and a half million dollars
right now.

664
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,200
It's me against everybody now.
There's no more allies.

665
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,120
I just-- I don't care, you know?

666
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,880
Um, I don't care about any of them.

667
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,120
When I get the opportunity,

668
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm gonna have no problem
taking any of these players out.

669
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,240
<i>Tomorrow,</i>
<i>one of you will win $4.56 million.</i>

670
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,880
<i>But not all of you</i>
<i>will make it to the final game.</i>

671
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,960
Oh, no.

672
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,040
I'm good at being able
to get people to do what I want them to.

673
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,560
I don't wanna do this.

674
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,560
It's not supposed to play out like this.

675
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Oh!

676
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,240
<i>Welcome to your final game.</i>

677
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,160
<i>Green light, red light</i>

678
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,120
<i>Eliminated. Eliminated.</i>

679
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,200
Congratulations.
You are the winner of <i>Squid Game.</i>
