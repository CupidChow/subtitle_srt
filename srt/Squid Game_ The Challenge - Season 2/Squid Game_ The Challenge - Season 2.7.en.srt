1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,720
I'mma take Yellow down to 22.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,280
I hope one of them disappears.

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,440
I'm going left.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,280
Love you all.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,000
I wish I would've taken
a more selfish approach

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,640
to deciding who was going
to go down the slide first.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,320
So much is at stake,

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,280
but I actually only have
a 50% chance of being correct.

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,040
No.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
- Oh…
- My God.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,720
Oh, my gosh.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
She didn't come back.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>Player 369…</i>

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>…eliminated.</i>

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,560
Oh, that's crazy.

17
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,640
Oh, my God.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,200
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,440
I don't feel bad about it.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,920
At this point, I'm just thinking 072
is just an overly emotional person.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,960
If you come for me, my retaliation
is gonna be to come for you.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,520
My head's in the game. On to the next.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
- Yeah.
- There you go. See?

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,400
- Still in this, Perla.
- Still here, baby girl. Still in this.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
You're still in this.

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,920
I'm cooking right now.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
It's okay, it's okay.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,960
I don't wanna hold a grudge,
but I'm seeing the way he's moving,

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,400
and that put
a really nasty taste in my mouth.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,080
I don't know why you're crying so much.
It's just a game.

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,360
The moment you show
your true colors, I'm done with you.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
"Choose a team to miss a turn."

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
That's not good for me.

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
Strategy over passion, maybe.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,440
- Yeah, strategy over passion.
- Strategy over passion.

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
I pick Red.

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,320
Everyone's just getting
a little emotional.

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,840
And hey, at the end of the day,

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,800
if you send someone back down,
they're probably gonna come for you.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,760
Player 072 has taken that personal.

41
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,480
At the end of the day,
there's no bad blood. There's no beef.

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
- Oh.
- Six.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,680
Two, three… five, six.

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm sorry I let
the passion get in the way.

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,640
It's okay, that's okay. It's emotion.

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,000
- Are we going back down to two?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,800
- No!
- Yeah. Coming back down, people.

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
Whoo!

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,720
All right, I'm manifesting
this six, y'all.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
- I'll take a three.
- Let's go.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
Hey, that's okay.
We skipped the chute, and we skip this.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
- Six.
- Ooh.

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
A five would be lit.

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,800
Dang it, that's crazy.

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,680
It just can't be a one or a two.

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,720
We are so close to that exit.
It is within arm's reach.

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,560
The way I'm, like, hoping
for their demise is wild.

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,640
Oh, my God, you guys.

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,360
No.

61
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,920
That's so unlucky.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,560
Justin, I wanna go first.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,840
Let me go first.

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,640
This game is crazy.

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,400
You can be at the top,
and the next turn, be at the bottom.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,320
Justin has been
such a great friend to me in this game.

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,680
And he's somebody that I am
completely willing to risk myself for.

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,680
Well, then pick the right one, okay?

69
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,880
Oh, man.

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I wanna win that money
and give back to my family

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,160
for all the sacrifices
that they've given me.

72
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm gonna step up,

73
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,960
and I'm going to take the chance,
take a risk.

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,080
- I'm going that way.
- Okay. Hey.

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,360
I wish you'd let me go.

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,720
No.

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
Please, God.

78
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,560
Come on, come on, come on.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
- Let's go.
- Yeah, I love you.

80
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
Please, God.

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
Yes!

82
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Let's go!

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,320
Somebody was gonna
get it right. We told you.

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
- You good. You are fine.
- Oh my God.

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,120
Good job.

86
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
Whoo!

87
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,720
Amazing.

88
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,120
There's only one left.

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
- That's the only unknown.
- 27.

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
- Four.
- Oh, my God. Is it the slide?

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,600
The one we don't know.

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,320
What the hell?

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,640
I have nobody
to talk through my decisions with.

94
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm just kind of relying on chance here.

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
I think I'm gonna go left.

96
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,600
- Love you, Mackenzie.
- We love you.

97
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,040
See you at the bottom.

98
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,240
Yes!

99
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,480
We have all the slides figured out now.

100
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,600
All the slides figured out.
Now it's just a race.

101
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Right now we gotta just get
all the way up there.

102
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,640
Yep. All the way up there.

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,200
It is not a race against time.

104
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,720
It's a race against who can finish first.

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,600
"Skip a slide.
Select a team to slide in your place."

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,880
So, we're gonna keep it.

107
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,160
That's a good card.

108
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,920
I don't ever wanna see
a slide again ever in my life.

109
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,720
Phew. Damn.
I was praying to my grandmother.

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,840
I was like, "Mama, <i>por favor,</i>
let me get a two."

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
All right. Here we go.

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,840
"Send a team back to the start."

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Oh, my God.

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,520
There's two teams ahead of us.
She's gotta…

115
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,600
She's gotta get rid of them
to increase her chances of getting there.

116
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
She's gonna go Blue.

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
She's gotta go Blue.

118
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Wait.

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,880
I have to remind myself
that this is a game,

120
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
and people will have to get eliminated.

121
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
I can't even allow
the, like, outside noise to get in

122
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,880
because when it's time to make decisions,
I need to have the clearest mind.

123
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Please, please, please.

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,960
I choose…

125
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,800
pink.

126
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,400
Really?

127
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,360
Sorry.

128
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,600
There is still beef with player 183,

129
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,720
but I have to be smart

130
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,720
because the pink team
has an advantage right now,

131
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,000
where they don't have to go
down the slide.

132
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,360
Wow.

133
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,560
She wanted to have a go at you,
and now it's us after everything.

134
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,760
It sucks because I really respect
both women that are on that team,

135
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,440
but I'm just playing the game
as fairly as I feel like I can.

136
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh, thank God.
I knew she wasn't gonna let me down.

137
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,960
It's okay.

138
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm so sorry.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Mm-hmm. You can tell that to my son.

140
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,040
- "Tell that to my son," she said.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,280
- That's what she's here for, honey.
- I know.

142
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,160
Dude.

143
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,360
It's okay, Perla. It's okay.

144
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
It's okay.

145
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,160
That comment was so uncalled-for.

146
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,640
I came to this competition
to fight for my family,

147
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,960
for the struggles I've had growing up,

148
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,520
for things I wanna change for my lineage,

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,760
and if someone were to ever send me back,

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,680
I would not bring
that guilt into their face.

151
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,160
That is just unfair and cruel

152
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
and just straight nasty.

153
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm really angry.

154
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,640
I hope she feels really bad.

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,160
What is wrong with her?

156
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,720
It's all right.

157
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,800
Game is on.

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,720
Okay.

159
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,200
Oh, God.

160
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,560
"Go back one space
or send a team to square 42."

161
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,920
- Oh, what's 42?
- That's the pass.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,360
Damn.

163
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,040
Back one space is a slide.
We're definitely not going down.

164
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,720
Or send a team
straight to the finish line.

165
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
We could play dirty.
We could swap the whole board around.

166
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,160
I mean, the smart move would be
to send us 'cause we're already here.

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,120
I mean, what do you wanna do?

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440
But we look up at the top.

169
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,880
The Blue team, they're the closest.

170
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,840
- They're already at top.
- Does it make sense?

171
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,480
The probability of them
making it already is high,

172
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,040
and that's not gonna mess up anything.

173
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
- You guys are already at top. Go.
- It makes more sense.

174
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,960
- Are you serious?
- I love you guys.

175
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,320
Makes the most sense. Get on down there!

176
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,920
- We love you again.
- Thank you so much.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,240
Doing this good karma
is just gonna come back and-- and get us.

178
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,800
<i>Congratulations, Blue team.</i>

179
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,280
<i>You have passed the game.</i>

180
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,160
Now the pressure is on
'cause it is a race.

181
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,000
We have to be one of the first six teams,
or we're going home.

182
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,400
We'll see you guys soon.

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,600
Love you all. Love you guys.

184
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
<i>There are now seven teams remaining,</i>

185
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,160
<i>but only five teams will pass the game.</i>

186
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,200
One, two, three.

187
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,320
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

188
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Oh, my God.

189
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>Congratulations, Purple team.</i>

190
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,600
<i>- You have passed the game.</i>
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

191
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
- First place, baby. That's something to…
- They didn't see that one coming.

192
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,160
- No, they didn't.
- I didn't see it coming either.

193
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
- They did not see it coming. Ooh!
- Oh, man.

194
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,400
Oh, look who's b… Yes!

195
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,680
- No way!
- Sweet.

196
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
- You guys! 'Cause we were wondering.
- Wow. That's crazy.

197
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
Tell us what happened.

198
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>Dude, oh, my God. It was crazy.</i>

199
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,680
<i>There are now six teams remaining,</i>

200
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,480
<i>but only four teams will pass the game.</i>

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,560
"Choose a team
to join you on this square."

202
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,920
They're gonna choose Perla.

203
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
Come on, Yellow.

204
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,920
You're the closest, mama. Come join us.

205
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,920
Told you.

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,840
There's been a lot of gameplay
and a lot of alliances.

207
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,360
302 and 072 are thick as thieves.

208
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,240
It's just unsettling. You know,
it reminds me of being back at school.

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
You got it, Perla.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,840
I got lucky, and then suddenly
I'm looking at the doors.

211
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,640
It feels reachable
that I could be the next to pass.

212
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, no.

213
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,960
It's the slide.

214
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,480
This game is so brutal.

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,720
You cannot make this up.
I was at the top of the top.

216
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, my! Oh, my God.

217
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,880
Right now, I'm freaking out
because if I'm at the bottom,

218
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,600
then I'm gone.

219
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,800
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

220
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,200
I can't watch.

221
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,000
Baby, we're going home!

222
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,040
<i>Congratulations, Green team.</i>

223
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,360
- Oh, baby.
<i>- You have passed the game.</i>

224
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,680
<i>There are now five teams remaining,</i>

225
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,560
<i>but only three teams will pass the game.</i>

226
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,520
We got the twist.

227
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
"Go back one space."

228
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,640
Come on.

229
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Roll a six, girl.

230
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,280
You're right up with me.

231
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,200
Now that I am playing as a single player…

232
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,120
Oh, my gosh.

233
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,520
…I am not sure if that makes me
a threat or a target.

234
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
All right, all you gotta get is a…

235
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,560
- Three plus.
- Three, four, five, or six.

236
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,880
Just gotta avoid a one or a two.

237
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,840
Square 42. Send me back to the dorms.

238
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,680
<i>Congratulations, Red team.</i>

239
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,440
<i>You have passed the game.</i>

240
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,480
- Good luck, y'all.
<i>- There are now four teams remaining.</i>

241
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,440
<i>But only two teams will pass the game.</i>

242
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,680
<i>Congratulations, Pink team.</i>
<i>You have passed the game.</i>

243
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,600
Good luck, guys.

244
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,440
This game has been brutal.

245
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,320
I've lost Zoe.
I've been targeted by Steve and Kate.

246
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,960
So for them to both make it
through the door before me

247
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,520
makes me determined
to be the last team to go through.

248
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,240
<i>I liked how you guys played.</i>

249
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,360
That's how the energy has been in here,
where everyone's cool with each other.

250
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
That's what you guys did.

251
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,440
I'm the same--

252
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,840
Don't you feel
like it was different in the game?

253
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,080
Like, it's so different in the dorms,
and everybody's different in the game.

254
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
- For sure. That is true.
- Versus games, yeah.

255
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,120
And I just have a hard time when people
are, like, one way to your face here

256
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,520
and then totally different in a game.

257
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,520
<i>I was upset because of how</i>
<i>she started crying and reacting.</i>

258
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,160
<i>I'm not coming for anybody,</i>
<i>but, like, at this point, it's cutthroat.</i>

259
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,640
<i>There are now three teams remaining,</i>

260
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,480
<i>but only one team will pass the game.</i>

261
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,000
It is kind of a neck-and-neck situation

262
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,840
between myself and player 072.

263
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,440
I just need to be
the last one through those doors.

264
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,680
I'm not ready to go home.

265
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
I'm not ready to go home.

266
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,920
There is a lot of squares
between me and that exit.

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,640
Oh, my God.

268
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,320
We need a miracle.

269
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,720
Let's come back.

270
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,000
We can do this.

271
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,040
Let's go.

272
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,000
One.

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,280
"Choose two teams to swap squares."

274
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,600
That's easy, I guess.

275
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,640
Well…

276
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,440
We need a three here.

277
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,960
I hate it.

278
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
I know, but I don't wanna go home either.

279
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,520
Please don't roll a three.

280
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,760
It's a three.

281
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,600
I think at this point,
I've gone down more slides

282
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
than anybody else on this board.

283
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,120
And not only that,
but I've had to do it alone.

284
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,080
- We're not losing. Okay?
- Okay.

285
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,680
I might be nearest to the door,
but there is a slide

286
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,920
between me and winning this game.

287
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,760
We're still-- We're still in this.

288
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,680
I know. I know.

289
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,640
I am praying for Perla to roll a one.

290
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,400
Oh, my gosh. I love you guys.

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
- It's okay.
- I love you, Perla.

292
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,080
I love you guys so much.

293
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,120
Like, I lit--
I'm so happy I shared this with you.

294
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,280
<i>Oh, the good life</i>

295
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,200
Oh, my God.

296
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,040
<i>Full of fun</i>

297
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,520
<i>Seems to be the ideal </i>

298
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,480
<i>Well, just wake up</i>

299
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,920
<i>Kiss the good life good… </i>

300
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,240
<i>Bye</i>

301
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,960
<i>I know we're not "cool" cool,</i>
<i>but we're good.</i>

302
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,720
- <i>We're talking.</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

303
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,640
<i>I hope you know</i>
<i>I knew you were just passionate.</i>

304
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,520
I knew. I was like, "She'll say sorry."

305
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,880
- I know, I know.
- It's okay.

306
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,960
It's not that I'm an angry person.
As in, like-- I <i>can </i>get angry.

307
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,680
- "I'm an angry person."
- We all have anger in us somewhere.

308
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,240
I just wanna make sure that you weren't
mad at me, too, 'cause like, yo, I'm not…

309
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,880
Like, I'm a really empathetic guy.
I know we haven't talked much.

310
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,320
- I am, like… I'm-- I'm about my people.
- I get that.

311
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,360
And she came for my guy
and I got emotional.

312
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,600
But like, honestly, if she comes through,
I'm-- I wanna apologize.

313
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,400
- Right?
- Yes!

314
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Oh, my God.

315
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,120
072 was in tears,
and I think everybody's taking her side.

316
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,720
Not good for me at all.

317
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,680
I'm gonna just play nice
but not overly nice to where it's obvious.

318
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,560
Like, "Hey, you know,
don't eliminate me, please."

319
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,440
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

320
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,120
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

321
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,920
- Dude!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
- She back.
- She back, so it all worked out.

323
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,760
<i>We both made it. </i>

324
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,600
<i>Now we really-- We might be the only guys.</i>

325
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,960
<i>Yeah, let's see what happens with Trinity.</i>

326
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,840
- <i>Trinity, we about to find out.</i>
<i>- Yeah, what happened to Trinity?</i>

327
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,560
Oh, Perla.

328
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,680
You live another day, darling.

329
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,600
- How many are we?
- We gonna find out.

330
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,760
Ten.

331
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,720
Ten?

332
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,400
- That was the scariest thing ever.
- Yeah.

333
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,680
I feel really bad.

334
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,360
- I don't-- I literally…
- I'm sorry. I really am sorry. I feel bad.

335
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,920
- That hurt a lot. I'm not gonna lie.
- I know. I know.

336
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,280
And I'm sorry, and it was wrong.

337
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I definitely think my reaction today

338
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,960
has made me a target, um, with her.

339
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,840
I definitely need to be
less emotional moving forward,

340
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,240
and I need to think more strategically.

341
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,400
I'm sorry, it was bad. I hate--
I hate that side that you're just like…

342
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,960
- Anyway…
- I know. Yeah.

343
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm sorry.

344
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,720
With player 327,

345
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,240
she attacked me from a place of malintent,

346
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,400
but you're not gonna catch me
being a bitch to anyone right now,

347
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,080
because any wrong move
could mess you up in this race,

348
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,240
and I'm not trying to get messed up.

349
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,560
You feeling good?

350
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Dude, when I kept seeing
you guys walk in there, I was like, "No."

351
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,000
I was more like, "Take me with you."

352
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,440
Yeah. We knew you was on the way though.

353
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,400
Player 072, Perla,
um, we're getting closer.

354
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,040
We're building a friendship,
especially as the numbers go down.

355
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,680
I think she's a great person.

356
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,520
She's a go-getter, you know,
she does what she needs to,

357
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,800
and she's somebody
that I wouldn't mind having on my side.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
Who do you trust in here?

359
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,160
- You guys.
- Okay, perfect.

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,400
And also, like, I feel like Kate
apologized to me, but like, girl,

361
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,760
you said what you said,
and I know how you move now.

362
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,200
And, like, you gonna guilt-trip me
to feel bad for you?

363
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,760
Like, well, tell that
to my poor family back in the Bronx.

364
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,200
That's what I'm saying.
So your problems are better than mine?

365
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,720
- Your problems are more important.
- Girl, you have a good job.

366
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,560
That really, like, bothered me today.

367
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,120
Everybody in this competition
got worries, concerns,

368
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,480
loved ones that we need to take care of.

369
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,000
You're not the only one, Kate.

370
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm a father of three daughters,

371
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,720
but you don't see me
weaponizing that against people.

372
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,160
You don't see me using that in a situation

373
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,320
to where I wanna make
somebody feel guilty.

374
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
<i>I'm so missing my family.</i>

375
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,040
You know what? I just knew you had kids.

376
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,200
I didn't know you had
some kinda story with your son.

377
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, so my youngest has a lung--
a rare genetic lung condition.

378
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,080
So the only thing we can do for him
at the moment is physio.

379
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,800
- So he has to do, um, an inhaler.
- Uh-huh.

380
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,560
And then he does a nebulizer, which is…

381
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
- Yeah, I know a nebulizer.
- Clears all the mucus.

382
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,040
How long does the process take?

383
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,960
It's probably like an hour
and a half each day.

384
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,640
- Oh, my gosh.
- So it's tough on him.

385
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,640
- Yeah, it's very tough. Especially--
- He's eight. He doesn't wanna do it.

386
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,880
So, like, that's where my anger was.
It was just, like…

387
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,200
- That's not her problem.
- 'Cause you're thinking about him.

388
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,960
That's not her problem. It's my problem.

389
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,960
She doesn't know the extent,
and why should she?

390
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,880
I took it personally,
and I shouldn't have done.

391
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
So that's where it was wrong.

392
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,920
But I just feel like I never thought
that this would be the reality.

393
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,520
I know! Top ten?

394
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,280
The more real it becomes,

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,120
the more I feel, actually,
there's something I can do here.

396
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,320
- There's-- I can make change.
- Yeah.

397
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,280
My youngest, when he was born,

398
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,160
it was confirmed that he had
a rare genetic lung condition.

399
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,200
There is no cure.

400
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,680
There is no treatment.

401
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,560
Um, it's progressive. It is degenerative.

402
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,240
And, um, we often have conversations,

403
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,240
and he-- all he says is,
"I just want it to go away,

404
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
and I just want a cure."

405
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,640
And obviously, as a mum, that's tough…

406
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,280
that I can't…

407
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,680
…offer him any light right now.

408
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,120
Gonna be tough now. We have got a mark.

409
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
- You think so?
- We have.

410
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,480
We're gonna have to step up.
I think it's game on.

411
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,320
With only ten players left,

412
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,600
I feel like everyone's got
dollar signs in their head.

413
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,600
I don't think anyone's
looking out for each other.

414
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,320
Everyone's looking out for themselves.

415
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,800
For me, personally,
I don't really have any alliances,

416
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,680
but I do have a really good friend
in player 327.

417
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,320
However, if I'm gonna win,

418
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I need to make connections
in the dorm again.

419
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,560
Steven, tell me about your-- your life.

420
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,600
I don't really know you.

421
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,000
I got a pet named Onyx. He is my lover.

422
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,160
- Ooh!
- He's my boy.

423
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
- What is he?
- Dog?

424
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,720
Yeah, a German Shepherd mix.

425
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,560
You got a German Shepherd too?
I got a German Shepherd.

426
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,880
- Hell, yeah.
- His name is Marley.

427
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
It really makes sense for me
to be in alliance with 318.

428
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,360
We're the only men standing.

429
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
I know we're both worried

430
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,680
that if one of us gets eliminated,

431
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,360
it's Team Girls.

432
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,800
I don't have anything crazy in my life,
just same old.

433
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,960
Went through highs and lows growing up.

434
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, there was times it was tough.

435
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,200
'Cause I feel like any kid that goes
through divorce, it's pretty tough.

436
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,200
That was, like, the toughest thing
I went through.

437
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,640
I could relate to that. My parents,
they divorced pretty, pretty young too.

438
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,560
My dad, when he went to jail,

439
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,920
he, uh, got arrested for drug dealing,
and then he got deported.

440
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,760
They pretty much told him, "You can't
come back to the US for 20 years."

441
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,000
- He just-- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my!

442
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,920
He just finished that 20 years.

443
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
It was actually last summer,

444
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,320
was the first time in 20 years
I got a chance to see him.

445
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,240
That's wild, bro.

446
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,680
I took all three of my daughters,
my family, my mom.

447
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,600
So you always had a good--
You wanted him in your life kinda thing.

448
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,240
I always wanted him in my life.

449
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,280
It's so hard when you're parenting

450
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,840
to be like, like, "Gosh,
I really hope that I'm not…"

451
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,600
Yeah, I don't wanna make
the same mistakes my parents made.

452
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,600
Yeah.

453
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,520
I'm mentally exhausted
and socially drained,

454
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,840
but you gotta keep chatting
because you gotta do what you gotta do

455
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,240
to get that money.

456
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,160
Our work for the day is done.

457
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,200
Mm-hmm.

458
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm really nervous
about what the next games are.

459
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,440
I don't know if those connections
are gonna benefit me

460
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,600
or if it's just gonna become
ruthless savagery,

461
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,040
and everyone's gonna have
to eliminate each other.

462
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,560
'Cause in that case, nobody's safe.

463
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
Attention, players.

464
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,480
The next game is about to begin.

465
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,680
Oh, my God.

466
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,200
We knew it was coming.

467
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,640
That'd be so annoying
for me to go out right now.

468
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,760
Please follow the staff to the game hall.

469
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,120
Dude!

470
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
I never in a million years
thought I would have a chance

471
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,680
of one out of ten people
to win four million dollars.

472
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,840
With being this close
to potentially winning this money,

473
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,320
the excitement is there,

474
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
but there's also this hope now

475
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,280
that I've seen the numbers
dwindle as much as they have.

476
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,480
I just met these people.
No one is gonna hand me $4.56 million.

477
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,440
I have to fight for it.

478
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,840
Trinity.

479
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,560
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,880
Trinity.

481
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
Hello.

482
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
Hey, Trinity.

483
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,520
- Where've you been? Are you okay?
- Yeah, chilling.

484
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,520
Okay.

485
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,320
<i>Attention, players.</i>

486
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,560
<i>Player 398 was not assigned to a team</i>
<i>for Slides and Ladders.</i>

487
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,600
<i>As a result, they received a pass.</i>

488
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,760
<i>Player 398 will now rejoin</i>
<i>for the next game.</i>

489
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,080
<i>Circle of Trust.</i>

490
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm feeling lucky that I didn't
have to play Slides and Ladders.

491
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,080
I see that there's only 11 of us left.

492
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,360
All I need to do is survive this game
to get to single digits.

493
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,680
<i>Please choose a seat.</i>

494
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
Oh, my gosh.

495
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,080
<i>Attention, players.</i>

496
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,960
<i>You will all be blindfolded.</i>

497
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,760
<i>If you are tapped on the shoulder,</i>

498
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
<i>please remove your blindfold,</i>

499
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
<i>take the gift box…</i>

500
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,880
<i>and place it on the desk</i>
<i>of the player you wish to eliminate.</i>

501
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,920
<i>That player will leave the game…</i>

502
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
<i>unless they can guess</i>
<i>who gave them the box.</i>

503
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
<i>If they guess correctly, they are safe,</i>

504
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,160
<i>and the player who gave them the box</i>
<i>will be eliminated instead.</i>

505
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,000
I don't like this game.

506
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,600
If there's a box placed on my desk,

507
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,360
is it gonna be someone I'm close with

508
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,800
or is it gonna be someone
I'm not so close with?

509
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
Every option is out there.

510
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,080
I'm not looking forward
to this game at all.

511
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,560
So, I'm really nervous.
I obviously know that I'm a potential mark

512
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,480
for some of the other players.

513
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,920
Equally, perhaps trying
to throw people off-scent,

514
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,520
they may well even attack
their own alliance.

515
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,680
So it's nerve-wracking.

516
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,480
Circle of Trust, that's my game.

517
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,960
With my background, it'll be easy.

518
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,440
Nobody knows I'm a police officer.

519
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,600
Every case you can think of,
I've worked it,

520
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,320
and I've solved every type of crime.

521
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,640
So if you put a box on my desk,
you're eliminating yourself.

522
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,240
That's a death wish.

523
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,040
You got this, Trinity.
Make the smart decisions.

524
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,760
<i>Players, please put on your blindfolds.</i>

525
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,120
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

526
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,400
I'm thinking about the strategy.

527
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,080
Player 072,

528
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,600
I feel vulnerable there.

529
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,360
I don't think she'd have
any qualms in, um, eliminating me.

530
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
But there's so much at stake here.

531
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,080
I'm having to think really, really hard
about who to choose.

532
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Players 409 and 110,
I think, at the moment,

533
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,240
haven't yet made alliances.

534
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,960
And player 110 is the one
that I have least connection with.

535
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,480
I truly believe that she won't suspect me.

536
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,560
<i>Players, please remove your blindfolds.</i>

537
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,000
<i>Player 110,</i>
<i>to save yourself from elimination,</i>

538
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,480
<i>you must guess correctly</i>
<i>which one of your fellow players</i>

539
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,800
<i>placed the gift box on your table.</i>

540
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,840
So?

541
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,120
Now you've looked at everyone in the eyes,
who-- who do you feel?

542
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,120
My gut's telling me Chris or Perla.

543
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,840
Honestly, and no fakeness,
I was not the one to put your-- the card.

544
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,640
But this is the time to be fake.

545
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,080
I guess it is,
but if that's a risk you wanna take,

546
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,920
I'm-- I'm comfortable in my seat.

547
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
If you wanna go home, pick me.

548
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,120
Why do you think it's Chris or Perla?

549
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,600
Because I think both of them would think
that I wouldn't think it was them.

550
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,000
But that's just as obvious as picking
somebody who you know is your enemy.

551
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,280
I believe it's somebody
who you have absolutely no attachment to.

552
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,000
Who do you think this is?

553
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
I think it's 327.

554
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,440
327.

555
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,440
I have no reason to vote off--

556
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,280
I mean, I'm just-- I just looked
at body language, to be honest.

557
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,920
It wasn't me.
Perla's always gonna throw me out there.

558
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,680
I could look you in your eye
right now and tell you,

559
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,520
if you pick me, you're going home.

560
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,320
- Perla.
- I'm not--

561
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,720
- You're too chill.
- It's not me.

562
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,720
And I don't want you to go home.
I'm dead-ass.

563
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
I don't want you going home. It's not me.

564
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,080
I'm feeling really torn

565
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,400
between 318 and player 072.

566
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,120
You can't trust anyone.

567
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,600
Now the stakes are high.

568
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,880
I came here
to win this money for my family

569
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,240
and to better their lives,

570
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,640
and I cannot lose sight of that now.

571
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,400
I think the player
that gave me the gift box is…

572
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,200
Player 318.

573
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,920
Tried.

574
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,920
It wasn't me.

576
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,080
<i>The next player to be eliminated is…</i>

577
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm scared for--

578
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,240
Ooh!

579
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,600
<i>…player 110.</i>

580
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
I told you.

581
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm the most honest player here.
I'm not the type.

582
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,640
So, that should give you an example.

583
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,920
I'm telling you, "It's not me,"
it's not me.

584
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,880
We believed you.

585
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,800
<i>Players, put on your blindfolds.</i>

586
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,080
<i>Players, please remove your blindfolds.</i>

587
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,320
Oh, man.

588
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,440
Oh.

589
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,360
I think I have
a good ability to read people.

590
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,280
That's crazy.

591
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,920
I feel like…

592
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,720
I have always been someone
who can pick up on if someone's lying.

593
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,280
All right.

594
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,400
- Vanessa?
- Yes.

595
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,040
- Was it you?
- No.

596
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,280
- Are you sure?
- You can pick me if you want.

597
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,720
But it wasn't me.

598
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,880
Even if there's just
the littlest thing off about someone,

599
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,920
I feel like I can usually pick it up.

600
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,720
Can I trust you, though?

601
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,760
Yeah.

602
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,320
It wasn't me.

603
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,200
- Same thing as the last person?
- Same, yeah.

604
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,400
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. It wasn't me.

605
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
Okay.

606
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,280
What about you?

607
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,440
I didn't do it.

608
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,400
Are you sure?

609
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,320
I played a fair game so far.

610
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Dang, this is hard.

611
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,040
Just go with your gut. Feel it out.

612
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
Yeah, I will go with my gut.

613
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,480
Throughout this game,
I wanted to be someone

614
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,240
who was flying under the radar,

615
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,360
and I didn't wanna take a lot of risks,
but I think I've had great luck so far,

616
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,720
and I'm ready to test my luck again.

617
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,200
Pro poker player?

618
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,320
Who do you trust the most here?

619
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,880
- Who do I trust?
- Yeah.

620
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,040
- Kate?
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,920
Okay, who do you trust the least?

622
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,840
- Uh, I'm not sure.
- That's a good question.

623
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,560
I honestly don't wanna answer that.

624
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,480
Why?

625
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,160
Because it puts me
in a bad spot in the game.

626
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,400
Well, are you nervous?

627
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,320
No.

628
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,760
I think he's lying about this.

629
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,720
I mean, he's a poker player.

630
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,000
How are you supposed to play
with a poker player?

631
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,200
- Who do you think it is?
- Yo, I think it's poker face.

632
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,760
- I think so too.
- But I don't know.

633
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,880
Like, I don't wanna tell you
to take that risk.

634
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,360
I think it's 017, or I think it's 183.

635
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,320
I don't wanna make your decision, babes.
But I'm gonna tell you it was not me.

636
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
I know, this is hard.

637
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,400
I think player 183
has an advantage in this game.

638
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,400
Someone who plays professional poker
for a living is clearly a threat.

639
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,360
They know how to lie,
they know how to deceive.

640
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,800
That's the problem with him.
You really don't know what you're getting.

641
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,880
But follow your gut.

642
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,880
All right. Going with my gut.

643
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,560
It hasn't failed me so far in the game.

644
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,760
And if it fails me now, it is what it is.

645
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,160
Good luck.

646
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,000
The player I think
who put the box on my desk is…

647
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,960
183.

648
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,520
<i>The next player to be eliminated is…</i>
