100
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,367
is Mount Marukami.

101
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,538
[Emi] Nanmaru, your ancestors,
the Marukami family,

102
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,332
lived near the foot of that mountain.

103
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,504
Right… But the person called Minamimaru
was killed, wasn't he?

104
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,174
Where does my surname,
Minamimaru, come from?

105
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:51,012
Tadayori Minamimaru had no children
when he was killed by Michiyasu Shimadera.

106
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,723
That's why his relative,
Masayori Marukami,

107
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,851
sent his youngest child to be adopted
by the Minamimaru family

00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,311
to continue the family line.

109
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,106

Tanabata is usually in July,

00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,892
-[Tagaya] What will you get?
-[Nanmaru] Hmm?

175
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,895
Um, iced coffee then.

176
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,606
-Two please.
-All right.

177
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,902
-[Sachiko] Two iced coffees.
-[cafe owner] Coming right up.

178
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,571
Hmm? What is it?

179
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,490
It's just, that girl…

180
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,285
-[Nanmaru] We might be closely related.
-[Tagaya] What?

181
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,329
It just kind of hit me.

182
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,791
-It hit you, huh?
-Mm.

183
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,584
So it's not because she's your type?

184
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,712
-That's not the reason.
-What?

185
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,921
-What?
-Really?

186
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,131
Yeah.

187
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,924
Sorry for the wait.

188
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,725
[Sachiko] Here's your milk.

189
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,977
[glass clanks]

190
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,020
-[Sachiko] Enjoy.
-Thank you.

191
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,147
[Tagaya] Thanks.

192
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,192
-[door bell chimes]
-[villager 1 sighs]

193
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,528
-[Sachiko] Welcome.
-Hey.

194
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,530
-Boss.
-[cafe owner] Hey.

195
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,324
[exhales deeply]

196
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,703
[grunts]

197
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,998
[exhales deeply]

198
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,418
-[cafe owner] Here you go.
-Thanks.

199
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,590
[groans]

200
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,634
The police are being such a pain
because of the incident.

201
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,512
[villager 1] Why bother coming back
if you go and do something like that?

202
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,806
[cafe owner] You think it was that person?

203
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,309
[villager 1] Of course. Who else is there?

204
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,935
Who else can do that kind of thing?

205
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,147
-Right, Sachi?
-What?

206
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,358
[softly]
Hey. You're being too loud.

207
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,194
There are other customers here.

208
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,488
[villager 1] They won't understand.

209
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,239
Just stop.

210
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,908
It was murder, after all.

211
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,160
[villager 1 whispers]
Fine.

212
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,956
By the way, what about that professor?

213
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,709
[villager 1] Quite something.

214
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,086
You can tell they're a direct descendant.

215
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,340
This coming festival is shaping up
to be a pretty good one.

216
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,425
[cafe owner] It's like the revival
of Lord Marukami, huh?

217
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,760
-Right!
-Exactly.

218
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,095
-[laughter]
-[Tagaya] Excuse me.

219
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,768
The professor you mentioned just now.

220
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,687
Is that Professor Masami Marukami?

221
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,277
[all] Nope.

222
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,655
I see.

223
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,952
So, who might you two be?

224
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,456
Ah. We're students of Professor Marukami.

225
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,961
We lost touch with Professor Marukami
after he came to this town,

226
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,379
so we came to look for him.

227
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,632
Let's see.

228
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,725
Certainly, the name "Marukami" is the same
as the feudal lord who lived around here.

229
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,563
[villager 2] This Professor Marukami…

230
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,023
-Does he have family ties to this town?
-[Tagaya] Yes.

231
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,568
He said he had roots in this town.

232
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,279
Is that so?

233
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,283
So, you really don't know him?

234
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,702
I'm sorry to say,

235
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,704
but I have no idea who he is.

236
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:36,000
We were just discussing
preparations for the festival.

237
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,918
"Professor" and "lord"

238
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,005
are the names we give
for roles within the festival, you see.

239
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,925
Is that right? Sorry for my interruption.

240
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,176
Not at all.

241
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,429
[Tagaya] Let's go, Nanmaru.

242
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,805
[Nanmaru] Hang on.

243
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,307
Hey! Wait a second.

244
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,643
Excuse me for asking,

245
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,730
but did he just call you Nanmaru?

246
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:02,026
Ah… My last name is Minamimaru.

247
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,572
My ancestors also lived here.
I think his name was Masayori Marukami.

248
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,324
The same as Professor Marukami.

249
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,161
-Oh my!
-My goodness.

250
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,538
-How rude of us!
-What?

251
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,750
So that's who you are. Mr. Minamimaru!

252
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,252
-[Nanmaru] What?
-How young you are! How old are you?

253
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,421
-[Nanmaru] W-What?
-How about another coffee?

254
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,924
-[Nanmaru] Uh…
-Our cod roe spaghetti is delicious.

255
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,676
-[villager 1] Delicious!
-[villager 2] Right!

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,179
-But…
-Please, sit down.

257
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,724
[Emi] I'd like to ask you something.

258
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,518
Did this person come here?

259
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,236
No.

260
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,365
He never stayed here.

261
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,869
Did you come all the way from Tokyo
to search for this person?

262
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,412
[Emi] Yes.

263
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,332
Please contact me
if you discover anything.

264
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,960
-Here's my card.
-[receptionist] Certainly.

265
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,754
You must be terribly worried.

266
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,840
-Thank you.
-[receptionist] Of course.

267
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,230
[footsteps approaching]

268
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,483
-[student] Welcome back.
-Thanks.

269
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,070
It was no use. I didn't find anything out.

270
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,864
I see.

271
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,660
But several people
looked clearly flustered

272
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,578
when they saw
Professor Marukami's picture.

273
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,164
-You thought so too?
-[distant chatter]

274
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,499
Actually, me too…

275
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,501
[Tagaya] Mr. Minamimaru!

276
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,254
-Shall I carry that for you?
-Stop that impression.

277
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,839
-[student] Welcome home.
-[both] Hello.

278
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,632
-[student] How did it go?
-It was amazing.

279
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,426
Nanmaru is a lord.

280
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,719
-A lord?
-[Nanmaru] No, I'm not.

281
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,304
[Tagaya] Right this way. Please sit down.

282
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,681
How old are you?

283
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,558
-I'm 21.
-[Tagaya] Wow!

284
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,727
-Young and spunky!
-What are you saying?

285
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,357
[student] You're a lord for real!

286
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,234
-A real lord!
-[Tagaya] That's right.

287
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,778
They were acting really unfriendly,

288
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,947
but completely changed their tune
when they found out.

289
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,365
[Nanmaru and student laugh]

290
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,075
[Tagaya] You're laughing like a lord!

291
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,620
But a Tanabata in June,

292
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,289
that's unusual, isn't it?

293
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,749
That's true.

294
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,836
Do you know what the "Tanabata"
in Tanabata Festival refers to?

295
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,796
I do.

296
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,842
It's the story in which Altair and Vega,
envisioned as lovers,

297
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:36,847
cross the Milky Way
to meet once a year, isn't it?

298
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,349
[Nanmaru] Altair?

299
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,310
[splutters]
Vega?

300
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,522
[Tagaya] Mm. They're different names
for Hikoboshi and Orihime.

301
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,982
[exclaims]

302
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,151
-I get it.
-[Tagaya] Now you get it.

303
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,866
It is said
that for Altair and Vega to meet…

304
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,076
"Altair, Vega"

305
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,327
…this bridge

306
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,581
was made by laying out Kasasagi feathers.

307
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,710
Therefore, Kasasagis are said
to be mediators between men and women.

308
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,171
-Wow. I never knew that.
-Hmm.

309
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,299
But there are no Kasasagis
in the Tohoku region.

310
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,177
In Japan, they're only found in Kyushu.

311
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,846
Furthermore, it is said
that they came to Japan

312
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,183
after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's
invasions of Korea.

313
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,269
Then, it would be strange for Kasasagis

314
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,814
to be on flags from Tohoku
in the Sengoku period, right?

315
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,235
This means that the origin of the Kasasagi
depicted on the Marukami flag

316
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,904
must have been some kind of drawing

317
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,740
that came to this village
along with the Tanabata story.

318
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,118
The Kasasagi
must have gradually become symbolized

319
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,162
and further established
with each Tanabata Festival.

320
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,581
That's why they could draw it,
even with no Kasasagis.

321
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,666
[Emi] Exactly.

322
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,045
But… I still don't know
why they chose to have it on their flag.

323
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,007
[all] Hmm…

324
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,717
That's a difficult question.

325
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,428
-[receptionist] Excuse me.
-Yes?

326
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:03,559
There are some townspeople
waiting at the entrance.

327
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,728
Okay.

328
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,656
Are you Mr. Minamimaru?

329
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,783
[Nanmaru] Yes…

330
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,203
Welcome to the land of your ancestors,

331
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,415
Marukami Village!

332
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,840
[elder] Let me introduce myself.

333
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,343
I'm a member of the town council.

334
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,054
My name is Genichiro Hayano.

335
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,807
Having heard about your visit,

336
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,185
Mr. Minamimaru,

337
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,730
we decided to host a modest banquet
to welcome you all.

338
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,816
[♪ quirky music playing]

339
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,069
Actually…

340
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,157
we came to this town
with a specific purpose.

341
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,452
Yes. I've heard all about it.

342
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,706
I understand you have come here
out of concern

343
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,584
for Professor Marukami's whereabouts.
[inhales sharply]

344
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,877
We at Marukawa Town,

345
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,005
intend to help you
with all our resources--

346
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,008
Mr. Hayano, this isn't an election.

347
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,968
-[laughter]
-Right.

348
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,762
Please, come.

349
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,805
-Yes.
-[villager 1] Let's go.

350
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,891
-[villager 2] Come on.
-[villager 1] Let's head off.

351
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,975
[villager 3] Let's go.

352
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:45,244
Welcome Party

353
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,662
-Yoshie.
-[Yoshie] Yes!

354
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,580
-Eriko.
-[Eriko] Coming!

355
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,125
[indistinct murmuring]

356
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,590
-Hello.
-[Nanmaru] Hello.

357
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,843
Here you are, young master.

358
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,845
Thanks a lot.

359
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,389
-[glass clinks]
-[liquid pouring]

360
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,641
Now for the servants.

361
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,893
Thanks.

362
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,895
-Here you are.
-Servants?

363
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,398
[indistinct chatter]

364
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,740
[indistinct chatter]

365
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,994
Here you go.

366
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,539
Okay. Enjoy.

367
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,749
[villager 1 clears throat]

368
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,586
[villager 1 clears throat]

369
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,672
[silence]

370
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,562
[nervous chuckle]

371
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,855
[soft laughter]

372
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,858
So… cheers!

373
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,985
[all] Cheers!

374
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,445
[villager 2] Drink up!

375
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,449
[applause]

376
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,252
[indistinct chatter]

377
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,475
[cafe owner] Here you go.

378
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,977
Thank you.

379
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,482
-[cafe owner] By the way, Mr. Minamimaru…
-[liquid sloshing]

380
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,608
Yes?

381
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,444
How should I ask this?

382
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,074
Has it been passed down to you too,
Mr. Minamimaru?

383
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,950
You know.

384
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,330
-Do I?
-[soft chuckle]

385
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,207
-[silence]
-Huh?

386
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,376
[insects chirping]

387
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,962
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

388
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,593
Ah…

389
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,220
[awkward chuckle]

390
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,722
You mean the supernatural ability?

391
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,100
-Wow!
-That's it!

392
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,186
In that case,
how about a display for everyone--

393
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,481
Sorry to interrupt the fun.

394
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,192
But we'd like your cooperation.

395
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:27,906
I'm Kanemura from the prefectural police's
First Investigation Division.

396
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:32,077
I would like to ask a few questions

397
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,704
about the recent murder
of Mr. Toshio Kuraishi.

398
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,918
Detective, how can you
barge in here like this?

399
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,545
-Right.
-[villagers] Right!

400
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,381
Don't worry.
I won't take much of your time.

401
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,804
It appears the main opposition
to the golf course construction

402
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,764
are all gathered here.

403
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,606
You lot are from out of town though,
aren't you?

404
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,359
That's right.

405
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,156
-What are you here for?
-[♪ tense music playing]

406
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,784
Stop it already! You have no right
to interrogate our guests.

407
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,829
-[villagers] That's right!
-Come on. This isn't an interrogation.

408
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:21,334
However, I think they ought to know.

409
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,671
That recently,
a murder occurred in this town,

410
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,840
and the murderer is still at large.

411
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:31,094
And that the people
who were vehemently opposing

412
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:37,100
the victim's golf course construction
are gathered here right now.

413
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,438
[Mr. Hayano] Mr. Kanemura, was it?

414
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,317
If you continue to make such rude remarks,

415
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,278
we will have to take action as well.

416
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,406
-That's right!
-Leave already!

417
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,909
[sighs]

418
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,121
Excuse me. I'll come back another time.

419
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,297
[indistinct chatter]

420
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:15,013
-My apologies.
-I'm terribly sorry about that.

421
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:19,017
-It's fine.
-Oh dear! That completely ruined the mood.

422
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,103
-[laughter]
-[villager 1] You're not wrong.

423
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,813
Sorry about that.

424
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,107
-Don't worry.
-Please, keep on drinking!

425
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,985
-[villager 2] Yes, let's drink!
-[cafe owner] Here you are, young master.

426
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,779
Thank you.

427
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,322
[villager 3]
This alcohol is delicious, after all.

428
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,698
Thank you.

429
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,536
-[villager 4] Drink it in one go!
-[villager 5] Right.

430
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,709
-I'm sorry, we ended up drinking so much.
-[Mr. Hayano] Not at all!

431
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,711
-Thank you.
-[Nanmaru] Let's head to the next bar.

432
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,129
-No way!
-[laughter]

433
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,048
-We'll take our leave then.
-[Tagaya] I'm going!

434
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,258
[Mr. Hayano] Thank you so much.

435
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,093
-Take care.
-Goodnight.

436
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,303
-I'm stopping at the store on the way.
-They'll be fine.

437
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,846
Goodnight!
[chuckles]

438
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,931
[student] Careful.

439
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,016
-[Tagaya] You drank quite a bit.
-[Mr. Hayano sighs]

440
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,818
[birds chirping]

441
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,363
[Nanmaru groans]

442
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,993
[student] Nanmaru, feeling hung over?

443
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,453
[Nanmaru chuckles softly]

444
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,123
[Nanmaru] I think I might be.

445
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:26,710
[Tagaya] You'll be fine in no time
with a bit of mountain climbing.

446
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,962
[Nanmaru] Sounds tough.

447
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,716
[Tagaya]
Nanmaru, I made a model of this mountain!

448
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,509
[Nanmaru] Um…

449
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,388
-So what?
-Huh? So I'm telling you it's fine.

450
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,140
-[student] Fine?
-It's fine?

451
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,350
[Tagaya] It's fine! Keep going.

452
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,145
-[student] Really?
-[Tagaya] Yes. It's fine.

453
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,396
[Nanmaru] Have a little mercy.

454
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,356
[Tagaya pants]
I can't go on.

455
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,900
-[Nanmaru] Come on.
-[student] Keep going.

456
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,110
[Nanmaru] Hey, Tagaya.

457
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,070
-[Tagaya] What?
-You're going to get left behind.

458
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,822
-[student] I can't…
-[Tagaya] You know what…

459
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,699
-[Nanmaru] Keep going.
-[Tagaya] Just leave me.

460
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,783
[Nanmaru] Don't give up.

461
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,369
[Tagaya panting]

462
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,459
Hello.

463
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,669
I'm sorry, but…

464
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,505
the festival will be taking place
at the summit soon.

465
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,216
It's off-limits to the general public.

466
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,219
What? But we came all this way.

467
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,138
[villager] I'm terribly sorry.

468
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,222
[Mr. Hayano] Oh.

469
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,807
Mr. Minamimaru?

470
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,143
Hello there.

471
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,978
[Mr. Hayano] What's the problem?

472
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,024
[villager] It seems these people
would like to climb up Mount Marukami.

473
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,859
[Mr. Hayano] What?

474
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,779
This is a bit of a problem.

475
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,531
The festival is nearly here.

476
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:46,998
Are we free to climb the mountain
when the festival isn't on?

477
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,917
[Mr. Hayano] Well, of course.

478
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,919
I see.

479
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,672
In that case,

480
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,467
Professor Marukami
would have been able to enter last month.

481
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,261
Well, I'm not sure.

482
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,057
We weren't here last month, you see.
[chuckles]

483
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,394
Um…

484
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,106
-wouldn't I be allowed?
-[student] Wait…

485
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,901
What? In your case…
[inhales sharply]

486
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,945
-[Nanmaru] Yes.
-[exhales deeply]

487
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,906
[whispers]
Oh. He's thinking.

488
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,827
Understood.

489
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,871
[Mr. Hayano]
Technically, the festival hasn't started,

490
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,998
so I will grant you special permission.

491
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,752
However, please make it brief.

492
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,964
-[Emi] Okay.
-Thank you.

493
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,716
-[Emi and student] Thank you.
-[pats on arm]

494
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,926
Nothing can stop you, Mr. Minamimaru.

495
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,512
-Nothing at all.
-[Tagaya and student laugh]

496
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,473
-All right!
-Thank goodness.

497
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,726
-Mr. Hayano, are you sure about this?
-[Mr. Hayano] Huh?

498
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,520
It's Mr. Minamimaru, after all.

499
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,401
[Tagaya panting]

500
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,780
-Watch out.
-We made it.

501
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,326
[student exclaims]

502
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,288
-What is all this?
-This place is huge.

503
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,831
[exclaiming]

504
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,082
Wow!

505
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,794
[Tagaya panting]

506
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,007
All right. Just a bit farther.

507
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,260
-[Tagaya] A bit farther.
-[Nanmaru] Just a bit more.

508
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,054
[Tagaya] Hey. You're going too fast.

509
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,307
Professor!

510
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,102
[Tagaya panting]

511
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,360
-All right.
-[student] There are rocks in a line.

512
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,030
They look just like normal rocks.

513
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,408
[Emi] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

514
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,659
Seven rocks.

515
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,581
There doesn't seem to be much else here.

[Tagaya] I knew it, that mountain…
Mount Kurone.

518
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,135
Because of that mountain, the sunset
comes early in this entire area.

519

[Nanmaru] But even after the sun sets,

520
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,603
it feels like it might reappear
from that opening at the base.

521

In the end,
we didn't find any clues here, huh?

Since you're living a normal life,

We didn't find any clues at all, did we?

Also, the people in this town

have gotten friendlier
thanks to that daft lord,

580

but something feels off.

581
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,848
I think that Professor Marukami…

582

might be being held prisoner
somewhere in this town.

You're overthinking it.

But we've been searching all over
and not gotten any witness information.

[student] That's true, but…

588
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,787
Moreover, this town is hiding something…

589
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,582

00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,589
[student] No way…

696
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,677
Sorry. Have you been looking for me?

697
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,804
-No, not at all.
-That's good.

698
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,888
Yes…

699
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,139
[student] Look at him.

700
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,432
He's in love.

701
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,768
Deep in love.

702
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,228
Yup.

703
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,605
[indistinct chatter]

704
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:51,110
[Nanmaru] It's refreshing to see people
wearing yukatas for once, isn't it?

705
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,576
Don't people normally wear yukatas
at summer festivals?

706
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,454
[Nanmaru] Ah.

707
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,417
[Nanmaru inhales sharply]

708
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,505
Oh yeah,

709
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:16,510
you can call me Nanmaru,
if Minamimaru is hard to say.

710
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,471
[soft chuckle]

711
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,642
Then that would make me Tomaru then.

712
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,571
[Sachiko]
Nanmaru, are you a university student?

713
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,491
[Nanmaru] That's right.
I'm a fourth-year student now.

714
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,786
But I still haven't found a job.

715
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,414
What about you?

716
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,044
[Sachiko] I never got a proper job
after high school.

717
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,881
I did have a job lined up,
but it didn't work out.

718
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,593
They rescinded the offer?
What a terrible company.

719
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,808
[Sachiko] Over here.

720

[wind gusting]

722
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,324
[Sachiko] Occasionally,

723
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,911
individuals with special qualities

724
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,747
are born into the old families
of this town.

725
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,708
There are two types.

726
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,920
One type is those "Within Reach."

727
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,923
The other type is the "Window Openers."

728
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,092
[♪ light music playing]

729
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,761
As far as I know,

730
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,306
there are six people Within Reach,
including you.

731
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,852
No…

732
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,772
There are only five.

733
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,486
Five telekinetics?

734
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,786
In addition, those who open the window…

735
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,581
and especially those Within Reach,

736
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,711
are the ones qualified to become
the priests of Mount Marukami.

737
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,214
[Nanmaru sighs]

738
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,719
Is it really that impressive?

739
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,430
What?

740
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,474
Certainly, I may be Within Reach.

741
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:31,770
But still, it's a rather boring ability.

742
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:37,276
[Nanmaru] Who cares about
such a tiny hole opening up?

743
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,903
Or could it be that…

744
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,741
it has some use I don't know of?

745
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,494
That would be great.
I could use it for my job hunting--

746
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,912
Stop it!

747
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,084
This is not a joke.

748
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,920
What?

749
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,258
Uh…

750
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,387
Forgive me.

751
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:11,143
I just wanted to say
that I agree with you.

752
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,520
It's useless for everyday life--

753
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,940
No. I wasn't being serious.

754
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,577
[breathes heavily]

755
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,222
Isn't it fine?

756
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,725
To just live normally.

757
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,188
[Sachiko] Normal is best.

758
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,273
[♪ pensive music playing]

759
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,570
Yeah, but…

760
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,199
don't you think
"normal" is difficult these days?

761
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:13,121
[Nanmaru]
I don't know how to obtain normalcy,

762
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,125
so I at least want something to rely on.

763
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,128
Like a supernatural ability, for example.

764
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,219
[Sachiko] Well,

765
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:32,683
if you became a priest,
you could make a living

766
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,101
by using your powers.

767
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,855
But you'd never be able
to leave this town.

768
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,106
[laughs]

769
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,525
What? I wouldn't want that.

[both chuckle]

771
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,362
That's a shame.

772
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:52,995
By the way,

773
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:57,207
what kind of powers
do Window Openers have?

774
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:04,381
Well, they don't really have any powers,

775
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,550
and there are lots of them.

776
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,428
I'm actually one of them.

777
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,596
Really?

778
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,974
But…

779
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,314
I can't really explain it.

780
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,278
All I can say is
I sometimes have nightmares.

781
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,115
Mm…

782
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,247

has come to this town.

[Yoshie] Who knows?
I haven't heard anything.

801

00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,837
[Nanmaru]
Where are Professor Emi and Tagaya?

879
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,464
Mount Marukami.

880
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,008
Mount Marukami? At this time?

881
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,511
I thought it was off-limits.

882
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,974
Professor Emi said
she just had to go and see it.

883
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,645
Look at this.

884
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,230
[Nanmaru] What?

885
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,526
Marukawa Town Newsletter
Marukawa festival will be held!

886
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,819
[Sakuragi] Turn the page.

887
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,073
Protests Held
Against Golf Course Construction

888
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,742
Historic Mount Marukami

889
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,953
Don't defile our precious land

890
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,163
Outsiders leave our town

891
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,249
[♪ ominous music playing]

892
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,924
[distant chanting]

893
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,448
[chanting continues]

894
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,769
[loud pop]

895
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,261
[Tagaya] I thought they saw us.

896
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,099
Did you see the person in the middle?

897
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:21,020
[Tagaya] Yeah. Do you suppose
that person is the most important one?

898
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,868
[animal screeching]

899
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,175
[Tagaya]
There's nothing here but these rocks.

900
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,303
There are only six rocks.

901
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,054
[Tagaya] What?

902
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,184
I'm sure there were seven.
Now there's only six.

903
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,728
One,

904
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,647
two, three…

905
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:10,069
four, five, six.

906
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,363
You're right.

907
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:24,000
Does this mean one rock disappears
each day of the seven-day festival?

908
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,170
[Tagaya] Hmm…

909
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,633
[groans]

910
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,718
[♪ tense music playing]

911
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,222
[exhales sharply]

912
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,017
[villager 1] What about Akemi,
by the station?

913
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,477
It should be open.

914
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,270
-All right. Should we call and book--

920
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,169
[villager 3] My leg… My leg!

921
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:10,588
[villagers whimpering]

922
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,967
