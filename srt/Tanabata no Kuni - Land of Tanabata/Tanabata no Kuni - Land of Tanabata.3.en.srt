[Emi] We're looking for this person,
you see.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,714
Don't think I've seen him before.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,049
Are you Mr. Minamimaru?

4
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:13,179
[Mr. Hayano] <i>Welcome to the land
of your ancestors, Marukami Village!</i>

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,724
Hey.

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,017
Big brother…

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,520
[Emi] <i>This town is hiding something,
and everyone is in on it.</i>

8
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,646
[Sachiko] <i>As far as I know,</i>

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,899
<i>there are only five people Within Reach,
including you.</i>

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,694
Five telekinetics?

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,821
[Emi] <i>Look, above Mount Marukami.</i>

12
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>I'm going to go check it out.</i>

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,366
[Sakuragi] <i>Isn't it off-limits?</i>

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,868
[Emi] <i>There are only six rocks.</i>

15
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:39,622
Does this mean one rock disappears
each day of the seven-day festival?

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,586

20

What's this about?

21
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,184
Apparently, they were planning
to carve out

22
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,685
the course from the Seven Peaks

23
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,438
to the east of Mount Marukami,
and from Mount Marukami itself.

24
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,192
Yeah, the place Tagaya built a model of.

00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,258

44
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,260
[follower 1] Huh?

45

46
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,390

[follower 1] What?

52
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,827
[follower 2]
It seems there's been a misunderstanding.

53
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,091
[Mr. Hayano] We have been performing
the Tanabata ritual,

54
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,428
passed down through generations
of the Marukami family.

55

[Tagaya breathes heavily]

57
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,273
We should treat him quickly.

58
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,569
[Mr. Hayano]
Let's go down the mountain together.

59
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,743
Okay.

60
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,582
[Mr. Hayano] So then…

61
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,087
tell me…

62
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,053

Anything else?

71
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,468
It was dark,
so I didn't see anything else.

72
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,232
I see.

73
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,860
Let's hurry up
and get down this mountain, shall we?

[♪ uneasy music playing]

75
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,543

-Are you all right?
-[Tagaya panting]

83
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,946
We were attacked
after going up Mount Marukami.

84
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,033
What? What do you mean?

85
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,993
He's alive.

86
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,786
What?

87
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,040
Nothing.

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,336
Basically, we saw something
we shouldn't have.

89
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,505
A ritual outsiders aren't allowed to see.

90
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,930
[Nanmaru] You really saw that?

91
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,480
We can't stay here any longer.
Everyone, pack your bags.

92
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,191
We'll head back to Tokyo
early tomorrow morning.

called Minamimaru?

[Tagaya] Who are you?

Just tell me.

[Takashi] Surely you do know.

[Takashi] It's this sphere
that is known as "Beyond the Window."

Those who can make this are Within Reach.

means reaching Beyond the Window.

and bring it to you.
