It's been up for two weeks.

00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,232
From Professor Marugami.

00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,735
Marugami?

on the bulletin board before.

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,206
I forgot my password.

138
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,835
I've not checked my email
for three months.

139
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,837
You haven't even checked it once
this year?

140
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,505
How does that not make you anxious?

141
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,509
Basically, I think communicating
face-to-face is more important.

142
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,720
Then go see the professor, will you?

deeply engrossed in his research,

[Emi] I apologize,
but Professor Marukami isn't here now.

179
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:06,869
What? Oh, aren't you
Professor Masami Marukami?

180
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,664
Professor Marukami is a man.
I'm Emi, a lecturer.

181
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,333
Right…

182
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,047
Can I sit here? Excuse me.

183
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,677
Professor Marukami is currently
in Tohoku for some research.

184
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,139
Nanmaru, do you have
any relatives in the Tohoku area?

185
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,393
Hmm…
[inhales deeply]

186
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,314
I don't think I have any close relatives.

187
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,817
-Is that so?
-[Nanmaru] Yes.

188
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,028
Then, are there any stories
passed down in your household?

189
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,446
Our household?

190
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,658
No, we're not that kind of family.

191
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,117
There's nothing like that.

192
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,369
Hmm…

193
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,246
Thank you.

194
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,748
[Nanmaru] What? Is that it?

195
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,335
I'm sorry.
Only Professor Marukami knows the details.

196
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,254
I see…

197
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,217
Um, what does Professor Marukami teach?

198
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,344
History and folklore studies, why?

199
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,097
History…

200
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,476
Folklore studies…

00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,605

Did you have another dream?

216
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,262
[Sachiko's grandma] Warm sweet sake.

217
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,223
I put ginger in too.

218
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,100
Thank you.

219
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,360
Delicious.

220
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,740
There were a few houses with lights on.

221
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,787
[Sachiko's grandma]
I suppose many people saw dreams.

222
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,210
You don't have to worry
about anything, Sachiko.

223
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,963
Finish your drink and sleep well.

224
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,591
Okay. I will.

00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,701
-[student 1] Sorry I'm late.
-Hey there.

230
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,078
-[student 2] Welcome back.
-[student 3] Welcome.

231
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,456
Oh, you two!

232
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,958
-[student 1] It's been a while.
-[student 2] Come and sit down.

233
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,168
[student 1] Are you well?

234
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,670
-[student 4] Was nobody caught?
-[student 5] Nobody.

235
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,798
-[student 6] Maybe someone you know or--
-Okay then.

236
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,134
Let's begin this regular meeting

237
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,011
of the New Skills Development
Research Society.

238
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,348
In this meeting, I'd like to decide
on the next club president.

239
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,726
Would anyone like
to put themselves forward as a candidate?

240
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,984
[Nanmaru] How about it, Asano?

241
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,152
What?

242
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,030
Why me?

243
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:58,368
You're quite diligent. I get the feeling
that you'd organize things well.

244
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,412
Actually, to be honest,

245
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,040
I think you should continue
being the president until you graduate.

246
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,000
You're the only telekinetic, after all.

247
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,670
That may be true,
but I've got job hunting to do as well.

248
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,589
That's exactly what is strange.

249
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,925
Why don't you use your powers
to get a job?

250
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,384
Well…

251
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,681
Supernatural abilities
aren't exactly meant for job hunting--

252
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,100
Then what are they for?

253
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,189
To save the world.

254
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,528
But this is more like
the club president's magic club.

255
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,948
It might not be spectacular,
but it's the real deal.

256
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,617
-Exactly.
-[student] She's right.

257
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,663
This is why…

258
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,749
[slams on table]
…I always get swept up in your odd tempo.

259
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,584
-What?
-Sure, it's the real thing.

260
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,003
Definitely a supernatural ability.
It's wondrous!

261
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:54,007
But why is it
such a useless, boring ability?

262
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,218
Who cares if you can open
a tiny hole like this?

263
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,804
It would be much quicker
to just use your hand.

264
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,642
That might be true, but…

265
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,019
I want to do something more practical!

266
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,313
This place
is just a bunch of useless people.

267
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,065
Being here has been a waste of time.

268
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,942
Such an ability is like no ability at all!

269
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,533
That was too cruel.

270
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,119
Why do we have to be useful to you?

271
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,416
We were all tricked,
by the words "new skills development."

272
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,335
Isn't that a bit of a stretch?

273
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,297
You're blaming everyone else,
like a child.

274
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,090
Why come back just to say that?

275
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,717
-Seriously.
-[student] We're not useless.

276
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,427
The universe will judge you.

277
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,179
In any case,

278
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,182
from today, we're dropping out
of this meaningless gathering.

279
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,227
[student 1]
Aww, I wanted to start a business.

280
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,438
[student 2] I'm joining
the English club from tomorrow.

281
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,106
-[student 1] I'm joining too.
-[student 3] Me too.

282
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,233
[student 1] That would be better.

[student 4] That arrogant jerk!

286
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,451
[student 5] President, don't mind them.

287
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,455
They were just
taking their stress out on you.

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,541
-Okay?
-[inhales sharply]

289
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,710
Hmm…
[chuckles]

290
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,340
Should we just disband this society?

291
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,925
[students] What?

292
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,760
-[student 6] President!
-[student 7] No way…

293
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,720
-[student 5] Don't say that!
-[student 4] Why?

294
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,056
[student 5]
We'll be left with nowhere to go.

00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,195

-Amazing, huh?
-Amazing!

303
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,213
Do it once more.

304
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,173
I can't do that.

305
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,011
Magic is valuable because it's performed
at just the right moment.

306
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:07,140
It wouldn't be interesting
if you used it all the time.

307
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,184
Hmm.

308
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:15,232
Your dad couldn't do it,
but I wonder if you can, Yoji.

309
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,900
-Me?
-Yep.

310
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:23,240
Only special, chosen people
can do this trick.

311
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,369
Yoji, do you want to be a special person?

312
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,870
I do!

313
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,248
All right, let's practice.

314
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,624
Lend me that.

315
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,210
Hold your hands up here,
like I did before.

00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:17,085
Right, from the other day…

324

There's something I want your help with.

325
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,842
What?

326
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,387
[student] Has something happened?

327
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,056
[Nanmaru] What?

328
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,515
[student] Well, you're crying.

329
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,352
[Nanmaru] I'm not crying.

330
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,145
-[student] Is that right?
-Yeah.

331
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,150
[student] All right then, shall we go?

332
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,485
-[Nanmaru] What?
-[student] What?

00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,867

335
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,077
[Emi] Oh, Tagaya.

336
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,662
Nanmaru, sorry this is all so sudden.

337
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,122
[Nanmaru] It's okay…

338
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,250
Are you Nanmaru?
From the New Skills Research Society?

339
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,461
[Emi] The New Skills Research Society?

340
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,839
That's right. He's a telekinetic.

341
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,844
It's nothing special though.

342
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,305
Hmm…

343
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,683
A telekinetic, huh?

344
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,020
What is it?

345
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,358
Nanmaru, you are probably…

346
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,163
a descendant of Masayori Marukami,
a local feudal lord.

347
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,457
-What?
-[Emi] Which means, you share…

348
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,296
a common ancestor with Professor Marukami.

349
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,343
While researching his own family lineage,

350
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,054
he happened to find you,
who attends school here.

[chalk screeching]

352
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:57,018
Masayori Marukami,
Professor Marukami, Minamimaru

353
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,896
Shortly after, he went to Marukawa Town
in the Kurone District…

354
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,532
"Marukami Village"

355
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,076
…to investigate the old Marukami Village.

356
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,953
Please wait a second.

357
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,747
Nanmaru, can you check
if any of your relatives

358
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,001
share a connection to Marukawa Town?

359
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,671
[Nanmaru] Well, I'm not sure about that…

360
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,134
-Ah, Grandad.
-[Tagaya] What?

361
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,137
[student] Does he look like your grandad?

362
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,638
[Nanmaru] No,

363
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,724
he doesn't look like him, but…

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,809
-[Tagaya] Huh?
-I just kind of thought that.

365
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,145
It just kind of, hit me.

366
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,732
It hit you?

367
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,484
[Nanmaru] Yes.

368
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:49,654
Oh, I should mention,
Professor Marukami is still only 50.

369
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,534
Maybe there's something that resonates
in your shared blood.

370
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,869
Right!

371
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,455
Did you feel
some kind of connection just now?

372
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,873
What?

373
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,667
Your family lines
might be surprisingly close.

374
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,630
I'm really grasping at straws here.
Please help me.

375
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,258
You seem really serious…

376
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,262
Has something happened
to Professor Marukami?

377
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,601
Professor Marukami…

378
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,231
never came back from Marukawa Town.

379
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,690
He's missing.

380
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,988
The last entry in the notebook
that the professor left at the lab

381
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,616
is the year
that Tadayori Minamimaru was killed.

382
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,537
Minamimaru was killed?

383
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,081
To put it simply,

384
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,544
your roots will serve as a clue
in tracing Professor Marukami's steps.

385
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,176
[Nanmaru] Right, I see.

386
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,973
So you're saying it's been over 120 years

387
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,600
since the Minamimaru family
moved to the Kanto region.

388
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,687
-[Nanmaru's mom] <i>Yes… that's right.</i>
-[Nanmaru] I see.

389
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:09,568
Oh, yeah. Can you ask Dad
about Marukawa Town for me too?

390
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,779
-<i>Huh?</i>
-[Nanmaru] Hang on a second.

391
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,072
<i>Okay…</i>

392
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,242

394
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,955
Sorry about that.

395
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,248
[Nanmaru's mom] <i>I'll ask him.</i>

396
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,751
-<i>But I doubt he knows anything.</i>
-[switch clicks]

397
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,753
[Nanmaru] What? How do you know?

398
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,256
<i>Well, you see, your dad,</i>

399
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,428
<i>has never shown
any interest in Marukawa Town.</i>

400
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,889
<i>Or at least, he's never mentioned it.</i>

401
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:43,893
<i>Maybe he doesn't think much of the place.</i>

402
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,395
[Nanmaru] Is that right?

403
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,147
[sighs]

404
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,859
<i>Don't tell me you just got home.</i>

405
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,068
Yeah.

406
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,196
<i>Are you eating properly?</i>

407
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,035
O-Of course I am.

408
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,661
<i>Really?</i>

409
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,790
-<i>You're probably not eating any veg.</i>
-Ask him for me.

410
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,960
-<i>I'll send you my homegrown green peppers.
-</i>Okay, see you. Bye.

411
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,378
<i>Right, I'll do that.</i>

412
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,258
Hmm…

413
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,647

-Okay.

I'm Keiichi Asano.

00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,572
Here. Take a seat.

418
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,865
-Thank you.
-Here.

419
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,003
[employee] Mr. Asano,

420
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,131
I appreciate you coming, but…

421
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,343
we've received
more applications than expected.

422
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,180
I'm afraid we're fully booked this time.

423
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,808
-Is that right?
-[employee] Afraid so.

424
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,061
But you've come all this way,
so I'm happy to talk with you.

425
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,354
-Okay.
-[employee] Yes.

427
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,402
Sorry. Excuse me.

428
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,947
Hello.

429
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:23,493
Yes. Oh, is that right?

Okay. See you.

00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,007
Mr. Asano.

434
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,553
We just had a cancellation.

435
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,264
A space has opened, if you're interested?

436
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,933
Ah, um…

437
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,689
-[phone vibrating]
-Excuse me.

438
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,024
[employee] Hello.

439
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,487
I see, you'd like to book a lot?

440
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,575
Yes. A space just opened up now--

441
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,868
Hang on!

442
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,246
I'll enter. I'll join right away.

443
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,336
[employee] Okay then, I'll call you back.

444
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,671
Goodbye.

445
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,551
In that case, Mr. Asano,

446
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,097
-I'd like you to fill in this form first.
-[Asano] Yes.

447
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,141
Do you happen to have your seal
with you today?

448
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,143
-[Asano] I have it.
-I thought you might.

449
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,732
-All right, please fill that in.
-[Asano] Okay.

450
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,026
Fantastic.

[♪ light suspenseful music playing]

452
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,355
Wow!

453
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,524
[Tagaya] Marukami Village.

454
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,400
On a scale of 1 to 10,000.

455
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,486
Wow. Why did you make this?
[chuckles]

456
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,071
-[Tagaya] I don't know.
-[Nanmaru] What?

457
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,240
But Professor Marukami asked me.

458
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,408
-For 400,000 yen.
-[Nanmaru] Oh…

459
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,538
So if Professor Marukami isn't found,
you won't get paid.

460
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,375
Don't say such frightening things.

461
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,336
[student] Making something like this
by hand nowadays…

462
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,672
-Even 400,000 yen seems cheap.
-[Nanmaru] Right.

463
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,173
-Listen up, Nanmaru.
-[Nanmaru] What?

464
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,552
This thing in the middle,
shaped like a pudding, is Mount Marukami.

465
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,930
[Tagaya] And this jagged mess next to it
is called little miss Seven Peaks.

466
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,348
Interesting.

467
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,516
Disgusting.

468
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,309
Not disgusting!

469
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,355
[Nanmaru] Professor Emi.

470
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,777
I asked my parents,
but it seems they don't know anything.

471
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,697
-Is that so?
-[Nanmaru] Yeah.

472
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,910
What did Professor Marukami
want to investigate in Marukawa Town?

473
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,415
Dewa Sengoku Chronicles

474
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,960
Marukawa Town, you see,

475
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,545
was once the domain

476
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,256
of a feudal lord named Shimadera
during the Sengoku period.

477
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,844
However, when the neighboring Mogami clan
invaded Shimadera territory,

478
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,306
the lord at the time,
Michiyasu Shimadera, confronted them.

479
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,349
This all happened in Marukami Village,

480
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,935
which was around
where Marukawa Town is currently located.

481
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,105
However,

482
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,692
that's when Michiyasu Shimadera's vassal,
Masayori Marukami,

483
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,987
ancestor to both you
and Professor Marukami,

484
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,657
suddenly betrayed him,
leading to Michiyasu's death in battle.

485
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,992
What?

486
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,245
My ancestor was a traitor?
How disappointing.

487
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,956
That is the established theory,

488
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,834
but Professor Marukami
has raised objections to it.

489
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,672
[♪ mysterious music playing]

490
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,886
In April of the seventh year of Eiroku,
during which the battle occurred,

491
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,306
there is no evidence that the Mogami clan
mobilized their troops.

492
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,475
Naturally, they have no records

493
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,435
of any casualties or injuries
from this battle.

494
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,648
However, on the Shimadera side,
there were as many as 300 fatalities,

495
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,442
including the lord himself, Michiyasu.

496
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,281
In the same period, Tadayori Minamimaru,
who was from Marukami Village,

497
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,492
was killed by Michiyasu.

498
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,290
Based on this,

499
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:44,253
I would like to propose the theory
that Marukami alone defeated Shimadera.

500
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,424
So you're saying

501
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,387
that this battle was to avenge Tadayori?

502
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,430
That's right.

503
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:59,602
Moreover, just 10 days after the battle,
for 7 days from April 29th,

504
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,980
a festival was held in Marukami Village.

505
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,818
Isn’t it strange to not flee,
but to hold a festival in the place

506
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,820
where they betrayed and killed their lord?

507
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:17,078
It's possible that Masayori Marukami
was never a vassal of Shimadera at all.

508
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,584
[Tagaya] But I still think it's unlikely.

509
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:28,381
Records indicate that Marukami Village
had a population of about 200 at the time.

510
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,886
This means that at most,
there were only 60 to 80 combatants.

511
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,640
To think they fought the Shimadera army,
which was said to exceed 3,000 people,

512
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,893
and that they even killed the general
is unimaginable.

513
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,983
[student]
I think the established theory is correct.

514
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,696
Professor Marukami probably wanted
to make him seem cool since it's his--

515
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,905
Professor Marukami…

516
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,164
Professor Marukami would never engage
in such low-level favoritism.

517
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,792
Sorry.

518
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,089
Um…

519
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,885
What if, just what if,

520
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,055
the people of Marukami Village

521
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:21,267
had dug a huge pitfall

Sorry for my stupid idea.

-Strange?
-[Tagaya] Yeah.

530
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,220
Their shape is kind of unnatural.

531
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,597
They have a deliberate feel

532
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,600

533

[Nanmaru] Don't you think
Professor Emi seemed kind of down?

535
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:17,281
[Tagaya] Of course she is. She's missing
her beloved Professor Marukami.

536
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,950
-Is that why?
-[Tagaya] Yeah.

537
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,244
And there's one more person
down in the dumps.

538
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,080
-[Nanmaru] What?
-You're so annoying.

539
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,164
No, I'm not.

540
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,582
-What?
-[Nanmaru] What do you mean?

541
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,960
Why would you say
something so unnecessary?

542
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,838
-It's not unnecessary.
-It was!

543
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,089
Just tell him.

00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,049
-[Tagaya] No! Why should I?
-Tagaya?
