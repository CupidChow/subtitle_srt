she's been poisoned, my King.

It is not enough to kill her,

58
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,166

to take the child.

I cannot lose you, my love.

80
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,750

be lost, my King.

What is?

87
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,249
The snow.

88
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,915
(light orchestral music)

89
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:07,500
It's like a million dancing
stars falling to the earth,

90
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,041
bringing light and
purity to the world.

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,375
It's the most beautiful
thing I have witnessed.

92
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:26,249

be the last sight I will see.

Please go, my love,

100
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,749

your last memory of me.

(soft melodic music)

152

heresy,

154
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,999

Urinating in a jar.

158

Forgive me for that one, Lord.

159
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,999

Thank you to Snow White, our
Princess of the Peasants.

168
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,124
It's nice to see some royalty
come down from the castle

169
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,374
to fill our hearts and not
just their own pockets.

see his head fall off?

Yes, yes, it was great.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,040
The guillotine was nothing
but a parlor trick.

174
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,290
Oh, I know, let's
go to the aviary.

175
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,290
Again? We were just
there this morning.

176
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,749
[Yvonne] Yeah, what's
got you so flustered?

177
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,999
No, no, no, nothing
is wrong, I just,

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
I just love the birds, you know.

179
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,540
The birds?

180
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,541
Yes, the birds.

181
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:12,749
Come on, let's go.

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,124
Snow, no. (cheerful
accordion music)

183
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,499
Don't look now.

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,790
Oh, I know.

185
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,249
Oh, I see.

186
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,290
I think I'd rather
skip the aviary

187
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,749
and stay here and
watch the lovebirds.

188
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,999
(all laughing)
-You behave this time.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,875
Always.

190
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,499
(cheerful accordion music)

191
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,165
Looks like we missed it.

192
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,415
Missed what?

193
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,249
Only the best part of the faire.

194
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,415
How will I find inspiration

195
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,249
for my writing
without the execution?

196
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,249
The beheading, the decapitation.

197
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,749
The old neck hole and head roll.

198
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,124
The blade drop and head pop.

199
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,374
The hatchet and head basket.

200
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,999
Come on, you're a Prince,
make them do it again.

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,874
That old trick, to
entertain nursery children

202
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,290
and simple-minded travelers?

203
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,500
Wait, we're not travelers.

204
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,499
Just talk to him already.

205
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,415
I couldn't, you saw me up there.

206
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,499
And what if I'm not his type?

207
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,749
Snow, you do this every time.

208
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,874
You are a beautiful
Princess, Snow.

209
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,290
You are quite literally
everyone's type.

210
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,499
Come on, you've known him
nearly your entire life.

211
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,915
Plus we've all seen the
way you look at him.

212
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,999
And he looks at you.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,665
I don't look at him.

214
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,874
Oh, you definitely look at him.

215
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,666
We all do.

216
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:21,874
You've got this.

217
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,915
(laughing) That's disgusting.

218
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,124
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

219
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:30,040
Is that awkward lady trying
to avoid your attention?

220
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,165
Oh, Jacob, that is
no ordinary lady,

221
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,874
that is the Princess, Snow
White, right, my Lord?

222
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,999
The Prince says-

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,749
[Florizel] I told you
not to call me that.

224
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,915
Princess? No, I
called her a Princess.

225
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,125
No, my Lord.

226
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,374
I'm not your Lord,
the Prince is my Lord.

227
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,749
No, I'm your friend,
not your Lord.

228
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,665
What do you think
they're talking about?

229
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,915
My guess is they're
debating the finer nuances

230
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,499
of how to properly
scratch their knackers

231
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,249
during a public event.

232
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,125
Oh.

233
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:02,999
I'm sure it's very regal,
very important things.

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,124
Ruling kingdoms,
political status,

235
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,374
heroic battle
stories and strategy.

236
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,790
If my Lord requests we
do not call him my Lord,

237
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,124
we do not call him my Lord.

238
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,624
Well, I'm certainly not
going to call him Florizel.

239
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,915
And why would you call him that?

240
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,124
That is his name,
right, my Lord?

241
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,874
Is that your name? Why
didn't I know this?

242
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,790
Well, I knew it.

243
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,040
My Lord!

244
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,041
Florizel.

245
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,040
[Florizel] I must talk to her.

246
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,999
That you must.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Must he though?

248
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,249
Ignore him.

249
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,124
You have been dreaming
of this girl for ages.

250
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,041
Ages?

251
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,875
All the appropriate
ages. Don't be weird.

252
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,040
I can't, not today, I'm not
even dressed for the occasion.

253
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,499
Come now, Snow,
you look radiant.

254
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,540
I wouldn't change a thing.

255
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,790
Well, if I knew I was going
to see a Prince today,

256
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,624
I would've worn something
a bit more revealing.

257
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,915
Revealing? That's not like you.

258
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,374
Well, yes, you know,

259
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,249
just something to catch
the Prince's attention.

260
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,290
Well, I think you've already
caught his attention.

261
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,875
(playful orchestral music)

262
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,999
Oh, hello there, I
don't believe we've met.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,749
I'm Snow White. You are?

264
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,040
Oh, I'm sure we
have met in person

265
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,749
and 1,000 times in my dreams.

266
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,625
He's good.

267
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:25,749
Hm.

268
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,874
Have we?

269
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,999
Hm, I simply don't recall.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,124
Oh, I recall you speaking
about me just moments ago.

271
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,624
You? Oh no, I was talking
about another Prince.

272
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,374
There's another Prince here?

273
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,374
Well, if there is, then I'd
better sweep you off your feet

274
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,249
before he lays eyes on you
and falls as hard as I have.

275
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,915
Well, I would watch
where you fall.

276
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,624
There have been a
lot of livestock

277
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,749
traveling through here today.

278
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,499
Well then, perhaps you and
your friends can join me

279
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,290
and ensure I remain upright?

280
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,874
Well, making sure a
Prince does not fall

281
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,749
into a pile of manure sounds
like a wonderful time.

282
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,499
We had plans to go
to the aviary, right?

283
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,165
No, we don't.

284
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,624
We would love to join you.

285
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,040
Great.

286
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,875
Shall we?

287
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:07,249
Yes.

288
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:12,250
(soft ominous music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

289
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,250
(Evil Queen groaning)
(corset creaking)

290
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,125
My Queen.

291
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,749
You-you wanted the results
of the skin treatment

292
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,250
with the arsenic.

293
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:34,125
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

294
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,999
Well?

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,249
Though the skin
does appear lighter

296
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,999
a-and more youthful, I would
not recommend ingesting it.

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,499
And the belladonna in the eyes?

298
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,875
The pupils did
enlargen, my Queen.

299
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,875
(gentle tense music)

300
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,249
Have it ready for
me in my chambers.

301
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,625
Give her the mercury next.

302
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,290
(gentle tense music)
(corset creaking)

303
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,624
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

304
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,249
Why do I hate them
so? (corset creaking)

305
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,249
Why is their laughter like
glass shards in my lungs?

306
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,415
Tighter.

307
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,999
My Queen, I fear it is causing
undue harm to thy body.

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
I said tighter.

309
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,249
(corset creaking)
(Evil Queen grunting)

310
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,249
Why does my blood burn with
hatred to see her smile,

311
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,624
or the smallest glint of
happiness in her eyes?

312
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,750
[Mirror Demons] Because
you are jealous.

313
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,125
I am not jealous.

314
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,250
I am the Queen.

315
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,625
[Mirror Demons] You want her
youth, her beauty, her joy.

316
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,415
I cannot be seen like this,

317
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,749
waist growing larger by the day,

318
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,415
flesh beginning to fold.

319
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,915
Once I have it all back,

320
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,499
I will marry into a larger,
more powerful kingdom,

321
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,249
and then burn this
useless one to the ground

322
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,874
with Snow White and her
nasty peasants in it.

323
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,624
[Mirror Demons] After you
have her heart, of course.

324
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,290
(laughing) Yes.

325
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,250
A beautiful beating heart.

326
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,916
Oh, Huntsman.

327
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:20,875
Gunnar?

328
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,915
I'd say we've known
each other long enough

329
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,374
for me to call you
that, don't you think?

330
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,665
Tell me, who is the fairest,
most beautiful woman of all?

331
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:34,666
(light melodic music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

332
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,875
Always

333
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,665
and only you, my Queen.

334
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,625
(soft cello music)

335
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,749
(hand slapping)

336
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,749
Good, I'm glad I can
still catch your eye,

337
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,749
while you still have
them, of course.

338
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,416
(hand thudding)

339
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,749
(birds chirping)

340
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,750
(soft melodic music)
(background people chattering)

341
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,624
So what do you think?

342
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,125
[Snow White] Hm.

343
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,290
Are you the Princess?

344
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,790
Why, yes, I am.

345
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,540
And who is your little friend?

346
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,124
[Felix] This is Diamond.

347
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,624
Diamond is very pretty.

348
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,499
And your name, my good sir?

349
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Felix.

350
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,999
I am so sorry, please
accept my sincere apologies

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,915
and forgive my son, he
does not understand.

352
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,040
No, no, it is an honor
to meet you, sir.

353
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,124
There was nothing
to be sorry for.

354
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,249
Father, may I have a shield?

355
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,124
[Felix's Father] I wish I could.

356
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,416
With your mother
falling ill, I-I...

357
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,874
(coins clinking)
-For the shield,

358
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,249
and may the rest
help with your wife.

359
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,290
This is too much.

360
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,374
No. Felix, may I help
you choose the shield?

361
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,375
How about

362
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,166
this one?

363
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,749
Here, I will even mark it
with a kiss for protection.

364
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,875
(soft melodic music)

365
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,374
Now what do we say to your
father for this lovely gift?

366
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,915
Thank you, Daddy.

367
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,124
Thank you. Thank you
1,000 times, Princess.

368
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,875
I will never forget
your kindness.

369
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,624
(soft melodic music)

370
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,874
That was very sweet of you.

371
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,666
How so?

372
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,874
I did see you give
that man your coin.

373
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:36,750
Give him?

374
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,499
Oh, I'm sure he
worked much harder

375
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,124
for those coins
than I ever have.

376
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,040
You really are Princess
of the People, aren't you?

377
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,165
I don't know about all that.

378
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,290
I was offered the gift of being
able to help and I took it.

379
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,375
The pleasure was mine.

380
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,374
And what are you
going to do with that?

381
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,124
I thought I might
buy it for myself,

382
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,249
should I find the need to
run it through your heart?

383
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,624
You've already pierced
my heart, Princess.

384
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,040
Then I shall keep
it at the ready,

385
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,999
should you be so
callous with mine.

386
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,124
Oh, I assure you,
I hold your heart

387
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,916
in the highest
treasure over any.

388
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,374
I would hope so,

389
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,415
as it appears you keep
trying to steal it.

390
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,499
Oh, certainly not,

391
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,290
a stolen heart will
not truly belong to me.

392
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,165
And I do pray that one
day, I am worthy enough

393
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,374
for you to give it yourself.

394
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,249
You think you're so charming.

395
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,249
You have been my longest quest.

396
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,290
Have I? I bet you say that
to all the other Princesses.

397
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,625
(soft orchestral music)

398
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,749
(sheath clicking)

399
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,665
(coins clinking)

400
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:41,000
(soft orchestral music)

401
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,250
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

402
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,665
(Evil Queen groaning)

403
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,666
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

404
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,290
She's probably down
there right now

405
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,790
covered in muck,
smelling of the stables,

406
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,875
just like the company she keeps.

407
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,915
Why is she like this?

408
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,125
I raised her to be a proper
Princess in my image.

409
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,665
Careful.

410
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,750
(gentle tense music)

411
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,749
(Evil Queen reciting
spell in Latin)

412
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,125
(soft orchestral music)

413
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,749
(liquid hissing)

414
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,125
(soft orchestral music)

415
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,124
Huntsman, I've lost
far too much blood.

416
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,999
Bring me a peasant girl.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,625
Bring me one of Snow
White's little friends.

418
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:59,165
We shall see how quickly
that pretty smile fades.

419
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,750
(intense orchestral music)

420
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,749
(birds chirping)

421
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,374
You know, I was a
champion jouster myself.

422
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,499
Of course you would be.

423
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,374
But you know, you could
get yourself hurt.

424
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,749
Hurt, have you suddenly found
a care for me after all?

425
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,915
Well, it is just
that when I dreamt

426
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,374
of a Prince falling for me,

427
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,749
it didn't involve you
falling off your horse.

428
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,249
Oh, but it did include me?

429
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,040
That is not what I meant.

430
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,499
(both laughing)

431
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,249
That looks amazing.

432
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,749
Come on.

433
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,415
(soft orchestral music)

434
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,790
Well, they look like they're
having a wonderful time.

435
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,374
What about you?

436
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,124
Me? It's all right.

437
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,665
Just all right?

438
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,249
If you like that sort of thing.

439
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,540
Well, do you, like
this sort of thing?

440
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,000
I could get used to it.

441
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,999
Well, what do you like?

442
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,041
I like you.

443
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,624
Snow, they're playing
our favorite song!

444
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,749
Oh!

445
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,125
(cheerful melodic music)

446
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,499
(cheerful melodic
music continues)

447
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,290
(hammer clanking)

448
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,124
(cheerful melodic music)

449
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,749
You're mine.
(villager laughing)

450
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,749
You did it, didn't you?

451
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,166
(cheerful melodic music)

452
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:38,041
(cheerful melodic
music continues)

453
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,874
I want to show you something.

454
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,875
All right.

455
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,415
Yeah. (laughing)

456
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,749
(villagers cheering)

457
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,916
(tense melodic music)

458
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,790
What are the huntsmen
doing out here?

459
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,000
(tense melodic music)

460
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,875
(gentle tense music)

461
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,915
Is he pointing at us?

462
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,749
I don't know why he would be,

463
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,915
unless, what did you boys do?

464
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,875
(soft tense music)

465
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,999
He's not looking at us.

466
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,874
He's definitely looking at you.

467
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,624
Well then, we should go.

468
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,249
We can't get in
trouble again. Come on.

469
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,165
(tense orchestral music)

470
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,249
(light tinkly music)

471
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,624
(soft orchestral music)

472
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,415
This place is amazing.

473
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,415
What is this place?

474
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,290
How did you find it?

475
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,749
My father used to bring
me here before he died.

476
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,124
We would talk to my mother.

477
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,124
Your mother, and
did she ever answer?

478
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,665
Oh no,

479
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,249
but I could feel her.

480
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,666
There are times I swear
I could almost see her.

481
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,750
Every time I come here,

482
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,625
I feel reborn, more alive.

483
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,499
When my time here
comes to an end,

484
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,291
I'd like my final
breath to be here.

485
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,790
(soft orchestral music)

486
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:29,249
Well, let's hope that
that time doesn't come.

487
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,915
(tense melodic music)

488
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,999
Do you see them?

489
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,499
What do you think they want?

490
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,040
I don't know, but it
doesn't look good.

491
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,291
Will you boys please
take Sofia home?

492
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,125
(soft tense orchestral music)

493
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,625
Meet me at the aviary.

494
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,124
Okay. Please be careful.

495
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,125
You too.

496
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,166
(tense orchestral music)

497
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,000
(tense orchestral
music continues)

498
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,000
(tense orchestral
music continues)

499
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:28,041
(tense orchestral
music continues)

500
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,750
(gentle tense music)

501
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,999
(gentle tense music continues)

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,665
(chains rattling)

503
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,750
(gentle tense music)

504
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,749
No, please, I'm a
friend of the Princess.

505
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,624
We're just having a bit of fun.

506
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,249
(gentle tense music)

507
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,665
Are you are going to hurt me?

508
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,750
(gentle tense music)

509
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:16,875
Oh, God.

510
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Please help!

511
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,999
Help! (tense orchestral music)

512
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,374
(chains rattling)
Please, someone help me!

513
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:28,916
(intense orchestral music)

514
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:33,125
(soft orchestral music)

515
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,000
Is everything all right?

516
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,291
Yes, everything is
perfect, actually.

517
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,415
(soft orchestral music)

518
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,499
Oh, you're gonna run
that through my heart?

519
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,625
No, giving you mine,

520
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,874
for you to remember me by

521
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,415
and to give you
strength on your quest.

522
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,750
You're not one to
forget, Princess.

523
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,749
I'll hold onto it but
not to remember you by,

524
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,374
but to have something to hold

525
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,874
in the moments you
are not in my arms,

526
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,749
and to use it on my own heart,

527
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,665
when the day comes that
you are no longer mine.

528
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,415
That got dark.

529
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,749
Well then, be my light.

530
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,249
(soft orchestral music)

531
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,999
(Inga screaming)

532
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,915
(soft ominous music)

533
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,415
That sounded like Inga.

534
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,624
Your friend?

535
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,249
Yes, we need to go help her.

536
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,249
Right. (dramatic
orchestral music)

537
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,249
(chains rattling)
-Help!

538
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,749
(dramatic orchestral music)

539
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,750
No!

540
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,250
No, no!

541
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
No!

542
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,249
Unhand her!

543
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,499
(chains rattling)
(Inga sobbing)

544
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,874
It's locked.
-No!

545
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,790
Get back, stand back.
(dramatic orchestral music)

546
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:56,249
(mallet thudding)
(Florizel grunting)

547
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,249
(dramatic orchestral music)

548
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,999
(blow thudding)

549
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,040
Leave her alone!
(chain rattling)

550
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,540
-Please!
-Leave her alone!

551
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,290
Huntsman Kaiser?

552
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,540
(Huntsman Kaiser laughing)

553
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:10,416
I'm here by the
order of the Queen.

554
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,790
(sobbing) Please, no.

555
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:15,249
You entitled little wench.

556
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,874
The Queen should have killed you

557
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:18,540
the day she killed your mother.

558
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,541
Wait-wait.

559
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,165
Oh, Snow. (sobbing)

560
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,290
(mallet thudding)

561
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,999
What did you say?
(mallet thudding)

562
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,875
What did you say?

563
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,790
(sword thudding)
(Inga shrieking)

564
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:32,791
(light melodic music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

565
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,749
(sword whooshing)
(blood dripping)

566
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,749
(light melodic music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

567
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,749
(Snow White sobbing)

568
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,874
(Snow White
screaming in anguish)

569
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,540
You'll pay for this!

570
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,165
Kill them, kill them both.

571
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,624
(light melodic music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

572
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,749
(swords clanking)
(both grunting)

573
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,750
(light melodic music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

574
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,665
(Florizel grunting)

575
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:10,374
(blow thudding)
-Snow, run!

576
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,790
I cannot leave you.

577
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:13,125
I'll find you.

578
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,165
(swords clanking)
(both grunting)

579
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,875
(dramatic orchestral music)

580
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:32,166
(dramatic orchestral
music continues)

581
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:38,500
Snow!

582
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,415
[Snow] Yvonne! (sobbing)

583
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,915
We are being
followed by huntsmen.

584
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,499
They killed Inga!

585
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,790
Where is Sofia?

586
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,749
I, I sent her home
with the boys.

587
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,666
Come on.

588
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,999
No, no! We have to
inform the Queen.

589
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,499
They are here by
order of the Queen!

590
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,749
What are we going to do?

591
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,040
(dramatic orchestral music)

592
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:03,249
Hide where they are
too afraid to look.

593
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,165
(dramatic orchestral music)

594
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,249
(swords clanking)
(both grunting)

595
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,999
(dramatic orchestral music)

596
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,500
(Huntsman roaring)

597
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:18,541
(blow thudding)
(Huntsman thudding)

598
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,750
(cicadas chirping)
(gentle tense music)

599
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,499
(cicadas chirping)
(gentle tense music)

600
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,040
(sudden ominous music)

601
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,875
What are you doing? Who are you?

602
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,874
Huntsman Gunnar?

603
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:41,749
What, what are you...

604
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,250
(solemn orchestral music)

605
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,791
My Princess,

606
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,625
this was your father's.

607
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,540
It's made from dwarf bone.

608
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,125
It will keep you safe.

609
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,165
Now go.

610
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:03,125
(soft tense music)

611
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,374
Who was that? Did you find them?

612
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,666
Just a couple of vagrants.

613
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,165
Go search the faire.

614
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:20,000
(soft tense orchestral music)

615
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:31,125
(soft tense orchestral
music continues)

616
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,374
Snow White!

617
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,375
Snow White!

618
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,874
Have you seen Snow White?

619
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,499
No, Prince, I haven't.

620
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,749
Oi! Oi, Prince!

621
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,999
Are you having a
great time or what?

622
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,749
Yes, yes. Have you
seen Snow White?

623
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,124
[Gerald] Aye, we have!

624
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:50,916
Where?

625
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,749
We saw her run into
the woods with a girl.

626
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,665
A girl with a nice set of
healthy lungs on her too.

627
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,790
Stay here and find the others.

628
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:02,791
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

629
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,290
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

630
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,790
(door clanking)

631
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,624
(soft tense music)

632
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,374
Where on earth have you been?

633
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,665
I've nearly aged another
year in your absence.

634
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,874
The huntsmen found
issue, my Queen.

635
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:27,415
With a young girl? That
does not seem likely.

636
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,665
With Snow White.

637
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,874
Snow White?

638
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,165
What has she done?

639
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:36,749
She and the Prince saw
Huntsman Kaiser's face.

640
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,249
The Prince is
involved? Where is he?

641
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,749
(dramatic orchestral music)

642
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,749
My Queen! (spears clanking)

643
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,999
My Queen, open the door!

644
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,165
I have news about the
Princess, she's under attack!

645
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,124
Seems we found the Prince.

646
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:51,540
Yet Snow White is still missing.

647
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,874
She must be found alive or
I risk losing the throne.

648
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,165
It's only a matter of time.

649
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,999
(hand thudding)

650
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,040
(object clattering)
-Find her now!

651
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:02,249
She's fled into the Dark Forest.

652
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,999
You must send your army there
to find the Princess, please.

653
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,290
We will relay your message.

654
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,999
Now, go before we
must use force.

655
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,374
(tense orchestral music)

656
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,750
Fine, I'll do it myself.

657
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,499
She will not survive
the Dark Forest alone

658
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,665
and we cannot risk
sending my men out there.

659
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,249
Then you go find her now.

660
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,249
And you remember,
I need her alive!

661
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,125
Get on!

662
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:31,166
(solemn cello music)

663
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,000
(water sloshing)

664
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:40,249
(ax thudding)
-Oh! What was that?

665
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,041
(leaves rustling)

666
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,499
Maybe we should go back, Snow.

667
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,749
[Snow White] I
don't think we can.

668
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,249
(gentle tense music)

669
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,249
(creature howling)
(both gasping fearfully)

670
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,375
(gentle tense music)

671
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:09,124
Snow, what are we going to do?

672
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm so sorry, Yvonne.

673
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:16,040
It's okay.

674
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,749
It's all right.

675
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,750
(gentle tense music)
(leaves rustling)

676
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:33,290
(creature snarling)
(both gasping fearfully)

677
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:38,291
(gentle tense music)
(leaves rustling)

678
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,374
[Snow White] I can't breathe.
Can you help me with this?

679
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,374
[Yvonne] Yes, give
me your dagger.

680
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,500
[Snow White] All right.

681
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,749
[Yvonne] Snow, we
should not be here.

682
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,499
(gentle tense music)

683
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,290
(corset rustling)
-Thank you.

684
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:07,291
(gentle tense music)
(leaves rustling)

685
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,749
Over there! (sudden
ominous music)

686
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,750
(creatures snarling)
(both shrieking)

687
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:26,249
They-they're surrounding us, oh!

688
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,665
Yvonne!

689
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:31,374
(tense orchestral music)

690
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:34,749
(sudden ominous music)
(Yvonne shrieking)

691
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,750
(tense orchestral
music) (both shrieking)

692
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,791
(intense orchestral music)

693
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,124
(intense orchestral music)

694
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,290
(Snow White screaming)

695
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,665
(creatures snarling)

696
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:07,666
(tense orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

697
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,291
(intense orchestral music)

698
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,250
(gentle orchestral music)

699
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,291
(intense orchestral music)

700
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,499
Is this the Haunted Forest?

701
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,499
The Dark Forest.

702
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,749
But it is haunted?

703
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,124
Well, yes, but they don't
call it the Haunted Forest,

704
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:52,499
just the Dark Forest.

705
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,041
And why are we going in there?

706
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,291
To save Snow White.

707
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:01,915
Right, about that.

708
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:06,916
I have heard there are many
other Princesses around,

709
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,499
beautiful too, way less drama.

710
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,124
-Jacob.
-So why don't we just-

711
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,165
-Jacob!
-For Christ's sake, Jacob.

712
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,499
(sword whooshing)

713
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,750
For Snow White.

714
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,749
For Snow White!

715
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,374
[All] Snow White!

716
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,249
Yes, Snow White.

717
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,875
(dramatic orchestral music)

718
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,750
(dramatic orchestral
music continues)

719
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,040
(flesh squelching)
-Every breath she takes

720
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,000
feels as though she
steals from mine.

721
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,665
Every step she takes
marches across my very soul.

722
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,874
(gentle tense music)

723
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,124
Her heartbeat is like
the clanging of sword

724
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,374
on shield inside my
head, it won't stop.

725
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,499
[Mirror Demons] But
you want nothing more

726
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,250
than to see her dead.

727
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:08,040
'Tis not true, mirror.

728
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:08,875
(flesh squelching)

729
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:12,040
The death of Snow White
would cost me my throne.

730
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:15,040
She cannot die, I
cannot eat her heart

731
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,250
until I gain power
over another kingdom.

732
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,000
I need her.

733
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:22,499
[Mirror Demons] Need and want
are very different things.

734
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,290
You need the power she
brings with her bloodline.

735
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:30,040
You want the beauty
she effortlessly holds.

736
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,625
Mirror hanging on the wall,

737
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,249
I am the fairest of them all.

738
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,624
[Mirror Demons] Oh yes,
you are fair, it is true,

739
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:42,040
but power is not
beauty, my Queen.

740
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,749
Snow White has a pure heart,

741
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,624
a gentle soul

742
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,999
and a radiant face.

743
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,249
You have a dark heart

744
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:55,749
and a face marred by
envy, age and hate.

745
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,999
Snow White is more
beautiful than you.

746
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,040
No, she's just a
child, a nobody.

747
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:06,124
I am the Queen, the ruler,

748
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,749
the most powerful fairest
woman in all the kingdom.

749
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,540
[Mirror Demons] And what a small

750
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,249
insignificant kingdom it is.

751
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,374
Enough! I will not listen
to any more of your lies.

752
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:20,165
Snow White is nothing to me.

753
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:24,249
[Mirror Demons] You must take
her to the gates of death,

754
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,125
neither asleep nor awake,
in an eternal trance.

755
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,749
Only then can you
bathe in the blood

756
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,374
of her purest heart forever

757
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:38,249
without consuming her heart
and losing your throne.

758
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,249
(dramatic orchestral music)

759
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,041
And then...

760
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,249
[Evil Queen] I
shall have it all.

761
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,249
(soft ominous music)

762
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,125
(soft tense orchestral music)

763
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,916
(soft tense orchestral
music continues)

764
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:10,000
(soft tense orchestral
music continues)

765
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,875
(soft tense orchestral
music continues)

766
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,999
(soft tense orchestral
music continues)

767
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,124
(ax thudding)

768
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,041
There she is. Get her!

769
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:38,165
(soft tense music)

770
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,999
No, no, no! I'm just
an ordinary girl!

771
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,250
We're here by order of the
Queen to bring you back safely.

772
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,249
If the Queen wanted you dead,
she would've left you here.

773
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,249
(soft tense orchestral music)

774
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,249
(soft ethereal music)

775
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,750
(gentle orchestral music)

776
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,750
(tense melodic music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

777
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,750
(tense melodic music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

778
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,125
(tense orchestral music)

779
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,124
Leave us!

780
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,040
We are here by
orders of the Queen.

781
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,915
Let her go!

782
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,249
Or what?

783
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,124
Or I'll free your body from
that wart you call a head.

784
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,915
We're here by
orders of the Queen.

785
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,624
Your Queen has no power here.

786
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:45,291
(dramatic orchestral music)

787
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,249
And neither do you!

788
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,250
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

789
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:03,249
This is going to be easy.

790
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,749
(swords clanking)
(fighters grunting)

791
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,749
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

792
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,999
(Huntsman Merek gasping)
-Splitsies?

793
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,665
-Splitsies.
-Splitsies? (groaning)

794
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:18,666
(dramatic orchestral
music) (flesh tearing)

795
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:22,749
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

796
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,750
(swords clanking)
(fighters grunting)

797
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,624
That was quite the face-off.

798
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:36,250
(playful orchestral music)

799
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,999
(dramatic orchestral music)

800
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,290
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

801
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,874
What, we can't kill them now?

802
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,625
We'll send one back.

803
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:51,249
Remind the Queen she has no
power of jurisdiction here.

804
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,125
So we only need one?

805
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,249
(intense orchestral music)

806
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,749
(mallet thudding)
(flesh squelching)

807
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,665
(Tiny exhaling heavily)
(blood dripping)

808
00:44:04,666 --> 00:44:07,749
Tell the Queen what you saw here

809
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,124
and remind her of her place.

810
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:15,125
(soft tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

811
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,250
(soft tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

812
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,625
[Tiny] I got brain on me shield.

813
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,749
-Tiny.
-Yeah.

814
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,749
-We wrapped that up nicely.
-I've got a few secrets.

815
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,249
-Time for a bath.
-Yeah.

816
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,374
[Tiny] Awesome, can we keep her?

817
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:46,249
[Arsta] You forgot
to feed the last one.

818
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,750
(gentle orchestral music)

819
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:59,666
(gentle orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

820
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:09,625
(soft orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

821
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:19,666
(soft orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

822
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:29,750
(soft orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

823
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,749
(soft orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

824
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,875
(gentle piano music)

825
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,624
Rar! (tankards clunking)

826
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,374
-To another victory!
-Yeah!

827
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,291
Yes, another one!

828
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:03,124
I can't remember what it's
called, glare-off! (laughing)

829
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,999
Of the head. (all laughing)

830
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,124
To our victory!

831
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,665
-Yeah!
-Victory!

832
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,040
(dwarves chattering)

833
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:10,875
Hello?

834
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:12,915
(playful orchestral music)
(dwarves chattering)

835
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:13,750
Hello.

836
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:17,665
(playful orchestral music)
(dwarves chattering)

837
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:18,500
Hello!

838
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,749
(playful orchestral music)
(dwarves chattering)

839
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,750
Men.

840
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,750
Men!

841
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,874
Hello.

842
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,624
How did you get down here?

843
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:29,165
Oh, I had her restrained.

844
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,540
I thought it was rude

845
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,415
to tie up a woman
without her knowing.

846
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:33,915
Uh-uh, here we go.

847
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,499
Besides,

848
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,124
what is she going to do?

849
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,040
Kill us in our
sleep, that's what.

850
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,790
I'd kill her in my
sleep if she tried.

851
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,249
(both laughing)
(tankards clanking)

852
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,374
Beautiful, we can't trust
her, she could be a killer.

853
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,124
She's too pretty to be a killer,

854
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,624
But so is that witch
that sits on the throne.

855
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:49,790
Are you talking about the Queen?

856
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,374
She's not my Queen.

857
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,375
Aye, nor mine.

858
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,040
But you know her?

859
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:55,874
Aye, she banished us.

860
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,665
Banished you?

861
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,374
Are you from the kingdom?

862
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:01,124
Aye, we were,

863
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:03,499
'til she imprisoned,

864
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,290
tortured and killed
our families. (sobbing)

865
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,874
(gentle melodic music)

866
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,375
The last of us that survived

867
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,499
just cast away.

868
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,791
We are all the
family we have now.

869
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,874
Lousy trade, if you ask me.

870
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,166
I'm so sorry.

871
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,749
I just learned today
that I lost my family

872
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,000
to the Queen as well.

873
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:30,040
Just today, she killed my friend

874
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,125
and sent huntsmen to kill me.

875
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,041
Oh wait!

876
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,874
What we doing?

877
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,749
She could be a spy.

878
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,249
(dwarves exclaiming)

879
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,041
Or a witch.

880
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,999
I'm not a witch nor a spy.

881
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,249
Hm, that's exactly
what a witch would say.

882
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,250
(tankards clanking)
-Aye.

883
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,749
If you thought I
was a danger to you,

884
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,499
then why would you
let me into your home?

885
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,124
Well, that's because...

886
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:57,166
(dwarves whispering)

887
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:05,374
Actually, how do you know
we are not murderers?

888
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,165
Wait, we're not?

889
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,499
I thought we were
quite good at that.

890
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,374
No, of course not.

891
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,124
I'd say we absolutely are.

892
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:14,749
I can see it in your eyes.

893
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,249
There is kindness in your souls.

894
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,874
You can see my soul?

895
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,415
Sounds like witchcraft.

896
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:23,165
[Dozer] She's being
hunted by the huntsmen.

897
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,915
Which means she's a thief.

898
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:28,415
[Grimwald] Or a witch
sent by the witch.

899
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:31,040
The witch sent the
huntsmen to hunt a witch,

900
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,415
but then she switched
from witch to killer,

901
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,499
then back to a witch.

902
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,415
Should that be the
witch's huntsmen

903
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:39,750
in the huntsmen's search
to find a killer witch?

904
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:42,040
Obviously.

905
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:44,374
-Oh, right, okay.
-I don't get it.

906
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:47,374
I know she's a witch,
she is a witch.

907
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:51,249
-That makes sense, don't it?
-Yeah, witch makes sense.

908
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,874
(soft melodic music)
(dwarves chattering)

909
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:56,790

the kingdom filled ♪

910
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:59,999

00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,499

(dwarves laughing)
(tankards clanking)

919
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,416
How do you know this song?

920
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:35,416
My father used to sing it to
me as a child before he died.

921
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,250
That very tapestry

922
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,915
hung in his quarters.

923
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,874
(light melodic music)

924
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:44,875
Snow?

925
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,790
Snow White, is it really you?

926
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:50,374
Yes.

927
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,999
Do I know you all?

928
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,499
I gave your father this dagger.

929
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,124
I was there when you were born.

930
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:59,499
Your father had watched
over us all the way up

931
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,915
until the witch killed
him and took over.

932
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,124
I was always told he
died by his heart,

933
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:08,124
and that my mother died in
childbirth during a siege.

934
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:11,374
It was his heart, a blade
that the witch ran through it.

935
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,249
And your mother,

936
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,874
your mother did not die from
the birth, my dear girl,

937
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:18,291
she was poisoned.

938
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,124
Can you tell me more
about my mother?

939
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:25,790
There was no kinder soul in
the kingdom than your mother.

940
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:29,124
Beautiful by all definitions.

941
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,749
I was their doctor.

942
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,165
You worked for them?

943
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,499
We all did. I'm called
Arsta, by the way.

944
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,124
You can call me Sunny.

945
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:38,790
I was the royal thespian.

946
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:40,915
He was a jester.

947
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:41,999
Hm.

948
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,749
I was the personal
night guard, Dozer.

949
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,874
My father was the Chamberlain.

950
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,999
He ensured that the
royal family was fit

951
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and dressed properly.

952
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:53,375
I was to follow
in his footsteps.

953
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,374
Beauregard at your service.

954
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,749
Just call him Beau.

955
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,165
That is quite improper.

956
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,040
But you, you can call me
anything you like, my lady.

957
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,499
Undergarment sniffer.

958
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,124
Oh, stop it. Enough out of you.

959
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:11,749
I was their gardener
despite my allergies.

960
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,790
They called me Pollen,
which reminds me,

961
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:16,374
did you like your flowers?

962
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,624
They were a terrible idea.

963
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,625
Yes, the bed!

964
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:22,374
They were gorgeous.
-Oh.

965
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,250
Gorgeous? Well then, I
helped with them too.

966
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,499
You did? Are you a gardener too?

967
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,375
Absolutely not!

968
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:31,665
The only thing I can grow
is tired of their shit.

969
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:32,749
Language.

970
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,040
Huh!

971
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,124
I was an ambassador,

972
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,874
probably because of my
good nature with people.

973
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,125
I can tell.

974
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,249
What about him?

975
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,915
Who, Tiny?

976
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,374
He was my assistant.
(chair legs scraping)

977
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,749
(lamps rattling)
-Oh!

978
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:51,750
(all laughing) (playful
orchestral music)

979
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:57,915
Alchemist, apothecary, chemist.

980
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,749
I make the mead.

981
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,790
I provide the weed.

982
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,540
I make the dope, you
know, to help you cope.

983
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,415
Would you like some?

984
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,665
You're the dope.
(Tiny laughing)

985
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,499
-I am.
-No, thank you.

986
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,291
I meant that he, well,

987
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:16,249
just doesn't look
like the rest of you.

988
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,374
Hey, we don't dwarf shame here.

989
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,624
Even if they can be a
couple of twats sometimes.

990
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:21,500
-I am.
-Language.

991
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:24,290
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean anything by it really.

992
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,249
Enough about us.

993
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,374
Tell us, how did you
get lost in the forest?

994
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:35,375
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

995
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:44,665
[Mirror Demons] You
saw that, didn't you?

996
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:47,750
(soft ominous music)

997
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,750
My Queen.

998
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:54,749
Is there art I can do for
thee, before I take my leave?

999
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,750
Ssh!

1000
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,666
(soft tense music)

1001
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,500
(Laira gasping)
(soft tense music)

1002
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,666
Yes, this will do.

1003
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,415
(claps) Handmaidens.

1004
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:14,250
No, no.

1005
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:18,165
Please, you don't
have to do this.

1006
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:19,790
Please don't.

1007
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:20,999
Please, no.

1008
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,374
Please, please, please.

1009
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:25,165
Please, please, please.
-Get on with it.

1010
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:30,166
(soft tense music)
(Laira sobbing fearfully)

1011
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,749
(soft ominous music)

1012
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,915
Uh! (sobbing)

1013
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:37,875
(soft tense music)

1014
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:45,124
Yes, these will do quite nicely.

1015
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,249
Take the rest.

1016
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,166
(soft tense music)

1017
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,874
(Laira groaning)

1018
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:57,249
(tooth clattering)

1019
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,915
(soft tense music)

1020
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,916
You forget.

1021
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,791
I can take everything from you.

1022
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,749
(door clicking)

1023
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,750
(tense melodic music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1024
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,250
Rise.

1025
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:20,625
Did you find her?

1026
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,749
Yes, we found her.

1027
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,499
Then where is she?

1028
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,790
We captured her, my Queen,
but we were ambushed.

1029
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,749
Ambushed? You mean she got away?

1030
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,666
(Laira screaming)

1031
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,790
A dozen dwar-giants!
attacked us,

1032
00:54:33,791 --> 00:54:35,499
(Laira sobbing)
(tooth clattering)

1033
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,249
Killed three of my men
and took her from us.

1034
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,125
But spared your worthless life.

1035
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:42,125
Why?

1036
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:44,374
A message, I was to let you know

1037
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:47,749
that you have no power
in the Dark Forest.

1038
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,665
(tense melodic music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1039
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:55,666
(Laira screaming)
(Evil Queen laughing)

1040
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:57,500
Is that so?

1041
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,124
Tell me, huntsman,

1042
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,416
which hand do you
wield your sword with?

1043
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:09,249
The right? Well then, you
have no use for the other.

1044
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,624
Huntsman Gunnar, I would
also like to send a message.

1045
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,415
Now relieve this man
of his left hand.

1046
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:18,000
My Queen, but this blade is
not meant to cut through bone.

1047
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,290
Then put your back into it.

1048
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:26,291
(tense melodic music)
(Laira sobbing)

1049
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:29,749
(Laira screaming)

1050
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,749
(soft intense music)

1051
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,249
(blade thudding)
(flesh ripping)

1052
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:40,250
(tense melodic music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1053
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:48,249
(Evil Queen laughing)

1054
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,125
(soft tense music)

1055
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:56,250
(intense orchestral music)

1056
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,749
(Laira shrieking)

1057
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:03,666
(soft tense music)

1058
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,541
I would've taken your head,
but 'tis apparently useless.

1059
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:20,374
I will do anything
to please you,

1060
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,375
my Queen.

1061
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,750
Of course you will, of course.

1062
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,249
(severed hand thudding)

1063
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:37,250
(gentle tense music)
(Laira sobbing)

1064
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,249
Leave.

1065
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:48,250
(gentle tense music)
(Laira sobbing)

1066
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,000
Where do you think you're going?

1067
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:58,375
(gentle tense music)

1068
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,416
(soft intense music)

1069
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:05,374
Prince.

1070
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:06,875
Prince, come quick.

1071
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:09,749
I found something.

1072
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,374
(soft ominous music)

1073
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,499
Yvonne!

1074
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,875
(gasping) I'm so sorry.

1075
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,624
My God, what happened here?

1076
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:22,540
[Felix] Is that the
Princess, Daddy?

1077
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,915
Felix, what are you doing here?

1078
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,750
You're not supposed to be here.

1079
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:30,665
It's okay, I have my shield.

1080
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:33,249
I came to help
find the Princess.

1081
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,791
We've come too far
to turn back now.

1082
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,291
We're not safe here.

1083
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:43,375
(gentle tense music)

1084
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:46,374
What do you say?

1085
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:49,416
(gentle tense music)

1086
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,499
I agree.

1087
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,999
We must keep moving.

1088
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,249
(creature screeching)

1089
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:01,250
(broom sweeping)
(light melodic music)

1090
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:11,250
(broom sweeping)
(light melodic music)

1091
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,874
You're doing it wrong.

1092
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,749
Hey, that's not very nice.

1093
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,249
Yeah, she's doing us a favor

1094
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,540
I'd say she's even
sweeping us off our feet.

1095
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,165
(all laughing)

1096
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:28,124
Well, she should, otherwise
she'd be a freeloading witch.

1097
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:30,749
We agreed to stop
calling her that.

1098
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,291
(playful orchestral music)

1099
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:39,500
Witch.

1100
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:41,915
[Snow White] Shouldn't you
be out mining or something?

1101
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,624
I was, I was minding my
own business until you-

1102
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:44,874
Wait.

1103
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:46,874
Do you feel that?

1104
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:49,790
There's something
wrong with the forest.

1105
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:53,375
(melodic orchestral music)

1106
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:58,875
Hey, don't clean under my bed.

1107
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:02,790
(playful orchestral music)

1108
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:06,249
Or look in my trunk
or under my pillow.

1109
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,250
Be safe.

1110
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:10,249
Don't tell me what to do.

1111
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,665
(playful orchestral music)

1112
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,000
I think you're cute.

1113
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:15,875
Scratch that.

1114
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:22,750
(dramatic orchestral
music) (fighters grunting)

1115
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:30,249
(dramatic orchestral
music) (fighters grunting)

1116
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,624
Put this in the book.

1117
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,249
Not right now, Jacob.

1118
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,874
(soft intense music)
(sword thudding)

1119
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:40,416
(melodic orchestral music)

1120
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,625
(soft orchestral music)

1121
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,249
(sword thudding)

1122
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,749
(villager thudding)

1123
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,875
Oh, I liked her.

1124
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:01,500
Huh?

1125
01:00:01,501 --> 01:00:03,790
(creatures snarling)
(soft ominous music)

1126
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:08,791
(melodic orchestral
music) (blows thudding)

1127
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:18,750
(melodic orchestral
music) (blows thudding)

1128
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:28,249
(light melodic music)

1129
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,749
(creature snarling)
-Over here, please!

1130
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:35,750
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1131
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:45,666
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1132
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:55,666
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1133
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,166
Tiny, inny-outy!

1134
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,125
Inny-outy up!

1135
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,915
(dart thudding)
(creature grunting)

1136
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:09,040
(soft intense music)

1137
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,165
(blood spattering)

1138
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:13,124
(playful orchestral music)

1139
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:15,249
Well, that was vile.

1140
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:18,791
(playful orchestral music)

1141
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:22,165
That's not going to wash out.

1142
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:25,250
(soft ominous music)

1143
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,000
Cover me.

1144
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:36,749
(melodic harp music)

1145
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:40,250
(gentle orchestral music)

1146
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,625
Sorry, I've never
met a Queen before.

1147
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,124
You called for me?

1148
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:53,624
Yes, I need your help to
bring our Princess home.

1149
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,750
Snow White?

1150
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,249
Of course.

1151
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,874
What can I do?

1152
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:01,749
Well, your role would
be very important to me,

1153
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,875
but would be difficult.

1154
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:07,374
Of course, I'll do anything.

1155
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,749
Oh dear, I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

1156
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,875
My handmaidens will
prepare you now.

1157
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,415
(soft tense music)

1158
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:17,915
[Sofia] It was
lovely meeting you.

1159
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:19,249
Charmed.

1160
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,291
(gentle tense music)

1161
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:26,290
Have her ready for my return.

1162
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:29,375
(gentle tense music)

1163
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:36,624
(soft tense music)
(singer whispering)

1164
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:40,166
If you want something right,
you must do it yourself.

1165
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:46,040
Death delay, but
breath shall stay,

1166
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,291
though blood be drained
and flesh decay.

1167
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:54,750
(soft tense music)
(singer whispering)

1168
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:04,750
(soft tense music)
(singer whispering)

1169
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:14,666
(soft tense music)
(singer whispering)

1170
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:21,124
Beauty is gone and
life is now taken,

1171
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:24,165
slumber eternal
and never awaken.

1172
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:27,624
Cursed in nightmare
unending damnation,

1173
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:31,749
lest true love's kiss
comes sending salvation.

1174
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,166
(tense orchestral music)

1175
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,500
(blood dripping)

1176
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:49,125
(tense orchestral music)

1177
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,791
Rotten, spoiled,

1178
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,750
wizened and vile,

1179
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:04,249
this the blood from
the head of this child.

1180
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,125
(soft tense music)

1181
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,875
There you are, pretty girl.

1182
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,125
(soft tense music)

1183
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:24,625
(witch grunting)

1184
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,125
Huntsman, help me.

1185
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:39,750
(Evil Queen groaning)
(soft tense music)

1186
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:48,499
(Evil Queen groaning)
(soft tense music)

1187
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,500
Handmaiden,

1188
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,916
fetch me the robes
of a peasant woman.

1189
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,125
Now!

1190
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:59,250
And get me my hair.

1191
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:06,915
It's time for me to take
matters into my own hands.

1192
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,790
Stop looking at me like that.

1193
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:09,999
(soft ominous music)

1194
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,624
(blow thudding)

1195
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,165
That's right, run
away, you cunt!

1196
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:14,249
Language.

1197
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,999
(playful orchestral music)

1198
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,499
Oh, my Lord!

1199
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,540
My Lord! (panting)

1200
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,415
Boy, what you doing here?

1201
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,790
And who are you, bringing
these innocents here

1202
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:25,791
to be slaughtered?

1203
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,999
We're actually looking for
someone of great importance.

1204
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
(sword whooshing)

1205
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:31,999
My name's Prince Flo-
Oh, great, more royalty.

1206
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,249
More? Have you
seen the Princess?

1207
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,999
Told you she isn't a witch.

1208
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,625
Wait a minute.

1209
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:42,374
How do we know that she's
not hiding from you?

1210
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:43,624
Aye.

1211
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:44,625
She's not.

1212
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:49,874
She's hiding from the huntsmen.
I've come to save her.

1213
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,249
Works for me.

1214
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,124
This forest is becoming
overpopulated, if you ask me.

1215
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:55,125
My Lord!

1216
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,915
My boy, Felix, he's missing!

1217
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,249
(sudden ominous music)

1218
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,041
(leaves rustling)

1219
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:08,875
(distant creature howling)

1220
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:13,125
(leaves rustling)

1221
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:19,249
(creature growling)

1222
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,041
(soft tense orchestral music)

1223
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,540
(soft tense orchestral
music continues)

1224
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:33,290
[Felix] Father!

1225
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:34,749
Father, help me!

1226
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,750
I am lost!

1227
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,250
Daddy!

1228
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:43,875
Hello, child.

1229
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,790
I've lost my father.

1230
01:06:48,791 --> 01:06:49,791
Come here.

1231
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,375
I have come to help you.

1232
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,250
No need to be scared.

1233
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,040
Let's see if we can

1234
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,791
find your father, eh?

1235
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,375
Show me your fear!

1236
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,750
(tense orchestral music)

1237
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:17,750
The dwarves,

1238
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,541
they are protecting her.

1239
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:27,249
[Felix] Are we going
to find my father?

1240
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,250
Ssh!

1241
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,290
I will take your fear away.

1242
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,790
(bones crunching)

1243
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:36,249
(tense orchestral music)

1244
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,416
(Evil Queen laughing)

1245
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:42,750
[Tiny] Boy!

1246
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:45,374
[Arsta] Felix, where are you?

1247
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:46,791
Felix, come back!

1248
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,999
[Florizel] Where
did they all go?

1249
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,875
Who?

1250
01:07:51,876 --> 01:07:54,624
The dark creatures,
the evil spirits.

1251
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,874
When we were banished and
cast away to the forest,

1252
01:07:57,875 --> 01:08:01,374
the spell that they used took
away their power over us.

1253
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:04,499
Our very bones are
poison to them.

1254
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,624
And Snow White, you're
sure she's safe?

1255
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,375
(laughs) Safer where she
is than near that witch.

1256
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,041
Witch?

1257
01:08:12,042 --> 01:08:13,749
The witch you call Queen,

1258
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,290
that banished us
and cast the spell.

1259
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:19,499
She's no Queen, she's a
right bitch, ain't she?

1260
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,790
Now, now, the Queen is
the one after Snow White.

1261
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:26,874
The Queen after Snow
White, are you sure?

1262
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,290
Quite sure.

1263
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,749
In trying to enlist the
Queen's aid to save Snow White,

1264
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:33,666
I, I might have told her she
was hiding in the Dark Forest.

1265
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,874
Split up, all of you.
Get back to the cottage.

1266
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:39,749
The rest of us will
look for the boy.

1267
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:43,375
(dramatic orchestral music)

1268
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:47,999
(gentle orchestral music)

1269
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,040
Do you like those
scratches, yeah?

1270
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,790
You like little scratches, huh?

1271
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:57,125
(soft orchestral music)

1272
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:06,000
Where are you going?

1273
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,749
Little friends? Where are
you going, little friends?

1274
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:18,750
(birds chirping) (gentle
orchestral music)

1275
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,999
Friends, where have you gone?

1276
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,624
(sudden ominous music)
-Help!

1277
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:28,374
Oh, my goodness, what
happened? Are you all right?

1278
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:31,499
In the forest, please help!

1279
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,874
It's all right, I have
you now, you're safe.

1280
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,374
(soft tense music)

1281
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:38,375
I've got you some water.

1282
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:43,749
Now what were you
doing out there?

1283
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,790
It can get quite dangerous.

1284
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:48,416
I was merely gathering some food

1285
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:51,665
when I was attacked
in the forest.

1286
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:54,124
It was fortunate that
I was there to help.

1287
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,125
Please,

1288
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,249
take this.

1289
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,415
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1290
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:06,290
Oh, I couldn't, food is so
scarce out here in the forest

1291
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:08,290
and I am well fed here.

1292
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,999
I cannot accept it.

1293
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,249
No one has ever shown me
the kindness that you have.

1294
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:18,749
I could not live with myself
if I did not pay it back.

1295
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,749
But there is nothing
to repay, my lady.

1296
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,000
Kindness should
not come at a cost.

1297
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,416
Perhaps you can repay
me with a smile.

1298
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,666
(soft tense music)

1299
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:36,750
Your eyes.

1300
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:40,165
You smile,

1301
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:42,916
but there is deep sadness.

1302
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:46,000
Something a bit familiar.

1303
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:48,290
Eat it.

1304
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:50,415
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1305
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,416
Eat it.

1306
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,999
(soft ominous music)
(Snow White groaning)

1307
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Eat it.

1308
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:04,000
(soft ominous music)
(Snow White groaning)

1309
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:09,375
Oh, you're dead, Princess.

1310
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,999
(soft tense orchestral music)

1311
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,665
(Snow White thudding)

1312
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:19,666
(soft tense orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1313
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:27,791
(melodic harp music)

1314
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:34,416
(haunting orchestral music)

1315
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,415
(people shouting faintly)

1316
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:38,416
Oh.

1317
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:40,625
Snow!

1318
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:42,124
(dramatic orchestral music)

1319
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,249
Snow, where are you?

1320
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:48,374
(dramatic orchestral music)

1321
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,999
Snow.

1322
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,249
Snow.

1323
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,249
(melodic harp music)

1324
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,250
Inga.

1325
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,750
Do you know her?

1326
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,915
One of Snow's friends.

1327
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,666
She was killed when the Queen
sent a huntsman after us.

1328
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,374
She's not upstairs.

1329
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:07,665
[Arsta] She's been poisoned.

1330
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:09,874
Poisoned? How do you know?

1331
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,624
I've seen this before.

1332
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:15,624
The poison that killed
the Queen, Snow's mother.

1333
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:18,749
No, the Queen died in
childbirth during the siege.

1334
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:21,374
The Queen did die
during childbirth,

1335
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:24,665
but the cause was
far more sinister.

1336
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:28,375
(haunting orchestral music)

1337
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:38,416
(haunting orchestral music)

1338
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,749
(dagger thudding)

1339
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,749
(flesh ripping)
(Queen sobbing)

1340
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:49,750
(haunting orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1341
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,250
(gentle orchestral music)

1342
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,874
(flesh ripping)

1343
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:10,540
You have been poisoned by
a form of aero longbeng.

1344
01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:13,666
It was shared between you and
your child through your blood.

1345
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,499
Can you save her?

1346
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,790
The only antidote lies within
the magic that was crafted,

1347
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:23,874
a life for a life, a sacrifice,

1348
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,875
that can only be made
through true love.

1349
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,499
How can I save her?

1350
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,040
My Queen.

1351
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:31,124
Please, please.

1352
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:36,125
You must take her poison breath
from her lips to your own.

1353
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:41,500
I cannot give you
the memory of me.

1354
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:46,000
But take in its
place the knowledge

1355
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,250
that I love you with
every part inside of me,

1356
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,665
and my entire heart. (sobbing)

1357
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:57,165
(soft orchestral music)

1358
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:00,249
If only I could see the
woman you are to become.

1359
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,749
(nurse sobbing)

1360
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,125
(soft orchestral music)

1361
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:16,291
(melodic orchestral music)

1362
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,750
(soft orchestral
music) (baby crying)

1363
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,791
(soft ominous music)

1364
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:43,040
(Evil Queen laughing)

1365
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:46,374
Sofia, darling, thank
you for your sacrifice

1366
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,999
in my effort to
find the Princess.

1367
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,500
I feel so much better
knowing you're happy to help.

1368
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,790
(gentle tense music)

1369
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,249
(fingers snapping)

1370
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,375
(gentle tense music)

1371
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:07,874
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1372
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:11,249
(blood dripping)

1373
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:16,250
(gentle tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1374
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:23,791
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1375
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:33,750
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1376
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:36,791
'Tis much better.

1377
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:42,124
[Mirror Demons] Yes,
but surely, not enough.

1378
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,915
I have found and
reclaimed my beauty.

1379
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:49,916
[Mirror Demons] And yet
you want more, don't you?

1380
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:55,665
Why, there she is, all
there for you to take.

1381
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:56,666
Go ahead.

1382
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:00,249
You have tasted her beauty.

1383
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,415
Now take her heart
from her chest

1384
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,374
and consume it all.

1385
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,375
I cannot,

1386
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,499
not yet.

1387
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:12,790
[Mirror Demons] Eat her
heart and live immortal,

1388
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,165
beautiful forever.

1389
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,415
I cannot.

1390
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:18,415
[Mirror Demons] Oh,
you know you can.

1391
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:20,165
Handmaiden!

1392
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:23,666
(solemn orchestral music)

1393
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,541
(solemn orchestral
music continues)

1394
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,541
(solemn orchestral
music continues)

1395
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:47,375
You are a plague, child!

1396
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,875
Even in sleeping death, you
bring me great suffering!

1397
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:59,750
(melodic harp music)

1398
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:08,541
Bring me the shears!

1399
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,416
(haunting orchestral music)

1400
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,415
Uh!

1401
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:19,291
I do not have anything on
me anymore, Snow White.

1402
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,290
You want me to do
your work for you?

1403
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,749
No, my Queen.

1404
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,416
(haunting orchestral music)

1405
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,790
(Queen groaning)

1406
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:41,791
(flesh ripping)
(Queen shrieking)

1407
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,749
(tense orchestral music)

1408
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,750
(flesh ripping)
(Queen shrieking)

1409
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:56,249
Did you find the boy?

1410
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,125
Aye, we did, but a bit
too late, I'm sad to say.

1411
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,416
Did you find Snow?

1412
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,040
Ah, the witch has taken her.

1413
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:06,875
We are going to take her back.

1414
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:11,499
Yes, about that,
what's the plan?

1415
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,249
I just told you the plan.

1416
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,749
The plan is we're
going to take her back.

1417
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,499
Were you not listening?

1418
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,249
Yeah, we're gonna
go save Snow White.

1419
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,540
Right, so you're telling me

1420
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,290
we just march in
there with no plan?

1421
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,999
That is the plan.

1422
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,374
What's with this cunt?

1423
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:27,291
Language.

1424
01:18:27,292 --> 01:18:29,124
(playful orchestral music)

1425
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,750
All right, all in.

1426
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,000
[Tiny] Hey.

1427
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,749
(Florizel sighing)

1428
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:42,291
(melodic orchestral music)

1429
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:49,750
(soft tense music)
(Queen groaning softly)

1430
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:58,375
(soft tense music continues)

1431
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:08,500

(soft tense music)

1434
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:27,500
(soft tense music continues)

1435
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:38,790
My hands, they're
showing far too much age.

1436
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:42,415
Handmaiden, bring me a small
vessel of Snow White's blood.

1437
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:43,416
My Queen.

1438
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:47,999
In your own words, you said
you cannot harm Snow White.

1439
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,374
Harm her?

1440
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,290
I said no such thing.

1441
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,790
I merely need her
alive and she will be,

1442
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:56,000
just without a bit of
blood here and there.

1443
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,999
Oh, she won't even miss it.

1444
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,749
(blood dripping)

1445
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:04,375

(tense orchestral music)

1448
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:30,165
All right, they have two
royal guards up ahead.

1449
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,499
Killing them would be
treason. Have you any ideas?

1450
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,540
Aye, we say bedtime.

1451
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,999
Aye, let's put them to sleep.

1452
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
All right.

1453
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,665
I go to the right,
you go to the left.

1454
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:46,250
(playful orchestral music)

1455
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,791
No, I said treason.

1456
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:51,666
What are you doing?

1457
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:57,916
(blows thudding)
(royal guards grunting)

1458
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:01,374
(royal guards thudding)
(armor clanking)

1459
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,749
Oh god.

1460
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,540
(playful orchestral music)

1461
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:07,874
-There we go.
-I thought you said

1462
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:09,290
you were gonna
put them to sleep.

1463
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:10,499
Aye, I did.

1464
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,541
Can't you hear them?
They're snoring.

1465
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:15,999
(royal guard gurgling softly)

1466
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,665
That's gurgling blood.

1467
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:20,790
(royal guard gurgling softly)

1468
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:23,875
(gentle tense music)

1469
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,499
Your Highness, I
have urgent news

1470
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,874
of an attack on the castle.

1471
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:34,249
An attack?

1472
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,415
Who would be so foolish?

1473
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:39,624
It appears that they
are dwarves, my Queen.

1474
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,249
(Evil Queen scoffing)

1475
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,999
The dwarves? Have
they all gone mad?

1476
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,124
They do appear to be quite mad.

1477
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,625
How long until they
reach the castle walls?

1478
01:21:52,416 --> 01:21:55,375
My Queen, they've
reached the outer walls.

1479
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,915
(dramatic orchestral music)

1480
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,249
Fuck!

1481

1490
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,500
Is that one of our guys?

1491
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,125
I don't know.

1492
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:05,166

(dramatic orchestral music)

1493

(swords clanking)
(dramatic orchestral music)

1494
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:14,749
Think I could do that?

1495
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:16,249
No.

1496
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:20,790
(dramatic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing gruffly)

1497

(blow thudding) (Tiny roaring)

1498
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,874
That's beautiful,
write that down.

1499
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:25,999
Oh!

1500
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,915
(guard groaning) (dramatic
orchestral music)

1501
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:31,750
I'm a hero!

1502
01:23:31,751 --> 01:23:33,790
Put that in the book.

1503
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:34,791
Fine.

1504
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,416

(blow thudding)
(Tiny groaning)

1506
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,124
It's a bit crowded in here.

1507
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,749
It is a bit crowded.

1508
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:51,750

1510

Am I gonna live, boss?

1511
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:03,374
I never got to be
the little spoon.

1512
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,249
You're gonna live.

1518

Do you think they're
doing this on purpose?

1519
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,125
Do you think they know
we're doing this on purpose?

1520
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,874
[Villager] A little
help would be nice

1521
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,749
if it's not too much trouble!

I am beginning to lose
faith in your men!

1541

You are safe, my Queen. There's
no way they could breach.

Fools, all of you!
(sword whooshing)

1548
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,249
Your stupid mistake
in attacking me

1549
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:38,291
has given me everything
I could want.

We're finally alone

1592
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:38,875
and you cannot hear
my heart beat for you.

1593
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,374
For years, I have felt for you,

1594
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:47,000
and always thought you would
be there when the time came.

1595

But here it is and here you are,

1596

and I am the one to be gone

1597
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:55,125

my full heart.

For you to always remember
me by when I'm gone.

[Both] And to give you
strength in your quest.

(soft orchestral music)

1602
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:17,874
If you can hear a single
word that I'm saying,

1603
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:19,500
take them and hold them forever.

1604
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,291
With all of my heart and the
brightest parts of my soul,

1605
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,249
I truly do love you, Snow White.

01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:42,165
(soft orchestral
music continues)

1608
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,915
[Arsta] The only antidote

1609
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:46,624
lies within the magic
that was crafted,

1610
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:49,749
a life for a life, a sacrifice,

1611
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,249
that can only be made
through true love.

1612
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:57,250
(melodic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

1613
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:07,250
(melodic orchestral music)
(singers vocalizing softly)

1614
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,166
(soft tense music)

1615
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:16,791
No, no, no, Princess,

1616
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,291
you are not meant to come back.

1617
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:24,625
(soft tense music)

1618
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:32,749
I'm going to enjoy this
more than I should.

1619
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:35,791
(soft intense music)

1620
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:39,290
(dagger thudding) Uh!

1621
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:42,290
(blood dripping)
(Huntsman Kaiser groaning)

1622
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:44,624
(blade whooshing)

1623
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:49,625
(blood dripping)
(Huntsman Kaiser groaning)

1624
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,249
(Huntsman Kaiser thudding)

1625
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:03,166
(Snow White breathing heavily)

1626
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:08,624
(gentle tense music)

1627
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:12,749
All your words were
not lost, My Prince.

1628
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:16,666
(melancholic orchestral music)

1629
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:23,625
(tense orchestral music)

1630
01:32:28,791 --> 01:32:33,791
(swords clanking)
(tense orchestral music)

1631
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:43,000
(tense orchestral
music continues)

1632
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:53,000
(tense orchestral
music continues)

01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:02,916
(tense orchestral
music continues)

1634
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:13,041
(tense orchestral
music continues)

1635
01:33:19,791 --> 01:33:21,249
No.

1636
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:24,666
(tense orchestral music)

1637
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:31,666
Kill her!

1638
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,250
Take her heart.

1639
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:38,625
Wait.

1640
01:33:40,875 --> 01:33:45,124
Let her death be in my
hands as was her birth.

1641
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,290
(soft orchestral music)

1642
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:50,499
I am not one for
sentiment, Huntsman.

1643
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,999
Take it now!

1644
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,665
Stop this!

1645
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:56,124
(gentle melodic music)

1646
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:58,624
There is no reason
for any more violence.

1647
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:01,666
There have been enough
lives lost in our names.

1648
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:05,124
Take my heart you
so desperately seek,

1649
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:07,375
so that it may spare
the lives of our people.

1650
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:12,749
I will give you my life gladly
in return for the promise

1651
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,249
that my death is the
last of this violence,

1652
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:18,375
that the villagers and the
dwarves may all be free.

1653
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,541
Do I have your promise?

1654
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:30,749
That the villagers and the
dwarves will all be free.

1655
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:35,750
(Evil Queen laughing)
(soft tense music)

1656
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:40,665
(Evil Queen clapping)

1657
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:42,999
(Evil Queen laughing)
(soft tense music)

1658
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,374
Stupid little Princess!

1659
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:46,625
I am the Queen.

1660
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,375
Now give me your heart.

1661
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:53,375
(gentle tense music)

1662
01:34:54,541 --> 01:34:56,290
You have my promise.

1663
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:58,000
Just do it already!

1664
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:00,666
My Queen.

1665
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:02,874
(dagger thudding)

1666
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:03,750
No!

1667
01:35:03,751 --> 01:35:05,749
(soft haunting music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1668
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:08,124
(gasping) Yes.

1669
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:09,125
Yes.

1670
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,750
Bring it to me.

1671
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,749
Bring it to me now.

1672
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:19,750
(soft haunting music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1673
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:29,666
(soft haunting music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1674
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:35,749
It is still warm.

1675
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:40,750
(soft haunting music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1676
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,625
(soft tense music)

1677
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:56,500
(soft tense music continues)

1678
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,874
(soft ominous music)

1679
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:06,790
(Evil Queen screaming)

1680
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,290
(soft tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1681
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:12,665
(magic whooshing)
(glass shattering)

1682
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:17,666
(soft tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1683
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:27,000
(soft orchestral music)

1684
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:37,250
(witch reciting spell in Latin)

1685
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,291
You will die today, Snow White!

1686
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:45,749
And I will steal
your last breath!

1687
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:50,750
(dramatic orchestral
music) (magic whooshing)

1688
01:36:55,916 --> 01:36:58,374
Enough! (reciting
spell in Latin)

1689
01:36:58,375 --> 01:37:01,249
(magic whooshing)

1690
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:06,250
(soft tense music)
(singers vocalizing eerily)

1691
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:13,499
(Evil Queen groaning)

1692
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,749
You know what I'm thinking?

1693
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,125
Aye, I do.

1694
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,875
Let's kill this fucking witch.

1695
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:21,874
I'll allow it.

1696
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:26,875
(dramatic orchestral music)
(Evil Queen groaning)

1697
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:36,625
(dramatic orchestral music)
(Evil Queen groaning)

1698
01:37:37,375 --> 01:37:38,375
Oi, cunt,

1699
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,500
just so you know,
we call this one

1700
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:43,791
the butterfly.

1701
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:47,249
(ax thudding) (flesh ripping)

1702
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:52,250
(soft tense orchestral
music) (Evil Queen groaning)

1703
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:01,624
(soft tense orchestral
music) (Evil Queen groaning)

1704
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,625
Help me.

1705
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:05,875
Help me, Princess.

1706
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:10,124
Mercy. (groaning)

1707
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:13,500
Show me mer-mercy. (groaning)

1708
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:24,249
[Mirror Demons] Look at you,
you are ugly, vile and aged.

1709
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,665
Look what you truly are.

1710
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:27,915
(sobbing) Please help me.

1711
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:29,540
[Mirror Demons] You
have never compared

1712
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:31,540
to the beauty of others.

1713
01:38:31,541 --> 01:38:33,374
You will never
find beauty again.

1714
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:34,916
I would sacrifice

1715
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,124
all I have

1716
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:37,916
for all I love.

1717
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:39,749
[Mirror Demons] You are ugly.

1718
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,999
[Snow White] Even with
all that you've done.

1719
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,124
-Vile.
-To my mother,

1720
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:45,250
to my friends,

1721
01:38:46,375 --> 01:38:49,999
I would give it all
for you to feel peace.

1722
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,625
Your mother's sacrifice
was wasted on you.

1723
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:58,499
The world sees your beauty
and it means nothing to you.

1724
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,624
[Mirror Demons] You
are hated by all.

1725
01:39:00,625 --> 01:39:03,040
But everything I see about you

1726
01:39:03,041 --> 01:39:04,125
is vile,

1727
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:05,916
ugly.

1728
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:10,249
(heart beating) (soft
orchestral music)

1729
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:12,249
And I used to think

1730
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,540
that you

1731
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:16,624
were the fairest
woman in the world.

1732
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:19,540
(heart beating) (soft
orchestral music)

1733
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:23,915
You cannot say that, take
it back, you little whore.

1734
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:24,875
Take it back.

1735
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:27,290
[Mirror Demons] Snow White
has always been the fairest.

1736
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,415
You will never
find beauty again.

1737
01:39:29,416 --> 01:39:32,665
(Evil Queen sobbing)
You are disgusting.

1738
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,165
It is your time to die

1739
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:36,499
and your people will
revel in your death.

1740
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,540
I'm not supposed to die.

1741
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:40,499
Snow White is supposed to die.

1742
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,874
[Mirror Demons] You
have never compared

1743
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:44,875
to the beauty of others.

1744
01:39:46,375 --> 01:39:47,166
No!

1745
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:50,124
[Mirror Demons] So look
at you, look at yourself.

1746
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:53,415
You are absolutely disgusting.

1747
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:58,374
You'll continue to watch
in this life and the next,

1748
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:00,749
and everyone will celebrate.

1749
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,165
(heart beating) (soft
orchestral music)

1750
01:40:03,166 --> 01:40:05,250
I am sorry for your pain.

1751
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:09,915
[Mirror Demons] Watch
as the flesh rots away

1752
01:40:09,916 --> 01:40:12,165
and falls from your bones.

1753
01:40:12,166 --> 01:40:13,499
You disgrace.
-No!

1754
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,165
[Mirror Demons] You have
never been anything.

1755
01:40:16,166 --> 01:40:17,624
Shut up, shut up!

1756
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:20,540
(tense melodic music)
(Mirror Demons laughing)

1757
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:23,290
Don't say all
that, take it back.

1758
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:28,291
(tense melodic music)
(Mirror Demons laughing)

1759
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:31,749
(blood dripping)

1760
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:36,750
(dramatic orchestral music)
(Mirror Demons laughing)

1761
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:46,666
(dramatic orchestral music)
(Mirror Demons laughing)

1762
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:56,541
(soft orchestral music)
(Mirror Demons laughing)

1763
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:01,541
(soft orchestral music)

1764
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:12,375
(soft orchestral
music continues)

1765
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,540
(Gerald laughing)
(villagers cheering)

1766
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:21,165
Our Princess of the People.

1767
01:41:21,166 --> 01:41:23,499
Now, the true Queen.

1768
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,540
(Pollen sneezing)

1769
01:41:25,541 --> 01:41:27,415
Oh, my friends.

1770
01:41:27,416 --> 01:41:30,249
Oh, it warms my heart
that you all are here.

1771
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,124
The flowers are beautiful.

1772
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:34,165
Oh, it was our pleasure.

1773
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:35,790
The dress is heavenly.

1774
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:37,499
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

1775
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,499
Your performance
was spectacular.

1776
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,165
Role of a lifetime.

1777
01:41:41,166 --> 01:41:44,874
And I have never felt more
safe than with you by my side.

1778
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:46,374
'Twas an honor.

1779
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:49,249
It is good to be back in
the kingdom, my Queen.

1780
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,749
Oh, please, you do not
need to call me that.

1781
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,249
Call her what?

1782
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,250
My Queen.

1783
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,249
-But she is the Queen.
-Don't start that again.

1784
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:00,249
Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm,
I'm grateful you're here.

1785
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:01,915
As are we.

1786
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:04,874
I know that our Lord
would be so proud.

1787
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,624
It's Florizel.

1788
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:07,999
Well, thank you both.

1789
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,415
Are you sure you
won't reconsider

1790
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:10,999
being a part of my council?

1791
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,540
Oh, heavens, no, I'm
too smart for politics.

1792
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:17,749
And besides,
writing is our life.

1793
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:20,499
In fact, Jacob and I
have started a story

1794
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:24,750
about these very events
titled, "Schneeviechen!"

1795
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:29,165
We are still
work-shopping that title.

1796
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:31,499
Well, I'm sure it
will be lovely.

1797
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,374
Thank you all again for coming.

1798
