00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,074
And really,
I should've thanked you much sooner.

513
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,744
About my bag. [chuckles]

514
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,788
Thank you for returning it to me.

515
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,458
I'm really glad that I got the chance
to see you again, A-ri.

516
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,378
Let's do it again, shall we?

517
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,174
[woman] Excuse me, Ms. Yoon.
There's a call for you.

518
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,134
[Si-hyeon] Oh.

519
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,471
Yes, how are you?

520
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,516
[chuckles] Thank you for giving me a call.

521
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,187
[girl 1 panting] You're Seo A-ri, right?

522
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,399
-Yeah.
-I saw you on Min-hye's livestream.

523
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,151
I started following you after that.

524
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,737
Oh, thanks so much.

525
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,321
-She's Min-hye's friend?
-Yeah!

526
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,450
Oh my God, that makes so much sense.
Your sense of style is amazing.

527
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,326
[girl 1] So what brand do you have on now?

528
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,875
It's just some cheap nameless brand.
I got it at the Jepyung Shopping Center.

529
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,460
-[girl 1] Oh!
-[girl 2] Wow!

530
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,253
They do say one's appearance
makes the look.

531
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,880
I thought they were designer clothes.

532
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,215
Yeah, me too. Where is Jepyung located?

533
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,260
[girl 1] I mean, cheap is still cool.
Please tell me where too.

534
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,220
This is how I want to dress.

535
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,972
So cute. Love it!

536
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,141
[Min-hye chuckles]

537
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,060
-Can you believe it? I really love this!
-[girl 2 chuckles]

538
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,063
My A-ri is so stylish, isn't she?

539
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,233
It's so hard hanging out
with someone so much prettier than me,

540
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,236
but I just can't resist. [chuckles]
She's my friend, and I love her!

541
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,322
-[girl 1] Oh!
-[girl 2] Wow.

542
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,948
Min-hye, you're really loyal.

543
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,409
-I mean, most people would get so jealous.
-[chuckles]

544
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,244
-[girl 1] Can we take a photo?
-[Min-hye] Of course.

545
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,413
-[girl 1] Thank you.
-[girl 2] Thank you so much.

546
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,373
-Cheese!
-[camera shutter clicks]

547
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,668
-Yeah, another one. And another.
-[camera shutter clicking]

548
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,087
-[man] In three, two, one.
-[Min-hye chuckles]

550
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:01,925

-Three, two…

00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,638
-[man] All right, that's it.
-[Min-hye sighs]

553
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,224
I'm gonna go ahead.
I have another appointment.

554
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,642
[Ji-na] Yeah, me too.

555
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,853
[Si-hyeon] Before everyone goes,
there's a charity bazaar this weekend.

556
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,104
I'm sure you remember?

557
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,440
Of course we do. It's you hosting.

558
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,861
I spent four days trying to pick out
some of the best items for you.

559
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,073
I'm so honored
that you gave us some time today.

560
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,324
It's no problem.

561
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,284
Then…

562
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,288
Let's go.

563
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,290
-See you! Bye!
-[Chae-hee] We're off.

564
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,416
[Yu-rang] I'll go on ahead.

565
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,293
-[Min-hye] Okay, thanks.
-[Yu-rang] All right.

566
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,462
[Min-hye] You see this? [sighs]

567
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,755
[indistinct chatter]

568
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,550
[Min-hye scoffs]
Not there. Start from the inside.

569
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,010
[Min-hye scoffs]

570
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,429
You did a great job today.

571
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,723
One might've mistaken today
was all about you.

572
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,892
What's the deal?
You were the last to arrive.

573
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,729
Go down to the parking garage.
You can help them sort out my inventory.

574
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,274
-What?
-[Min-hye] Hey!

575
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,651
Don't hold it like that,
or you'll break it.

576
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,610
Ugh!

577
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,155
What? Go to the parking garage.

578
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,492
No, don't do it like that.

-[Yu-rang exhales]
-So what's all this?

582
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,968
They're presents for Min-hye.

583
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,136
From her followers.

584
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,806
They bring her gifts
while they're here to buy her products?

585
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,101
Of course, if it means
they can see Min-hye in the flesh.

586
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,186
And I mean,
the whole Gabin Society was here today.

587
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,396
It's an honor to be invited.

588
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,523
An honor? Really?

Don't just stand there and watch.
Please help. This is exhausting as hell.

Sure.

You know what
this charity bazaar is, right?

626
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,923
Lots of rich people, influencers,
celebrities all selling their things.

627
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,176
A crap ton of luxury items,
everything's dirt cheap,

628
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,886
and you can't get in without an invite.

00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,430
You're right. Who would've thought
something like this was real?

It's a bazaar.
They're bound to have all sorts of stuff.

That's why you're invited.

Their PR team contributed
quite a large sum.

Well, he should've showed up as well.

After all, it's good publicity.

I'm sure he's busy.
He did more than enough.

See you at home.

00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,404
Hmm. That was my mother.

653
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,615
She didn't believe me
when I said I was with the police.

Uh, yeah. [inhales]

00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,998
Excuse me,
why did you come here in person?

657
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,754
I mean, I'm sure you have,
well, plenty of lawyers at your disposal.

658
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,174
It's because of that woman. Ms. Seo A-ri.

659
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:40,096
The cross-examination's today, right?
So that's why I'm here. For my accuser.

660
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,014
Oh, that's too bad.

661
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,933
I'm afraid you've come
all this way for nothing.

662
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,352
This case is for sexual harassment.

663
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,356
For such incidents, we forgo them
if the victim doesn't want one.

664
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,442
And Ms. Seo decided
to submit a statement instead.

Min-hye told me to get here by five.

679
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,856
We should hurry up.

680
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,816
[Si-hyeon] Thank you for coming.

681
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,902
It was my pleasure. Good luck.

682
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,238
A-ri, hi.

683
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,282
[gasps] Good to see you.

684
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,869
Did I get the time wrong?
Isn't it supposed to start at five?

685
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,205
-Uh…
-[A-ir] That's what Min-hye told me.

686
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,999
I need to get my stuff
and be here by five to set up.

687
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:54,003
Is that why you also decided
to bring all of your things with?

688
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,088
Did we get here too late?

689
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,008
-Is it okay if we go in?
-Hey!

690
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,762
It was so hard
to drag this all the way! Ugh!

691
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,805
Huh?

692
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,557
[exhales] Come on in.

693
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,893
I'm sure there's enough room
for your things.

Whoa! [exhales]

698
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:26,285
This is crazy. I'm losing my mind.
It's so cool! [gasps]

[gasps] Whoa!

703
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,462
It's a total designer fest in here.
Seriously!

704

-[Si-hyeon] Please take your time.
-[woman] Thanks for having me. Thank you.

practically every brand here.

[Jeong-sun gasps]

707
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,060
Unbelievable.

708
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,897
Uh, hold on Ms. Lee.
I'm gonna make some room for her here.

709
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,232
[Ms. Lee] Of course, ma'am.

710
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,442

Jeong-sun, hey, just hold on.

713
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,693
Si-hyeon,

714
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,279
I think that maybe we should just go.

715
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,031
Oh no. Really, it's all right, A-ri.

716
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,741
[Min-hye] Seo A-ri?

717
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,788
[scoffs] What are you doing?

[scoffs]

719
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,296
Ugh, did you really think
I was asking you to take part

720
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,922
when I said be here by five?

721
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,092
Hey, I was telling you what time
you had to be here for cleanup.

722
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,469
You really don't belong here.

723
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,432
Those her cheap off-brands?

724
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,976
I mean, it sure is different.

725
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,729
-How much do these cost?
-[Min-hye chuckles]

726
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,938
[chuckles]

727
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,358
[Yu-rang] A-ri, look.

728
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,111
There's only designer brands sold here.
Your stuff will be out of place.

729
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,322
That's wrong.
Any personal items are allowed here.

730
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,033
-That's the point of our event.
-[Chae-hee] Si-hyeon!

731
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,911
Ignoring her level, sure,
but can't we keep things classy?

732
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,371
This is just embarrassing.

733
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,289
How would this make us look?

734
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,665
Chae-hee, that's enough.

735
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:40,795
Whoa, aren't you… aren't you all
taking this a bit too far right now?

736
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,755
There's more
than just cheap off-brands here.

737
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,924
-There's also the bag A-ri used to wear--
-Stop it.

738
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,553
Stop it. Let's go.

739
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,391
-Why? We haven't even looked--
-Didn't you hear me?

740
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,518
I said, "Let's go."

[indistinct chatter]

742
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,438
I'm sorry that I caused you
so much trouble.

743
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,150

00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,299
[Min-hye] Oh my God.

749
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,553
What did she think was going to happen?
This is so embarrassing.

Been wondering where you were
after you ignored me.

753
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,912
You chose to do this instead?

754
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,505
Si-hyeon, that's Jun-kyoung, isn't it?

755
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,673
[gasps]

756
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,807
Looks like you're in need of some help.

757
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,517
Or are you good?

[Min-hye grunts]

759

Han Jun-kyoung?

760

The Yugang heir and Hue Cosmetics CEO?

761
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,832
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

762
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,251
But how does someone like that know her?

763
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,046
There's no way.
Even I've never met him before.

764
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:47,963
Ugh!

765
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,052
That was incredible!
So unbelievably freaking incredible!

766
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,887
Since when do you know Han Jun-kyoung?
Huh?

767
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,641
Come on, say something.
You are absolutely killing me.

768
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,684

[sniffles]

770
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,863
Mr. Han asked me to give you a ride home.

-So where can I take you?
-[inhales] Oh God.

[Jeong-sun exhales]

773
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,790
So tell me. Where did you meet her?

774
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,835
Come on. Like, how exactly
does Seo A-ri meet someone like you?

775
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,920
Wine, maybe?

776
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,217
[Chae-hee scoffs]
Don't change the subject.

777

Come on, start talking!

778

[Jun-kyoung] It has.

783
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,201
You've gotten prettier.

784
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,080
Si-hyeon, did you know about this?

785
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,291
That Jun-kyung and A-ri
somehow know each other?

he was gonna get to see her.

To send you that DM,
I had to make an account for myself.

Through your feed,

793

848
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,640
You think she and I were close?

849
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:14,271
[chuckles] Fine, ask me whatever you want.
I have nothing to hide.

850
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:15,689
Seo A-ri?

851
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,316
Yeah, I knew her very well.

852
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,735
She was an absolute bitch.

853
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,613
She was vain, seething with jealousy,
and willing to do anything.

854
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,199
Min-hye, what's gotten into you?
That's enough. Stop!

855
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,617
Let go! You know I'm right!

856
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,536
She made everyone around her miserable!

857
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,080
How is Seo A-ri streaming if she's dead?

858
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,499
I have no idea!

859
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,669
All I know is everything out of her mouth
is a lie and manipulation.

860
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:42,090
She was as asshole who stepped on anyone
who got in her way, no matter the cost!

861
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,051
Ugh!

862
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,762
You're right.

863
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,473
Maybe I did that. But you're one to talk.

864
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,727
I mean, there was that one instance.
The infamous flame wars.

865
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,188
Instigated by Seo A-ri.

866
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,108
The post I put up at that night…
You know the one.

867
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,444
…rocked social media to its core.

-What?

870
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,959
My phone! Where's my goddamn phone?!

873
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,431
Seo A-ri, this fucking bitch.
What's she trying to pull here?

874
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,475
[A-ri] Everyone listen.

875
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,811
-I hate getting likes.

876
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:39,439
"You're so pretty. You're my role model.
You're like a princess."

877
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,649
Stop that.

878
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,234
I don't need you…

879
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,653
to say those things to me.

880
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,363
Unlike another group,

881
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,658
you all know
I don't need an army to protect me.

882
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,286
Now, I'd like to ask you all a question.

883
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,330
Why do you volunteer
to be someone's lackey?

884
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,500
Just what makes us so special?

885
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,085
What is it we have that you don't?

886

[keypad clicking]

887
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,213
I'm sorry, but I'm not interested.

888
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:09,094
So, please, save it for the princesses
who are desperate for your attention.

JUST SAY THANK YOU.
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

895
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,791
SHE'S CLEARLY ATTACKING GABIN SOCIETY
CRAZY FOR ATTENTION

896
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,184
WHAT THE HELL'S SHE SAYING?
