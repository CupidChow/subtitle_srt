00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,010
The surgery was successful.

346
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,096

We just need to monitor his recovery.

347

Oh, you're here.

Are you going to be heading home now?

351
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,322
Yes, I just wanted to meet his doctor
before going home.

352
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,991
I appreciate your help.

353
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,244
Ah, don't mention it.

Now go ahead.

Oh, Seo A-ri. Is that the lady's name?

356
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,675
-What?
-I saw her. She was here just now.

357
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,969
She said she wanted to see Jun-kyoung,
so I let her.

358
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,971
A-ri was here, you said?

What were you about to do just now?

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,320
I just… I can't.

367
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,199
I can't take it anymore.

368
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,369
This is all too much for me.

369
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,790
You should just leave me to die
since that's what I deserve.

370
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,252
It's my fault this is happening.
I'm the one who has to face it.

371
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,006
This is all so wrong, Si-hyeon.

Every choice I made.

373
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,636
Because my mistakes
are ruining other people's lives.

374
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,846
A-ri, listen.

375
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,599
All those things
that people say about me are true.

376
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,518
"I'm a loser." "I don't know
what I'm doing." "I don't deserve…

377
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,230
to live." I wish I listened.

378
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,816
That's just the reality.

[A-ri whimpers]

380
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,196
Yes, it's true.

381
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,074
You are to blame
for everything that's happened to you.

382
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,575
They're the consequences

383
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,660
of the choices you made.

384
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,122
But that's applies to me too.

385
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,333
And it applies to Jun-kyoung.

386
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,295
And are you to blame
for what happens to us?

387
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,382
Listen to me, please.

388
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,092
You must stay strong.

389
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,886
A-ri, you must keep going
for Jun-kyoung and me too.

391
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,147
[A-ri] Every choice in this world
has consequences.

392
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,065
But

393
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,402
most people live their lives
oblivious to this fact.

394
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,444
Scratch that.

395
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,407
Most people
wouldn't even try to understand.

396
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,869
It's easier to be blissfully ignorant
of the wreckage we leave behind.

397
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,541
But, you know, we all need
to be more aware of our actions.

398
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,919
And we need to know
we can't escape the consequences.

399
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,921
We all have a price to pay
for the choices we make

400
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,464
no matter what our intentions.

401
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,674
Don't try to avoid it.

402
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,759

to the drug incident in Mr. Kim's death?

-[reporter 5] We'd like a word--
-Listen, everyone!

410
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,199
These claims are lies.
They're pure fiction.

411
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,327
The truth will ultimately be revealed,

412

no matter how hard
some people are trying to hide it.

413

Did you bring the passport?

Yeah, I brought it, but…

It's not true, is it?
It's all made up, right, honey?

419
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,605
There's no way you could do
something like this right?

You did hire me first, Mr. Han.

512
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,466
[phone buzzes]

513
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,144
[A-ri] Si-hyeon, it's me.

514
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,146
Seo A-ri.

515
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,689
A-ri…

516
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,363
[tires screech]

517
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,051
[tires screech]

518
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,686
A-ri.

519
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,104
A-ri!

520
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,774
Hey, A-ri!

521
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,028
A-ri, it's me. Open up!

522
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,571
It's true that

523
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,366
the reason I started this livestream

524
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,701
was so I could become infamous.

525
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,997
[siren wailing]

526
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,375
[Jang] Hey, Hwang Yong-tae!

527
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,252
What?

528
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,045
[dramatic music playing]

529
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,046
[tires screech]

530
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,214
[Yong-tae] What is this?

531
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,383
[A-ri] That's just
the kind of world we live in.

532
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,551
Where's Seo A-ri?

533
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,594
Where is Seo A-ri?

534
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,889
A world where just one small voice
can become powerful,

535
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,934
and some will use that power
to crush people.

536
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,728
People have power through authority
or because of their name.

537
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,355
-And sometimes…
-[Jun-kyoung] A-ri!

538
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,816
…anonymity.

539
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,697
I chose to use what I learned
to become famous.

540
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,910
I had to get power because

541
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,663
there are things I need to do.

542
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,211
[Jun-kyoung breathing heavily]

543
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,259
You wonder what I'm about to do, right?

544
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,845
[continues breathing shakily]

545
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,014
Aren't you just dying to find out?

546
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,099
A-ri.

547
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,287
[dramatic music playing]

548
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,503
How are you

549
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,756
doing this?

550
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,764
[distorted] Just you wait.

551
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,642
I promise I won't let you all down.

552
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,437
I want you all to bear witness

553
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,732
to the conclusion
of this scandalous, glamorous

554
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,151
little tale.

555
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,129
YOON SI-HYEON

556
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:53,262
[line ringing]

557
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,102
It's me, Seo A-ri.

558
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,023
I called
because I need to tell you something.

559
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,527
Because I…

560
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,615
I never thought
that I would end up going down like this.

561
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,995
I just wanted everyone to pay
for what they've done.

562
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,999
A-ri, don't do this.
Please just listen to me first.

563
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,585
[A-ri] But for that to happen,
I have to pay for what I've done too.

564
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,006
This isn't the right way to handle this.

565
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,091
A-ri, you're not the one
at fault here, okay?

566
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,844
You're wrong. I share the blame for this.

567
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,389
I couldn't stop myself.
All I wanted was power, to be on top.

568
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,641
I think I would've done
anything just to get there.

569
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,684
A-ri…

570
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,063
I just need to make sure people
are talking about me one last time.

571
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,567
I need to be famous enough,
powerful enough

572
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,819
to make everyone pay
for what they've done.

573
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,903
A-ri, wait!

574
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,363
A-ri!

575
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,371
