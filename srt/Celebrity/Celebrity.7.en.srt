00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,847
[whooshes]

174
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,725
[keypad continues clicking]

175
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,685
[whooshes]

176
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,771
Oh my God! That is awesome!

177
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,524
How did you come up with a plan
to use Hwang Yu-ri?

178
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,694
Why do it myself when I can
have others get rid of the bitch?

179
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,572
She would've gone belly-up
with a slight nudge anyways.

180
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,949
You really are the brains
of our operation.

181
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,534
Tell me all the details right now.

182
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,620
[sucks teeth]
Maybe later, while we're shopping.

183
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,414
[gasps] Since we're in a good mood,

184
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,541
we should spend
at least 20 million, right?

185
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,544
I'm going to max out my credit card
and buy everything!

186
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,337
Let's spend enough to buy a Benz.

187
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,797
Wouldn't be the first time.

188
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,715
[exhales]

189
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,343
I should really get in touch
with my salesgirl at Chanel.

190
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,469
[exclaims joyfully]

191
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,847
[inhales] Let's calm down.

192
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,141
We might get in trouble
for being extravagant.

193
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,310
God, what do you mean?

194
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,562
We just envy you.

195
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,189
-Can you go a bit harder?
-[masseuse] Okay.

196
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,191
-[whooshes]
-[dramatic music playing]

197
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,320
You saw, right?
Seo A-ri's been wiped off the map.

198
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,739
I never get tired of seeing it.
It's just so satisfying.

199
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:18,075
"Right back"? She wishes.
She's such a hot mess now.

200
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,246
She's not the first to drop off the face
of the earth after a public shaming.

201
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,457
[both laughing]

202
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,876
SORRY, WE WILL BE BACK
AFTER A BRIEF REORGANIZATION

203
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,086
Your shoulders are a bit tight.

204
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,422
Why wouldn't they be?

205
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,467
With how stressed I've been,
I'm sure they're hard as rocks.

206
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,845
We have to apply your face mask now,
so let me hold onto your phone for you.

207
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,888
[Angela] Mm-hmm.

208
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,807
[Angela sighs]

209
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,817
Then you have no idea
where A-ri is either, Min-hye?

210
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,819
The thing is,

211
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,490
A-ri's always been flaky
and never takes any responsibility.

212
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,824
Even in high school.

213
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,786
She would stir up trouble then disappear.

214
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,579
So she's got me worried too.

215
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,247
-[Min-hye sighs]
-Who is it?

216
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,999
Yoon Si-hyeon.

217
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,836
All right, Si-hyeon. Have a nice day.

218
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,840
[scoffs] For real?
Why the fuck would Si-hyeon care?

219
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,426
I heard that A-ri's totally ruined.

220
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,303
Besta Room marked A-ri's items
as exclusive,

221
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,347
which completely shut down Ari&.

222
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,392
She fucked with the wrong people.
It's her Karma.

223
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,228
-I think Si-hyeon's such a nice person.
-[scoffs]

224
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,814
She seems to be the only one
that's worried about A-ri.

225
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,565
Hey, you think
that makes her a nice person?

226
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,735
She's pretending to be
all magnanimous and honorable.

227
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,945
A-ri's the worst,

228
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,197
but Yoon Si-hyeon
really gets on my nerves.

229
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,825
-Don't you agree?
-Well, yeah, I guess so.

230
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,952
And never mind.
What were you talking about earlier?

231
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,371
-You think your husband's cheating on you?
-Oh, right.

232
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,249
Min-hye, he's been acting so weird.

233
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,293
I mean, he left in the middle of the night
saying he had an emergency.

234
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,797
-Since then, he barely comes home.
-He's a doctor. These things happen.

235
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,008
He's a plastic surgeon.
What's an emergency for him?

236
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,178
-Just ask him who his patient is.
-Ugh, seriously.

237
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,473
Hold on. [gasps]

238
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,767
The person who called him that night
was Tae-jeon.

239
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,562
-Hmm? Jin Tae-jeon?
-Yup.

240
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,897
They went to the same school,
so they're kind of friends.

241
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,859
That night,
my husband got a call from Tae-jeon

242
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,278
and just rushed out
in the middle of the night.

243
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,865
[exhales] Huh.

244
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,578
So no one knows where she is?

245
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,331
I tried contacting her.
I couldn't track her down.

246
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,127
They've tried sending DMs
to A-ri's friends multiple times,

247
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,378
but she hasn't answered yet.

248
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,966
Well, that makes sense
if her company doesn't know where she is.

249
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,344
Okay.

250
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,055
Thanks a lot for looking into this.

251
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,476
You must be really worried.

252
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,939
Because A-ri just happened
to disappear into thin air.

253
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,193
You're wondering where she is,
what she's up to, whether she's all right.

254
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,112
When I see you like this,

255
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,614
it makes me wonder

256
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,283
whether this is how you reacted…

257
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,789
back when you thought that I just up
and left you without any reason.

258
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,707
[pensive music playing]

259
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,169
[exhales]

260
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,840
So… do you have something to say to me?

261
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,886
You said something like that before.
Something strange.

262
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,930
You asked whether I thought you left me.

263
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,682
What did you mean by that?

264
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,059
[exhales]

265
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,063
Tell me, Si-hyeon.
What did you really mean by that?

266
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,898
It doesn't matter anymore.

267
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,153
[tender music playing]

268
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,197
What you should've known then,
you should've known then.

269
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,617
What should've been said,
should've been said then.

270
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,618
But now

271
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,163
you don't need to know
or say anything more, Jun-kyoung.

272
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,123
[sighs]

273
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,378
I have a meeting to get to.
Please leave now.

274
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,883
By the way, I'll keep looking for A-ri.

275
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,177
I'll tell you if I manage to find her.

276
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,806

Hello! It's Angela.

283
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,196
What's up?

284
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,033
I'm a lot prettier in person, you know.

285
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,826
Where are you?

00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,505
I have a lot of Balmain too.

291

When will I be invited? [sucks teeth]

293
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,636
[gasps] Oh no!

294
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,641
-What are you doing home so early?
-Just freshening up.

295
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,269
You went shopping?

296
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,981
I bought this with my own money
I made from an event.

297
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,650
Good work.

298
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,527
Day in, day out with that nonsense
while I work myself to the bone.

299
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,488
It's not nonsense.

-Hello.

-Oh, hello.
-Good to see you.

319
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,435
Talk to you later then.

320
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:24,937
You're here?

321
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,689
Look at you, Chae-hee!
Head to toe Balmain!

322
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,358
Chae-hee's bossy, you know.

323
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,652
That's why Balmain fits her
like a second skin.

-[Min-hye chuckles]
-Where's Angela?

325
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,614
I don't know.
She couldn't come because of a cold.

326
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,826
That's odd. She wouldn't miss a show
even if her appendix burst.

327
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,577
This is a Balmain show.

328
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,495
That's right.

329
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,501
Oh, Si-hyeon's here. Over here!

-Yes.

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,490

seating rows by rank. [sucks teeth]

What's with that empty seat?
It's almost time to start.

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,043
Oh, that must be Angela's seat.

she finally snagged the front row

00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,405
They're all good ones. It's insane.

516
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,741
[A-ri] That's right.
That was all part of my plan.

517
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,743
I needed to befriend
a top-tier fashionista

518
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,746
who happened to have
a whopping 4.5 million followers.

519
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,166
The muse for all the best designers,
Choi Bom.

520
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,046
[pensive music playing]

521
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,466
[keyboard clicking]

522
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,054
If I could meet her somehow…

523
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,686
[inspiring music playing]

524
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,898
And if I could somehow catch her eye…

525
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,609
[A-ri] The clothes Choi Bom was wearing
in those photo I sent you,

526
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,527
I need all of them.

527
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,695
[A-ri] And If I could

528
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,364
get mentioned on her feed,

529
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:12,370
a dazzling 4.5 million followers
would see me and know who I was.

530
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,913
[sewing machines whirring]

531
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,712
Now, let's hurry it along, okay?

532
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,964
-Pick up the pace. We don't have time.
-[man 1] Yes, sir.

533
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,048
[man 2] Yes, sir!

534
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,636
Are you really sure it will be all right
making this many in advance?

535
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,555
What if they don't sell, though?

536
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,224
Just you watch.
This is going to be something huge.

537
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,603
[A-ri] Do you remember?

538
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,106
The first cheat code of this world
that I told you about.

539
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,151
Become famous.

540
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,820
Approach a celebrity.

541
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,115
Borrow their power.

542
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,701
Become their

543
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,453
parasite.

544
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497
[upbeat music playing]

545
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,415
[chimes]

546
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,421
Mom, the orders just won't stop.

547
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,590
[Mrs. A-ri chuckles]

548
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,883
Take a look at this.

549
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,551
-Huh?
-[chiming]

550
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,928
Just how much is this?

551
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:13,264
-One, ten, a hundred… [gasps]
-Hundred thousand.

552
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,851
[both laughing]

553
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,689
[chimes]

554
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,442
[A-ri] Can you believe it?

555
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,695
To think that achieving success like this
is possible.

556
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,366
Do you feel like you hit the jackpot
with the recent launching of your brand?

557
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,953
I think we owe our success more
to Choi Bom's support than my talent.

558
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,996
We got really lucky to catch her eye.

559
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,874
Hmm, but Choi Bom
isn't someone who endorses a product

560
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,418
through advertisements
or sponsorship deals.

561
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,254
That means you owe your success
to your great talent alone.

562
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,340
I heard you had a hand
in designing the brand.

563
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,385
It's a brand that definitely represents
my taste and style,

564
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,971
so I'm very involved
in the design process.

565
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,597
[A-ri] But it was true.

566
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,432
That was how things worked here.

567
00:32:56,516 --> 00:33:00,061
If I wanted to be successful
and level up in this world,

568
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,189
I had to use
every cheat code at my disposal.

569
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,112
Okay, so what is this, then?

570
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,156
A collaboration proposal
that marketing received.

571
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,908
I thought you should take a look, sir.

572
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,662
It's from Ari.&.

573
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,624
And they requested a meeting with you.

574
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,353
[drink continues pouring]

575
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,815
[maid] Oh no. Ma'am!

576
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,025
Oh!

577
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,526
-What's wrong?
-I'm so sorry.

578
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,986
Are you all right, ma'am?

579
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,280
Oh, I just spaced out for a…

580
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,157
I should get a towel for this.

581
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,160
-[sighs]
-[door shuts]

582
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,829
[Chae-hee] Si-hyeon,
I will never accept this.

583
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,416
I will not allow Seo A-ri
to do whatever she wants,

584
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,625
even if it kills me!

585
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:08,254
You saw how arrogant Seo A-ri was
at the show. You saw it for yourself.

586
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,548
Si-hyeon, are you listening to me?

587
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,133
Seo A-ri, that bitch--

588
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,343
Stop! Chae-hee, please just stop it!

589
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,930
Please stop saying A-ri's name
in front of me.

590
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,515
Please stop.

591
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,059
[breathes deeply]

592
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,268
[Chae-hee] Si-hyeon?

593
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,522
-[pensive music playing]
-[Si-hyeon continues breathing heavily]

594
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,316
[phone buzzing]

595
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,195
DR. KIM MIN-CHAN

596
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,657
Hello?

597
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,868
I'm home right now.
I can't really talk--

598
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,912
What?

599
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,769
Our company has designed cosmetics
alongside the fashion line.

600
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,402
These are sheet masks
that I used to wear and sell myself.

601
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,862
They're quality goods.

602
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,865
I can supply as many as we need
to keep up with the demand.

603
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,953
And I came here to see
whether a collaboration with The Hue

604
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,579
would be at all possible.

605
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,044
Uh…

606
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,548
We're a small brand that's just launched.

607
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,302
And I'm truly grateful
that the CEO himself would meet with me.

608
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,727
So, you look well.

609
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,479
I was so worried.

610
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,570
Let's wrap up.

611
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:01,159
-Uh, Mr. Han, we still have things to--
-What more is there to discuss, though?

612
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,913
Do you really think
that I would turn down this collaboration

613
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,540
when you're proposing it?

614
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,544
[gentle music playing]

615
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,838
[A-ri] That word.

616
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,884
Infatuation.

617
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,307
[A-ri] Whatever it is,

618
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,976
it's as if you're possessed.

619
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,978
One's mind is captivated…

620
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,606
[inhales deeply]

621
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,442
…making you lose all rational thoughts.

[breathing heavily]

623
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,113
Thirty volts! [breathing heavily]

[sighs]

630
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,879
[Tae-jeon] I told you to keep him alive.
That's all I asked.

631
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,384
You prick.
That's all I said you had to do, right?

632
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,302
[A-ri] Back then,

633
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,263
everyone was possessed.

634
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,934
Please go over the proposal first.

635
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,393
You can give me an answer later--

636
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,686
I've gone over it all.

637
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,188
Your proposal.

638
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,941
And you, Miss Seo A-ri.

[Jun-kyoung exhales]

640
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,238
Now then,

641
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,532
I'd like to know your thoughts, A-ri.

642
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,372
Do you still not want
to spend time with me at all?

[pensive music playing]

644
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,089
Sorry, this is how I do things.

645
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,008
So it won't matter if you turn me down.

646
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,511
[pensive music continues]

647
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,933
[A-ri] When you're possessed like that…

648
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,270
no one

649
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,147
knows the moment,

650
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,483
what their choices may bring.
