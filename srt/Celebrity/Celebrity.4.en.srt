522
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,184
Contemporary marketing trends
prefer influencers

523
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,269
over traditional celebrities now.

524
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,855
The effects are instant, after all.

525
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,483
That's not the whole picture, though.

526
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,153
Aren't they given a rank
based on their public image?

527
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,154
[Seung-hyeok] Yes.

528
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,740
"How classy does the influencer seem
in the public eye?"

529
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,325
"What's their target demographic?"

530
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,369
All these things decide an e-celeb's rank.

531
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,746
Depending on rank,
some attendees will be paid

532
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,456
while others won't at today's launch.

533
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,668
I'd like to know
which ones belong to your company.

534
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,880
Yes, for the paid attendees,
there is makeup artist Risabae.

535
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,758
Nine hundred sixty-one thousand followers
and…

536
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,510
89K INFLUENCER SEO A-RI

537
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,471
Seo A-ri, with 89,000.

538
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,225
Her numbers may be low,
but she's provocative and is expanding.

539
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,852
We have high expectations for her.

[Tae-jeon] Oh, you're home.

545
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,630
I was about to head out.
There's an event today.

546
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,926
Oh, you're going to that, are you?
Jun-kyoung's big launch event thing.

547
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,553
Say hi for me.

548
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,595
I'll do that.

549
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,347
Oh.

550
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,434
Also, tell him to watch his step.

551
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,561
Seo A-ri.

552
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,146
Was that her name?

553
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,814
That new woman Jun-kyoung's been with.

555
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,692
How do you know about that gossip?

556
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,402
The rumor's is all over the place.

557
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:01,281
I heard he's going to make
a social media account for that woman.

558
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,368
[inhales] Uh, I heard he was sued recently
for sexual harassment.

559
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,245
And that woman was also Seo A-ri.

560
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,833
[inhales] Just tell him
to get a grip, and, uh,

561
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,877
find himself a proper woman,
why don't you?

562
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,795
We don't know how long he'll last,

563
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,089
but he has nothing to gain
from strange rumors.

564
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,261
You're an old friend of his,
so I suppose he'll listen to you, right?

565
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,597
[chuckles softly]

00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,836
Hello, it's your girl Ssinnim.

569
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,547
I'm here
at the Swiss Perfection event today,

570
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,257
and it's an absolute blast.

571
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,551
I haven't been to parties in a while.

572
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,553
They have perfumes…

Min-Hye, aren't you gonna come in?
The party's almost over.

576
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,088
Ugh, just stay here.
I can't go in until I see for myself.

[Min-hye] Hey, Seo A-ri.

581
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,491
[scoffs] What's up with that car?

582
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,285
Hue Cosmetics send it?

583
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,121
Is he paying for you or something?

584
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,122
Is that why?

585
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,001
If you're asking whether
I'm receiving payment for attending,

586
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,294
it's true. So what?

587
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,588
Hey, that doesn't make sense.

588
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,923
How come you're getting paid?
I'm not even getting paid.

589
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,509
-You're a nobody.
-Why are you asking me that?

590
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,469
-Go ask the person who--
-Han Jun-kyoung.

591
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,806
Is it true?

592
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,142
Those rumors that you're seeing him.

593
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,101
Those are real?

594
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,979
Answer me.

595
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,064
Did you come on to him?

596
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,900
Is that why
you're getting special treatment?

597
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:42,859
Min-hye,

598
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,694
it's my turn to ask you something.

599
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,905
Why would I even answer that?

600
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,114
[scoffs]

601
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,075
Shouldn't these conversations
be reserved for close friends?

602
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,870
I thought we were done
with the whole BFF act.

603
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,205

604

-Min-Hye--
-Let go.

Huh? Uh, Min-hye!

607
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,555
Uh, that's not the way.
The entrance is over here, Min-Hye!

608
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,563
[Ji-na] What? Seo A-ri?

609
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,357
It's all everyone's talking about.

610
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,818
Han Jun-kyoung made an account
and only followed Seo A-ri.

611
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,029
I heard she was being paid
to attend this event.

612
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,906
-[Ji-na scoffs]
-When she's under 100K.

Are you kidding me? Is that true?

614
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
Is it, Chae-hee?

615
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,912
You have to know something.
You're close to Han Jun-kyoung.

616
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,956
Shut up. That's all bullshit.

617
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,000
-I know. Jun-kyoung used to date--
-[woman] Oh my, Chae-hee.

Wow, Yeon-woo! It's been forever.

00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,549

You've just gotten prettier and younger.

-You should stay in touch more often.

00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,189
Is that really Seo A-ri?

628
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,609
It is.

00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,778
-Just hold on, be right back.

00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,620
I've seen you on TV.

Oh my. I've been dying to meet you.
To think I'd run into you like this here…

634
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,376
To meet me?

So nice to meet you.

your face is really petite.

Oh, I've been meaning to ask.
You have the prettiest feed ever.

639
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,432
Do you manage it alone,
or do you have someone do it for you?

640

but my friend…

She's up to renew her contract
with your company soon.

645
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,783
I think that's why she's doing that.

646
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,870
Because of all the rumors
that you're seeing A-ri.

647

She's a good person.

if it's a fling?

692
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,753
You think the rumors about them are true.

693
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,131
You think this bitch is a somebody.

694
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,758
Sucking up to her to extend your contract.

695
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,677
Fuck that shit!

696
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,054
I'm the one cutting ties with you, bitch.

697
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:26,475
You two will get along great,
seeing how you two started as nobodies.

698
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,603
[Yeon-woo] Hey, how dare you?

699
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,022
I'm Song Yeon-woo.
You think I'm gonna let this slide?

700
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,941
Two can play that game, yeah?

701
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,943
You're the one
that doesn't seem to know who I am.

702
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,196
Do you have any idea
who you're messing with?

703
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,656
[A-ri] And who are you? [scoffs]

704
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,370
Do you not know? Is that why you keep
asking everyone if they know who you are?

705
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,122
What are you talking about?

706
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,167
Hey, that's not my point. My family--

707
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,753
Tell me who you are,
not who your family is.

708
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,172
Just you, Jin Chae-hee.

709
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,424
Why should we care?

710
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,885
[scoffs] Hey.

711
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,804
You think you're hot shit?

712
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,891
Because you've got Jun-kyoung behind you?

713
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,976
You crazy bitch,
she's just talking to you because--

714
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,270
Chae-hee, stop.

715
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,024
-Stop this. You're causing a scene.
-Let me go! That bitch started with me!

716
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,817
People are watching you.

[Si-hyeon breathes shakily]

718
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,570

724
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,755
I'm sorry. Allow me to apologize.

725
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,423
[Yeon-woo exhales] Thank you, Ms. Yoon.

726
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,717
It's just that
I'm really shook up right now.

727
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,263
What's up with her? [breathes shakily]

728
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,222
Let's go outside.

729
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,266
There should be
a change of clothes in my car.

730
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,142
Okay. [breathing shakily]

[pensive music playing]

732
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,261
Leaving so soon?

733
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:33,853
Just a second.

734
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,568
Thank you so much.

735
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,404
For your help.

736
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,241
I haven't had a chance
to return the favor.

737
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,788
Would you be all right
if I also followed you?

738
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,124
Huh?

739
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,334
I meant on social media.

740
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,086
You see, I've also made an account.

741
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,091
I'd appreciate it,

742
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,385
if you took my request.

743
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,140
That would allow us
to connect as good friends, wouldn't it?

744

[music fades]

745
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,901
[A-ri] "Connection."

746
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,571
What do you think it really means
to connect?

747
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,908
A person sharing
their thoughts and feelings

748
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,951
to understand another person?

749
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,953
Something like that?

750
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,538
[Si-hyeon] It's true.

751
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,124
I did like A-ri.

752
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,752
I got close to her,

753
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,754
and I wanted to help her.

754
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,844
Until she

755
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,764
decided to do what she did.

756
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,141
[A-ri] Nope, wrong answer.

757
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,977
We can never truly understand
other people.

758
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,605
Misunderstandings, they just…

759
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,525
pile up until they fall.

760
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,901
Seo A-ri?

761
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,778
You seriously believe her?

762
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,114
How can you all believe
what Seo A-ri is saying?

763
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,117
You know all the things
that Seo A-ri has done.

764
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,869
Why'd she drop off
as if she's running away?

765
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,957
ARE YOU REALLY SEO A-RI?

766
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,458
YOU CAN'T BE!

767
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,210
That's not possible.

768
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,254
We all know Seo A-ri is dead.

769
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,923
A bitch like her doesn't deserve to live.

770
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,842
Seo A-ri

771
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,885
is a fucking murderer!

772
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,138
She killed a man! [breathing shakily]

773
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,849
Someone who did
everything in his power for her.

[dramatic music playing]

775
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,781
Then I guess the three of us
have become friends now?

776
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,256
[A-ri] Oh, that's right.

777
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,136
I did do that.

778
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,223
I'm responsible…

779
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,143
for someone's death.
