I've got to take care
of my followers first.

-Doesn't that apply to all of us?
-[woman 2 sighs]

179
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,916
Do you have more followers than me?

180
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,920
I told you all to put them down.
You bitches are starting to piss me off!

Angela, you too.

184
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,429
Chae-hee, that was not cool.
Watch your language.

185
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,807
You wouldn't know
since you're not on social media.

186
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,642
You have no idea what a big deal this is.

187
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,561
I do know you're throwing
a tantrum right now.

188
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,396
Si-hyeon!

189
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,774
She has a reason to be angry.
Please understand, Si-hyeon.

190
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,818
Everyone here is an influencer.

191
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,320
I know you came all this way,
but this is important.

192
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,364
Would you mind if we talk business?
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,284
[exhales] Please don't mind me.
Go about your business.

[sighs] I'm sure you all
have seen by now, but earlier today,

196
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,334
Wang Ro-la released her chats
with Biniimom online.

197
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,962
I guess Wang Ro-la wanted
to start something with Biniimom.

198
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,380
Problem is…

199
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,800
in most of their chats,
they're talking behind our backs.

[chuckles] Well, that's how she dissed me.

211
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,918
My full name is all over social media
and the major forums right now.

212
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,046
[woman 4] They also mention my initials.

213
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,131
All the luxury goods I sell
are knock-offs,

Apparently, I got breast surgery?

[laughs] That's bullshit.

217
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,475
I mean, what does she want?

218
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,685
Should I pop these babies out
to prove they're real?

219
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,647
Ugh! Those crazy fucking bitches!

220
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,150
I mean, why drag all of us
into their catfight?

221
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,861
Sure, Biniimom's a total fucking bitch,

-but what's up with Wang Ro-la?
-[chuckles]

223

Weren't those two totally inseparable?

-Wang Ro-la used to be Biniimom's maid.
-Chae-hee.

225
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,997
They had a fallout recently, and Biniimom
was in the process of ditching Wang Ro-la.

226
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,375
She tried to kick her out
of our group, right?

234
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,444
that you were trying
to have a meeting without me?

235
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,201

A row?

237
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,540
A fight broke out between
two female influencers on social media,

238
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,792
but the others
are getting caught in the crossfire.

239
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,043
That's the gist, right?

240
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,087
Oh, is that what a row is?

241
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,006
Here, most people refer to it
as World War Three.

00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,842
A world war? Seriously?

243
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,510
What? Are they saving the country?

244
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,804
No, these are strangers bickering online.

245
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,349
She's not just some stranger.
Biniimom's my Insta buddy, okay?

246
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,894
Ah, I've been wondering
why you wear those ugly shoes.

247
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,646
So they're from this Insta buddy of yours?

248
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,733
I keep telling you, they're an "it" item.
Look, okay?

249
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,610
Um, even celebrities
wear Binnie Shoeshoes.

251
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,366
You follow all these people? Why?
You don't even know them.

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,119
Yeah. Their stuff is fancy to look at.

At the end of the day,
these are total strangers.

I might someday become--

00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,465
Enough.

Hey, Seo A-ri!

Think about ways
to improve your performance

instead of whatever that is.

265
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,397
This is no time to live vicariously.

266
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,399
Keep this up, you'll get fired.

267
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,984
Fine, just watch the road, witch.

268
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,659
[A-ri] Even expensive cosmetics
all use the same ingredients.

269
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,246
This one's almost identical
to the one in the brown bottle.

270
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,207
[women] wow.

271
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,168
Oh my, I'm not supposed
to be buying so many. What do I do?

272
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,504
With these babies,
you're making money the more you buy.

273
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,880
-Oh yeah?
-Oh!

274
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,050
-Well, it is super moist like you said.
-Here. See how my skin glows?

275
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,260
Just apply this after you wash your faces.

276
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,970
It won't even take that long. Two weeks.

277
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,932
No results? You'll get your money back.
That's my personal guarantee.

278
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,809
Young lady, you've got a way with words.

00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,103
-She's gonna bleed our wallets dry.
-She's great, right?

280
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,730
I was tight with her mom.

281
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,357
Her family used to be very wealthy.

282
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,027
She grew up around the finest things,
so she's got quite an eye for what's good.

283
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,279
[woman 1] That's right!

-Seven thousand won at the thrift store.

-This cost you 7,000 won?
-[woman 1] Oh my, it looks expensive.

288
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,333
Tell me where you bought all this
so I can tell my daughter to get me some.

289
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,668
[woman 1] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,046
Ladies, I'll give you all my tips,
but please look at the cosmetics first.

291
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,923
-Oh, all right.
-[maid] Stay focused, ladies.

292
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,925
Hey, this one sprays! Oh my, hey!

293
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,427
Give it two weeks. A miracle will happen.

294
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,179
-You'll see a miracle.
-[woman 1] It's organic.

295
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,307
It doesn't smell like makeup at all.
It's practically scentless.

296
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,101
-Wow.
-Take your time and check it out.

297
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,270
It really has no smell
because it's all organic, right?

298
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,022
[woman 2] Hey, check this out.
It's perky now. It's already perked up.

299
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,859
[woman 1] Oh, it's so soft.
We'll see a miracle in two weeks?

300
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,611
-[maid] We'll look ten years younger.
-[woman 1] Ten years? [laughs]

301
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,155
[woman 2] At your age? Ten years, my foot.

302
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,866
[woman 1] You're just jealous.

303
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,950

skin whitening products?

Ugh, these freckles
just keep showing up. It's killing me.

308
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,590
Of course I do.

What's this?

310
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:48,012
This has five times the vitamin C content
found in conventional cosmetics.

00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,069
[woman 1] What do I do?

318
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,030
You said she wasn't coming back
for a while!

319
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,698
-Oh God!
-Tell me, what should I do?

320
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,158
[maid] Hey, shut up!

321
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,579
You guys take these and get outside.

322
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,164
-Hurry up.
-[woman 2] Okay!

323
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,041
[maid] Clear it out! Put it away!

324
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,043
Call me later, okay? Got it?

325
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,929
[maid] What are you doing?

326
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,597
-You have to get out!

329
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,901
Right.
Well, I thought you would be occupied.

330
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,488
Welcome back, Mrs. Yoon.
I thought you'd be out for longer.

331
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,530
Things change.

332
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,535
I'm back earlier than planned.
It wasn't the best lunch situation.

333
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,163
[sighs]

334
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,670
How do you know about all that?

335
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,099
Did you hear it from your sister?
About Biniimom?

336
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,892
[man] Nope, from Chae-hee's boyfriend.

337
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,603
An, the lawyer. I play golf with him.

338
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,023
Chae-hee must have kicked up
quite a fuss over the phone.

339
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,817
And on the tenth hole,

340
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,279
he apologized out of the blue,
and ran off freaking out. [chuckles]

341
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,616
Chae-hee's got quite the temper, that one.
I guess he went to calm her down.

342
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,539
Why do you go to these meet-ups?
It's not exactly your cup of tea.

343
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,041
Because of Chae-hee's nagging?

344
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,751
Well, that's part of it.

345
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,089
But also, it's common practice
to advertise through influencers nowadays.

346
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,135
It helps whenever
the foundation's hosting events.

347
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,513
I mean, then why don't you
just manage your own account?

348
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,764
Why put up with the hassle?

349
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,350
Yoon Si-hyeon,
the chairman of Haeum Foundation.

350
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,602
That name and title alone
should be enough.

351
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,355
I'll pass. [chuckles]

352
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,525
You know I just prefer
to operate discreetly.

353
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,033
By the way,
what are you doing about your sister?

354
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,077
She's all worked up saying
she's going to recruit your help

355
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,912
to sue Biniimom and Wang Ro-la.

356
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,372
I'll take care of it.

357
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,833
I'll just butter her up a bit, you know?

358
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,337
Honey, this situation
doesn't merit such an extreme response.

360
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,718
Oh, I'm getting a call from your sister.

361

[inhales] I'm going to pick up this call.
Can you stay on the line for now?

Hey, look at this. Hmm?

379

How does your mom look? Hmm?

380
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,634
-Wow, Coco Chanel in the flesh.
-Right?

381
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,636
It's just perfect for me.

382
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,432
I mean, remember how I was really into
this kind of fashion back then?

-Mom.
-[chuckles]

Someday, everything's
gonna blow up in your face.

Besides, what if it does? [chuckles]

389
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,573
Once I'm done fixing them up,
there won't be a trace.

390

Not one. [chuckles]

391

We hit rock bottom ages ago,
yet madam sees fit to keep up appearances.

392
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,080
Take them off. They aren't your clothes.

393
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,749
No way. Mmm.

394
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,251
I mean, this kind of fun keeps me going.

395
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,004
I don't run a clothing alteration shop
in Gangnam for nothing.

396
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,964
I know, right?
The store isn't making any money,

397
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,633
but the rent is high.

398
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,384
You know we barely made rent this month?

399

God! Money, money, money, money.

400
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,598
Can you stop talking like a commoner?
It's completely unattractive.

401
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,642
I am a commoner.

402
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,854
Oh wait, living like this is Gangnam,
we're even lower. An untouchable?

403
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,897
Oh please.

404
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,857
Hey, I raised you for 18 years

as the privileged daughter
of a rich family.

406
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,322
We're of noble origins, you and I.
[chuckles]

Well, in reality,
our lives our a dumpster fire.

[A-ri] Funny, isn't it?

421
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,051
To think the famous Seo A-ri
didn't have an account at the time.

422
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,012
But it's true.

423
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,472
I was busy dealing with real life.

It's not like I had time to follow
that kind of nonsense.

…all of this had just ended
right then and there?

Then the next decision,
and the one after that,

431
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,289
and then the next.

432
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,708
What if I had made
different choices back then?

433

Would this chain of events
have never occurred?

434

What would've happened?

435
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,423
Would the Seo A-ri of today

436

have been a different person?

you have amazing fashion sense.

That's just tacky.

as much as I want on expensive things."

Oh Min-hye. She's one of

Sorry, A-ri.
We just released a new product.

She is, isn't she?

534
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,895

Isn't that right, A-ri?
You went overseas to Yale, wasn't it?

537
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,945
Anyway, you went to some school there.

538

-I brag about you sometimes, you know.

-That I have a friend at an Ivy League.
-Mmm.

[Min-hye] It's something to be proud of,
having a friend like that. [chuckles]

541
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,580
[inhales] So tell me. What are you up to?

or working for daddy?

She was super famous.

Crazy rich, A+ student,
great fashion sense…

545
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,965
A-ri would wear something,

546
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,134
and all the other kids
would try to imitate her.

547
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:21,014
Oh wow, you really have it all.
I'm so jealous.

548

So what are you doing?

549
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,228
Now I'm working as
a door-to-door makeup--

550
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:32,067
Ah! A-ri just works on putting on makeup,
and wearing clothes, and partying.

Right. You seem busy,
so we should really get going.

564
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,143
Oh, A-ri, we should connect.
What's your handle? I'll follow you.

-Let's follow each other.
-What?

That's fine. I'm not on social media.

You're not? Why?

568

Give me your phone number.
I can call--

No.

00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,739
Ms. Min-hye,
why don't I just send you a DM?

572
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,866
Yes? If you follow me back,

573
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,870
I can relay whatever your message is
to A-ri. [chuckles]

574
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,497
I should follow you?

575
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,873
Why is that necessary?

576
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,875
I mean, that works, A-ri, right?

It's all DMs now.

You're really gonna throw this away?

676
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,601
Mmm.

677
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,645
It's old, and I barely use it anymore.

Uh, then, maybe can I have it?

00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,653
Sure.

696
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,692
Good morning, ma'am.

697
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,075
Make sure she does prison time.

698
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,910
Five years. No, ten!

699
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,037
She has to pay for trying
to come after me.

700
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,830
[man] Honey, I told you already.

701
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,833
Uh, something like this,
the most she'll get is a fine, okay?

702
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
Just a fine?

703
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,712
That's bullshit! No, I want her in jail!

704
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,256
-Just do it for me.
-Of course I want to do it,

705
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,008
-they mistreated you.
-[sighs]

706
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,676
[man] But from a legal standpoint…

707
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,179
All right, we get it. Hmm?

708
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,056
-We'll do as you wish.
-Really, Tae-jeon?

709
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,975
I mean, I don't see why not.
We are Taegang, right?

710
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:07,897
Just proceed as our client wishes, hmm?
Let the law firm handle everything.

711
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,482
And forget about it.

712
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,567
Uh, yeah. Okay, sir.

-Huh?

715
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,244
-What are you doing here?
-[chuckles]

716
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,538

-Mmm.

[Si-hyeon sighs]

718
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,342
I dropped by because I was worried
your sister might try this.

719
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,553
But are you really going to file a suit?

720
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,472
No, don't worry.
I'm only going to pretend, okay?

721
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,808
Don't you know Chae-hee?

722
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,686
I told her what she wants to hear
so she'll forget about everything.

723
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,688
I'll just play along.

724
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,065
You should pretend you don't know
and forget about it too.

725
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,695
You must be tired
from looking after Chae-hee.

726
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,322
She's a bit quirky, my sister.

727
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,782
No, I'm fine.

728
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,243
Take good care of her, hmm?

729
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,621
Ever since she was little,
you were the only person she'd listen to.

730
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,914
[footsteps approaching]

731
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,874
[man 2] Sir?

732
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,543
-It's time for the meeting.
-That's right. Let's go.

733
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,961
I'll take care of it, huh?

734
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,464

[indistinct chatter]

737
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,857
Hey, isn't that Jun-kyoung?

738
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,234
-Jun-kyoung--
-Chae-hee, hold on a sec.

739
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,736
[Chae-hee] What?

740
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,740
Just let him be.
Don't call him, he's on his way out.

741
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,742
Why? We haven't seen him in a while.

742
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,286
-We should at least say hi.
-No, it's fine.

743
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,497
I heard you were here,
so I dropped by on the way to pick you up.

744
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,250
-We'll be pressed for time as it is.
-Oh, the party?

745
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,461
Okay, fine.
I guess I can catch up with him there.

746
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,712
What do you mean?

747
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,548
-Catch up with Jun-kyoung?
-Yeah.

748
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,925
Jun-kyoung should be there.

749
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,635
His company's sponsoring
the party tonight.

750
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,851
[Mrs. A-ri gasps] Oh! [chuckles]

751
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,145
Ah, a perfect fit, right?

752
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,146
[gasps]

753
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,607
These clothes were meant for you.

754
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,192
Aw! [giggles]

755
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,276
You know, girl,

756
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,321
you can thank your mother
for winning the genetic lottery.

757
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,322
[chuckles]

758
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,784
You ruined your daughter's youth,
and now you're laughing about it?

759
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,869
I'm not the one
who ruined the business, okay?

760
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,870
Blame your dead dad.

761
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,497
[chuckles]

762
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:30,998
But…

763
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,209
what finally changed your mind?

764
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,044
You were so set on not going.

765
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,755
I'm just a little curious

766
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,049
-about what these people are like.
-Huh?

767
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,221
God, never mind this.
I'll just wear my own clothes.

768
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,473
Hey, what's this? Why?

769
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,517
I can't wear this.
It belongs to someone else.

770
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,893
[Mrs. A-ri sighs] Hey.

771
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,312
Are you that desperate to make
a laughingstock of yourself?

772
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,982
Saying, "I'm destitute
and wear cheap, off-brand crap"

773
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,276
to these women with luxury items.

774
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,485
Is that your plan?

775
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,030
[grunts] Just wear it, and go.

776
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,284
Just wear it a little,
and let's, um, dry-clean it.

777
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,286
[chuckles]

778
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,412
Come here.

779
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,665
Oh, look.

780
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,917
Look how gorgeous you are, A-ri.

781
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,669
Oh.

[pensive music playing]

783
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,970
[sighs] I'm sad enough sending you off.

784
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,181
Don't dress like a bum,
or you'll break your mother's heart.

785
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,559
[Mrs. A-ri groans]

786
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,944
[Chae-hee] Should be about a month
since Jun-kyoung got back.

787
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,696
I heard he was gonna
take over the company.

788
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,197
I guess you didn't hear.

789
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,492
[Chae-hee sighs]

790
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,662
Si-hyeon, why don't you wear
that Saint Laurent dress?

791
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,414
That would've been perfect.

792
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,375
It's being altered.

793
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,085
A thread came lose
while I was cleaning up.

794
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,837
Oh no, that beauty?

795
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,131
[scoffs] Saving it for later
was a bad idea.

796
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,258
Why keep it packed away
when you could be wearing it?

797
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
Hurry up and finish preparing.

798
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,179
-We're almost there.

What are you doing?

814
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,818
Who do you think you are?
You can't touch me.

815
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,029
I'm so sorry.
I took you for the wrong person.

816
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,030
Oh really?

817
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,700
Of course you thought I was someone else.
That's what they all say.

818
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,326
You know, perverts.

819
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,828
Not at all. That's not true.

820
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,830
I really thought
that you were someone I know.

[camera shutter clicks]

822
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,624
Hey, what are you doing?

823
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,376
-Phone number.
-Huh?

824
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,503
Give me your phone number
so I can report you.

825
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,340
I have a motto I live by.
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

826
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,468
But in these cases,
I don't deal with people myself.

827
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,761
-I let the police handle it.
-The police?

828
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,721
Yeah!

829
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,348
You know how often I run into perverts
like you on the subway

830
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,517
day after day on my way to work?

831
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:22,354
Yeah. I reported them all.
Of course I do. That's why I pay my taxes.

832
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:23,981
[chuckles]

833
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,027
Something funny?

834
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,653
Uh…

835
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,283
Taxes, the subway… I mean,
things were getting so interesting.

836
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,284
How so?

837
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,913
[sighs] Playing dumb?
You've got some nerve.

838
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,041
Fine. I knew you weren't
going to give it to me.

839
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,251
The photo was so I could report you.

842
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,595
Did you not hear me?
You need me to repeat that?

843
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,680
[Jun-kyoung chuckles]

844
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,891
To think there's another person
that owns that outfit,

845
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,934
that's also interesting.

846
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,395
Do give me a call.

847
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,898
