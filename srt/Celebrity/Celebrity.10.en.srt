Hey, check this. It's A-ri's hate account.

[scoffs] Hate account? Ugh, who cares.

Wouldn't be the first time
they made a fuss about nothing.

Huh?

What is going on?

204
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,484
You want to halt in-house production

205
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,402
Yeah.

"That fucking bitch Hwang Yu-ri,
it's her turn next."

I found out about your situation
on my way here.

It's not true. I never said any of this.

you really believe that?

308

No way.

Just like that fucking Biniimom.

318
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,699
So that's why you came here
raving like a bitch?

319
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,035
Because you thought that was me?
To catch me?

320

Honey,

321
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,373
you can't catch them.

322
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,002
It's all anonymous.

323
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,045
That's social media.

324
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,256
You can accuse anyone
of anything in that space.

325
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,509
So who else but me, you ask?

326
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,762
The possibilities are endless.

327
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,767

that can't stand seeing others succeed?

No.

350
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,395
How did it go?

351
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,065
Just as you expected.
They're actively burying the case.

352
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,650
I think they don't want to investigate.

353
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,319
[grunts] It's all part of
a fucking cover-up.

354
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,364
Maybe you should lay off this one.

355
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,034
You're going up against Taegang,
and, sir, it seems like a lot.

356
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,911
Hey, not you too, man.

357

We couldn't have asked
for a better witness or testimony.

358
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,166
Something's brewing
around Seo A-ri right now.

359
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,418
-What?
-You haven't heard about it?

360
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,505
I heard it from my wife,

361
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,632
but the whole internet's
on fire right now.

362
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,634
And it's all because of that Seo A-ri.

Do something! Huh?

384
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,991
Just keep calling them
until they fucking pick up!

385

Oh, shit.

386
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,339
I'm not done milking everything
I can out of you, Seo A-ri, got it?

387
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,133
I'm not gonna let you just ruin this
for everyone like a fucking idiot!

388
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,551
Huh?

389
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,137
[Min-hye] So predictable.

390
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,806
She'll say it's all lies,
and she's a victim.

391
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,602
But you know,
when were people interested in all that?

392
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,687
It's not like we made all this stuff up.

393
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,648
She deserves what's coming.

394
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,400
It's just how it works.

[Min-hye] What are you doing here?

399
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,375
Mr. Jin, is that you?

400
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,460
You're Si-hyeon's husband, right?

401
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,130
Oh my, and Mr. An too.

402
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,715
I was just on the phone with Chae-hee.

403
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,634
Now's not the time for that.
We've been caught.

-Huh?
-So, they know that we…

405

all that stuff online.

He went home.

410
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,494
He says he'll even hack social media.

411
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,539
He'll do whatever it takes
to catch those crazy haters.

412

You know, right?

416
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,848
Don't let something like this
bring you down. Huh?

417
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,765
[A-ri] Hmm.

418

Is it ready?

419
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,519
Yeah.

420
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,065
It's not my fault.
Seo A-ri forced me to do it.

421
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,319
I had no idea it would hurt you
or Chae-hee, Mr. Jin.

422
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,487
Please, will you forgive me?

423
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,908
Three years and nine months max.

for the crimes that you committed.

You've been a bit naughty
with the super car business.

00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,802
One could call it a Ponzi scheme.

432
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,639
Hmm, then that would be a

433
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,477
violation of the economic crime law
and get him three years minimum?

completely on her own, sir.

00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,697
I'm doing this livestream today

455
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,952
to clarify my position on the rumors
that have been spread about me.

the rumors that have been circulating
about me online.

but the facts today,

even if the truth
makes me look bad in your eyes.

what happened at the club?

have anything else to lose.

00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,708
and I exchanged DMs
over the course of a long period of time.

473
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,629
I received information
on e-celebs from bbbfamous.

474
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,965
I obviously used that information.

475
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,426
However,

476
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,095
many of the recent posts are not true.

477

Most of them were in fact Photoshopped,

478

the original copy of my chat history,

as shameful as it may be.

I know I'm not blameless in all of this.

482
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,986
I wanted to succeed in this world
just like everyone else.

483
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:48,904
To achieve this,

484
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,116
I didn't hesitate to use
others' weaknesses against them.

I know it will take more than regret
and remorse to make this all go away.

487
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,541
I will…

take responsibility
for my grievous actions.

What I won't do

490
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,720
is take the blame for things
I'm not responsible for.

491
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,263
I cannot accept

492
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,266

Also,

00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,022
there are too many secrets
that I will not hide anymore.

this woman's making me do.

Yes.

I was the one who originally posted
those texts online.

about the drugs at Aragon
and the man dying.

-[Min-hye] You ask me why I did it?

It's because of Seo A-ri.
