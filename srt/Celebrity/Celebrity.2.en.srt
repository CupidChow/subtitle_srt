00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,653
Just giving you some tough love
to help you come to your senses.

175
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,238
Got a problem?

176
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,656
You can come find me.

177
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,368
[dramatic music continues]

178
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,598
[music halts, fades]

179
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,142
Oh God, this is never gonna come out.

180
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,060
Fuck.

181
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,438
[man] Hello. Need a little help?

182
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,778
I saw you in there,
and thought you might need this.

183
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,155
[sighs]

184
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,742
A Saint Laurent covered in red wine.
That's just… [inhales]

185
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,036
That's just a shame, but…

186
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,830
that dress really does suit you.

187
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,168
-[door opens]
-[alarm chimes]

188
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,795
[maid] Welcome back, Mrs. Yoon.

189
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,506
Mr. Jin wanted me to tell you
that he would be late today.

190
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,050
Thanks for your hard work.
You can head home now.

191
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,134
Thank you, ma'am.

192
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,387
Oh, and excuse me,

193
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:19,183
which store is it
that's doing alterations on my dress?

194
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,310
[Mrs. A-ri gasps] What?

195
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,063
Oh no! Oh God! [exclaims]

196
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:28,276
Oh! Oh God, what's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

197
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,737
God! Do you have any idea
how much this dress costs? Oh Jesus!

198
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,490
You can get if off, right?
You're good at alterations. [chuckles]

199
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,409
Alterations and laundry are different!

200
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,244
How do we make it disappear?

201
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,328
[whimpers]

202
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,039
How much would the dress go for?
Two million? Three million?

203
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,916
Will we have to pay for it?

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,168
Oh God.
This is clearly worth an arm and a leg.

205
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,086
Ugh!

206
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,256
It's not like you even
have any money to give them.

207
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,675
[Mrs. A-ri whimpering]

208
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:57,179
I mean, why did it have to be wine?

209
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,931
Wine never comes off of anything!

210
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,100
-[A-ri] This tweed dress is…
-Oh my God!

211
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,768
-[Mrs. A-ri continues whimpering]
-[dings]

212
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,853
[A-ri gasps]

213
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,064
-Twelve million won?
-[gasps]

214
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,067
[Mrs. A-ri gasps, exhales]

215
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,696
[indistinct chatter]

216
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,866
Is the diversification strategy meeting
at two?

217
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,242
Yes, it is, sir.

218
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,577
Have me on audio.

219
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,704
And have everyone else on video, please.

220
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,788
Yes.

221
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,511
[grunts, exhales]

222
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,265
Even though our third quarter
marketing cost for the Chinese market

223
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,558
exceeded by 32%,

224
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,896
our revenue growth rate was below 17%.

225
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,732
Let's try switching to words that appeal
to millennial and Gen Z crowds,

226
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,484
like "safety" and "natural."

227
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,028
[chuckles]

228
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,614
We can adjust that, can't we?

229
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,241
[Tae-jeon] Hey, Mr. Han!

230
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,453
[Jun-kyoung exhales]

231
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,589
Hey, when did you get here?

232
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,133
I called the company,
and they told me that you were here.

233
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,593
Isn't this scary?

234
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,428
[Jun-kyoung] It is pretty scary.

235
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,222
I tried it for the first time today.

236
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,891
We have a strategy meeting,
but I figured I could multitask.

237
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,434
So you took the meeting up there?

238
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,729
[breathes deeply]
Physical exertion just helps me focus.

239
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,943
Ah, that's why you go out shooting,
paragliding, and now indoor climbing, huh?

240
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,153
It's pretty fun. You want to join as well?

241
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,947
Oh, no, man. I'm good.

242
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,615
Hey, and just so you know,

243
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,952
they aligned up some real beauts for you.
Are you available now?

244
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,870
Hold on.

245
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,123
What are they bitching about right now?

246
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,124
What do you think?

247
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,751
They're all talking about how Biniimom
embarrassed me at the party.

248
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,878
-With your name?
-[Min-hye sighs]

249
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,172
Is your name making
the rounds right now?

250
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,091
It's not. Just my initials for now.

251
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,301
It's just a matter of time, though.

252
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,929
What if someone uploads
a photo from the event?

253
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,847
[sighs]

254
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,016
Even something this small
is enough to ruin things. Ah, shit!

255
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,395
Then we just deny, deflect,
and go after their asses from the get-go.

256
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,981
The moment I hear a peep out of them
about your real name,

257
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,900
I'll sue all those assholes
and put them behind bars, I swear.

258
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,736
So don't worry, honey, okay?

259
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,655
They better not try anything, huh?
How dare they?

260
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,199
Ah, shit.

261
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,495
Ah! Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Mr. Jin is here. He's here.

262
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,872
One sec, be right there.

263
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,668
-Wow.
-Hello, hello! Welcome, Mr. Jin!

264
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,378
-Yes, it's been a while.
-Yes, it has.

265
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,421
Oh, and this is--

266
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,840
The CEO of MH Grand Motors.
I'm Kwon Myeong-ho.

267
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,009
Great to meet you, sir.

268
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,638
[chuckles] Mr. Han, it's such an honor
to host an esteemed CEO like yourself.

269
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,598
[exhales]

270
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,515
Great.

271
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,936
You're more impressive than I thought.
I'm like, "God, this man's intimidating!"

272
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,148
I heard you're really into car racing.
This was built in 1962.

273
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,358
There's only four in Asia.
This one's in the best shape.

274
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,778
I'll bring the keys.
Now where are those keys, huh?

275
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,449
Yeah, I know. He's a bit much, right?

276
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,284
Well, he's good at what he does.
[chuckles]

277
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,619
Do you know him well?

278
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,662
[Tae-jeon] Just through Chae-hee.

279
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,874
You know
those Instagram famous celebrities, right?

280
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,501
That guy's married to one.

281
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,712
Ah. A celebrity.

282
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,838
[Tae-jeon exhales]

283
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,217
Most people at the party yesterday
are in that line of work, right?

284
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,134
Oh, right.

285
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,762
I heard something happened.
Is everything all right?

286
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,139
Didn't your company sponsor that party?

287
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,892
How'd you know? Did Si-hyeon…

288
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,771
-[door shuts]
-Did your wife tell you all of that?

289
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,774
Hey, just call her Si-hyeon, okay?
You guys knew each other in college.

290
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,691
[Jun-kyoung scoffs]

291
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,652
You really think
she would tell me these things?

292
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,030
No, I just happened upon Chae-hee
screaming at Mr. An.

293
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,032
Does that mean you didn't see her?

294
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,784
See who?

295
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,452
Si-hyeon.

296
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,164
Ah. No, I didn't. I had to leave early.

297
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,460
[Angela chuckles]

298
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,963
Oh my God, awesome. It's so pretty.

299
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,548
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Look at this.

300
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,467
-[phone chimes]
-[camera shutter clicks]

301
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,096
[Min-hye] Amazing fashion sense
as always, Chae-hee!

302
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,223
[scoffs] Such a cutie!
Love you so much, bestie!

303
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,183
-Ugh, shit! She's so annoying!
-[Angels gasps]

304
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,644
-God, you're scaring me.
-Why's this bitch being so clingy?

305
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,728
[Angela] Who?

306
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,146
-Min-hye again?
-[Chae-hee exhales]

307
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,732
She's been commenting on my feed nonstop.

308
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,317
What a stalker.

309
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,445
Like, in what world
is she my bestie? [scoffs]

310
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,198
Has she not learned
that when people leave her on read,

311
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,908
it means they want nothing to do with her?

312
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,869
[gasps] What the…

313
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,830
She's on my feed too.

314
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,416
[Min-hye] Ji-na, you look so pretty!

315
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,960
-Miss you!
-Wow, so sick of it.

316
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,211
[Ji-na exhales]

317
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,630
Word about Min-hye's scuffle
is already making the rounds.

318
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,174
Even when we ignore her,
she still can't take a hint.

319
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,302
-She's going all misery on us.
-[chuckles]

320
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,638
First Biniimom, and now Min-hye?
They're dragging down our reputations.

321
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,515
And the mom forums
are blowing up right now

322
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,103
-about Min-hye's real past.
-Her real past? Like what? Let me see.

323
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,813
Min-hye!

324
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,356
God, what do we do?

325
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,151
I'm looking at it right now. [sighs]

326
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,071
Aw shit. Who the hell did all of this?

327
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,032
You must be so frustrated.

328
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,285
I mean, if it's bad for me,
you must be doing terrible.

329
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,163
Are Chae-hee, Angela, and Ji-na
icing you out too?

330
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,081
Are they ignoring your comments?

331
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
Uh, no, they haven't been.

332
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,835
Why?

333
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,836
[scoffs]

334
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,838
Are you there?

335
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,426
[sighs] What do I do?

336
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,387
[exhales]

337
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,223
You all think you can cut me off
just like that?

338
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,892
Bring it on.

339
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,895
You think I'll go down without a fight?

340
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,649
What?! It's worth 12 million won?

341
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,902
That's completely insane,
even for a limited edition.

342
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,363
Hey, what will you do
if they ask you to pay them back for it?

343
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,280
What?

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,451
[A-ri screams, sobs]

345
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,995
I don't know.
I can't believe this is happening.

346
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,289
Hey, uh, did you get a pic, though?

347
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,875
What?

348
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,628
Of you and the dress
to upload to social media.

349
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,797
You really think this is the best time
to post a photo?

350
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,257
Just look how many followers
you have right now. Look.

351
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,052
Upload a photo and show your followers
how good you looked.

[pensive music playing]

353
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,808
I don't know any of these people.
Where did they come from?

354
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,142
It's all thanks to Min-hye.

355
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,895
That's just what happened
since she followed you back.

Oh.

[A-ri clears throat]

360
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,667
Yes? This is beauty consultant Seo A-ri.
Hello?

361
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,421
What?

362
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,131
Who is this again?

363
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,844
Oh no, I remember you.
I'm just wondering

364
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,929
how did you find my phone number?

365
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,056
What? What's up?

[Jun-kyoung] Any social media platforms?
Are you on them, Mr. Kim?

368
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,568
Yes.

369
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,530
Well, I guess you could say that I am.
I have accounts, but that's basically it.

370
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,159
Our firm manages marketing for some
of these so-called celebrities, right?

371
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,912
I'd like to see a full list of guests
at last night's party, Mr. Kim.

372
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,749
Yes, sir.
The PR team should have that list.

373
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,001
Please have it in my office
when I get back.

374

I'd like to look into someone.

375

Yes, of course, sir.

[pensive music playing]

377
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,718
So can I ask?
How did you get my phone number?

378
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,096
Getting your number was easy.
We could've dug deeper.

379
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,098
[inhales] If we wanted to,

380
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,850
we could get our hands on
all there is to know about you.

381
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,769
-Including everyone you dated.
-What?

382
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,063
It's a joke. A joke.

People are always misunderstanding me.

384
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,193
I'm not a weirdo or anything.

385
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,446
Honestly, you come off as a total weirdo.

386
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,698
I did some research before I came here.

387
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,327
I guess you run a pretty famous
consulting firm, isn't that right?

388
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,204
Marketing, PR, all of that.

389
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,165
It seems strange that the CEO of a company
specializing in all those things

390
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,584
would ask to see me.
Not to mention what you just said.

391
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,504
If you've developed feelings for me,
I should go,

392
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,422
since it'd be a waste of both our times.

393
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,716
And if this is all fake
and you're trying to scam me,

I plan to report you.

395
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,429
But you think this could be legit,
so you came to see for yourself.

[A-ri clears throat]

397
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,979
You sure captured everyone's attention
at the party. You have a certain charm.

398
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,982
You're a person who can draw focus.

399
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,025
I can work with that.

400
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:12,985
What?

00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,070
It looks like you're pretty new to this.

402
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,780
What stopped you until now?

403
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,449
You didn't think you had anything to show?

Privileged upbringing,

407
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,374
but dropped out of Dartmouth
when your dad's business went under.

408
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,917
Leaving you poor and in debt.

409
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,712
Since then, you've been hopping
between part-time jobs,

410
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,757
and your current gig is hawking cosmetics.
What are you? A beauty consultant?

411
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,593
What gives you the right
to dig into my life--

Nothing to write home about,
so I considered letting it go.

But I noticed
that your follower count kept increasing.

417
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,067
Could it be your fashion sense?

418
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,863
Trading follows with Oh Min-hye
should have netted you 15 minutes of fame,

419
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,866
but your follower count
keeps increasing by the day.

420
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,452

That's what I'm talking about.

"I might try making this girl a somebody."

You're friends with Oh Min-hye, right?

I mean, at the end of the day,
it's just business.

than you think?

Oh my gosh, ma'am. I'm so sorry.
Words can't express how sorry I am.

about it or anything like that at all.

There's nothing more for us to say.

I'm so sorry.

Anything I say would be an excuse.
We never should have done this.

It's honestly okay. We should end this.

I don't use credit
because I don't like owing people.

to withdraw the money right away.

of what we did to you and your dress.

that we can't pay you back in full.

and it kills me to know that.

I promise I'll pay you back.

You've misunderstood.

497

to look down on you or anything.

It's a shame we had to meet this way
because you looked really cool that day.

500
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,280
When I said you didn't need to pay,
all I meant was that…

I don't really wear it that often anyways.

So let's just end things here.

00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,162
[sighs]

514
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,804
[sighs]

515
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,976
[tires screech]

516
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,863
[phone chimes]

517
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,618
Goddammit, Min-hye.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

518
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,995
[sighs]

519
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,956
-Hey, get out.
-[valet] What?

520
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,541
Get out of the fucking car.

521
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,751
[sighs]

522
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,924
[tires screech]

523
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,844
[Angela scoffs]

524
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,014
Seriously,
what is she trying to pull here?

525
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,726
"Hi, friends. I'm inviting you all
to Min-hye's digital Gabin Society party."

526
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,730
"See you on the livestream with my besties
from the Gabin Society tomorrow"?

527
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,774
-Did you guys approve this?
-[scoffs] You see the hashtags?

528
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:55,655
#gotmybackforever, #truefriendship,
#womensticktogether, #besties. [chuckles]

529
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,949
[Angela] Is she trying to get us
to hate her even more?

530
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,827
She's trying to force us to hang out
by roping in all her followers.

531
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,330
She's bending over backwards
to keep her claws in us.

532
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm sick of her, and this doesn't help.

533
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,249
I think all of you might be--

534
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,629
Ladies, this is why you just can't give
desperate social climbers attention.

535
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,715
It makes them think
they're better than they are. [chuckles]

536
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,010
They just don't realize that we're
from fundamentally different places.

537
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,347
I'm gonna unfollow Min-hye, cut her loose.
You too?

538
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,140
Yeah, I'm totally in.

539
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm on board too.

540
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,602
Well, I plan on going.

541
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,774
Her invitation, I'm taking her up on it.

542
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,235
She contacted me about it this morning,
and I already RSVPd.

543
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,320
I should honor my word.

544
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,947
Hey, what are you doing?

545
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,158
Si-hyeon, I mean,

546
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,243
you aren't even that close
to Min-hye, are you?

547
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,246
So then I take it
I'll be the only one in attendance?

548
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,668
I think maybe I should call it a day now.
I'm pretty tired.

549
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,128
Si-hyeon.

550
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,923
Stop! Wait up!

551
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,300
Is this because
of what happened that night?

552
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,010
Is that why everyone's ignoring Min-hye?

553
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,679
[scoffs] Isn't it obvious?

554
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,764
None of us need to let her
drag us down to her level.

555
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,682
Chae-hee!

556
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,017
What level?

557
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,727
If there really are levels,

558
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,230
who decides what they are?

559
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,147
Do you? Do we?

560
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,274
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

561
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,360
Who has the right to make that call?

562
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,030
I hate when you act like this.
It's disappointing.

563
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,077
When you live in a world like this,
everything you do is public.

564
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,789
So if you drop Min-hye and ignore her,
what would people say?

565
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,834
"Oh, Chae-hee would cut out
a close friend at the drop of a hat."

566
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,960
You want that?

567
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,671
You're okay
with people saying that to you?

568
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,299
Which choice works out in your favor?

569
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,928
And what kind of image
do you want to build for yourself?

570
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,395
Oh my God.

571
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:54,023
What will people think
if she goes and we don't?

572
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:54,941
[Angela] I know.

573
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,861
Si-hyeon is way more famous than we are,
even without social media.

574
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,280
Between her dad's political ties,
and all the work she does,

575
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,073
and her husband,

576
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,367
everyone in the world would know her.

577
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,578
Fuck, I don't know what to do! [exhales]

578
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:10,206
Why does she always try
to undermine me about stuff like this?

579
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,292
FOLLOWERS 340K

580
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,466
FOLLOWERS 297K

581
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,738
Oh. Hey, you're here.

582
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,323
[Min-hye exhales]

583
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,741
[A-ri] Mm-hmm.

584
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,581
We just opened this store in advance
of the black collection's release.

585
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,754
One question, Mr. Kim.

586
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,464
DMs…

587
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,674
These direct messages…
I'm just curious.

588
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,385
Are you talking about social media?

589
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,138
What if you send someone a DM,
but they don't read it?

590
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,473
Are they ignoring me?

591
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,810
Do they not want to deal with me, or what?

592
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,269
Huh?

593
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,356
Hmm.

594
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,565
[phone chimes, buzzes]

595
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,278
I think you got a DM.
Do you want to check it?

596
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,490
I'll check later.
I don't even know how it works.

597
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,407
Oh.

598
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,994
[exhales] That party was so crazy.

599
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,163
Yea, it was.

600
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,250
This life can be wild,
but that was a punch in the gut.

601
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,210
Biniimom's been jealous of me for a while,

602
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,630
but I had no idea that she'd
actually take it as far as she did.

603
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,882
I'm sick over how all this went down.

604
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,844
Life is basically a series
of punches in the gut.

605
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,847
If you lost sleep over this,
you must've had it pretty easy.

606
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,682
What?

607
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,893
[gasps]

608
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:59,190
Oh, so, A-ri, about, uh,
you not really being an Ivy Leaguer…

609
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,234
That's not true, right?

610
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,612
Like, the last I heard is that you were
definitely going to an American college.

611
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
Well, then my family went broke.

612
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,117
Huh? Broke? Really?

613
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,035
Don't be so shocked.
It happens all the time.

614
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,121
People go broke and lose everything.

615
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,248
-It's just how things turned out.
-Oh…

616
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,500
So, uh, what are you really doing now?

617
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,794
-I'm hawking cosmetics.
-What?

618
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,422
Like door-to-door sales?

619
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,300
For Bibidia. It's not a well-known brand.
You wouldn't have heard of it.

620
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,761
Oh. [chuckles]

621
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,848
I didn't really see a need
to swap our life stories,

622
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,766
so I didn't bring it up.

623
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,018
It was nothing against you.

624
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,311
[Min-hye chuckles]

625
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,479
Oh. Yeah, no, of course.

626
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,565
It must have been tough on you,

627
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,775
since you grew up so rich.

628
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,487
[exhales]

629
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,869
Well, anyway, Min-hye,
I came here because I have a question.

630
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,038
So on your Instagram, I saw that you--

631
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,080
Oh.

632
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,665
Wait, you sell, like, makeup, right?

633
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,587
Hey, do you have some time today?
Oh my God, we should leave right now.

634
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,090
I have a showroom that's right over there.
Come have a look. [chuckles]

635
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,091
Really?

636
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,428
Who would have thought
that I'd ever get a chance to help you?

637
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,222
Uh, come on, pack it up.
Let's go, let's go.

638
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,350
Okay, A-ri.

639
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,226
[chuckles]

640
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,438
Come on, let's go. Let's hurry. Ah!

641
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,154
So all of this is yours?

642
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,197
Yeah.

643
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,949
Showrooms are on the first
and second floor,

644
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,784
office is on the third. Pretty big, right?

645
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,827
-[woman] Hello, welcome back.
-Hi.

646
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,290
Take a look around.

647
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,607
[woman] Hey, sweetie!

648
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,068
[Min-hye] Hey. [exhales]

649
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,116
Is everyone responding to you?
They're coming?

650
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,868
Uh, well, I'm not…

651
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,121
-Oh.
-[gasps]

652
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,664
[exhales] Si-hyeon!

653
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,834
[Min-hye chuckles, exhales]

654
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,918
I hope I'm not late.

655
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,045
We call came together.

656
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,964
[Min-hye giggles] Welcome, everyone.

657
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,174
Look at you all. Now it's a party.

658
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,968
-[Angela] Mm-hmm.
-[Chae-hee scoffs]

659
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,845
[Ji-na] Oh.

660
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,597
Looks like your friend is here too.

661
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,815
[upbeat music playing]

662
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,066
[chuckles]

663
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,318
Hello there to all my Lucies!

664
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,529
It's me, Min-hye. [chuckles]

665
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,489
So today…

666
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,867
Ta-da! [chuckles]

667
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,077
Today we have a special livestream.

668
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,996
And we might be having a few drinks.

669
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,623
Don't judge us for day drinking, okay?

670
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,250
[laughs]

671
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,461
Hey, Gabin Society. Say hello!

672
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,587
[all] Hello!

673
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,089
Wow, everyone looks so pretty. [chuckles]

674
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,549
And don't forget…

675
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,469
She runs the Gabin Society
from behind the scenes.

676
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,846
Say hello to Si-hyeon!

677
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,016
Even though she's not on social media,
she's still super famous.

678
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,269
A-ri, where are you going? [chuckles]

679
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,104
Stop! Come here!

680
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,773
Come join the livestream.

681
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,776
And I'd like to introduce everyone
to this cutie

682
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,694
and my high school BFF, Seo A-ri.

683
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,113
So pretty, isn't she? Just look at her.

684
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,618
Oh, she's shy and always tries
to hide that pretty face.

685
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,287
Hey, look. Everyone's excited to meet you.

686
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,873
"Pretty girls always have pretty friends.
Crying emoji."

687
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,708
"Whoa, is that body for real?"
"Oh my God…"

688
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,460
Min-hye, I should just head out.

689
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,003
Oh, A-ri!

690
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,006
Some Lucies already recognize you.
Look at this.

691
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,593
"You're A-ri, aren't you?
I started following you recently."

692
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,552
Oh.

693
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,721
See that, A-ri? [chuckles]

694
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,849
[inhales]
Now's the time for me to come clean.

695
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,684
She's the reason I gathered us here.

696
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,020
I owe my bestie a lot,
so I wanted to help her out.

697
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,982
Did you know
that I got picked on a lot in high school?

698
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:10,900
[sucks teeth]

699
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,819
Well, I did have it coming a little.

700
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,612
Just because my family had money,

701
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,074
didn't mean I needed
all those name brand things. Ugh!

702
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,577
I was so full of myself back then.
[laughs]

703
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,663
But you know who always tuck by me?

704
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,414
A-ri, of course!

705
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,250
Guess who's gonna return the favor?

706
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,669
Only her favorite bestie Min-hye!

707
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,087
[chuckles]

708
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,672
Now…

709
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,384
for today's main event. [chuckles]

710
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,886
Just give me a second. Hold on.

711
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,394
Now, right here in my hands,
are the cosmetics that A-ri sells.

712
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,021
You see her skin, right?
It's like a peeled egg.

713
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,565
And what is her secret?

714
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,817
This body mist that only costs 20,000 won.

715
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,734
What is she doing?

716
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,987
[Min-hye] Lucies,
isn't this totally cheating?

717
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,864
So what am I gonna do right now?

718
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,868
Bingo! Sell some. [laughs]

719
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,077
What should we do, A-ri?

720
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,538
Hundred sets? Or should we start with 200?

721
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,916
-Two hundred?
-Lucies, you know me. I'm Oh Min-hye.

722
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,544
I wouldn't sell anything
that wasn't certified gold.

723
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:12,962
So buy now.

724
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,881
Trust me, and try this stuff out.

725
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,009
Let's go. Time to my BFF
what Lucies are made of.

726
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,721
[gasps] Oh my God!

727
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,764
What has gotten into you today?

728
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,683
[exhales] I knew it.

729
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,101
Everyone wants it.

730
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,645
I'll be right back
after I restock my inventory.

731
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,147
This is really blowing up.

732
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,441
See you, Lucies! Bye-bye now!

733
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,946
[Angela] Wow, look at Min-hye.

734
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,742
She's trying to recover her bestie image
after ditching Biniimom.

735
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,285
Is that what that was?

736
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,330
I was wondering about all
the crappy cosmetics lying around.

737
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,789
-[Chae-hee scoffs]
-[Ji-na chuckles]

738
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,084
[all chuckling]

739
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,754
Look at Ms. Fake Ivy
selling shit door-do-door.

740
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,131
[all chuckle]

741
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,552
[Angela] "Fake Ivy!" [laughing]

742
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,226
-Wow.
-[women continue chuckling]

743
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,107
[Angela] What? What's her problem?

744
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,822
Hey, where are you going?
You can't just walk out like that!

745
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,032
A-ri, come on!

746
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,868
Is this why you wanted to meet up with me?

747
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,663
So that you can use me
to wipe your slate clean?

748
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,122
My what? God!

749
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,959
What do you mean by "wiping it clean"?

750
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,794
You think I was doing this for myself?

751
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,837
I just helped you sell off
a ton of inventory.

752
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,423
-Come on, Min-hye.
-Are you kidding me?

753
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,591
I used you?

754
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,594
Okay, let's just say
that's what I was doing.

755
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,929
What about you?

756
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,389
You say you're broke.

757
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,391
You didn't even go to college.

758
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,851
You're hardly in a position to judge me.

759
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,647
Like, I felt bad for you
when I heard you were selling makeup.

760
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,565
And I was like, "Maybe I can help her."

761
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,611
Hey, I was just trying
to help you get a little cash.

762
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,364
Do you… Do you even know
how much I'm worth?

763
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,575
Honestly, you should be thanking me
for the free publicity.

764
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,911
"Your help"? "Publicity"?

765
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,870
[Min-hye] Mm-hmm.

766
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,622
This was all a way to deflect attention.

767
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,500
You're using me
to make yourself look good.

768
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,710
You feel bad for me?

769
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,130
You're in a worse position than me,
and you're just as pathetic as I am.

770
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,048
-[Min-hye] I'm pathetic?
-[A-ri] That's right.

771
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,133
I'm so embarrassed for you

772
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,303
that, honestly, I can't believe
you can even look me in the eye.

773
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,345
[scoffs]

774
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,847
You need to get a grip, Min-hye.

775
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,476
Do you really think this will get you
the things you deserve in life?

776
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,813
Can you even hear yourself?

777
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,608
What I want? What about you?

778
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,235
Just admit it.

779
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,279
You're jealous of me.

780
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,615
Because I'm somebody,
and you're barely scrapping by.

781
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,533
Aren't you?

782
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,661
-What?
-You're delusional.

783
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,414
Haven't you noticed
I'm not that needy girl anymore,

784
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,915
and you're not that rich bitch?

785
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,459
I never saw you like that.
I thought--

786
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,960
Yeah, exactly.

787
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,670
What gives you the right?

788
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,423
You're not the same Seo A-ri
I knew back then.

789
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,427
You're a drop-out door-to-door saleswoman.

790
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,346
You're a loser.

791
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,390
[Min-hye chuckles]

792
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,391
Shit.

793
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,979
I let a low-rent loser like you
into my circle for old time's sake,

794
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,647
but you're still entitled.

795
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,320
A-ri, get your shit together.

796
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,947
This whole act you have going…

797
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,492
I see through it.

798
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,244
[Min-hye exhales]

799
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,002
You, uh, left your bag behind.

800
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,850
[pensive music playing]

801
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,065
[Min-hye] Haven't you noticed
I'm not that needy girl anymore,

802
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,983
and you're not that rich bitch?

803
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,611
-[Min-hye] A-ri! Ah!
-[A-ri screams]

804
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,822
Hey! Ugh! No!

805
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,407
Oh no!

806
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,784
Hey! What are you doing? Let's go.

807
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,204
This is the designer bag you gave me.
I don't want to get it wet!

808
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,040
Oh right. We'll keep this bag
a secret, yeah? [chuckles]

809
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,252
Min-hye, bags are for using,
not just for worshiping.

810
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,169
Come on, let's go.

811
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,339
-[A-ri shrieks]
-Ugh! A-ri, wait!

812
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,799
-Hurry up!
-Ugh!

813
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,926
-[A-ri shrieks]
-[Min-hye sighs]

814
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,512
[Min-hye] You're not the same Seo A-ri
I knew back then.

815
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,765
You're a dropout door-to-door saleswoman.

816
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,350
You're a loser.

817
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,020
Oh, sorry.

818
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,653
[Seung-hyeok] Let me ask you.

819
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,781
How do you think Min-hye made it so big?

820
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,244
[Angela] She's trying to recover
her bestie image after ditching Biniimom.

821
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,413
Who would've thought
I'd ever get a chance to help you?

822
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,914
Gabin Society, say hello!

823
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,459
[Seung-hyeok] I mean,
at the end of the day, it's just business.

824
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,878
Could there be a lot more to this
than you think?

825
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,421
Don't you ever wonder?

826
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,048
[A-ri] You know how
some people love to say

827
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,260
that the world online is totally different
than the world offline?

828
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,053
That it's virtual reality?

829
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,098
That's not true
because online or offline,

830
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,642
anywhere there's people
is exactly the same.

831
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,227
[beeping]

832
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,270
Followers.

833
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,356
A measure of how many people know me,
and how many people are watching me.

834
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,359
There's power in that data.
It's also how you make money.

835
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,195
But did you know…

836
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,864
you can just make them out of thin air?

837
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,075
[Min-hye sighs deeply]

838
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,993
I wired the money.

839
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,205
I just need all the followers
I had before the drop.

840
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,956
And then I need even more.

841
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,416
[A-ri] Wondering how?

842
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,002
I'll take care of it.

843
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,423
[chuckles]

844
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,095
Go.

845
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,265
[tense music playing]

846
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,313
[keypad clicking]

[chiming rapidly]

849
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,162
[A-ri] It happens just like this.

850
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,039
[chiming continues]

851
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,042
But I guarantee you,
there's something people covet

852
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,002
even more than followers.

853
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,671
Quality over quantity.

854
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,006
Meaning,
how many celebrities are following me

855
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,050
and responding to things I say?

856
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,218
[crowd cheering]

857
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,014
This is what decides
your true social standing in this world.

858
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,559
And that's why every single person you see

859
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,019
is obsessed
with making connections to celebrities.

860
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,271
But you know what?

861
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,774
The timing worked out,
and I got pretty lucky.

862
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,945
A connection that everyone wanted
just dropped out of the sky…

863
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,573
and into my lap.

864
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,701
[phone ringing]

865
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,249
Yes, hello?

866
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,216
[dramatic music playing]

867
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,345
[siren wails]

868
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,233
This way, please.

869
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:34,862
Hey, sir.

870
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,742
[exhales] So are you Ms. Seo A-ri?

871
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,784
Yeah.

872
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,788
Why did you ask me to come down here?

873
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,875
Why would you ask us that? Huh?

874
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,420
You two are the ones wasting our time
on what sounds like a private matter.

875
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,005
[cop clears throat]

876
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,362
[music fades]

877
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,615
[closing theme music playing]

878
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,217
[music halts]
