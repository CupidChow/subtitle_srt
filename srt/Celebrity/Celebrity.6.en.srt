177
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,294
Sure. Meet you there.

178
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,796
Uh-huh.

179
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,425
[engine roars]

180
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,891
It's a relief that it wasn't serious.

181
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,813
I was feeling conflicted about everything.

182
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,315
About whether
I should call the police or not.

183
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,694
But, in the end, I couldn't.

184
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,614
I was afraid I wouldn't be able
to avoid being entangled.

185
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,702
A-ri, I don't know what to say.

186
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,914
I'm so ashamed about this situation.

187
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,754
Don't worry.
Chae-hee wasn't the only one involved.

188
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,258
If it had been me,
I would've handled it the same way.

189
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,681
[door opens]

190
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,767
Oh, sorry I'm late.

191
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,440
Honey, why… why are you here?

192
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,693
You and Ms. Seo were meeting,
so I thought I should too.

193
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,069
Jun-kyoung came too.

194
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,994
Things had been hectic, wouldn't you say?

195
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,705
Tae-jeon, just what are you doing?

196
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,458
Well, we never got to properly meet
due to what was happening.

197
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,627
Besides, aren't you seeing each other now?

198
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,921
Hey man, you should've
at least formally introduced her.

199
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,507
I'm sorry.
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

200
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,636
Mr. Han and I aren't affiliated
in any way.

201
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,055
Therefore, our relationship
doesn't require such formalities.

202
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,474
I think I should go now.

203
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,975
Fine, enough of that.

204
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,478
Why don't we get to business, Ms. Seo?

205
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,149
Oh, it's nothing. But, please,

206
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,194
sign here. That's all we need.

207
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,073
-But, honey--
-We cannot have any loose ends.

208
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,075
What is this?

209
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,827
It's flawless from a legal perspective.

210
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,997
And you don't have to worry
about any ill-will clauses.

211
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,791
You don't even need to read it.

212
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,294
This meeting is about
what happened last night?

213
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,546
You want me to sign an NDA?

214
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,424
You catch on pretty quick.

215
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,469
Then I'm sure you can imagine
what's in it for you.

216
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,057
You're starting something, no?

217
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,811
It's a business.
At least that's what I was told.

218
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,979
Money must be a tight, right?

219
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,898
I'm sure this will help.

220
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,359
-And if you sign this document…
-[Jun-kyoung] Tae-jeon.

221
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,028
-Enough.
-I can't do that.

222
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,822
I won't sign that document.

223
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,866
An NDA? Compensation?

224
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,785
Why would I need anything like that?

225
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,872
What right do you have to ask that,
and how dare you ask so rudely?

226
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,251
Aren't secrets

227
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,878
meant to only burden
the sinners among us?

228
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,548
This has nothing to do with me.
I did nothing wrong.

229
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,549
[chuckles]

230
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,595
I thought we were meeting here
so we could apologize to each other.

231
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,850
I didn't expect to be confronted
with such revolting threats.

232
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,601
-A-ri, please.
-Ms. Seo.

233
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,939
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

234
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,236
My wife and I aren't
in a position to apologize,

235
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,363
and we certainly aren't threatening you.

236
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,117
It's more like we… allow.

237
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,076
That's just a warning.

238
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,036
-Honey, please stop!
-Ms. Seo.

239
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,873
It's best you settle
while this offer's still here.

240
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,626
I mean, if you're not dating Jun-kyoung,
what's with the bravado?

241
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,545
[dramatic music playing]

242
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:38,215
Status, one's class, and place.
You know them, right?

243
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,762
Not to mention what you should be doing.

244
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,348
Tae-jeon, it's enough.

245
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,438
This display has been a joke.

246
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,106
What?

247
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,567
Let's go.

248
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,612
[Tae-jeon] Hey, Han Jun-kyoung!

249
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,204
[sighs]

250
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,499
Is this the reason
why you told me to go see A-ri?

251
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,919
So you could start interrogating A-ri
in front of Jun-kyoung?

252
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,005
I checked her background,
and her level was too low, okay, huh?

253
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,133
What I did was try to be considerate
and end things on a good note.

254
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,468
Oh, but what? [sighs]

255
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,345
A revolving threat? From me?

256
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,222
Yes.

257
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,599
You did exactly that.

258
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,186
And Jun-kyung was right to call you out.

259
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,646
That was a total joke.

260
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,490
[beeps]

261
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,869
[elevator chimes]

262
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,254
[beeps]

263
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,631
We can take my car. I'll drive you home.

264
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,633
-I'm good.
-I know you are.

265
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,261
But this once,
you need to listen to what I say.

266
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,391
Regardless of how crass his methods were,
he was right.

267
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,559
Ms. Seo,

268
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,769
you're in no position to say no.

269
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,147
I know what kind of person you are.

270
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,067
But you'll get hurt if you keep trying
to do everything your way.

271
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,613
I don't care if I do.

272
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,699
I'm not going to stop doing what I want.

273
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,118
And what I want right now

274
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,414
is to not spend another moment
in this elevator with you.

275
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,000
[elevator doors open]

276
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,515
[engine turns over]

277
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,100
[engine rumbling]

278
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,479
[engine roars]

00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,232
[exhales shakily]

280

[tires screech]

281
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,044
[dramatic music playing]

282
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,640
What are you doing?

283
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,393
I'm trying something different
since you won't listen to me.

284
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,313
Not wanting to spend
another moment with me?

285
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,358
You would do better
to lose that mindset, Ms. Seo.

286
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,236
'Cause I'm why you'll stay safe.

287
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,031
Can't you see?

288
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,284
I can do whatever I want
without fear of what happens.

289
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,203
It isn't the same for you.

290
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,666
So you should listen to me.

291
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,543
I don't want you
to have to go through what happened again.

292
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,046
Especially not when I'm there.

293
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,382
Watching.

294
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,677
[pensive music playing]

295
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,476
[Yong-tae] Hey, dickhead,
mop with little muscles, okay?

296
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,644
[Myeong-ho] Hey, bro!

297
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,855
Bro.

298
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,481
-[Yong-tae] Mm-hmm?
-Hey. [inhales]

299
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,819
Why'd you come here yourself?
You could've just sent a guy.

300
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,529
Your cut this month.

301
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,783
Thanks to those assholes you sent me,
business has been really thriving.

302
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,330
Well, there's a lot of crazy bastards
that lose it over supercars, huh?

303
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,791
And also… [inhales]

304
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,293
…know what's up with this?

305
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,627
Huh?

306
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,129
This.

307
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,630
Jin Chae-hee.

308
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,886
This is the club, right?
It's like she's on something.

309
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,554
[chuckles]

310
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,722
That's bullshit, man.

311
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,099
Hey, come on, my wife told me
that she had to be, though.

312
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,101
She said the eyes are a dead giveaway.

313
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,896
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

314
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,647
She's drunk there.

315
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,068
Don't you know this bitch puts on
a whole show when she's blacked out?

316
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,944
She's famous for it.

317
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,489
-[chuckles] Man…
-Really?

318
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,618
-That's really all it was, huh?
-[Yong-tae sighs]

319
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,829
Yeah, so stop talking nonsense
and leave me. I've got to open up now.

320
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,123
Drugs in my club?

321
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,209
You think I'm gonna get screwed
alongside that bitch?

322
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,089
That's odd.
My wife was positive that's what it was.

323
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,593
-I guess she must've had a lot.
-That's it, okay?

324
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,054
Yeah, dammit. That bitch
has been driving me crazy lately.

325
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,098

Mr. Han's here.

329
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,407
Hey, why are you here so late?

330
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,535
Why else, though? I'm here for a reason.

331
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,036
[scoffs]

332
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,497
Reason?

333
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,462
You called me over the other day

334
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,132
because you thought
it would mess with A-ri, didn't you?

335
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,175
Oh, that?

336
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,221
Man, she seems exhausting, right?

337
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,098
She sure has quite the temper.

338
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,269
I mean, I'm not worried since you said
there was nothing going on, but…

339
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,688
You should date women
more suitable for you, huh?

340
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,189
It's about time you did.

341
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,317
Maybe you should start worrying.

00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,961
don't end up overstepping, okay?

349
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,714
And that, it's handled.

350
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,216
That's the thing.
Fix it before I have to, okay?

351
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,093
What?

352
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,596
Chae-hee and Si-hyeon
probably know nothing,

353
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,222
but how bad is it?

354
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,724
Coma? Brain-dead?

358
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,615
Maybe that's a big deal
to ordinary people, but not us.

359
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,658
It should be easy to make it disappear.

360
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,454
So I wonder why you had to step in
if it's so easy.

361
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,123
Maybe it wasn't so trivial after all.

362
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,835
And that's why you had to step in
and get A-ri out of the picture.

363
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,422
Just what do you think
you're trying to do here?

364
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,175
Shouldn't you handle it
before I get more involved?

365
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,093
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

366

Come on now.

You're really putting me
in a tough spot, Jun-kyoung.

371

Didn't you say someone in your position
doesn't make threats?

372
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,240
You're right, we don't do such things,

373
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,951
since whatever we want, we can just do.

I'm not threatening you.

377
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,332
This is just a courtesy warning.

378
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,835
Best of luck with the cleanup.

379
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,046

Let's go. Got a golf lesson.

522
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,726
Come on, what's the rush?
Really. Have a seat.

523
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,811
Hey, let go.

524
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,813
COMMENTS

525
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,399
I see. She's gotten under your skin?

526
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,735
Want me to get rid of her?

527
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,570
[pensive music playing]

528
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,991
-Really?
-[chuckles] I knew that was it.

529
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,702
You all must be so angry right now.

530
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,581
Don't worry.
I'll take care of A-ri very soon.

531
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,584
I am the reason, after all,
that loser's even here.

532
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,961
It's only fair that I end her.

533
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,755
Don't you think?

534
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,759
[chuckles softly]

535
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,930
[indistinct chatter]

536
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,943
-[tires screech]
-[Jeong-sun] Watch… A-ri!

537
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,736
-[horn honks]
-Hey, A-ri! Come on!

538
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,737
The light's still red.

539
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,364
What's with you today?

540
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:23,201
-Uh, sorry, I'm just out of it.
-Oh, what is it? Is something wrong?

541
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,704
Uh, nothing. It's nothing.

542
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,039
What shops did we get
the preorders from again?

543
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,999
Three seventeen and at six ten, right?

544
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,084
Uh-huh.

545
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,421
God, you really scared me. [exhales]

546
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,591
[A-ri] What do you mean
you aren't able to fulfill our order?

547
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:43,179
Look, right here.
It says I preordered 5,000 units from you.

548
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,223
[sighs] Well, we can't now.

549
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,476
We can't get you that order,
so try again later.

550
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,188
Wait! You can't say no
and think you can just walk away.

551
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,442
We've already sold out the preorders
that you guaranteed to provide us.

552
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,193
We have to start shipping them out.

553
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,528
But I said I can't.

554
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,947
My hands are tied,
don't you see that? [scoffs]

555
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,115
[A-ri] Please, ma'am!

556
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,120
[sucks teeth]

557
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,373
[woman] I already told you!
We can't do it, so leave me alone!

558
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,168
[Jeong-sun] Seriously?
None of this makes any sense!

559
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,003
[woman] Make sense or not,
a no is still a no!

560
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,629
Ugh, are you kidding me?

561
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,592
You know we ordered this dress first.
You had no right to give our order away!

562
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,178
What was I supposed to do?
They marked it as exclusive!

563
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,889
They picked that exact item,
so we can't sell it to you!

564
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,766
[Jeong-sun] You've got to be kidding.
How's this possible--

565
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,726
Someone designated
these items as exclusive?

566
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,102
Who did? Who was it?

567
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,730
[sighs, groans]

568
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,398
[A-ri] Ma'am, please!

569
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,235
[groans] Besta Room.
Besta Room made them exclusive.

570
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,572
Since you're in the business,
you should be aware.

571
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,741
In Dongdaemun,
Besta Room runs everything here.

572
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,203
I understand that this may cause
a lot of trouble for you,

573
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,871
but what choice do I have?

574
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,873
Hwang Yu-ri.

575
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:56,336
If I get on that bitch's bad side,
I would be in the same spot as you two.

576
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,837
Ugh!

577
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,674
[Jeong-sun breathes shakily]

578
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,136
A-ri, what do we do now?
We already received all the payments.

579
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,598
Should we look at another store?
They might carry the same products.

580
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,768
Don't you know
what an exclusive purchase is?

581
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,770
It means no store

582
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,649
is allowed to sell us
any of these products.

583
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,236
-[Mr. Park] Really, Besta Room?
-[man 1] Yeah.

584
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,779
This is that, you know.

585
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,532
She put an exclusive deal
on a bunch of items,

586
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,909
and some up-and-comer
had tried to reserve them first.

587
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,121
God, Hwang Yu-ri may be a bitch,
but she's one savvy businesswoman.

588
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,748
So which store lost out then?

589
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,417
Who was it? Ari.&, was it?

590
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:38,920
[grunts]

591
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:40,880
Ari, what?

592
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,217
Well, something like that.
Ari something, maybe.

593
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,012
Oh, I think I heard that A-ri
was the name of the owner. Seo A-ri.

[sighs]

605
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,808
[A-ri] Those exclusive items
Hwang Yu-ri posted,

606
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,018
they were mine first.

607
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,477
She stole all of them.

608
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,063
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would she do this?

609
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,482
"Watch your step, or you'll get hurt."

610
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,028
"Fly too high, and you'll regret it."

611
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,071
That's right.

612
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,491
That's how things were.
And that was a rule of the land.

613
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,454
Whatever you witnessed,
whatever they did to you,

614
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,832
you were just supposed
to shut up and take it.

615
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,293

617
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,756
SHE BOSSES THEM AROUND TOO.

618
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,928
A-ri, I think you need
to hurry home right now. [exhales]

619
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,804
[brother] Yeah, sure.

620
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,140
Uh, but the thing is…
No, the thing is…

621
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,185
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but we'll get you refunded right away.

622
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,770
I told you already.

623
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,397
I will give you a refund
as soon as we can.

624
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,483
[brother] Not at all.
We tried our best, but we're--

625
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,902
[Mrs. A-ri] Come on!
What do you want us to do?

626
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,737
This is all
'cause some bitch stole our stuff.

627
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,405
You think we're happy we have to do this?

628
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,740
Oh, ma'am!

629
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,034
You can't treat them like that,
or it could be bad for us!

630
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,496
And just how much worse could it get?
Can't you see how badly this hit us?

631
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,541
We're getting cancellations from people
who say they can't trust our products.

632
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,962
Exactly what are we going to do
with all this goddamn clothing now?

633
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,630

-[alarm device chimes]

636
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,283
[A-ri] And as usual,
my temper got the best of me.

637
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,661
I couldn't just lie down and take it.

638
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,204
I was furious.

639
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,455
I had been wronged.

640
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,582
And the more I thought about it,

641
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:27,338
I couldn't come up with a single reason
why I deserved all this bullshit.

642
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,141
[Min-hye] Oh please,
I hardly did anything.

643
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,184
No, don't worry.

644
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,479
She was starting to get on my nerves,
so I was gonna do that anyways.

645
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,106
[Min-hye] I know, she's the worst.

646
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,567
Only you could've done
something like this.

647
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,570
Besta Room needs to show her
who's in charge.

648
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,655
What was it? Seo A-ri?

649
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,658
I'll give her this, she knows her fashion.

650
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,368
Everything we posted instantly sold out.

651
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,997
It wasn't because of the products.
It's your name that sells.

652
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,458
Oh, and you remember? Twenty percent.

653
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,962
Because I was the one who tipped you off.
I trust you'll do the right thing.

654
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,380
[chuckles]

655
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,884
Yes, my dear.
You know I pay back what I owe, right?

656
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,053
Yeah, I'll be in touch.

657
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,015
-[phone line ends]
-Unbelievable.

658
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,685
It's as if they never pretended
to be besties. [scoffs]

659
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,605
Again,
this work has no true friends anyways.

660
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,899
-[woman 1] Yu-ri.
-Okay, let's start.

661
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,734
[woman 2] I told you, you can't do this.

662
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,569
[A-ri] And I told you
I need to see your boss.

663
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,447
-[woman 2] Ugh, but, ma'am--
-Once I see your boss, I'll be on my way.

664
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,324
[woman 2 scoffing]

665
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,118
-What's this?
-Uh, well, I…

666
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,661
Uh, excuse me!

667
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,121
Excuse me! [scoffs]

668
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,999
You're Besta Room's CEO, aren't you?

669
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,293
I'm Seo A-ri.

670
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:49,962
[exhales]

671
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,132
-It's fine. You can go.
-Ma'am.

672
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,344
[Yu-ri clears throat]

673
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,054
Seo A-ri?

674
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,305
Seo A-ri…

675
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,185
-I don't recall.
-You should know me well. Ari.&.

676
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,730
You made some items I reserved exclusive
over at Dongdaemun.

677
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,857
-Like some kind of snake.
-[scoffs]

678
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,735
Oh, sweetie.
It seems you forgot your manners.

679
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,820
"Sweetie"?

680
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,864
I think you're the one who needs
to be reminded of their manners.

681
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,076
-What? Hey, you--
-[A-ri] That's enough.

682
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,995
I have something to say to you,
so shut up and listen.

683
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,872
You got me once,
but it won't happen again.

684
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,458
I'm well aware
of how much influence you think you have,

685
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,336
but I warn you, if you do this again,
I won't sit back and no nothing.

686
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,632
Now that we've gotten to know each other,
let me tell you what I think of you.

687
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,467
You abuse what little power you have

688
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,345
to step on, to lord over,
and torture others.

689
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,014
It's all so immature,
pitiful, and pathetic.

690
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,641
It's sad you can't see it for yourself.

691
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,103
Why, you little bitch.
Just who do you think you are?

692
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,062
What?

693
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,189
"Immature?" "Pathetic?"

694
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,232
Are you done now?

695
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,191
Yeah.

696
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,110
I'm done.

697
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,279
[scoffs] Hey!

698
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
You.

699
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,159
I've been wondering why Min-hye
asked me to humble you. Is this why?

700
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,910
'Cause you don't know your place?

701
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,289
[chuckles]

702
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,168
Wow, get a load
of this crazy bitch, everyone, huh?

703
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,753
I mean, "Lord over?" "Torture?"

704
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,008
Hey, I'm going to lord
if I rule this castle. I won't grovel.

705
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,844
So listen, Ms. Seo A-ri,

706
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,554
my big sis.

707
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,763
You feel wronged?

708
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,057
If your feelings hurt, succeed.

709
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,935
Make it to the top
so you can lord over others.

710
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,106
I fought tooth and nail
to get exactly where I am today.

711
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,358
All so I can lord over others, you know.

712
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,694
I am not claiming to be a hotshot

713
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,529
because I am actually a hotshot!

714
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,159
How dare you try to lecture me on life?
Lectured by pathetic garbage like you?

715
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,912
[scoffs]

716
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,538
Hey, yeah, deal me in.

717
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,498
I think I'm gonna get lucky today,

718
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,876
seeing as that crazy bitch
is the one with all the bad luck.

719
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,586
[women chuckle]

720
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:00,927
[A-ri] Bbb.

721
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,723
Do you have any more info on Hwang Yu-ri?
I don't care how small. Anything will do.

722
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,641
[whooshes]

723
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,727
[alert chimes]

724
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,064
TYPING…

725
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,572
-What are you doing?
-You had a spot open.

726
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,825
The game would be more fun
with more people, don't you think?

727
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,661
I even know the rules.

728
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,372
-Hold'em, right?
-[scoffs]

729
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,332
What's wrong? Feeling uncomfortable?

730
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,583
Or are you feeling scared?

731
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,087
I'm sorry, but this game is supposed--

732
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,880
It's fine. Let her.

733
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,051
Do you have what it takes, though?

734
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,762
-We don't do under a thousand here.
-Yeah?

735
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,555
Then…

736
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,142
would this be enough to spice things up?

737
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,398
[chuckles]

738
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,568
Dealer, let's go. Start dealing.

739
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,075
[dramatic music playing]

740
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,249
Twenty.

741
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,545
[woman 1] Call.

742
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,716
[woman 2] Fold.

743
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,180
[A-ri] Raise.

744
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,641
Five hundred.

745
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,684
[scoffs]

746
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,478
[Yu-ri] Call.

747
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,564
Fold.

748
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:45,948
[A-ri] One million.

749
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:48,951
[scoffs]

750
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,079
[sighs]

751
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,957
Call.

752
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,755
Two million.

753
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,799
Are you insane?

754
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,468
Do you actually know the rules?

755
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,888
No limit.
I can raise as much as I want.

756
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,681
[scoffs]

757
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,100
Call.

758
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,191
-Five million.
-Enough.

759
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,776
Do you think we're gambling here?

760
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,277
This is supposed to be a game!

761
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,613
I know, but this game is serious.

762
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,699
That's why I'm betting
what you charge clients for your services.

763
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,535
-What?
-VIPs.

764
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,122
[dramatic music playing]

765
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,958
Famous e-celebs,
even beauty pageant winners.

766
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,087
I heard brokers for VIPs make lists
of women that they can hand out

767
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,464
to people in positions of power.

768
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,301
That's how you made your money, Ms. Hwang.

769
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,387
Five hundred thousand,
then a million, then two million,

770
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,554
all the way to five million.

771
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,848
You made your money whoring yourself out,

772
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,975
selling clothes,
and making connections to gain power.

773
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,894
-Besta Room's secret.
-What are you accusing me of?

774
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,020
This!

775
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,356
My bets are exactly what you charged.

776
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,317
You fought tooth and nail
to get where you are?

777
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,903
I've had to do the same.
I've always had to.

778
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,988
And I don't plan on backing down
anytime soon.

779
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,701
Show them.
You told me to fight to the top.

780
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,037
Do you think…

781
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,540
you can beat Seo A-ri?

782
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,583
[chuckles]
