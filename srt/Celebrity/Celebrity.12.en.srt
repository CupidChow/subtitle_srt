Hello, everyone. This is Ji-na speaking.

177
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,357
Today I am here
to apologize to all of you.

178
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,568
Oh! Baby, please forgive me!

179
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,777
You whore!

180
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,238
You've been selling your body all along?

181
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,531
[woman 1] Here! Over here!

182
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,367
-[woman 2] Do you admit to malpractice?
-[man 1] What's going through your head?

183
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,329
[detective] You are under arrest
for partaking in illicit narcotics.

184
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,624
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to request an attorney.

185
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,126
You also have the right
to refuse to say anything unfavorable.

186

My family has a shit ton of lawyers!

187

-Stop it!

Hey, call my brother! Tae-jeon!

Can you really live without me?

190
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,969
[Ho-won] Speak for yourself.
Can you live without my money?

191
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,722
With nothing, though?
Nothing else but that body of yours!

192
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,433
Please forgive me just this once.

193
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,268
I'm talking about the allegations

194
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,520
that I've been selling
knockoff luxury items.

195
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:50,232
I want to take this opportunity
to tell you how sorry I am.

196
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,942
I would like to apologize

197
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,737
for causing our nation such distress.

198
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,697
Did you really act under Mr. Jin?

199
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,743
He asked me to take care of the patient,
and I knew nothing more.

[camera shutters clicking]

201
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,455
But I did the best I could to save him.

202
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,124
We'll be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

203
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,126
Min-chan's confession? It won't hold up.

204
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,462
Correct, sir.
We just transported a critical patient.

205
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,756
It's their fault they failed
to take the correct measures.

206
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,965
And Mr. An?

207
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,550
You sent him to Yong-tae?

208
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,969
-Make sure you shut up that asshole.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,848
[sighs] Shit.

Hey, it's me, An Jae-hun.

214
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,158
I heard you wanted me.

215
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:42,993
[loud thud]

216
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,747
Going somewhere?

217
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,459
How did you get in here?

218
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,378
Seriously, Min-hye?

219
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,715
I thought friends share
each other's house codes.

Yu-rang, your timing's perfect.

224
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,058
Take my bags. We'll keep them with you
until we know it's safe.

225
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,685
Here, take this.

-The Birkin.

[Yu-rang] Um…

00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,232
Are you sure I'll have enough room?

229
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,193

-[Min-hye sighs]

232
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,160
-What's wrong?
-My husband, his family,

233
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,538

Why'd you do it?

236

If what A-ri's saying is the truth,

237
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,005
you're the one who wrote
that original post.

238
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,507
We're supposed to be friends, Min-hye.

239
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,885
Close enough
to share each other's passcodes.

240
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,345
So tell me. How could you
stab me in the back like this?

241
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,181
You talked about my husband online!

242
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,224
Hey! Are you insane?

That's a Birkin! What the fuck? Ugh!

It's from Hermès.

-What?

Everything you did to make sure the space
was filled with designer goods,

251
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,288
I know all about it.

252
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,207
Oh Min-hye,

253
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,794
I was your number one lackey, wasn't I?

254
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,463
[Min-hye] You're wrong.

255
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,300
There's no reason for us to be fighting.
We're best friends. No one's closer.

256
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,928
Shut the fuck up, you stupid bitch!

"The Seo A-ri livestream incident,"

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,122
this case has shook the world,

262
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,124
sending everyone into a frenzy.

263
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,167
But wait.

264
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,670
What could have done this?

265
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,506
Apparently,
the livestream was not Seo A-ri

266
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,341
but rather operated by a third party.

267
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,634
Introducing the deepfake.

268
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,721
Yeah, a deepfake is a combination
of "deep learning" and "fake."

269
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,349
It uses AI technology
to edit someone's face

270
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,602
onto a different person's face
in photos and videos almost seamlessly.

271
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,564
At this time, it is safe to assume
that Miss Seo A-ri's livestream

272
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,192
which has been quite the talk of the town,
is a textbook example of a deepfake.

275
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,494
[anchor 1] Now, the question remains

276
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,162
exactly what punishment

277
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,957
can we expect to see
those involved receive?

278
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,045
Especially for the attorney Jin Tae-jeon,
the CEO of Taegang law firm,

279
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,299
as well as the anonymous user
known as "bbbfamous."

280
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,343
Someone who gains more and more attention
as the story unfolds.

281
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,096
This incident has sparked comments
from the public like,

282
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,307
"Trolls like these
deserve severe punishment."

283
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,267
[man 2] Right.
Leaving such hostile comments

284
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,102
is considered by the law
an act of violence

285
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,062
that could destroy someone's life.

286
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,940

that such comments are undeniably a crime.

-Mmm.

are doing drugs or God knows what else?

after the incident already happened, sir.

00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,773
Okay?

347
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,153
Mr. Hwang, you seem to have misunderstood
why you're here. Let me clarity.

348
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,573
I called you down here
to discuss another charge.

349
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,491
What?

350
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,243
Oh, I mean,
selling drugs is a serious offense,

351
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,497
but those aren't the only crimes
you have committed, right?

352
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,003
Han Jun-kyoung.
Remember you tried to kill him?

353
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,048
[dramatic music playing]

354
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,220
[panting]

355
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,346
I'm Mr. Hwang's lawyer.

356
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,473
-Thank God you're--
-[lawyer] Don't say another word.

357
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,016
From this moment on,

358
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,560
you can only question him
when his attorney's present.

359
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,314
[sighs]

360
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,236

361
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,531
[sighs]

362
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,620
Ah, why isn't this asshole
picking up the phone, huh?

-[man 1 heaving]
-[man 2] The bathroom. No, don't throw up!

364
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,501
-Just… Jesus Christ! Come on.
-[man 1 groaning]

365
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,128
[man 2] Come on.

366
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,506
What's wrong with you?
Why would you drink and drive, huh?

367
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,674
[man 1 vomits]

368
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,093
[man 2 scoffs]
They're gonna throw you in the slammer.

369
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,429
[man 1] I'm so sorry. [heaves, coughs]

370
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,515
-[man 2] Excuse me, sir.
-[sighs]

371
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,433
What do you think you're doing?

372
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,353
[Tae-jeon sighs]

373
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,521
You know who I am?

374
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,774
-I'm from the law firm Taegang--
-Yeah, I'm aware.

375
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,819
You're all over TV right now.

376
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,237
But the rules apply to you too.

377
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,574
No one is permitted to smoke
in any public spaces, you understand?

378
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,367
Like, seriously.

379
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,286
-[man 1 vomits]
-[man 2] Yeah, there you go.

380
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,246
-You good?
-[man 1] Yeah, yeah.

381
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,915
This is why you shouldn't drink and drive.

382
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,083
Don't smoke in here again.

383
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,087

[sighs]

386
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,347
[Jun-kyoung] Are you trying
to call An Jae-hun?

387
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,932
You sent him to Yong-tae?

388
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,728
[pensive music playing]

389
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,981
[operator] The number you have dialed
can not be reached at the moment.

390
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,940
You…

391
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,651
Oh, I guess you didn't know I woke up.

392
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,987
We did keep it quiet, after all.

393
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,657
[inhales] It's been a while.

394
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,744
You know, I needed some time to catch you,

395
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,079
Jin Tae-jeon.

396
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,458
But excuse me, sir,
just what the hell are you saying?

397
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,128
Mr. Hwang admits
to all the charges against him.

398
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,549
It's true that under Mr. Jin's orders,
he caused that car accident intentionally.

399
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,718
-Wait, what the fuck, sir?
-Just shut it!

400
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,803
If you want to live too.

401
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,597
[breathes shakily]

402
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,682
Please, sir, go easy on this man.

403
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,685
Mr. Jin was the one who ordered him to.

404
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,604
[Yong-tae breathes shakily]

405
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,272
[Yong-tae exhales]

406
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,691
[Jun-kyoung] By now,
he'll have admitted to all the charges.

407
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,778
-[chuckles]
-You know why?

408
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,656
Because Mr. An and I met today.

409
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,535
Our legal team has proven
that Tae-jeon and Taegang

410
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,248
are the ones who made the order
for Mr. Hwang to cause that car accident.

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,378
In addition, we also uncovered
how you sabotaged Miss Seo

412
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,922
by forcing Miss Oh's hand
against her will.

413
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,802
So what will you do now?

414
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,471
Will you go down with Jin Tae-jeon?

415
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,890
Fight for Taegang, an already lost cause?

416
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,392
Or…

417
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,145
would you like to keep your law license?

418
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,106
What a joke.

419
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,732
[dramatic music playing]

420
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,651
That's not true.

421
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,612
You think I'll fall
for such a stupid trick?

422
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,948
You think Taegang's a joke, don't you?

423
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,034
Then why isn't Mr. An picking up?

424
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,496
Jin Tae-jeon,

425
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,499
this is your new reality.

-[dramatic music continues]

A police station.

428
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,754
A filthy, cramped bathroom.

429
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,173
A scumbag criminal.

430
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,384
This new status

431
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,970
fits you very well.

432
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,895

That's not true.

[chuckles]

436
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,033
No, no.

437
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,286
[sighs] That can't be true.

438
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,039
Who do you think I am?

439
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,459
Huh? I'm fucking Jin Tae-jeon!

-Ms. Yoon requested me?
-Yeah, as soon as you're available.

You know her, right?
Of the Haeum Foundation.

-Yeah.
-She's a top VIP.

445

Treat her well, okay? Hmm?

Uh, it's such an honor
to serve you like this.

I'll begin by rinsing your feet.

00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,847
What kind of oil should I use?
Would you like to try them first?

455
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,812
I'm just going to pick one out myself.

[breathes deeply]

459
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,169
Sorry, but you should answer
when they ask you a question.

460
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,629
If you're going to act this way,
why'd you--

461
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,089
[A-ri] I was curious.

462
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,758
What kind of person are you?

463
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,679

Who are you?

was just a trap to catch you.

Really?

But still, most people go
about their lives oblivious to this.

But, you know, we need to be aware
of the actions we've taken.

520
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,457
We need to know there's no escaping
the consequences of those actions.

521
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,584
We all have a price to pay
for the choices we've made,

522
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,085
no matter what our intentions.

523
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,130
Don't try to avoid it.
You won't be able to anyways.

524
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,509
Of course, the law will deal with you.

525
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:21,264
But you need to be exposed to the public
for everyone to see.

526
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,392
You'll become nothing more
than meat for the world to tear apart.

[breathes shakily]

528
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,937
How does it feel to be in my shoes now,

529
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,522
Lee Seon-yeong?

530
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,067
Fucking answer me.

531
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,610
Why'd you do it?

532
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,362
What were you hoping
to get out of all this?

533
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,198
-Shut up, you fucking bitch!

[Si-hyeon] A-ri!

00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,091
-What… What's wrong?
-Let go!

[Seon-yeong breathing shakily]

00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,616
[gasps] Oh, oh, oh, oh!

543
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,826
Cockroaches!

[women screaming]

545
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,540
Oh my God, cockroaches!

[dramatic sting]

549
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,857
What in the hell did I do wrong?

550
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
What did I do?

551
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,905
Wait, what are you doing?

552
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,993
[Seon-yeong laughing]

553
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,581
Who gives you the right
to lecture me, huh?

554
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,959
Those fuckers?

555
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,045
The Gabin Society who always bragged?

556
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,965
They deserve what they got.

557
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,886
They would spend what I would in a month
on a single meal.

558
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,764
I'll never earn that money,
no matter how hard I try.

559
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,807
You people spend it all in one day.

560
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,269
[laughing]

00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,395
[sighs]

562
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:37,734
All those clothes,
designer clothes, supercars.

563
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,152
You keep flaunting it,

564
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,738
and it makes us feel even shittier
about our lives.

565
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,365
Is it that frigging hard
to share with others?

566
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,702
Do you have to rub it in our faces too?

567
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,371
So please just shut up.

568
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,707
You people are driving me crazy!

[breathing heavily]

570
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,252
Now you're going to say,

571
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,588
"Oh no!"

Well, that's fucking funny.

575
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,853
You can go fuck yourselves.

576
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,440
This whole world can go fuck itself.

577
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,446
[breathes shakily]

578
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,782
Oh no!

[dramatic music playing]

580
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,583
[Seon-yeong laughing]
I wish you fucking bitches would just die.

581
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,543
You fuckers.

582
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,962
Kill yourself, Seo A-ri!
How is she still alive?

583
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,255
That crazy bitch, Oh Min-hye.

584
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,757
Bitches like you deserve to fucking die.
You fucking whores!

585
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,968
You motherfucking crazy bitch!

[laughing]

00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:50,139

[music halts abruptly]

590
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,401
We appreciate your cooperation.
We'll be in touch very soon.

591
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,861
Thanks for the hard work.

592
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,628
Are you okay now?

593
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,882
[A-ri breathes deeply]

594
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,600
This isn't how I wanted it to go.

[sighs]

596
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,854
All I wanted to do was fix this
and make everything right.

597
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,606
I know, A-ri.

598
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:46,112
Thankfully, her injuries
aren't as serious as we thought.

599
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,407
Once she's recovered,

600
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,453
she'll pay the price
for all of her crimes.

601
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,081

00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,716
Jun-kyoung.

-[tender music playing]
-[Si-hyeon] I told him to come here.

After all, no one else

607
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,184
has longed for your return
as much as he did.

608
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,979
I couldn't tell you before. Sorry.

609
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,327
Jun-kyoung, nobody told me
that you were awake.

610
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,954
How did you--

611
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,290
No need to worry about that.
At least not now.

612
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,804
Don't you ever again,

613
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,765
for whatever reason
that you might have,

614
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:56,766
disappear.

Lee Seon-yeong, 32.
Lives at Jangmun-ro 35-gil, Yongsan-gu.

618
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,675
Apparently, "Lee Eun-chae"
was the alias she was using.

619
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,177
You say her laptop
was filled with recordings?

620
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,846
Like you wouldn't believe.

621
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,307
It ranged from customer's conversations
she recorded while massaging them,

622
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,935
to screenshots she got
by stealing the password of their phones.

623
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,563
It seems that's how
she got her inside info.

624
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,732
[scoffs] She's a total psychopath.

625
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,068
She was undergoing a lot of therapy
for depression, also.

626
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:53,781
Jesus Christ, this world is filled
with colorful nut jobs.

627
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,659
Oh, and did you see
the state of her house?

628
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,287
You're supposed to know a person
from how they live, but this was a dump.

629
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,539
-That's enough. Stop it.
-What?

630
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,083
You should be talking shit about your boss
'cause I can take it.

to be here in my own home.

[breathes deeply]

642
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,281
It's a relief, though,
that they released you on probation.

643
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,240
A relief?

644
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,161
Yoon Jeong-sun. And you too, Du-seong.

645
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,996
I was ready to give you
a piece of my mind.

646

Where's your decency?

647
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,918
How could you hide A-ri from me
this whole time?

648
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,254
Do you have any idea
how much that's eaten me up inside?

649
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,714
I'm so sorry, Mom.

650
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,925
I mean, you're quite the blabbermouth. Uh…

651
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,094
What? What did you say?

652
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,721
Uh, uh, sorry, uh… [chuckles]

653
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,098
You'd know eventually.

654
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,101
You know, you are just the worst, huh?

655
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,436
What did you say to me?
I'm a blabbermouth, huh? Say it!

656
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,190
Please, ma'am, calm down.
I know, but he's not that wrong, though.

657
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,235
Just how would it succeed if you knew?

658
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,237
It would've ended before we started.

659
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,365
Ugh! How could you?
You feel the same way too?

660
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,617
Oh, you… [scoffs]

661
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,452
Ugh.

662
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,037
Wait.

Where's that brat now?

-You'll need to keep this quick.

-Yes, I understand.

[pensive music playing]

670
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,643
[Si-hyeon] So you really are here.

671
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,354
Si-hyeon.

672
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,903
Jun-kyoung said you'd be.

673
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,532
He also said you report everything you do
and everywhere you choose to go.

674
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,118
Yeah. [chuckles]

675
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,704
I just wanted to see it.

676
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,086
I suppose this place
is going to be cleaned up soon.

677
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,382
I bet you're thinking

678
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,846
Lee Seon-yeong was someone
who was able to only exist in this place.

679
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:08,809
And that bbbfamous was the only thing
with actual meaning in her life.

680
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,395
Yeah.

681
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,065
Maybe that's why.

682
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,568
But now I'm here,
this place just seems sad

683
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,906
rather than a nightmare.

684
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,918
[Si-hyeon chuckles softly]

685
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,712
Have you seen this?

00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,096
[Si-hyeon sighs]

687
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,726

that supports you, A-ri.
