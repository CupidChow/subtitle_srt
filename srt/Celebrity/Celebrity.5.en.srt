of a rich guy's house.

171
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm sure you're capable
of having a meal by yourself, hmm?

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,417
[Si-hyeon] Don't play with kind people
based on your whims like this.

185
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,920
Whenever you play these little games,
someone gets hurt.

186
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,507
[Jun-kyoung] That doesn't apply to you.
You turned out fine, Si-hyeon.

187
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,593
Since I was the one

188
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,429
who got hurt.

[giggling]

201
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,530
I didn't want to be late
after inviting you, so I ran here.

202
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,450
It's so amazing
to spend time together now, isn't it?

-What, you didn't know?

206
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,884
I'm a cradle Christian.
So, yeah, I go to Jeong-su Church.

207
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,093
It's in Samseong-dong.

208
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,930
And the biggest church in Gangnam.
I'm a deacon.

209
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,605
Oh, but also, you shouldn't ever talk
about religion on social media.

210
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,981
Politics too.

211
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,692
Remember that
because it doesn't help with sales at all.

212
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,320
Uh, sure. [chuckles awkwardly]

213
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,197
This is the tea I sell.

214
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,116
It's great at flushing the fat out.

215
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,620
[sighs] Thought it's not
like you have any fat to flush out,

216
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,497
so you probably don't need to drink any.

217
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,252
So, uh, why did you want to see me?

218
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,169
Hmm?

219
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,588
Ah.

220
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,757
Oh! Oh God. [chuckles]

221
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,634
Well, I could show you around my studio,

222
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,512
but I Invited you
because I want to be friends.

223
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,264
-Friends with me?
-A-ri.

224
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,517
Think of me
like I'm your cool older sister.

225
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,060
I am two years older than you.

226
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,437
You want us to be like sisters?

227
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,524
Listen, A-ri.
You won't make it alone in this world.

228
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,526
You must connect.

229
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,904
Big sis will help you out.
I'll mediate between Chae-hee and you.

230
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,573
Oh, you don't have to--

231
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,700
Just listen to my advice
and make up with her.

232
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,201
Just let go of this grudge.

233
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,330
Think about it. What do you have to gain
from a strained relationship

234
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,915
with these famous people?

235
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,667
You know?

236
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,839
[A-ri] What? Angela used to be a bar girl?

237
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,258

-[man 1] But it's true…

-[man 2] That old pervert…

-[girl 4] His wife's breasts…

240
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,095
-[man 3] And shows them off…
-[girl 5] At that…

-[girl 1] Digging…

244
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,439
[girl 2] You'll find they all
have so much to hide.

245
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,024
-[girl 3] All that…
-[man 2] Money they piss away…

246
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,734
[girl 4] Where do you think it comes from?

247
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,655
I'm Angela. Nice to meet you.

248
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,162
These are all top-tier, right?

249
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,622
We can't be too careful.

250
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,625
We got a complaint
from some crazy bitch asking us

251
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,920
if they might be knock-offs.

252
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,464
[Min-hye] I've put checkmarks on them.

253
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,300
So copy them with minor changes,
and put in the production order.

254
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,217
Okay.

You've really helped me,

268

and we've been DMing each other
for a while.

269
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,509
It seems like I should
at least know your name.

270
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,178
Honestly, I did find it a little weird

271
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,430
that this complete stranger

272
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,432
was sending me messages
wanting to help me.

273
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:19,561
I just couldn't figure out how this person
knew all these secrets.

274
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,231
I thought,
"Who are they? And what do they do?"

275
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,232
"Or wait,

276
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,901
are they even telling me the truth?"

It's true.

I thought that maybe

00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,204
I could actually have that life.

Why did you even want to come
to Dongdaemun this late at night?

Shouldn't you be shopping

-I'm not here to buy anything.

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,516
We'll inform you
when you can get your products.

338
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,685
-Great.
-[Jeong-sun] Ma'am, sorry to bother you.

339
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,396
I'd like to check this one out
when you can.

340
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,647
Hey, lady.

341
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,316
If you're here for retail,
go across the street to Doota.

342
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,943
They only care about talking wholesale.

343
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh my God, I'm not a lady, okay?

344
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,073
And also, I'm here for, um, wholesale too.

345
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:20,993
[scoffs]

346
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,871
[A-ri] Hmm.

347
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,707
I'll get this sweater in every color.
Except for mint, please.

348
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,418
Okay. You new? I've never seen you around.

349
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,838
I haven't been here before, but I heard
I could find some great stuff here.

350
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,550
I'm with Ari.&. No damaged products,
and I'll need a receipt.

351
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,302
[woman] Of course. Just a second.

352
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,973
What's going on?
Are you some kind of fashion expert now?

353
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,058
I came prepared because, remember,

354
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,810
I'm the daughter
of a textile factory owner.

355
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,188
Oh, right. [chuckles]

356
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,482
-[man 1] Right. Yeah.
-[man 2] Business good? [chuckles]

357
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,779
Oh God.
I told her to go to across the street.

358
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,782
Look. It's cute.

359
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,952
-This one too.
-[man] Mr. Park, you coming?

360
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,662
[Jang] Yeah, be right there.

361
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,168
[A-ri] Mmm…

362
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,966
[Yu-rang] What? Hey, look at this.

363
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,011
Isn't this A-ri's bestie?

364
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,847
They both posted
that they went to Dongdaemun together.

365
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,724
-Dongdaemun?
-Mm-hmm.

366
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,065
Why go to a wholesaler?

367
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,818
Does she want to build some kind
of shopping mall or something?

368
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,903
What's she doing?

369
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,781
[keyboards clicking rapidly]

370
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,582
Good, right? I made it modern
and desaturated, like you said.

371
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,502
Wow, this is the first time
you've ever been useful.

372
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,628
[chuckles]

373
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
Yeah? You're getting me a computer, right?

374
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,882
-[hisses]
-Just wait until this idea blows up,

375
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,842
A-ri can get you
your own internet café by then!

376
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,552
A-ri, you have to get me a Birkin!

377
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,221
-No, a Kelly! [squeals]
-[chuckles]

378
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,515
Hold on, that one.

379
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,891
I like that one better.

380
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,976
-Touch it up.
-[man] Sure.

381
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,520
Let's upload that one
and see what people think.

382
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:12,479
Got it.

383
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,107
[phone buzzes]

384
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,862
[Angela] You know about tonight, right?
It's at eight!

385
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,365
Chae-hee wants to bury the hatchet.
You have to come.

386
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,866
I'll be waiting for you!

387
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,244
-[party music playing]
-[cheering]

388
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,204
The queen is here.
Heading to the VIP room.

389
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,081
Ah, shit, we're royally fucked.

390
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,916
Going on standby, sir!

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,626
Hey, that fucking bitch is here.

392
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,354
How do you get hotter and hotter
every single time I see you?

393
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,189
-How?
-What's this? What's all the fuss about?

394
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,609
Ah, it's a reception fit for a queen.
Your loyal subjects better bend the knee.

395
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,988
-A bottle for every table, on me.
-Okay! Woo! Woo! Woo!

396
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,867
Hey, everybody, the queen is buying!
Everyone scream!

397
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,327
[all screaming]

398
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,456
THE QUEEN IS HERE!

399
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,128
Woo!

400
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,179
I've been feeling like shit
because of this stupid bitch, okay?

401
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,015
I gotta get her out of my system.
Is everything set?

402
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,267
Of course! You're the queen, aren't you?

403
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,437
[man 1] Hey, hey, hey!
Are all of you ready?

404
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,023
There's nothing she hates more
than being cut off. Remember that.

405
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,026
Tell her she looks 23,
and you'll get a hefty tip, yeah? Got it?

406
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,110
[all] Yes, sir.

407
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,696
Now move your asses!
If you're using makeup, hurry the fuck up!

408
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,907
-Hey, is everything ready?
-[man 2] Yeah, it's all set.

409
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,826
Shit, get out of the way.
[sucks teeth] Ah, fuck.

410
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,121
[chuckles]
They taste like apricot this time? Really?

411
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,415
You're bound to get tired
of the same old stuff you tried,

412
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,627
-so I prepared some new products for you.
-[Chae-hee] And the quality? Good stuff?

413
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,295
I promise you it's gonna rock your world.

414
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,506
Ah! Fuck yeah!
Get it to my room right now.

415
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,132
Okay, this'll be the night of your life!

416
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,259
You better get ready! [chuckles]
Here, here, here.

417
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,137
Yeah, let's get this party started!

418
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,099
Chae-hee.

419
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,936
Oh my god! Hey!

420
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,979
You look so amazing tonight, Chae-hee!

421
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,064
[Angela squeals]

422
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,108
What the fuck is this?

423
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,859
Why is that bitch here?

424
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,236
Hey, calm down.

425
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,113
I invited her so we could all make peace.

426
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,698
I mean, come on, A-ri and us,
we keep seeing each other around,

427
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,119
-so we should just--
-"A-ri and us?"

428
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,498
Did you just put that piece of shit
on the same level as me?

429
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,666
[Angela] Chae-hee.

430
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,959
That's not what I…

431
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,712
[screams] Jesus fucking Christ!
Listen, you stupid bitch.

432
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,423
"We'll see her around?"

433
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,426
You think you can make
these fucking decisions by yourself?

434
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,469
-[screams]
-[Angela gasps]

435
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,806
[exhales]

436
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,910
[Angela] A-ri, wait!

437
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,038
A-ri, you can't just leave like that!

438
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,415
What are you trying to do?

439
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,584
You told me Chae-hee
wanted to meet with me.

440
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,420
How can you expect a truce between us
when she didn't know I was coming?

441
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,590
-What made you think this would even work?
-God, wait a minute.

442
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,383
I have a brilliant plan.

443
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,927
I invited you
because I have this great idea.

444
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,722
-What are you talking about?
-Just calm down and wait it out.

445
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,432
Chae-hee's gonna mellow out soon.

446
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,935
She'll feel absolutely awesome,
and that's when you can talk to her.

447
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,812
What's going to make her mellow out?

448
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,105
[man 1] Hey, hurry, hurry.

449
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,232
[mysterious music playing]

450
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,075
I don't think it paints the best picture
when we meet in private like this.

451
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,330
Really?

452
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,833
Why did you ask to see me?

453
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,045
It's about Seo A-ri.

454
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,424
Are you close with her?
How do you two know each other?

455
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,803
I asked her if she wanted to go out,
and she rejected me.

456
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,389
But the more I see her, the more I think,

457
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,977
"Why does she act like that?
It really doesn't make any sense."

458
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,980
"She has no filter.
She picks fights for no reason."

459
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,857
Maybe that's why.

460
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,236
I'm very interested in her,
but she hates my guts.

461
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,197
It's strange, though.

462
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,699
I feel a bit odd now.

463
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,370
It's not the first time
I've been rejected,

464
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,372
but I just can't seem to get over it.

465
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,290
It's made me care more.

466
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,672
Just like years ago,

467
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,465
when you up and left
without telling me why.

468
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,301
[tender music playing]

469
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,328
[Jun-kyoung] I had absolutely no idea
why it happened.

470
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,706
And I got no explanation from you.

471
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,750
You just suddenly left
completely out of the blue.

472
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,421
[Jun-kyoung inhales deeply]

473
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,298
But I was fine with it.

474
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,968
I found closure, and I thought,
"She must have had her reasons."

475
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,350
[chuckles] Don't take it the wrong way.

476
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,269
I didn't call you
to tell me your reasons now.

477
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,562
You haven't changed at all.

478
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,024
You truly believe that

479
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,569
what happened back then
is that I was the one who left you?

480
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,321
[pensive music playing]

481
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,407
That you were the one who was hurt
and that I wasn't?

00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
[elevator chimes]

483
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,125
An Jae-hun. Reservation for three.

484
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,419
Mr. Jin, I see you're here as well.

485
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,049
Oh, I see you aren't here
to meet your wife. Apologies.

486
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,385
Your wife is already here, so I thought
you might have a reservation with her.

487
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,679
My wife is here right now?

488
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,015
[Jun-kyoung] Yoon Si-hyeon,

489
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,059
if there's one thing I'm sure of,
it's this.

490
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,269
Are you telling me
that my memory is incorrect?

491
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,397
"She must have had her reasons."

492
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,858
It's true.

493
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,610
I was the one that left you.

494
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,946
But the thing
that made me leave back then--

495
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,864

It really does taste like apricot.

God, the whole floor is like apricot.

503

The ceiling too. [chuckles]

00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,873
[Angela] Ugh, come on. Come back inside.

505
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,166
[A-ri] Hey, I said no.

506
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,794
Should definitely be game over by now.
Come look.

507
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,505
[gasps] Chae-hee.

508

511
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,183
Who is this?

512
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,227
What's her deal?

513
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,854
[Angela] Girl, it's cool.

514
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,816
This is A-ri. Seo A-ri.
You wanted to make peace with her tonight.

515
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,735
Make peace?

516
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,278
Did I fight her or something?

517
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,740
-You didn't.
-[Angela and Chae-hee chuckle]

518
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,366
You're pretty hot.

519
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,790
I guess you can follow me around,
my pretty little angel. [chuckles]

520
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,839
[Chae-hee breathing heavily]

[camera shutter clicking]

524
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,977
So, the person you had to meet,
it was Jun-kyoung?

525
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,812
[sighs] Yes.

526
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,982
-But I didn't know you would--
-Oh, a meeting.

527
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,358
And Mr. An is here as well.

528
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,987
Hey, man, you left me out
of a meeting with the missus?

529
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,572
A heads-up would be nice.

530
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,575
We had to meet in private, obviously.

531
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,826
We've all got secrets.

532
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,205
[inhales]

533
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,750
Anyway, please tell your father
that I'll visit within the next few days.

534
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,753
Okay.

535
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,797
I'll look into it and call you.

536
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,340
Hey, Jun-kyoung.

537
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,719
Why is it that you only seem to buddy up
to her in situations like this, huh?

538
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,471
[Jun-kyoung and Tae-jeon chuckle]

Chae-hee! [gasps]

542
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,313
What? What's wrong?

543
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,231
Honey.

544
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,235
What? Is this happening again?

545
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,823
Next to her, that's Seo A-ri, isn't it?

546
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,536
It's right near here. I'll head over now.

547
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,501
[Tae-jeon] Mr. An, is it possible
to cancel that meeting?

548
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,336
So then give them a call right now.

549
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,963
Sorry, but I gotta go too.

550
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,676

[voicemail] Please leave
a message after the beep. [beep]

00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,269
Chae-hee, you have to take down
that post right now. Please call.

[Chae-hee and Angela laughing]

555

God, you have to actually sit up. Come on.

556
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,915
[Angela and Chae-hee groan]

557
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,877
[Chae-hee] God,
this is so fucking awesome.

558
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,588
It's for sure
the best one I've ever tried.

559
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,966

[Angela] Let me go! [chuckles]

562
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,474
-Oh, it hurts.
-They're insane.

563
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,144
Sit up. You have to sit up, okay?

564
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,061
[both groan]

565
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,646
[Angela yelps]

566
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,482
What is this?

567
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,568
What the fuck are you doing?
Why'd you bring me here?

568
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,945
Ugh, come on. We're just having some fun.

569
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,489
So what's your problem?

570
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:49,866
What?

571
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,200
Hey!

572
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:55,204
A-ri, hey, everyone gets high sometimes.

573
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,539
It's stupid not to.

574
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,417
We're part of high society
because we do this.

575
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,128
Uh, high society?

576
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,342
So the rules are different?
You think you can just get away with this?

577
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,386
Hey, we aren't like other people.

578
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,305
We dress and eat differently.

579
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,515
We let out stress differently, you know?

580
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,436
[scoffs] God, you're such a buzzkill.

581
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,898
[A-ri] That's when I realized.

582
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:26,110
These people have even more privileges
than I ever thought possible.

583
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,865
That normal consequences
don't factor in their lives at all.

585
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,576

601
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,634
You said you wanted no part in my life,
that you didn't have to like it.

602
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,552
Just your preference.

603
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,762
But in there?

604
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,016
Apparently, that's the kind of life
you do have a preference for.

605
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,726
It's not what it looks like. This is--

606
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,437
I guess I should let you hear
my response to your refusal.

607
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,689
I'll also have to turn you down.

608
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,858
I prefer

609
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,027
not to be around with trash.

610
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,199
Stop right there.

611
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,327

Oh shit!

616
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,226
What the fuck?

617
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,354
Oh my god, come on.
Wake up, asshole. Don't do this!

[Yong-tae] Just get up!
Jesus Christ, snap out of it!

620

Hey, come on! [exhales]

622
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,032
Wake up, you prick!

623

Come on, motherfucker, don't do this! God!

624
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,956
He isn't breathing.

625

[Yong-tae] Hey!
What is wrong with this guy? Seriously?

626
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,878
Come on, you need to get it together!

Stop it! Come on, wake up!

Just open your eyes, asshole!

634
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,481
Move over.

Si-hyeon, what's wrong with him?

641
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:33,631
It's the drugs. [breathing shakily]
I think it's because of the drugs.

A-ri, don't!

Get him out through a route

you were still in this room!
