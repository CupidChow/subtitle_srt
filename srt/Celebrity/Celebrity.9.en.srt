[gasps]

180
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,379
Who are you really?

181
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,048
Online, are you…

182
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,718
bbbfamous?

183
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,679
[pensive music playing]

184
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,606
Just what is that?

185
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,069
[man] Mr. Han.

186
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,863
[Jun-kyoung] I think
we need to have a chat.

187
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,202
-[Jun-kyoung sighs]
-Clear the room, please.

188
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,083
You came in person at this hour?
You could've called.

189
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,840
[Jun-kyoung] Have you always been
this terrible at taking care of business?

190
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,634
You shouldn't have started
something you couldn't handle.

191
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,929
You are the reason someone died
because they weren't properly treated.

192
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,222
[sighs]

193
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,016
Well, did I kill them, though?

194
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,517
It was an accident.

195
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,269
And that accident's now an incident.

196
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,021
So what?

197
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,189
What're you going to do?

198
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,734
Lecture me? Stop me? Threaten me?

199
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,235
You should come clean.

200
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,321
Before anyone else ends up hurt.

201
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,823
It's to threaten me.

202
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,700
But for who, though? Seo A-ri?

203
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,493
Hey, Jun-kyoung!

204
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,997
I mean, no, Mr. Han.

205
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,541
Do watch yourself.

206
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,460
Against Taegang's full might,

207
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,713
both you and your company
won't be safe.

208
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,840
[dramatic music playing]

209
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,218
Fine. Sure.

210
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,221
I'm just here to warn you,
but now you've threatened me.

211
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,308
Do it. We would put up a hell of a show.

212
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,684
Han Jun-kyoung versus Taegang.

213
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,853
One of us is certainly going to get hurt.

214
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
[Jeong-sun] Who? Wang Ro-la?

215
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,616
Yeah, you mentioned it before.
Some great war on social media?

216
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,160
Ah, between Biniimom and Wang Ro-la?

217
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,746
What happened exactly?

218
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,998
What kind of

219
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,000
person is Ro-la?

220
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,920
[pensive music playing]

221
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,548
[Jeong-sun] Originally, Wang Ro-la was one
of Biniimom's most loyal customers.

222
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,717
Every time she visited,
she bought tons of products.

223
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,469
Eventually, they became close friends.

224
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,805
Oh, Ro-la! Back so soon?

225
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,307
Just came to get gifts for my friends.

226
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,101
I even brought a suitcase today.

227
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,645
Oh, my dear, that's so nice of you.

228
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,980
-Please come inside.
-[both chuckle]

229
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,732
-Need any help?
-[Ro-la] Oh, no.

230
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,733
[Jeong-sun] Soon after,

231
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,652
Biniimom brought Ro-la
into the Gabin Society.

232
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,446
This is Ro-la. You've seen her on my feed?

233
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,906
[all chuckle]

234
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,492
-I'm honored to meet you.
-[Yu-rang chuckles]

235
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,787
[Jeong-sun] After all, at first,
it seemed Ro-la was rolling in dough.

236
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,039
But that's when it happened.

237
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,126
[A-ri] When what happened?

238
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,003
It turns out Wang Ro-la
wasn't really that rich.

239
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,256
All her designer goods
turned out to be rentals.

240
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,967
So then what happened
when Biniimom finally found out?

241
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,301
[dramatic music playing]

242
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,387
Oh, hey.

243
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,682
So what brings you here
without any notice?

244
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,891
[chuckles softly]

245
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,853
You never invited me over,
so I invited myself.

246
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,024
But it doesn't seem like
you've done much with the place.

247
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,485
Looks nothing like it does on your feed.

248
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,155
I guess that was temporary?

249
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,783
Oh, well, um, I don't use this room much.

250
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,829
Hmm. So, aren't you gonna offer me tea?

251
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,456
Huh?

252
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,874
Oh, yeah, just a sec.

253
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,468
What the fuck?

254
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,227
Seriously? This is unbelievable.

255
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,233
Biniimom didn't secretly film her home,
did she?

256
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,736
[Jeong-sun] Yeah,
but that wasn't the end of it.

257
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,571
[dramatic music playing]

258
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,413
[recorder chimes]

259
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,172
[Jeong-sun] Ro-la got pissed
and posted her chat history with Biniimom,

260
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,549
where she smack-talked the Gabin Society.

261
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,761
In the end,
the two of them were finished as e-celebs.

262
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,346
Isn't that so funny?

263
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,557
I mean, Wang Ro-la's pretty lame too.
Like, don't show off what you don't have.

264
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,811
Besides, these e-celebs aren't all
that much if you look hard enough.

265
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,979
Just a bunch of try-hards
acting like they're the shit.

266
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,231
They'll gossip, dig up dirt,

267
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,817
and sometimes they'll even plot
against each other, A-ri.

268
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,445
Yeah, I guess that's what it takes
to succeed in this world.

269
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,990
-[Angela] Oh, A-ri!
-[A-ri] What?

270
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,909
Angela used to be a bar girl?

271
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,246
That's how you made your money, Ms. Hwang.

272
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,040
You made your money whoring yourself out,
selling clothes, and making connections

273
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:53,999
all to gain power.

274
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,084
Besta Room's secret!

275
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,711
I'm the same.

276
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,380
Huh?

277
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,422
I, um…

278
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,219
[exhales shakily]

279
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,722
Did you see? [scoffs]

280
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,391
It's fucking scary, right?

281
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,519
Seo A-ri was doing so much shady shit
behind the scenes.

282
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,855
[sighs] My hands are shaking still.

283
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,815
Who are we dealing with?

284
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,817
This is only a taste of what's coming.

285
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,861
They have tons of DMs from A-ri.

286
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,827
We should meet up. Talk in person.

287
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,745
Hey, what's up? I wasn't expecting you.

288
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,790
What are you…

289
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,209
Don't go on your phone for a while, okay?

290
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,503
No matter what,
social media is off limits.

291
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,381
-What?
-You have no idea

292
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,093
what the consequences of your actions
brought on us all.

293
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,803
[sighs]

294
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
So nothing happened
to your husband's clinic?

295
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,098
Not even an investigation?

296
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,933
Mmm, not a thing.

297
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,184
How is that possible?

298
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,312
There were drugs involved. Someone died.

299
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,564
That was just some rumor. Come on.

300
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,940
What?

301
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,151
Min-hye, you know how worried I was?

302
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,236
Ugh, so scary.

303
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,989
But it was all a lie. Totally fake.

304
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,909
That's why all of those websites
had to take down their posts.

305
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,536
They're gonna catch
everyone who shared it,

306
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,288
including whoever posted it first.

307
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,874
Apparently, Taegang is going after people.

308
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,584
Who said it was totally fake?

309
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,753
They're threatening people who post it?

310
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,171
Huh?

311
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,298
Min-hye, you don't believe this.

312
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,008
It doesn't make sense.

313
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,470
Where are you going?

314
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,846
Hey, Min-hye!

315
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,806
[dramatic music playing]

316
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,728
Honey, what's up? You look into it?

317
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,812
How'd things go?

318
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,984
Well, Yong-tae wouldn't pick up his phone,
so I went to the Aragon myself.

319
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,320
-But I think he didn't go in today.
-And?

320
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,282
What do you mean, "And"?
I'll talk to him the next time I see him.

321
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,743
Ugh, you idiot, can you hear yourself?

322
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,121
-How can you be so goddamn stupid?
-[sighs]

323
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,208
Look, that post I put online
is getting buried.

324
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,542
Taegang's moving in.

325
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,963
I was trying to teach Chae-hee
and Seo A-ri a lesson,

326
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,756
but now I'm the one getting fucked.

327
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,717
This could end up killing me instead.

328
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,513
[panting]

329
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,974
[Yong-tae sighs]

330
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,645
[exhales] You take care of it?

331
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,357
[Yong-tae] Yes, sir. We delivered it
to the dead asshole's sister.

332
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,943
You spent a lot of money on this.

333
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,821
-Then she gets the message?
-She's got more than enough.

334
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,198
At the least, they would know
what happens if they act up.

335
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,910
Were they the ones who made the post?

336
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,165
Sir, they kept denying it, though.
Said it wasn't them.

337
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,128
So who could've leaked that information?

338
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,756
Seo A-ri. Check her out, okay?

339
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,551
Every detail about her.

340
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,722
[woman] Miss Seo.

341
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,393
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-[gasps]

342
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,187
How should we handle
the orders for the new product?

343
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,148
Uh…

344
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,275
Let's… [clears throat]

345
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,778
Let's make a decision once we've had time
to review the schedule.

346
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,196
Yes.

347
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,948
A-ri.

348
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,409
It's showtime. Let's get going.

349
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,495
Yeah. I'll go get ready.

350
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,707
[gentle music playing]

351
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,671

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,519
But what happened that day
wasn't your fault at all.

527
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,481
-You shouldn't feel guilty about this.
-Si-hyeon.

528
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,360
My husband, my in-laws, and my family
are who should be held responsible.

529
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,612
So I'll take care of this however I can.

530
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,781
But I was also there that day.

531
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,991
You know I was.
I should've called the police.

532
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,284
And I said it'd be fine.

533
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,536
I was the one who convinced you
nothing would happen to him.

534
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,415
I am begging you. Please stay out of this.

535
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,585
If anything goes wrong,
you might get wrapped up in it.

536
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,255
[sighs]

537
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,134
How do we fix something like this?

538
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,970
-A-ri, please.
-Can you resurrect the dead?

539
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,555
Whatever you call it, it's a cover-up.

540
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,559
Pretending as if this never happened,
just like we did that night.

541
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,146
Everything you have accomplished so far,
you will lose.

542
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,148
Are you sure you're okay with that?

543
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,528
You've seen what it's like
to be in this world now.

544
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,987
You've experienced it for yourself.

545
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,865
You have.

546
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,827
So you should absolutely take no action.

547
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,621
There's nothing more you can do.

548
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,378
[chimes]

549
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,860
[exhales]

550
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,612
[loud thud]

551
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,426
[Jeong-sun] Absolutely.
Enzymes are totally what's hot right now.

552
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,261
You all know my friend A-ri, right?

553
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,680
Just how do you think
she keeps up that figure?

554
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,477
These enzymes right here
are the ones A-ri takes every single day.

555
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,520
-Jeong-sun, what are you doing?
-[gasps]

556
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:33,980
[gasps]

557
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,067
Why are you at the office?
I thought you had gone home.

558
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,570
Are you hosting a purchase event
for those enzymes?

559
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,906
From that offer I turned down?

560
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,365
A-ri, the thing is…

561
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,037
It seemed like…
It seemed like such a waste, you know?

562
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,289
It was a huge profit,
so I thought I could do it.

563
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,541
So you thought you could use my name?

564
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:54,876
This isn't like you.

565
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,253
I can't believe you would do this to me.
Why?

566
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,340
Remember what you told me
about Wang Ro-la?

567
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,967
How's this any different
than what you accused her of?

568
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,219
You're doing the same thing.

569
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,596
So, what are you saying, A-ri?

570
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,434
Just try to be thankful for what I have?

571
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,477
Since I'm not A-ri?

572
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,563
Even your mom told me that.

573
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,775
She reminded me of my place.
That your fame's not mine.

574
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,530
All I did was use your name
for a mass purchase event

575
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,824
so I could benefit from my famous friend.

576
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,076
But is… is that really a sin?

577
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,248
I'm just a nobody,
so I pretended to be somebody.

578
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,667
Was what I did really that terrible?

579
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,668
Jeong-sun…

580
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,378
[Jeong-sun sighs]

581
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,341
I'm sorry that I forgot my place.
[sniffles]

582
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,134
I'll return it all.

583
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,470
[Jeong-sun exhales]

584
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,888
[tender music playing]

585
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,811
But let me tell you.

586
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,147
You think you're different?

587
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,859
You're the same as me.

588
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,320
How are you any different
than the e-celebs you look down on?

589
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,114
[Jeong-sun whimpers]

590
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,702
[tender music playing]

591
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,917
[sighs]

592
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,088
[door opens]

593
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,969
You called for me, sir?

594
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,349
Ari.& and Zhang Wei's commerce event,
what time's it start?

595
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,768
At three. It begins soon, sir.

596
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,105
Our marketing team will be there
to review its marketability.

597
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,733
[sighs]

598
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,825
[Du-seong] Hey, A-ri, look here.

599
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,120
The views on that vlog we uploaded
totally took off.

600
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,039
I think today's gonna be huge.

601
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,415
Oh.

602
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,333
Hey.

603
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,129
We're already busy as it is.
Has anyone seen Jeong-sun? Huh?

604
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,798
-Du-seong, give her a call now.
-[Du-seong] Oh, sure.

605
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,550
It's fine. Just let her be, Mom.

606
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,054
I had her take some time off.
She seemed tired.

607
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,263
[scoffs]

608
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,933
Tired from what exactly?
What does she even do around here?

609
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,850
God, Mom.

610
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,936
What?

611
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,318
Excuse me.

612
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,780
[woman] I'm sorry,
but we are closed today for a shoot, sir.

613
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
Uh, I'm not here to buy anything.

614
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,327
Is there a Ms. Seo A-ri here?

615
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,505
I'm Inspector Jang
from the Dongbu Police Station.

616
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,215
Thank you for taking the time
to speak with me.

617
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,800
[A-ri] I know who you are.

618
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,677
The two of us have met before.

619
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,764
Uh, the sexual harassment case.

620
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,059
So you do remember me, Ms. Seo.
The case with Han Jun-kyoung.

621
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,145
Were you able to settle things with him?

622
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,898
Yeah, it was a misunderstanding.

623
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,818
But what is this about?

624
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,027
Well, the thing is,

625
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,031
someone filed a report,
so I need to ask you some questions.

626
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,379
[breathing heavily]

627
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,848
[Jang] The person who came in
reported a death.

628
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:42,020
And it's possible that we may have
a case of drug-induced homicide.

629
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,731
Have you heard anything about it?

630
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:49,110
There was talk it was floating around
in forums online for the past couple days.

631
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,114
I'm not sure.

632
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,160
Well, at the moment,
it's nothing but a rumor.

633
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,453
We just wanted to check it out.

634
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,791
Can I ask you,
have you been to the Aragon Club recently?

635
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,211

637
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,630
[Mrs. A-ri] A-ri?

638
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,341
It's time to go.
What are you doing in there?

639
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,344
Zhang Wei will be arriving soon.
We need to leave now.

640
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,057
-A-ri!
-[breathing heavily]

641
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,016
A-ri!

-A-ri!
-[doorknob jiggling]

645
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,903
[A-ri] I think that was the moment

646
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,781
I remembered the most afterwards.

647
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,283
The choice

648
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,994
that I made back then.

649
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,961
The camera should be over here.

650
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,808
[chuckls] Oh,
why am I the one panicking here?

651
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,518
[gasps] Oh!

652
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,728
Oh my, how amazing!

653
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,605
-Oh, Mr. Park!
-Hello, ma'am.

654
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,108
A-ri, we've got the million they wanted,

655
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,110
and they're all ready
to be shipped out today.

656
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,946
-God, I feel good about this!
-[Mrs. A-ri] Oh my God! [chuckles]

657
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,906
Oh! Oh wow!

[pensive music playing]

659
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,335
[Mrs. A-ri] This is incredible.

660

[speaks Chinese]

661
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,050
[translator in English]
She's very satisfied with this setup.

662
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,971
[Mrs. A-ri] Oh, thank you so much!
And my, don't you look so beautiful!

663
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,347
-[speaks Chinese]
-She said, "Thank you."

664
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,392
[man] Everyone, we've got ten minutes
before the event goes live!

665
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:48,229
[Mrs. A-ri chuckles, gasps] Oh, hey, A-ri.

666
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,231
[A-ri] Let me ask you.

667
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,695
What choice do you think
I should have made back then?

668
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,979
Hello, everyone. I'm Seo A-ri
of the fashion and cosmetics brand Ari.&.

669
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,567
First, I'd like to say I'm so grateful
for the chance to host this exciting event

670
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,777
with the amazing Zhang Wei.

671
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:41,532
This'll probably be the most exhilarating
and overwhelming day of my life.

672
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,828
Right at the start,
we have a total of 20,000 viewers.

673
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,122
And it's rising quickly.

674
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,124
We're at 50,000 now.

675
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,212
You probably know her already,
but please welcome Ms. Zhang Wei.

676
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,589
[in Chinese] Hello, everyone.
I am Zhang Wei from China.

677
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,799
I am honored to be here today
at the live show.

678
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,927
I hope you will love our products.

679
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,471
[in English] Unbelievable.

680
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,472
Seo A-ri,

681
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,641
you think I'm just gonna sit by

682
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,435
while you ride into the sunset?

683
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,731
-[woman] Welcome, ma'am.
-Angela, she here?

684
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,649
Uh, yeah.

685
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,153
[relaxing music playing]

686
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,659
[scoffs] Ugh, I told you that part hurts.

687
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,994
Go easy on me. [scoffs]

688
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,996
[woman] But you always
ask me to go hard here.

689
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,290
[sighs] Well, today I said no.

690
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,085
I didn't know
because you didn't say anything.

691
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,295
[scoffs] Are you talking back to me?

692
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,091
Hey, what is your name?

693
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,051
Don't you know they sponsor me?

694
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,594
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

695
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,512
Hey!

696
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,348
Do you think this is time for the spa?

697
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,683
Why are you here?

698
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,019
Just take a look at what Seo A-ri
is up to right now.

699
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,397
[in Chinese] Ari.& is the trendiest brand
in Korea these days.

700
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,441
[in English] We're just over 200,000 now.
Our highest count.

701
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,527
[Wei in Chinese]
Now let's look at the products.

702
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,404
Miss Seo,
please introduce them to us in detail.

703
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,949
[in English] We've got enough viewers.
So how's sales? How are our numbers?

704
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,701
What? How?

705
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,370
How's it going here?
How are the sales going right now?

706
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,664
-I don't know. It seems--
-[Gyeong-bae] What's wrong?

707
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,208
-What's going on?
-[Du-seong] Something's weird.

708
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,876
The numbers aren't going up.

709
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,962
-The numbers?
-The number of sales.

710
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,588
We hit 50k, but haven't sold any since.

711
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,674
-Huh?
-But how can that be?

712
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,135
The number of views
keep increasing, though.

713
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,594
We're over 300,000.

714
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,306
And that's counting
both Korean and Chinese viewers.

715
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,349
-Something's wrong with the program.
-[Gyeong-bae] A tech error?

716
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,393
[Mrs. A-ri] What do we do? Oh!

717
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,769
[Gyeong-bae] Check it again.

718
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:37,106
[indistinct chatter]

719
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,275
[suspenseful music playing]

720
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,279
Ari.& takes great pride

721
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,948
in our attention to the smallest details
in all of our designs.

722
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,992
[indistinct chatter continues]

723
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,291
On today's live commerce show,

724
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,044
we are bringing you
our most exclusive item

725
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,211
at a special discount.

726
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,921
[in Chinese] How many sets now?

727
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,924
What?

728
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,218
That makes no sense.

729
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,930
[woman in English]
Sales aren't increasing?

730
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,016
Yeah, we expected a million orders,

731
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,768
but we haven't made more than 50,000.

732
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,770
We haven't seen any more purchases.

733
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,398
The item that I would most recommend
to everyone

734
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,900
is this stunning jacket.

735
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,694
Black, ocean blue, sky blue.

736
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,696
You can find it in these three colors.

737
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:33,454
Uh, you can even create a chic look
by adding a scarf like this.

738
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,747
[Wei speaks Chinese]

739
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,797
[speaking Chinese]

740
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,634
[translator in English]
Excuse me, Miss Seo.

741
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,429
But she said that
we won't be able to continue.

742
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,016
-[dramatic music playing]
-What?

743
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,153
You're leaving, sir?

744
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,031
It's over, isn't it?

745
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,791
Uh, what do you mean
we won't be able to continue the show?

746
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,876
[Du-seong] No way!

747
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,420
We sold everything! It's sold out!

748
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,421
We sold out?

749
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,506
[Mrs. A-ri] I can't believe it! [chuckles]

750
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,007
We sold out?

751
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,010
[in Chinese] Yes,
congratulations, Miss Seo.

752
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,972
Products have sold out,
so we can't continue the show!

753
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,723
I can't believe what just happened.

754
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,767
Our website had a crash for a moment

755
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,602
due to a sudden rush of traffic.

756
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,231
All one million pieces
sold out within five minutes,

757
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,358
but we had no idea.

758
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,570
This is a first for me as well.
Congratulations, Miss Seo!

759
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,947
[all applauding]

760
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,532
[chuckles]

761
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,284
[Gyeong-bae in English] A-ri!

762
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,411
[Gyeong-bae shouts]

763
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,914
A-ri, this wasn't 'cause of Zhang Wei,
this was all you! All of it!

764
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,251
It all sold out instantly, A-ri! [laughs]

765
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,961
[all continue cheering]

766
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,045
[Gyeong-bae] Oh!

767
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,132
[Mrs. A-ri laughs]

768

[clanking]

770
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,076
[Seung-hyeok] Here's a cosmetic proposal
we received from Zhang Wei's team.

771
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,411
[chuckles]

772
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,622
I think we've really impressed them.

773
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,625
And let's not forget to mention
all the other offers.

774
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,338
Have you reviewed these with Ari.& yet?

775
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,715
Uh, thing is,

776
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,217
I can't seem to reach them.

777
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,929
Seo A-ri, you mean?

778
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,889
Yeah, her phone's turned off.

779
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,975
Have you heard from her, Mr. Han?

780
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,479
[dramatic music playing]

781
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,314
So you decided to come in.

782
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,610
I did.

783
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,196
I told you I would, so I'm here.

784
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,280
[A-ri] It was true.

785
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,742
I must have thought about it a thousand…

786
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,619
No, 10,000 times.

787
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,413
That night, what happened.

788
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,918
How would things have been different
if I had stopped them?

789
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,419
Then maybe…

790
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,173
none of this would have ever happened.

791
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,509
I'll tell you everything.

792
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,553
That night,

793
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,056
on February 15th,
I went to the Aragon Club.

794
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,058
And there…

795
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:42,893
There was…

796
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,230
Um, in a backroom, there were drugs.

797
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,901
And you were right

798
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,529
that there was an accident that day.

799
