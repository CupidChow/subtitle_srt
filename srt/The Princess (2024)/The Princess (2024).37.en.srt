Muran,

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,240
it's my bad.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,430
I didn't give you a happy family.

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,830
My sensitive son

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
had to grow up in fear.

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,600
Your attachment to Ruoran

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,960
was also my mistake.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
I thought I could give you a better life,

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,230
so I stole her key

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,550
and gave it to Du Hanqing.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,760
It turned out to be the doom
of the two families.

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,390
For seven years,

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,320
I have lived in the guilt for you

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,200
and the great sin.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,200
I have been sleepless at night.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,750
My heart is dead.

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,240
Now,

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,070
I have chosen to leave

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,320
to atone for my sins.

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,710

(Your Mother)

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
It wasn't Gu Yanting
who stole Sister's key.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
It turns out

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,430
it wasn't Gu Yanting
who sold out the Qiu family.

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,280
It was because of me.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,150
Hadn't it been for me,

41
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,150
Mother wouldn't have
betrayed the Qiu family.

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,400
Muran. Don't do this, Muran.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,000
Aunt will worry about you.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,310
Sister.

45
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,790
Sister.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
I didn't know. I really didn't know.

47
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,710
But now,

48
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,950
I have no mother.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,230
I don't have a mother anymore.

50
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,400
It's okay, Muran.

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,840
I will be there for you.

52
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,840
I will be there for you.

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
It's late.

54
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,710
What's wrong?

55
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,080
Mrs. Li is gone.

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
What happened?

57
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,680
She killed herself

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
and left her last words.

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,960
That's all I know.

60
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,870
How is Yue doing?

61
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,800

Cry if you want.

63
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,310
Why did she lie to me?

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
She stole the key

65
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,520
and gave the treasure map to Du Hanqing.

66
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,190
It was her

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
who made me blame

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,910
and hate you.

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,840
She did the wrong things,

70
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,800
and she even tried
to take my life along with hers.

71
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,470
But

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,800
how come I didn't hate her

73
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,000
when she left?

74
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,160

75
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,800

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,360

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,390

You murdered my family.

163
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,720

165
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,320
