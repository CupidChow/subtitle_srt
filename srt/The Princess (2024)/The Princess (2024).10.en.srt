12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,470
So, you two, fake mother and son,

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,790
teamed up to trick me?

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,200
I shouldn't have lied to you.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,030
But Mrs. Xiao would never allowed me

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,960
to be the secretary in Xiao Mansion,

17
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,390
if I didn't have husband and a child.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,580
Since I don't have a child,
I have no choice but to hire him.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,840
(So Xiaozhentou's not Yue's real son.)

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,680
May I have a roasted sweet potato?

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,480
You just had dinner!

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,350
Sir.

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,710
- One roasted sweet potato.
- Okay, sir.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Do you want one?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm not hungry.

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,920
Two medium ones, please.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
Got it.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,360
They target only me.

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,840
Then we won't hold you back, Mr. Gu.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
We'll head home now.

31
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,120
Stay safe.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
You heartless woman! You…

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Let's go.

34
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,150
After them.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
You're back again.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,590
Feeling guilty now, Mrs. Gu?

37
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,590
Can't bear to see me die?

38
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,660
Stop!

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
- Here!
- Quick!

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
Hurry, after them.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
- These men seem to be after me.
- Hurry!

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Got a spare gun?

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,150
No.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,910
Seems like they won't hurt me.

45
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,990
Run!

46
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
Hey!

47
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,270
Well…

48
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,360

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,220

50
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,310

Commander,

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,080
something's strange today.

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Another group came to kill Mrs. Gu.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,750
They ran into our men.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,680
What? Jiang Ruruo escaped?

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Is she hurt?

57
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,430
They said no.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Sorry, Miss.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,830
Gu Yanting protected her tightly.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,190
We couldn't do anything.

and a quick fix is fine.

Stop pretending.

66
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,710

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,430

68
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,150
I'll dress it myself.

116
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,700

117
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,000
come from?

118
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,440
I found him on the street.

119
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,440
He sold himself for money to bury his father.

120
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,670
He even didn't have a name at that time.

121
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,960
Dead father? Sounds bad.

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
You're not his real father.

123
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,960
You hired him,

124
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,150
then why did he secretly take
on other jobs?

125
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
I…

126
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,030
I've been tight on money these days.

127
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,750
I owe him wages.

128
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,670
One silver dollar a day,

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,360
and you owe him?

130
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,790
It's gone up to two a day.

131
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,150
Who'd have thought
the elegant Mrs. Gu is

132
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
poorer than me?

133
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,630
I've been too busy with revenge.

134
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,000
I have no time for money.

135
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
You…

136
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
You've had a hard time these years,
right?

137
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,750
It's nothing.

138
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
And you?

139
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,790
My foster father, the Warlord,

140
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,030
sent me to Xiao Li

141
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,000
to get the treasure of Qiu Family.

142
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,790
Considering my foster father

143
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,790
and my Northern Division,

144
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,240
Xiao Li hates me,

145
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,870
but he only dares

146
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,720
to kill me in secret.

147
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,280
See?

148
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,390
I was right.

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,320
Everyone's after the treasure of Qiu Family.

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
- Actually, I…
- I know.

151
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,320
I don't blame you.

152
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,480
After all,
you're putting it to good use.

153
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
I don't mind.

154
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,390
Today's event at Wangyuelou
were odd.

155
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,360
I found the mechanism too easily.

156
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,670
Someone set you up.

157
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,480
It might be the same group

158
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
who attacked you.

159
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,600
I know it was Xiao Li
who's after me,

160
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,480
but I can't figure out

161
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,320
who's after you.

162
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,960
I think it's Du Anni.

163
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,240
No way.

164
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,720
She's just a spoiled girl,

165
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,910
and she wouldn't do that.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
I fold.

167
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm done playing.

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,440
Are you sure
that child isn't Gu Yanting's?

169
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,040
Absolutely!

170
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
That little brat

171
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,360
rents himself out to be people's son.

172
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,870
He's a come-from-nowhere brat,

173
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,960
and no one knows his identity.

174
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,710
Commander,

175
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,440
