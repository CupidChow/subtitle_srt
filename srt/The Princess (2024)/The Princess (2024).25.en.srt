(Xiao Mansion)

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,190
Mr. Du,

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
welcome.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,120
What brings you here?

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,430
Captain Gu,

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,430
let's have a word in private.

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,510
We can talk

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,070
in front of my bros.

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,950
Now, Gu Yanting and Xiao Li
are missing at the same time.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,430
Jiangcheng is
in the Northern Division's control.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
A new Division Commander is needed.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
Captain Gu, what do you think?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,480
Who do you suggest,

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,230
Mr. Du?

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,230
It's men's business.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,840
Stay out of it, woman.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Muran,

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,910
get out of my way.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
This is Boss's gun.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Yes, it is.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Yanting gave it to me.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,790
The gun represents the man.

34
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,960
The gun is the witness.

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
From today on,

36
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,280
before Yanting returns,

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,120
I am the Northern Division Commander.

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,520
Anyone who proposes

39
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,710
cooperation

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,120
are welcome.

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Gu Liang,

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
now that Mr. Du is here with his offer,

43
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,430
why don't you take the gold bars?

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,080
Yes, Madam.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,710
Jiangcheng needs to be rebuilt.

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
The money comes just in time.

47
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
To express the gratitude
for Mr. Du's generosity,

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,590
a pennant will be made

49
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,310
and delivered to your mansion.

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,750
Miss Jiang,

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,150
I underestimated you.

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,000
Call me Mrs. Gu, please.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
If you want collaboration,

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,150
you're welcome to come.

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
Gu Liang,

56
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,750
see them off.

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,990
Please.

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
Sister.

59
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,840
- I...
- Muran.

60
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,710
Come with me.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,920
Sister.

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,030
Just come with me.

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,840
Wise up, you!

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,020
Muran,

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,870
don't act against
your father because of me.

66
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,750
Go now.

67
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,120
Sister, what about you?

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,280
I'll go to Gu's house.

69
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,680
Take care of yourself and your mum.

70
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,200
Just go.

71
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
Let's go.

72
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,660
(Xiao Mansion)

73
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,500
(Bugao Alley)

74
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,030
Yanting,

75
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't care about what people say.

76
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,870
I will wait for you to come back.

77
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,630
You'll be okay.

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,520
Won't you?

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,160
Madam, bad news.

80
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,470
What's the matter?

81
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,390
When I was in your aunt's house,

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,040
Xiaozhentou had already been

83
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,120
taken away by Du's men.

84
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,630
They also asked

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
to you got to Du Mansion.

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,760
Sorry, we have rules.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,430
This way, please.

88
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,110
Ruruo,

89
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,070
you are Wanrou's niece

90
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,600
and Muran's loved one,

91
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,160
there's no need
for hostility between us.

92
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,120
We can talk.

93
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
About what?

94
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,270
I have heard

95
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,310
you are mustering Jiangcheng Army
which served under Xiao Li.

96
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
Mr. Du,

97
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,390
you are a businessman.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,870
I'm afraid

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,040
this is not the right topic for us.

100
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,750
Keep Gu Yanting's
Northern Division separated,

101
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
name your price,

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,310
I want the rest of Jiangcheng Army.

103
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,680
And why is that?

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Mr. Du,

105
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,160
I am curious

106
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
about your purpose

107
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,270
behind your action.

108
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,720
A businessman

109
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
always pursues profit.

110
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,160
As far as I know,

111
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,430
both you and Gu Yanting

112
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,430
care much about the boy.

113
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,670
Soldiers!

114
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,790
Put down your guns!

115
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,830
Do it. Do it.

116
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,720
Put down your guns.

117
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,510
You'd better give the boy

118
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,750
back to me safe and sound.

119
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,800
A woman and a boy,

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,950
with no one to rely on,

121
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,080
aren't you tired?

122
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,320
Just choose an easy way.

123
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,160
Shut up.

124
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,390
Where is he?

125
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,390
Go. Go.

126
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Listen to me.

127
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,200
Just listen.

128
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,440
Muran is in deep love with you.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You may even

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,870
become my daughter-in-law.

131
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,790
Just shut up!

132
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,320
Sir, bad news.

133
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,440
Young Master has taken the boy away.

134
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,420
(Bugao Alley)

135
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,560
Xiaozhentou

136
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,520
Mum!

137
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
Xiaozhentou.

138
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,990
Sister.

139
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,510
Are you injured?

140
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,110
Xiaozhentou,

141
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,480
go upstairs with Gu Liang.

142
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
Come on.

143
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,080
Let's go.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,840
Sister,

145
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,320
our child died young,

146
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
but from now on,

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,550
I will take care of you and Xiaozhentou.

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,630
Thank you for getting him out.

149
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
But I'm doing fine.

150
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,390
I can take care of myself.

151
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,870
Muran,

152
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,350
let's talk.

153
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,750
I admit that Du Hanqing

154
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,240
shouldn't take Xiaozhentou away.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,100
I apologize to you on his behalf.

156
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,470
You are right.

157
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,550
But what Du Hanqing did has got

158
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,590
nothing to do with you.

159
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,440
This isn't what I want to talk about.

160
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,270
My enmity with Du Hanqing

161
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,480
puts you in a difficult situation,

162
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,270
which isn't what I intended,

163
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,240
but it is what it is.

164
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,390
There's no way back.

165
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,710
So,

166
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,320
how about we...

167
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,000
You wish to break off with me.

168
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,480
Since I learned about the past,

169
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,440
I have noticed
we are walking away from each other.

170
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,350
It's late.

171
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,600
Go home.

172
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,670
Du Muran, what are you doing?

173
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,390
Sister, I'm sorry.

174
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,360
I didn't mean by that.

175
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,270
I just don't want you to leave me.

176
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,480
I've got used to you.

177
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,630
I've got used to

178
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,030
the life with you since we were little.

179
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,150
I can't accept what you said to me.

180
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,840
I feel terrible. I'm sorry.

181
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,320
Sister.

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
Muran.

183
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,120
You have changed.

184
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
I...

185
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,160
Sister,

186
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,270
are you sure
it isn't you who have changed?
