Are you finished?

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,790
You think by doing this

15
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,150
Jiang Ruruo will come back to you?

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,240
Muran,

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,120
you are too soft-hearted.

18
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,310
A man

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,870
takes any measures

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,280
to get what he desires.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,870
Any measures?

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,920
I am not you.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,710
If I love a woman,

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,350
I'm willing to die for her.

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,840
You wish to marry Jiang Ruruo?

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,480
You are delusional.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,870
No, you are delusional.

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,950
I tell you what,

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,200
as long as I'm around,

30
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,480
you will never have my mum
for this lifetime!

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,920
You jerk!

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,870
You!

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,840
Mum, you are once again in the kitchen.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,360
Is Dad coming back too?

35
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,630
I will learn how to cook,

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,750
and I will make good dishes for you two.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,150
When will he be home?

38
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,590
Soon.

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,590
Watch out.

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Muran.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Sister,

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,190
what's the matter with you?

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,240
Xiaozhentou,

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,190
look what this is.

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,590
What happened to your head?

46
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,120
I fell accidentally.

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,520
Du Hanqing did this, right?

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Sister.

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,870
Come with me.

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,750
(Bugao Alley)
He's here again?

51
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,710
What's his relationship with her?

52
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,120
I don't understand.

53
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
Gu Liang,

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,190
Du Muran is here again.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
We must do something,

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,400
or before Boss's soul

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
rests in peace,

58
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,150
his woman would be stolen.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Bah!

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
Shut your mouth up.

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,280
How about we tie him up

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,520
and hold him hostage?

63
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,590
In case Du Hanqing looks for more trouble.

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,570
Good point.

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,430
You are right.

66
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Yeah, right.

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,870
Let's go and have a look.

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,980
(Buago Alley)

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,240
Is it good, Xiaozhentou?

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Sister.

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,150
Sister,

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,390
since when did you start
working in the kitchen?

73
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,560
Mum learns how to cook

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
so she'll make good dishes for me and Dad.

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
Sister,

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,560
it breaks my heart
to see you live a tough life.

77
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,430
Take Xiaozhentou and be with me.

78
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,080
Muran,

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,630
I promised Yanting

80
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,800
that whatever happens,

81
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,630
I'd be Mrs. Gu forever,

82
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,160
that I'd look after what he leaves behind

83
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,160
until he comes back.

84
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,680
If you have no business with me,

85
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,160
please do not come here again.

86
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,710
Sister.

87
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,360
Is it good?

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
It's good.

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,830
Thank Uncle Muran for the cake.

90
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,630
Thank you.

91
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,790
It's fine.

92
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
Muran,

93
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,120
I'd like to invite you to my wedding.

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
What wedding?

95
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,310
Miss Jiang Ruruo,

96
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,360
do you take Mr. Gu Yanting
to be your wedded husband?

97

98
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,120

101
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,560
(you'll make your vows.)

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,040

Madam,

126
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,070
some soldiers
we just incorporated rebelled.

127
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,390
They joined forces with Du's bodyguards

128
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,830
to drive our men out of the Armory.

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,630
Now, Du Hanqing has taken control

130
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,440
of the Armory.

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,600
How come Jiangcheng Army rebels?

132
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,630
Has Xiao Li been found?

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,280
No.

134
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,360
After the Xiao Mansion
explosion last month,

135
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,840
Boss and Xiao Li disappeared into thin air.

136
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,390
Have you searched Wangyuelou?

137
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,720
Nothing in Wangyuelou.

138
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,600
No one disappears into thin air.

139
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,680
Madam,

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,670
if Boss was still alive,

141
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,750
he'd try every way to contact us.

142
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,270
But we haven't got anything
for a whole month,

143
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,870
so I'm afraid that...

144
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,710
I'm not.

145
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,360
I don't believe Yanting is dead.

146
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,510
Uncle Gu Liang,

147
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,360
I don't believe Dad's dead either.

148
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,440
I won't talk about it again.

149
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,550
Yanting took the Armory.

150
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I can't lose it.

151
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
We'll take it back

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,240
at all costs.

153
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,870
Yes.

154
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,550
Who's shooting off fireworks
in the daytime?

155
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,200
Captain, our men report

156
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,200
that the daytime fireworks
in the recent days

157
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,960
have been troubling the entire city.

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,960
Who sets off fireworks

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
in the daytime?

160
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
This is wastage.

161
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,600
We were surrounded twice.

162
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,200
If it happens again,

163
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,510
set off a signal.

164
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,750
I'll be there as fast as I can.

165
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
What's that place?

166
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,480
I think it's where Du Mansion is located.

167
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,120
Du Hanqing is such a smug.

168
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,240
He sets off fireworks

169
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,840
right after obtaining the Armory?

170
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,600
Only in the well-guarded Du Mansion

171
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,150
can a person be kept
without leakage of information.

172
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,720
I should have thought of it.

173
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,710
Jiang Ruruo,

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,440
are you out of your mind?

175
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,870
What are you trying to get?

176
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,110
Nothing,

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,870
but taking my man home.

178
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
What's going on?

179
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
No firing. No one fires.

180
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,480
Sister, what's going on?

181
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Miss Anni,

182
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,360
give me Yanting,

183
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,630
and I'll leave.

184
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,200
I don't understand what you are saying.

185
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,910
In the entire city,

186
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,670
who else but you
has the ability and motive

187
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,080
to keep him hidden for a whole month?

188
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Sister.

189
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,870
Hold still.

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,960
Gu Liang,

191
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,630
you wait here.

192
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,990
Jiang Ruruo,

193
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
what do you think this place is?

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,200
Anyone who gets in my way

195
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,270
dies!

196
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,680
Don't shoot.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
Be careful.

198
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,120
Du Muran, what are you doing?

199
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,740
My sister wants to search the place,

200
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,670
you let her.

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm your sister.

202
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,750
Gu Yanting.

203
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,670
You jerk.

204
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,840
Show yourself if you are still alive.

205
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,270
If you keep hiding,

206
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,670
I'll leave along
with our son and your division,

207
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,000
so you'll be alone forever.

208
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
Shut up. He isn't here.

209
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,390
