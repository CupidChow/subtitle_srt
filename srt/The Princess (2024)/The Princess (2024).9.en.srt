Sister Qiyan,

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,400
I remember back then,

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,710
you also met
Commander Xiao through opera, right?

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,070
Now, Jiang Ruruo takes the stage.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,280
Aren't you worried that
Commander Xiao might be tempted

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
and seek another lover?

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,430
I do all this for the Commander.

- Good!
- Great!

28
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,430
Why is Yanting here?

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,640
It's Mrs. Gu's first appearance on stage.

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,950

Shall I get you a private room?

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,040
No, thanks. I have the child with me.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,640
- It is close to his mom here.
- Okay.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,870
Then call me if you need anything.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920

64
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,080

65
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,750

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400

69
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,510
I didn't see anyone when I came in.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,640
Go and search!

71
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,110

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,270
What's going on?

79
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,510
- Quickly!
- So many people!

80
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,390
What on earth is happening?

81
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,680

82
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Qiyan,

83
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,920
I have told you,

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
except me,

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,390
no one but me can touch the deity statue.

86
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,950
I came backstage to invite Mrs. Gu for tea.

87
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,600
I even didn't see her.

88
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,950
What are you standing there for? Search!

89
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,030
Yes!

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Isn't this Mr. Gu?

91
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,270
- Yes.
- Isn't this Mr. Gu?

92
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,190
- Yes.
- Who's she?

93
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,510
It seems like the one who sang just now.

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,950
Let's go quickly.

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,070
This is my wife.

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,000
- The performance has ended.
- This is Mrs. Gu.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm here for her curtain call.

98
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,030
Mrs. Gu?

99
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,160
Thank you all for
coming to support her today.

100
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,560
We haven't seen her before, Mr. Gu.

101
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,610
Yeah.

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,240
Mr. Gu,

103
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,510
we've never heard that you have a wife.

104
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,680
- Yes!
- Exactly!

105
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,510
I won't randomly call someone wife.

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,830
Then give a kiss to prove it.

107
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,680
Exactly.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,160
Kiss!

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Just kiss!

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
Kiss, kiss!

111
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,480
- Kiss, kiss!
- Stop fooling around.

112
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,430
Kiss, kiss!

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Don't go.

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440

Sorry, Commander.

143
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,210
We borrowed costumes from Wangyuelou

144
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,690
to bring some marital romance.

145
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,070

You never know.

151
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,270
Let's dig it up another day.

152
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,480
Maybe we can dig up some treasures

153
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,320
to support the foster father.

154
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
Ruruo,

155
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,630
did I scare you?

156
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,340
Thanks for your concern, Commander.

157
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,790
Glad you weren't scared.

158
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Sister Qiyan,

159
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,000
how did I perform today?

160
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,600
Your performance

161
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,750
is really excellent.

162
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,330
Sir,

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
something happened.

164
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,210
Sir,

165
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,670
I was too focused on the Jiangcheng Army.

166
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,000
When I came to, Xiaozhentou was gone.

167
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
Over there!

168
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,000
- Here!
- Yes!

169
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Commander,

170
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,960
the one who moved the deity statue today
should be Mrs. Gu.

171
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
How could you...

172
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
How does she know

173
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,030
the opera deity statue
leads to the Secret Room?

174
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
Qiyan,

175
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,440
You are smart.

176
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,030
I hope

177
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,600
this kind of thing won't happen again.

178
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,080
Commander, what do you mean?

179
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,910
I am the daughter of the owner of Wangyuelou.

180
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,630
How come I allow a woman of unknown origin

181
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,600
to access the most
important secret of Wangyuelou?

182
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,510
Hope it is not the case.

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,390
Dad, I have finished eating.

184
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Can we leave now?

185
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,440
Sweetie, why in such a hurry?

186
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
Eat a little more.

187
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
I will take you to find your mom later.

188
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,870
Um, I have to go be someone's son tonight.

189
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,960
I have to go now.

190
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
What's the rush?

191
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,270
You don't want the wages?

192
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
I... I...

193
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,240
I want.

194
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,510
You little cheat!

195
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,480
Wanna flee? Come over!

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,630
So you're in cahoots with this trafficker.

197
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,290
Since you've seen through it,

198
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
I won't pretend anymore.

199
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
You little cheat.

200
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,360
Be sweet-talking when you are sold later.

201
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,090
So I can sell a good price.

202
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,950
Are you clear?

203
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,600
If you run again, see how I will punish you.

204
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,360
No, don't shoot.

205
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,510
Dad!

206
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,870
Stay put!

207
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,670
Be honest with me.

208
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,000
- What's going on here?
- How many dads do you have?

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,240
He is carrying a gun.

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,870
How about finding a chance to run away later?

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,670
See what?
Can't you see there are traffickers here?

212
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,560
Get the police!

213
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,150
It's a long story.

214
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,200
The wonton here is quite delicious.

215
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,510
I'll serve you a bowl.

216
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,390
Here you are, dad.

217
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,120
Dad, it's not good to be so wasteful.

218
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
Xiaozhentou!

219
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,440
Mom!

220
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,440
Where did you go? I was so worried.

221
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,390
Jiang Ruruo,

222
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,870
This child calls everyone dad.

223
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,280
Can you explain?

224
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,840
Don't get angry.

225
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,160
I will explain back home.

226
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,440
Gu Liang, these two are human traffickers.

227
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,910
The police aren't here yet.
You take them over.

228
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,080
Yes!

229
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
Go!

230
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Uncle Gu Liang, wait a moment.

231
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,720
This is my half-day's salary.

232
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,550
I can't just be someone's Son for free.

233
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,790
At least you have a conscience, you little.

234
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,230
Go!

235
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,730
Two bad guys, go to jail!

236
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,160
Quickly!

237
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,030
Son, don't do such dangerous things anymore.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,050
Get it?

239
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,910
Get it, get it.
