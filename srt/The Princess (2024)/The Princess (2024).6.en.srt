Well done!

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,150
She loves this.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,310
Seems like people here today

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,840
have ulterior motives.

- Amazing!
- Encore!

Wonderful!

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
Great!

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Mr. Paul,

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,630
this is the local delicacy.

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,960
Please try it.

39
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
(Xiao Li,)

40
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,960
(you indeed stole our family's treasure.)

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,870
Mr. Xiao,

42
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,240
doing business with you is a pleasure.

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,280
In ten days,

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,190
I want steel and gunpowder

45
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,120
flowing into my armory.

46
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,590
No problem.

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Deal's done.

48
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,590
Deal's done.

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,080
- Amazing!
- Great!

50
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,030
Well done!

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Impressive!

52
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,470
Amazing!

53
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,710
Ruruo.

54
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,270
You're late.

55
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,270
The opera just ended.

56
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,190
She tricked me.

57
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,510
How was it?

58
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,360
A great show!

59
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,750
Makes me want to try it.

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,920
Fantastic!

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,870
Excellent!

62
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,070
Hand it over.

63
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,110
Alright.

64
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,240
Gu Yanting, you were following me.

65
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
You still recognized me.

66
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,030
Give me the money.

67
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,640
Mrs. Gu,

68
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,260
aren't you disappointed
that I'm still alive?

69
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,190
You know me well, Gu Yanting.

70
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Thanks.

71
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,030
Gu Yanting,

72
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
give me the money.

73
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,190
You're a jerk!

74
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Mrs. Gu,

75
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,830
god is watching.

76
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,190
This is called karma.

77
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,950
Karma?

78
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,830
I can't be worse

79
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
than you,

80
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,950
the butcher hunting for treasure.

81
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,480
So that's what you think of me.

82
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,200
Sir,

83
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,390
we must send them out

84
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,950
in the first group leaving the city
after dawn.

85
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
You're the florist?

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,750
This is Jieyu Flower Shop?

87
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,160
Yes, Mrs. Gu.

88
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
What are you doing?

89
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,440
Let go of me!

90
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Let go!

91
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
You are hiding money in the flowers
to sneak it out of city?

92
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,830
Yes, Mrs. Gu.

93
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,440
Gu Yanting,

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
where's this money going?

95
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Mrs. Gu,

96
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,920
we're sending it to the frontlines

97
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,870
to support our comrades.

98
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,030
Him? Doing good deeds?

99
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,200
Not only that.

100
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,600
Mr. Gu gives all his savings

101
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,600
to the refugees.

102
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
He never wastes money.

103
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,630
Sir,

104
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,910
remember, you have to pamper your wife.

105
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm not his wife!

106
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,840
I don't want you either.

107
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,670
With the war in chaos,

108
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,600
can you really get the money out?

109
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
Mr. Gu has connections.

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,120
We've been supporting the frontlines
like this for a while.

111
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,080
(So he's seeking treasure
to support the frontlines.)

112
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,360
(Did I misjudge him?)

113
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,110
Why are you staring?

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,670
You tricked me at Wangyue Theatre today.

115
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,240
This money is your debt.

116
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,000
You did the wrong thing first.

117
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,030
Either way,

118
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,270
Xiao Li will investigate

119
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,630
the missing money.

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,120
If we want to survive,

121
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,560
we need to work together.

122
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
You're finally awake,

123
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,510
my dear brother.

124
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Mr. Xiao,

125
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,480
last night, a woman in a qipao

126
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,670
stole the money you gave me.

127
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,670
She was veiled,

128
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
but

129
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,390
she had a graceful figure.

130
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,670
Beautiful,

131
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,750
but vicious.

132
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,550
My concern is

133
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,750
whether you can deliver the goods

134
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,030
to my armory in ten days.

135
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,960
You have to repay me.

136
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,840
Without the money,
I can't get the goods.

137
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,800
Mr. Paul,

138
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,150
for the sake of the city,

139
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,910
I won't let any bandits run free.

140
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,630
But you lost the money yourself.

141
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,870
I won't pay you again.

142
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,030
Then the deal's off.

143
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,910
You'll regret this, Xiao Li.

144
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,200
It was her!

145
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,910
She stole my money last night.

146
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,150
Sir, what money?

147
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,390
After the opera, I went home.

148
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,550
I didn't go out again.

149
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't believe her lies!

150
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,360
It was her!

151
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,840
Have you proof of this?

152
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,630
What?

153
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,280
It's you!

154
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,200
You dare double-cross me!

155
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,230
Sir!

156
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,200
I hate it
when people point fingers at me.

157
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,910
Where can we find a new supplier

158
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,480
in such short time?

159
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I heard from Qi Yan

160
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,390
that Du Hanqing has returned.

161
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
With him,

162
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,840
we won't need Paul.

163
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,550
It's been six months.

164
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,840
You are not only prettier,

165
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,600
but also a better musician.

166
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,510
Sis,

167
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,630
I heard you performed
at Wangyue Theatre yesterday.

168
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,390
I was busy with a friend

169
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,390
and missed it.

170
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,000
That's all right.

171
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
I'll call you next time I go.

172
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,840
Okay.

173
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,440
Mrs. Gu,

174
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,480
this is Miss Du Anni.

175
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,910
She just returned from Europe
with Mr. Du.

176
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,960
I invited her over.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,720
She's Gu Yanting's wife?

178
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,920
Yes.

179
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,670
Nice to meet you, I'm Jiang Ruruo.

180
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,030
Is Yanting really coming?

181
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,720
Since Mrs. Gu became the secretary,

182
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,510
