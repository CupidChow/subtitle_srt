12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,240
Just minor injuries.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,670
They don't hurt.

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,000
You are so weak.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,920
Yet you still forced yourself
to confront Du Hanqing

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,120
at the Armory.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,550
You think you have the bones of iron

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,520
and are capable of anything?

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,600
The Armory is your family asset.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,430
You sacrificed so much for it.

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,960
I must secure it for you.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,560
I won't thank you, though.

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,790
You brought this

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,920
upon yourself.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,920
You still don't admit it.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,120
You ordered Gu Liang
to keep me here.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,000
You blame me for going to the Armory.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
It's obvious you are worried about me.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,840
So I must safeguard you as well.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
Nonsense.

31
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,710
I suddenly feel this conversation

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,480
has taken us back to the past.

33
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,870
Too bad, we can't go back to the past.

34
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,310
Muran, stop waiting.

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,000
You are injured.

36
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,480
Go to bed.

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm okay.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,870
Sister said.

39
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,790
She said

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,040
she'd come back to see me.

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Muran.

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Muran.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,030
Muran. Muran.

44
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Muran.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,470
Muran! Are you okay, Muran?

46
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,000
Muran, you silly boy.

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,190
Muran.

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,990
Sister.

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Sister,

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,630
why do you do this to me?

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,310
Sister.

52
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,990
Sister,

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
don't go.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Muran,

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,560
again and again,

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,470
you risk your life

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
for Qiu Ruoran.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,150
If it goes on,

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,030
you'll get yourself killed eventually.

60
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,140
(House of Qiu)

61
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,430
(Muran,)

62
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,520
(it's all my fault,)

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,870
(so you have so much burden.)

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,400
Aunt,

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,910
why are you here in our old house?

66
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,590
Sit.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
Ruoran,

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,430
since you learned
about the child's past,

69
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,800
we've been estranged.

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600
It's been a long time

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,430
since we last sat and talked.

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
Aunt,

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,840
I know

74
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,870
you did everything for Muran.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
It's my bad.

76
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,510
I gave birth to Muran,

77
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,830
but I didn't provide him
with a peaceful and happy life.

78
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,310
Muran is a sensitive boy.

79
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,360
He needs extra care.

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,590
Back then,

81
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,950
Du Hanqing and I had an affair.

82
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
I was pregnant,

83
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,150
but then,

84
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,950
Du Hanqing got scared and left.

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,240
I wanted to keep the baby,

86
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
and married Li out of desperation.

87
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,630
Your uncle was nice to me and Muran.

88
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,600
But it didn't last long.

89
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,310
After his mother knew Muran's birth,

90
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,680
she tried everything to torture him.

91
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,510
I couldn't tolerate it

92
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,390
and I took Muran

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
to stay with the Qiu family.

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,960
Ruoran,

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,600
it was your company

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
that took Muran out of depression.

97
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,590
Aunt,

98
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,480
everything will be fine.

99
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,880
However,

100
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,920
I don't know if your company

101
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,510
is fortune

102
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,600
or a curse.

103
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,110
Ruoran,

104
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,430
this used

105
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,270
to your favorite snack.

106
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,200
Try it.

107
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
When did you get

108
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,040
back together with Du Hanqing?

109
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,510
You wish to know

110
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,870
if I'm involved

111
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,000
in the massacre of the Qiu family

112
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
seven years ago.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Aunt,

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,680
I wish not to doubt you and Muran.

115
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,310
I put all my suspicion and hate

116
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,750
on Gu Yanting.

117
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,590
But in the recent days,

118
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,480
it suddenly occurred to me

119
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,750
that another person knew I had the key

120
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,430
and could easily obtain it.

121
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,670
You.

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
When I met

123
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,560
Du Hanqing again,

124
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,480
he was already Qiu family's manager.

125
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,430
I didn't want anything to do with him,

126
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,070
but he threatened me

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,870
to steal the treasure map

128
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
with Muran.

129
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,040
I thought he was after the money,

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920
but I didn't expect

131
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,120
it led to that massacre.

132
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,430
Du Hanqing

133
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,040
colluded with Xiao

134
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,390
that as soon as
they had the treasure map,

135
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,680
they'd launch the attack.

136
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,190
Among the Qiu and the Li families,

137
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,830
no one but

138
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,680
the three of us survived.

139
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,310
So you knew all along that Yanting
was the wrong person to blame?

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,070
So what?

141
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,070
I poured my heart out to you.

142
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,310
Do you know how much he matters to me?

143
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,750
But does he love you?

144
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,310
If he does, why did he go to Ningcheng

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,920
instead of coming back as promised?

146
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,190
If he had come back as promised,

147
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,630
the Qiu and the Li families

148
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,910
wouldn't have been slain

149
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,630
by Xiao Li and his soldiers.

150
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,790
When I learned

151
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,510
that he lied to you,

152
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,320
do you know it hurt me?

153
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,240
Whenever I saw you

154
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,550
hold the boy in arms
with both love and hate,

155
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,550
it reminded me

156
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,840
of myself in the past.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,750
So you took the liberty

158
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,030
to dump my sick baby

159
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,480
and came back to tell me
that he was dead.

160
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,360
I did the right thing.

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,270
Only when you learned the boy was dead

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,670
would the pain take you out
of the love for Gu Yanting,

163
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,750
so you'd focus on the revenge.

164
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,720
What's wrong with taking revenge?

165
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,790
Because I have

166
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,080
nothing but hate inside.

167
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,870
In conclusion,

168
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,840
it is all my fault.

169
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,390
I will be responsible

170
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,910
for my own fault.

171
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,120
Empty another shot

172
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
with me.

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,910
Perhaps it is

174
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,270
the last time

175
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,550
the two of us sit together like this.

176
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,910
It fits you.

177
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,150
People say,
"Daughter is the mother's coat."

178
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
Then what about the son?

179
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,200
The son?

180
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,320
The son is the mother's pillow.

181
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Too bad,

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,670
I only have the pillow,

183
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
no coat.

184
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,550
Aunt, I'm your coat.

185
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,480
Yes, yes.

186
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,200
In the end,

187
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,360
I still can't do it.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,150
It truly is a curse.

189
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,550
One misstep

190
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,240
lead to more missteps.

191
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,280
Aunt.

192
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,600
It's poisoned.

Aunt.

200
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,870
Take care of Muran.

Don't let him feel sad
because of you again.

Mother.

210
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Aunt.
