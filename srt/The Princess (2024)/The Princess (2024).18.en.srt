You point a gun at me first.

If I kill you in self-defense,

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,200
I don't think Old Warlord will blame me.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,390
So it is what you are after

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,430
by getting me here.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Get him.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
Ruruo,

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,710
do you have any idea
what you are doing?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Hold me hostage, so you'll get out alive.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Jiang Ruruo!

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,230
- Stay out of this.
- Now.

23
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,790
You forget what I said?

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,680
Hurry!

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,870
Xiao Li, you know how good a shooter I am.

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,150
Quickly, go!

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,270
You...

28
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,910
Jiangcheng is
under Xiao Li's control for 7 years.

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,470
His forces are all over the city.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
He commands
Jiangcheng Army and Wangyuelou.

31
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,240
You must think before act.

32
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't be reckless.

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,840
Are you worried about me

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,430
or are you worried about

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,430
losing your hard-earned
Commander's Wife title?

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
I...

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm...

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm worried about you.

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,910
As who?

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
I...

41
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,120
This is how far I go.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
Are you going back to him?

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Yes.

44
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,280
You like these?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,030
When you were with you,

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,870
I'd blame myself
for the smallest injury on you.

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,470
You have only been his wife for a night,

48
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,750
and after he did this to you,

49
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,800
you are still going back?

50
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,750
Are you that

51
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,150
submissive?

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,430
I am.

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
The treasure has been moved.

54
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,800
It is no longer in Wangyuelou.

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,190
Why are you telling me this?

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,590
What I do

57
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,840
will no longer be your business.

58
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,800
Since the treasure cannot be found,

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,120
Xiao Li is no longer
taken into consideration.

60
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,720
I must teach him a lesson,

61
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,040
or else he thinks
he really rules Jiangcheng.

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,150
Yes, Boss.

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,070
What you can't tolerate
is how Xiao Li treats Ruruo.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,430
You are right. He's crossed the line.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,430
Nobody hurts her.

66
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,790
Move them away.

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,510
Are you going to help Gu Yanting?

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
Mind your own business.

69
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,470
It's Dad's order

70
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,390
that the Du family will not
be involved in their rivalry.

71
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,750
We wait until one of them is down.

72
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,630
Take her to her room.

73
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,180
(Map of Jiangcheng)

74
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,800
It appears Gu Yanting was prepared.

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Last night,

76
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,360
the Northern Division raided

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
23 outer-city sentry posts.

78
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,870
Our men were caught off guard

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,120
and surrounded by them.

80
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,300
(Map of Jiangcheng)

81
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,870
After laying low for so long,

82
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,680
Gu Yanting finally strikes.

83
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,710
Commander,

84
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,310
I assume your wife is the reason

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,040
why Gu Yanting launches the mutiny.

86
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,390
Indeed, the Northern Division
is formidable,

87
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,430
but they are still a fraction
of Jiangcheng Army.

88
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,720
It cannot be that easy

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
for them to surround us.

90
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,510
Plus, we have stopped
their arms supply,

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
he won't last for long.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
And by then,

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,190
he will ask Old Warlord for aid.

94
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,480
Have you located their telegraph?

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,720
Wangyuelou elite soldiers

96
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,430
are in the search for it.

97
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,360
Keep it monitored once it's located.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Yes.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Father,

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
I have controlled all passes
in Jiangcheng.

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,040
But I'm in short of arms supply,

102
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,630
so I require your aid.

103
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,510
Miss Zi Dai, where are we going?

104
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,950
It isn't safe here.

105
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,630
I'll take you to somewhere safe.

106
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Sir.

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Commander's order.

108
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Take Xiaozhentou to Xiao Mansion.

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
Madam.

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Mr. Lou.

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,680
Are you here with the message
for Commander Xiao?

112
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,710
Madam.

113
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,680
(Play script)
This is the latest play script.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,750
It is to be reviewed by Commander.

115
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,950
Play script?

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,380
(2053 0961 1927 0582)

117
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,110
Madam,

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,270
do you remember

119
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,160
the password book I showed to you?

120
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,800
It is the location of Gu Yanting's telegraph

121
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,560
found by Wangyuelou.

122
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,200
It is very important information,

123
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,680
Commander is to be debriefed at once.

124
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,590
Zi Dai?

125
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,910
Xiaozhentou?

126
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,430
Mum.

127
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,230
Zi Dai,

128
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,790
why have you brought him here?

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,870
Madam, it's unsafe out there.

130
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Commander ordered me to take shelter

131
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,440
here with Xiaozhentou.

132
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,270
I'm his mum. I'll take care of him.

133
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
It's Commander's order.

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,670
I must take him to the specified place.

135
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,390
Xiaozhentou, come with me.

136
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,500
(Xiao Mansion)

137
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,350
Wait.

138
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,280
Madam.

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,150
Where are you going?

140
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,230
I've got stuff to do.

141
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
I need to go out.

142
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,360
Ask Commander for permission, please.

143
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,350
Commander gave the order.

144
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,790
Nobody leaves the mansion.

145
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,910
Are you sure I'm included?

146
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,840
Well, I...

147
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,150
I'm going out.

148
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,510
And no one stops me.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
Madam.

150
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,350
Commander,

151
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,630
I ran into your wife on my way here.

152
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,120
She knows you

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,320
are searching for Gu Yanting's telegraph,

154
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,960
so she changed the note inside.

155
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,740
(3096 2582 0953 9362)

156
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,160
Commander.

157
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,750
Your wife left the mansion by force

158
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,600
along with Gu Yanting's son.

159
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,630
We didn't dare to stop her.

160
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,510
(Ruruo,)

161
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,270
(it seems your heart)

162
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,790
(is always with Gu Yanting.)

163
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
Yes, sir.

164
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,560
Commander,

165
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,960
do I order soldiers to take her back?

166
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,440
She will try to find ways

167
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,870
to protect Gu Yanting's telegraph.

168
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,750
Order the soldiers
to destroy the telegraph,

169
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,960
and then take her back safe and sound.

170
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,990
Yes, Commander.

171
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,870
Young Master,
Miss Jiang has left Xiao Mansion.

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Move.

173
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,440
Sister. Oh, sorry. Mrs. Xiao.

174
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,920
Where's Yanting?

175
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,030
B-Boss is not here.

176
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,030
Xiao Li intends
to hold Xiaozhentou hostage.

177
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,390
You must keep him on the watch.

178
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,790
Nobody takes him away
except for Yanting.

179
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes.

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,510
Be good, Xiaozhentou.

181
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,320
Mum, I will.

182
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
(It turns out the telegraph)

183
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,200
(is at the hideout Yanting
took me and Xiaozhentou to.)

184
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,000
(I must help him move it elsewhere.)

185
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,630
Dad.

186
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,800
Son.

187
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,390
- Division Commander.
- Anything happened?

188
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,030
- Where is Zi Dai?
- Dad,

189
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,910
Aunt Zi Dai took me to Xiao Mansion.

190
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,200
Xiao Mansion?

191
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Then Mum took me back again.

192
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
Where is Mum?

193
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
She said

194
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,080
she'd go to the secret room we stayed

195
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
for an important matter.

196
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,390
- Keep him on the watch.
- Yes.

197
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,480
Xiaozhentou, come here.

198
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,150
(The telegraph is here as expected.)

199
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,840
(I must move it elsewhere.)

200
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,270
Mr. Lou, what are you doing here?

201
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,960
Madam, Commander identified
the wrong information on the note,

202
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,840
and has sent soldiers
to destroy the telegraph.

203
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,440
I came to tell you
as soon as I was informed.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,590
It must be moved elsewhere
before Xiao Li's soldiers arrive.
