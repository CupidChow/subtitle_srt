I risked my life getting you
out of Xiao Mansion.

I have been taking good care of you.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
I have been there for you.

34
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,870
But the first thing you do
when you open your eyes

35
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,120
is to see Jiang Ruruo, huh?

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Why?

37
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,630
Tell me why!

38
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,240
Why can't it be me?

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,870
It's her.

40
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,870
It's because of her.

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,080
Sister,

42
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,210
it's gone this far.

43
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,360
Let them leave.

44
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,430
Anni,

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,000
you saved my life.

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,750
I appreciate it.

47
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,960
And if you want my life back,

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
you can have it.

49
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,870
But you can't hurt Ruruo.

50
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,190
You think I won't shoot?

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,310
My dad is a traitor.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm not!

53
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,800
Why does everyone attack me?

54
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,750
What are you looking at?

55
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,720
Even you will humiliate me?

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
I won't stop you.

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,390
Jump if you like.

58
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,910
I'll have a cigarette.

59
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,110
You...

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,270
I came here first.

61
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,710
Be my guest.

62
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,560
Why must you kill yourself?

63
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,430
You don't understand!

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,000
You know nothing.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,870
Why must you feel bad

66
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,000
about what others say?

67
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,720
Everything is over if you die.

68
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,080
Yanting,

69
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,920
let's go home.

70
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,150
Protect Boss.

71
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,480
Doctor says you are severely injured.

72
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,920
You should rest in bed.

73
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,800
You should have signaled me later.

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,190
What's the rush?

75
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,270
I can handle

76
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,310
our family business.

77
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,360
You want the truth?

78
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,360
I don't care.

79
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
The truth is,

80
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,040
as soon as I closed my eyes,

81
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,750
I'd imagine
you get stolen by another man,

82
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,750
and then I couldn't stay in bed.

83
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,680
Did I make you laugh, my love?

84
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,470
Easy.

85
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,600
I couldn't wait to come home

86
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,390
because I missed you too much.

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,390
I lied.

88
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,240
The days without you drove me crazy.

89
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,390
You should have come home sooner.

90
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,520
Same for me.

91
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
I missed you like crazy.

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,200
Let's meet tomorrow.

93
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,600
Miss Anni,

94
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
the Northern Division
is fighting the Du family,

95
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,360
you shouldn't have asked me out.

96
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,910
Excuse me. Your coffee.

97
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,080
I should have realized

98
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,870
that no matter
how long I kept Yanting,

99
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,670
you would always be his love

100
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,870
while I could't have win his heart.

101
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,630
What's your point, Miss Anni?

102
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,270
I'm here to say goodbye.

103
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,670
You are leaving Jiangcheng?

104
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,240
I came back home for Yanting.

105
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,510
Since I can't have his love,

106
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,200
there's no point in me staying here.

107
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,150
Yanting is outside.

108
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,440
Will you say goodbye to him?

109
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,630
No need.

110
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,120
Just go.

111
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,150
Stop showing off.

112
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,110
It annoys me.

113
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,470
Anni.

114
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,510
Goodbye.

115
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,710
(Yanting.)

116
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,800
(Goodbye.)

117
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,790
Won't you ask what we talked about?

118
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,870
I heard she'd go abroad.

119
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,240
I hope she'll find her own happiness.

120
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,240
Like ours.

121
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,670
Drink the medicine.

122
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,480
You have been
in Wangyuelou all this time?

123
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,150
Where else

124
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,390
could I go?

125
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,120
You had a chance to kill me.

126
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,240
Why didn't you do it?

127
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm not like you.

128
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,320
After being with you for years,

129
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,510
I can't say I have no feeling for you.

130
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,030
When I reclaim Jiangcheng,

131
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,150
I'll let you run Wangyuelou.

132
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,160
Commander,

133
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,150
we are getting in touch
with more and more

134
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,990
Jiangcheng troops.

135
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,270
The Warlord has learned and agreed

136
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,670
to your conditions.

137
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,990
Got it.

138
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,510
Dad, you are up?

139
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm fine.

140
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,840
What's going on in the kitchen?

141
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
Mum said

142
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,550
she'd cook for us.

143
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,740
She'd make soup for you.

144
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Give me more time.

145
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,350
Wait a minute.

146
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
Are-are you okay in there?

147
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,320
Don't look down on me.

148
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,510
I can handle it.

149
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,000
Something is wrong
with the fish, though.

150
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,510
I'm making chicken soup.

151
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,840
Do you need my help?

152
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,960
No.

153
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,680
Dinner's ready.

154
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,750
Where is Xiaozhentou?

155
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,790
He's asleep.

156
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,720
He won't have dinner.

157
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,720
What a feast.

158
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,910
The chicken...

159
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,590
Looks perky!

160
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,360
I tried it.

161
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,870
It tastes okay.

162
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,350
What's wrong?

163
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,480
Nothing. I prepared a surprise for you.

164
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,440
