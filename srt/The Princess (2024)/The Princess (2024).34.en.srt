Hurry.

190
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,630
Ma'am.

191
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,240
Ma'am, bad news.

192
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,960
Boss got assassinated.

193
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,920
What?

194
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Is he...

195
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,870
Is Gu Yanting dead?

196
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
He's still alive.

197
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,480
But heavily injured.

198
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,480
Do you know who did it?

199
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,600
Judging from the clips,

200
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,510
it was Northern Division soldiers.

201
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
You're back.

202
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,870
You escaped death.

203
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,720
Very lucky.

204
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,120
If you want me dead,

205
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,120
you can do it personally.

206
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,710
Don't you worry.

207
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,480
I will kill you myself.

208
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,080
But you still have worth,

209
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,200
so for now,

210
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,720
I let you live.

211
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,750
Gu Liang,

212
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,480
stop following me anymore.

213
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
You watch him closely.

214
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Starting today,

215
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,720
Gu Yanting

216
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,480
