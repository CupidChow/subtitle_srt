(Xiao Shizhao's Death Inquiry)

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
(Xiao Shizhao was poisoned to death.)

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,920
(On the night he died,)

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,350
(Xiao Li went into the Commander's Office.)

17
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,150
Xiao Li,

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,480
our nation is in peril.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,000
The Qiu family has founded
the machinery factory

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,310
in a bid to save our nation.

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,640
It is a great move,

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
yet has drawn too much attention.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,310
I'm afraid trouble will find them.

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,310
I order you to protect it in secret.

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,070
Make sure it is secured

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,430
and aid them
in achieving the great cause.

27
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,280
Xiao Shizhao ordered Xiao Li

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,680
to protect the factory

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,280
instead of slaughtering our family.

30
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,640
(The truth has come to light.)

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,240
(Xiao Li,)

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,280
(death is upon you.)

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
Commander,

34
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,560
I saw Gu Yanting take soldiers
out of the city with my own eyes.

35
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,280
We get back to Xiao Mansion now.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Yes.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,150
Hold still, Jiangcheng is ours.

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,470
Surrender now.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,180
(Xiao Mansion)

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,340
(Xiao Mansion)

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,590
Hail, Commander.
Jiangcheng is once again yours.

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,460
(Xiao Mansion)

43
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,430
It is too easy.

44
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,750
Ruruo,

45
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,590
are you waiting for me?

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm told you were an orphan.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,470
Xiao Shizhao took you home.

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,840
Then you followed him in war

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,910
and came to Jiangcheng seven years ago.

50
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,710
But within a month you came back,

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,750
our family was massacred.

52
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,550
And soon,

53
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,080
Xiao Shizhao died of illness.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,590
What are you getting at?

55
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,680
Father told me

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,910
both Mr. Fang

57
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,190
and Commander Xiao

58
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,000
were supportive of his factory,

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,430
so they wouldn't define him

60
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,840
as a warmonger.

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,710
And information shows

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,870
that Xiao Shizhao was in good health,

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,310
but right after he wrote the testament

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
that made Yanting his successor,

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
he died unexpectedly.

66
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,590
Ruruo,

67
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,510
you confront me this way

68
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,120
because you are sure I won't kill you.

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,870
Even if you do,

70
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,510
it doesn't change
the fact that you are the culprit.

71
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,870
The massacre of my family

72
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,830
was orchestrated by you.

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,950
It has nothing to do with Xiao Shizhao.

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,240
You say all these

75
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,000
to exculpate Xiao Shizhao

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,000
just to be with Gu Yanting, don't you?

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,200
You are right.

78
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,270
I want to be with Gu Yanting,

79
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,920
and I will also avenge the innocent.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,240
It's too late for you to be with him.

81
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,670
What do you mean?

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,190
Right after he received the message

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,600
and left town with his soldiers,

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,750
I came immediately back
to Xiao Mansion.

85
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,870
Haven't you realized anything?

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
The so-called intelligence

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,190
was to lure Yanting out of the city.

88
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,830
What's your deal with the Old Warlord?

89
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,950
This is the letter of appointment

90
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,510
from the Old Warlord

91
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,000
(Ningcheng Warlord Shen Yishan)
that reinstates my position.

92
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,390
Once I take over Jiangcheng,

93
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,310
and put my name on it,

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,920
I will still be the legal
Commander-in-chief of Jiangcheng.

95
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,070
He has his eyes on Jiangcheng for long,

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,680
why would he do it?

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Of course,

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,920
after I occupy Jiangcheng,

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,510
I must listen to his orders.

100
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,510
But it's still a good deal.

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,510
He promised he'd kill Gu Yanting.

102
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
In order to take Yanting's life,

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,430
you give up the city?

104
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,110
Correct.

105
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,360
I hate Gu Yanting so much

106
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,560
that I'm willing
to trade the city for his life.

107
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,430
- You...
- Ruruo,

108
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,190
when Gu Yanting is dead,

109
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
you will be mine.

110
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,560
It is too late.

111
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,430
I bet Gu Yanting has been
shot to death in the wild.

112
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
Shut up!

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Commander, what's going on?

114
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,110
Nothing.

115
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,830
Just an accident.

116
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,950
Even if you kill me,

117
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,950
Gu Yanting won't be back.

118
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,350
Xiao Li,

119
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,040
you are smart.

120
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,720
You should have realized
the Old Warlord's intention.

121
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,830
He's in Ningcheng,

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,830
yet his eyes are on Jiangcheng,

123
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,600
as it's a strategic and rich city.

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,720
That's why he always involves
himself in this city's affairs.

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
You let his men in

126
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,310
is like inviting a wolf pack in.

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,720
So what?

128
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,040
All I am after

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,870
is the commandership.

130
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm not like you or Gu Yanting.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,040
I don't care about
the nation or the people.

132
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,830
All I want is

133
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,040
a nice life with you.

134
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,190
Count me out!

135
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,830
Your nice life is built on others' misery!

136
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,240
Others' misery is none of my concern.

137
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,310
Xiao Li,

138
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,800
you are hopeless.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,430
You give me no hope!

140
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,870
You missed on purpose.

141
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,160
Because you knew

142
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,830
if you killed me,

143
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,270
you wouldn't even
see Gu Yanting's dead body.

144
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,670
You!

145
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
What's so good about Gu Yanting?

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,310
Just be with me,

147
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,600
we can raise Xiaozhentou together.

148
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,240
In your dreams!

149
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,830
It's not your call.

150
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,480
I have sent my men to get your son.

151
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,440
Open up!

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
What took you so long?

153
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,390
Officers,

154
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,600
what is the matter?

155
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,750
Let me ask you.

156
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,440
Your next-door family has a boy,

157
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
about six years old,

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080
did you see him?

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,910
You mean Mrs. Gu's son?

160
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,590
You did?

161
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,150
I did. I did.

162
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
Where?

163
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,000
He and his parents

164
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,270
went shopping yesterday,

165
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,960
and I ran into them

166
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,030
on their way home.

167
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,110
Yesterday?

168
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,670
- Right.
- Don't

169
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,270
you waste my time with

170
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,110
your yesterday story.

171
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,350
Get out of the way!

172
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,710
Search the place.

173
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,710
Move.

174
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,510
It's...

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,790
Nothing in here.

176
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,750
A waste of time.

177
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
Check over there.

178
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,320
Yes.

179
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,870
Granny,

180
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,270
when will Mummy be home?

181
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
Let's get inside.

182
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,320
Hurry.

183
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,030
You can't find him.

184
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,870
It seems you made the arrangement

185
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,750
before you came here.

186
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
Commander,

187
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
Gu Yanting's body is in the square.

188
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
Impossible.

189
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,910
Which one is Gu Yanting?

190
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,630
Commander,

191
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,720
you should have more patience.

192
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,440
Desheng,

193
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,600
what are you doing?

194
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,870
The Warlord agreed
to help you kill Gu Yanting,

195
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,120
but he didn't want Jiang Ruruo to live.

196
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,510
Oh yes.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,870
My foster father

198
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,510
enjoys having everything in control.

199
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,870
I have been informed

200
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,750
that he has planted his man
in your mansion.

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,630
So you are the Warlord's man.

202
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,150
Over the years,

203
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,720
I have never got suspicious of you.

204
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,800
Commander,

205
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,600
if you stuck with the plan

206
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,720
and helped the Warlord
occupy Jiangcheng,

207
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,120
I'd still be loyal to you.

208
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,080
All he wants is the city,

209
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,910
but why Ruruo's death?

210
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,440
It's simple.

211
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
He doesn't want her alive.

212
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,480
What's the story between them?

213
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Seven years ago,

214
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,960
the Warlord ordered Gu Yanting
to approach her

215
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,440
in an attempt to obtain
the treasure map.

216
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,790
However, Gu Yanting
fell in love with her,

217
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,870
and returned to Ningcheng empty-handed.

218
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,910
The Warlord's plan failed,

219
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,510
you obtained the treasure map.

220
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,120
Seven years ago,

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,840
the Warlord sent Yanting over.

222
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,870
But unexpectedly,
a stone-hearted man like you

223
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,320
would get soft for her.

224
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,120
You even gave away the Armory.

225
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,870
So now you see?

226
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,000
The Warlord decides

227
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,080
this woman must go!

228
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,040
Xiao Li,

229
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,670
you set me up.

230
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,960
(Yanting is not dead.)

231
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,750
(I must find him.)

232
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,910
Now that the Warlord's spy is killed,

233
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,390
starting now,

234
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,480
Jiangcheng will be mine.

235
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,110
Ruruo,

236
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,670
from this day on,

237
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,320
you go nowhere.

238
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
You stay by my side

239
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,270
as the commander's wife.

240
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,230
Ruruo,

241
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,790
there is no escape.

242
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,710
Xiao Li,

243
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,670
I'd rather die

244
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
than be with you.

245
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,270
Don't hurt yourself.

246
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,470
Xiao Li.
