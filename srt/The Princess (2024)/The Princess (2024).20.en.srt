92
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,000
Mr. Du, you has turned
into a wealthy businessman from a Manager,

93
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,600
very impressive.

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,560
Mr. Gu,

95
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,070

96
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,000
Mr. Du,

97
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,870
you used to be an employee

98
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,100
of Qiu Family,
the richest in Jiangcheng.

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,160
Then

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,750
you acted as a manager
between foreigners and locals.

101
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,560
In terms of career planning,

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,430
you've remained dedicated.

103
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,670
Mr. Gu,

104
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,160
you said you'd help me take the armory,

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,600
but Xiao Li still holds the wealth

106
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,750
he stole from Qiu Family.

107
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,750

108
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,950
having money means

109
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,630
he can recruit soldiers anytime

110
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,120

111
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,790
Mr. Du,

112
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,920
I understand your concerns.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
You're afraid
that if you openly standing with me,

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
Xiao Li will take revenge on you.

115
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm just a businessman.

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,070
How could I confront

117
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,750
you or Commander Xiao,

118
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,720

119
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,790
Don't worry.

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,680
The treasures Xiao Li took
from Qiu Family

121
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,870
have been sent to my foster father.

122
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,630
Without the armory,

123
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,950
he won't be able to return.

125
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,560

sufficient supplies,

127
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,270
I'll defend it for you.

128
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,480
You just need to focus on your business

129
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,920

130
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240

131
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,430

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,310
What's it?

136
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,190
Qiu Family was wronged,

137
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,630
leading to Qiu Nianyuan's death.

138

As an old employee,

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,510
you know he was innocent, right?

140
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,720
Yes, yes.

141
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,830
So after you get the armory,

142
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,270
I want you to issue a statement

143
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,310

144
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,720
Rest assured, Mr. Gu.

145
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,160
Mr. Qiu was just and noble,

146
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,870
and cared for the country and people.

147
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,480

148
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,750

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640

been unwavering.

154
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,600
But I heard

155
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,510

156
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,600
Aren't you afraid of repeating the past?

157
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,470
I

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,560

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,790
to establish a machinery factory,

188
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,150
and do business with foreigners?

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,910
Because in today's world,

190
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,270

all in the hands of Westerners.

191
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,270
To strengthen our nation,

192
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,360
we must learn it first.

193
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,990
(Dad,)

194
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,670
(after all these years,)

195
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,910
(your name has finally been cleared.)

196
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,030
Mr. Qiu was
not only Jiangcheng's richest,

197
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
but also a Chief of Staff
who could rival the Warlord.

198
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,390
The Northern Division's soldiers?

199
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,440
Now his name has been cleared.

200
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,510
- Yes.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Yanting,

202
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
thank you for everything
you've done for me.

203
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,270
I must resolve the hatred

204
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,240
between Xiao Li and me myself.

205
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,000
Mrs. Gu, I finally found you.

206
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,550
What happened?

207
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,790
For some reason,

208
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,510
boss's injury worsened suddenly.

209
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,510
He ain't doing good.

210
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,440
Mrs. Gu, where are you going?

211
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,390
I'll drive you there.

212
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,830
Where is she?

213
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,680
Young Master,

214
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,910
we asked several times and confirmed

215
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,540
that Ms. Jiang hasn't returned
to Xiao Mansion.

216
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,670
Mom said she went to find Xiao Li.

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,320
If she didn't go…

218
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,600
Could she have gone to Gu Mansion?

219
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,360
Yanting,

220
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,480
are you okay?

221
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,150
You're all right?

222
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
You disappointed?

223
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,110
I…

224
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,120
I saw your men

225
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,750
distributing newspapers

226
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,720
on the street today.

227
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,030
Thank you for clearing my father's name.

228
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,910
No need to read too much into it.

229
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,790
I didn't do it all for you.

230
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,590
I understand.

231
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,960
But I still want to thank you.

232
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,240
You inadvertently help me a lot.

233
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,720
Where's Xiaozhentou?

234
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,480
It's not safe here.

235
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,570
I had Gu Liang take him

236
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,360
to my aunt's place in the countryside.

237
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,350
That's good.

238
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,510
Then…

239
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,720
Take care of yourself.

240
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
(Yanting,)

241
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,320

242
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,670
