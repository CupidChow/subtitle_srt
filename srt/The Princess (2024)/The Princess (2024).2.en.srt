Mr. Gu, you're back.

14
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,510
(I actually forgot this woman.)

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,590
Who are they?

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,120
Hello, Auntie! I'm Xiaozhentou.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,840
I'm Dad's son.

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,200
I forgot to mention,

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm already married and have a son
in Ning City.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,480
This is my wife.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,400
This is Zi Dai,

22
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,990
my concubine.

23
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,510
You two need to get along.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,430
(Why did he suddenly agree?)

25
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,480
Ma'am, let me help you with your luggage.

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,000
Young master, come on.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,070
I'll take you for some snacks.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
Okay.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,310
I want to eat this!

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,870
This one? Here!

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,760
(Only by sticking closely to Gu Yanting)

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,000
(can I go into the prison
to save Muran.)

33
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,630
- Good!
- Great!

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,590
Commander, Mr. Gu and his wife are home.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,960
Ask her to test things out tonight!

36
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,470
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,080
Good!

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,680
He has such an appetite

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,150
that I thought he hadn't eaten for days!

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,710
No manners at all.

41
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Auntie's cooking is too delicious!

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Mr. Gu doesn't say much
about his days in Ning City.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,080
This meal is

44
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,750
made to his taste.

45
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,080
Does it suit yours?

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,800
Yes.

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,080
What Yanting likes, I like.

48
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,560
You two are so sweet.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
How did you meet?

50
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,360
Years ago,

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
I saved her life,

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,870
and she decided to be with me.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,030
But now, she doesn't remember it.

54
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,310
You're quite the hero!

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,680
But Ma'am,

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,590
how could you forget
such a romantic thing?

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,910
How could I forget!

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,240
I just remember

59
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,400
what Yanting said when he proposed-

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,470
I never proposed to you.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,710
Yue,

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,470
I want to always be by your side.

63
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,470
I want to marry...

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm tired. I'll go rest now.

65
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,030
I remember

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
your old clothes

67
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,240
are still in the wardrobe
in Mr. Gu's room.

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,080
My old clothes…

69
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,470
they're still there?

70
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,550
Yes.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
You should try them on later.

72
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,470
If they don't fit,

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,190
I'll prepare a few more sets tomorrow.

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,400
No need.

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,830
I brought enough clothes.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,870
Mr. Gu treasures

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,630
your clothes.

78
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,040
If you don't wear them,

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
he might be upset.

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,750
It's not that serious.

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
I'll try them on.

82
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,220
(So many beautiful clothes.)

83
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,440

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,610

85
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,630

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,430

87

to be a good wife.

190
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
Drive.

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,460
(Prison of Jiang City)

192
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,120
We've used every method,

193
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
but he won't say anything.

194
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,550
This is only one stitched wound
on his body.

195
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,870
Gu Liang, check it out.

196
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,870
I'll wait outside.

198
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,390
Little girl, come here. Keep me company!

199
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,270
Such a pretty girl.

200
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,710
Come here.

201
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,960
Don't go.

202
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,240
All of them are desperadoes,

203
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,910
you should be careful.

204
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,550
Desperadoes?

205
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
Without executioners

206
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
like you and Xiao Li,

207
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,950
where would all these desperadoes
come from?

208
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
(Muran!)

209
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080
