Division Commander.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,510
Did anyone take

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,110
any weapons out of here?

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,350
Young Master Du came yesterday.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,480
Muran?

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,350
How come I wasn't notified?

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,550
He had your signature.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,440
We thought you approved it.

21
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,600
Unless I come in person,

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
no one ever

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,870
takes anything out of the Armory.

24
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,870
Yes.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,440
Sister.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,640
Sister, you want to see me?

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,430
Do you know why I hit you?

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
Come on.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
Yes, I sent someone to kill Gu Yanting,

30
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,760
but he isn't dead.

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
Muran,

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,350
I can't believe you've become like this.

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
You used to be so...

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,600
But you are very aware

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,230
that he's the son of your enemy.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,590
You also know
he approached you with a purpose.

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,200
I don't understand why

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,350
you keep defending him?

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,070
Is it because he's Gu Yanting?

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,620
Because he's Gu Yanting,

41
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,790
you won't even take revenge?

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Or maybe

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,920
it's because he already has you,

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,840
and you two have a child?

45
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,350
You...

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Muran,

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
don't get the child involved.

48
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,360
It's between you and me,

49
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,190
no one else can know

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,750
Xiaozhentou is Yanting's child.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,430
- Especially not Gu Yanting.
- Sister,

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
why are you scared of him knowing

53
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,870
the child is his?

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,150
Because you know better than anyone

55
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,400
that Xiaozhentou
is Xiao Shizhao's grandchild,

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
a descendant of your enemy.

57
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,750
Sister,

58
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,710
why?

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Even you avoid the fact

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,870
that he's the father,

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,710
so what does your love mean?

62
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,150
What does it bring to your life?

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,560
I really hate to see you
keep torturing yourself.

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,190
Let me handle everything.

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Okay?

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,190
I will resolve all of

67
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,470
your troubles.

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
Muran, it is my family business.

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,150
You keep out of it.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
You are doing well.

71
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,520
How did you get in?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,030
I walked right in.

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,430
Sister said you couldn't go out,

74
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,120
but she didn't forbid me from going in.

75
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,470
You think I'd poison you?

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Your sister would be disappointed

77
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,080
if she saw you like this.

78
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,680
You have no right to judge me.

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
It is you who took her from me.

80
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,400
You hurt her feelings.

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,030
You made her so painful

82
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,590
that she had to remove you from her mind.

83
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,590
You tell me,

84
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,430
what makes you think you can show up

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,800
and take her from me again?

86
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,430
Because she still loves me.

87
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,430
You're the murderer's son.

88
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,430
You don't deserve her love.

89
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,160
What Xiao Shizhao did
had nothing to do with me.

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,200
But still,

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,310
you don't get to be together with her.

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,070
It's not up to you.

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm afraid you still don't know

94
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
that Xiaozhentou

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,390
is you two's child.

96
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
What did you say?

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,190
She has already known,

98
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,270
but she kept it from you.

99
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,000
Because she hates you guts.

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
So, Gu Yanting,

101
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,120
even if you have love,

102
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,950
even if you have a child,

103
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,040
the hate between you
will never be erased.

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,120
Is Xiaozhentou really my son?

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,680
Why didn't she tell me?

106
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,300
(Armory)

107
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,400
Mr. Du.

108
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
What brings you

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,830
and your men here?

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,430
Mrs. Gu,

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,360
you have three days

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,070
to move your things
out of the Armory.

113
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,920
Look what this is.

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,870
Qiu Ruoran,

115
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,390
I have the title deed.

116
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm the owner of this property.

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,950
How come you have the title deed?

118
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,830
It's none of our concern.

119
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,660
(Title Deed)

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,560
How do I know if it isn't fake?

121
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,270
You expect me to believe

122
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,800
you have the title deed

123
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,070
with a mere picture?

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Three days later,

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,070
I will show you the original copy.

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Xiao Li had the title deed.

127
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,680
He went to see you, didn't you?

128
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,920
Xiao Li always values the Armory,

129
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,120
why would he give you

130
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,510
such an important thing?

131
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,480
All I can say

132
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,190
is your relationship cannot be normal.

133
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,360
You two go way back, don't you?

134
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,630
You'd better hurry
and start moving your things.

135
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,630
As for the rest,

136
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,920
you'll understand later.

137
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,160
What if I don't?

138
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,070
Well, we won't use words

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,310
three days later,

140
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,240
but violence.

141
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,120
You allowed Du's men
to assassinate our boss.

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
If you cooperate with them again,

143
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,510
we won't be civil.

144
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,000
Qiu Ruoran,

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,720
you can't even control your soldiers,

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,830
what do you expect
to secure the Armory with?

147
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Let's go.

148
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
My lord,

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,510
that was a golden opportunity.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,480
Jiang Ruruo is in a desperate situation,

151
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,840
we can just kill her.

152
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,120
You have the Armory.

153
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
I have Jiang Ruruo.

154
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,840
If she is even slightly injured,

155
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,960
you get nothing.

156
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,870
Put down your guns.

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,000
I understand

158
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,120
how you feel.

159
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,630
Boss,

160
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,840
you should think about yourself.

161
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,670
You gave the Northern Division
to Jiang Ruruo,

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,150
yet she plotted an assassination on you.

163
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
Good boy.

164
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,790
I want some soup.

165
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,750
OK, I'll make soup.

166
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,150
My good boy.

167
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,870
Gu Liang,

168
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,360
you didn't do anything, did you?

169
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,230
Let me tell you,

170
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,750
if you don't obey me, I'll kill you.

171
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,870
I'll be responsible
for my own actions.

172
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,240
Mr. Du, heading for the Armory?

173
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Look at you,

174
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,270
standing there like a hero, huh?

175
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,320
I was told you'd use violence?

176
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,790
So I must come and look.

177
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,150
Look how pale you are.

178
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,360
You are in a worse state
compared to the time

179
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,960
you took the Armory over, right?

180
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,510
Still enough to deal with you.

181
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,870
Where's the title deed?

182
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,510
I need to see if it's real.

183
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,300
(Title Deed)

184
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,150
It's a very important item.

185
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,030
You can take a look from a distance.

186
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,870
Are you robbing me?

187
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,320
I have to authenticate it, don't I?

188
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,840
Mr. Du,

189
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,120
we can still talk business.

190
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Talk business?

191
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,440
Well, that's good.

192
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,280
Here.

193
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,590
Mr. Du,

194
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,390
it isn't real.

195
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,920
Yes.

196
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,390
Xiao Li still has the real one.

197
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
Still,

198
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,240
today, the Armory

199
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,080
will be mine.

200
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,120
- Seize them.
- Stop.

201
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,670
Nobody hurts Sister.

202
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,710
Muran,

203
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,000
get out of the way.

204
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,990
Unless

205
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,200
you and your men leave here,

206
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,910
or I won't move.

207
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,270
Get away! Now!

208
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,390
Sister and his dad invested
so much in the Armory.

209
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,030
I won't let you ruin it.

210
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,350
Muran.

211
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
You want the Armory, huh?

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,320
You and your men can have it

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,390
over my dead body.

214
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,480
You are so cold.

215
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,150
You even hurt your own son.

216
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,960
Jiang Ruruo,

217
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,600
you are a curse.

218
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,470
Go.
