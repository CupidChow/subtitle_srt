You really dislike me,

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,710
and even don't wanna see me, huh?

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Yanting,

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,910
I…

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,350
What's your relationship with Du Muran?

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
We are…

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,000
So what do I mean to you?

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,630
I…

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
I understand now.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,640
I've always been living
in my own fantasy of love.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,280
I've never

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,200
truly had you.

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,000
Yanting.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yanting.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,910
My body…

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
I forgot

29
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,030
you're Mrs. Xiao.

30
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,150
Your heart is bound to Du Muran,

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,630
and your body belongs to Xiao Li.

32
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
Take off your clothes.

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
Mrs. Xiao, you're so beautiful,

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,080
but so badly hurt.

35
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,150
It really ruins your beauty.

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,680
Hold it.

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
Sister.

38
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
What…

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,520
What…

40
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,720
What are you doing?

41
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,510
If you glance at him again,

42
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,350
I'll kill him right now.

43
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,070
Yanting, don't hurt him.

44
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,830
Muran, put down the gun!

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Gu Yanting!

46
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,160
What you see is

47
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
what we're doing.

48
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,160
You want to kill me?

49
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,120
Then why didn't you just kill me

50
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
that day in the telegraph office?

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
I…

52
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,470
Get lost.

53
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,110
Gu Yanting,

54
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,750
I had a child with her.

55
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,790
And what do you have?

56
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,120
You have nothing!

57
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,830
You only bully her

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,070
and hurt her!

59
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,830
- Gu Yanting.
- Come on!

60
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
I need to talk to Muran alone.

61
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,920
I have something to ask him.

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
Only one minute.

63
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,190
Was it Yanting who saved me

64
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,430
that day in the telegraph office?

65
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,350
Yes.

66
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,270
Was it you who shot him?

67
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,630
Sister, sister,

68
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,390
I just didn't want you to be taken away.

69
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Muran,

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,070
I never thought you would lie to me.

71
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,600
Sister, I never wanted to deceive you.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,830
I just didn't want you
to risk your life to kill Xiao Li.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,310
It's too dangerous.

74
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,710
You…

75
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,430
Time's up.

76
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Where are you taking me?

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Gu Yanting.

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,320
Sister.

79
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Gu Yanting.

80
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,960
Gu Yanting, let her go!

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,360
Where's this place?

82
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
From today on,

83
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,360
you are my prisoner.

84
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,510
Without my permission,

85
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,560
you can't go anywhere.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,190
There's only hate between all of us, right?

87
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,110
Hate?

88
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,390
Only love can lead to hatred.

89
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,350
Jiang Ruruo,

90
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,830
there's no love between us,

91
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,630
how can there be hate?

92
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,480
I love you.

93
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,110
What did you say?

94
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,120
I said I love you.

95
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,360
But I can't love you.

96
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,000
Your acting is getting better.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
Even I can't tell what's real.

98
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
You know what?

99
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,040
All this time,

100
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
if you had just looked back at me once

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,800
or reached out to hug me once,

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,360
I would have been willing
to be deceived by you forever.

103
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
But you never did.

104
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,990
(Yue,)

105
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,360
(I will never let you)

106
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
(return to Xiao Li to take risks again.)

107
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
(Gu Yanting,)

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
(I'm not lying to you.)

109
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,320
(I really fell in love with you.)

110
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,320
(If we had met at the right time…)

111
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
(But it's a pity…)

112
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,350
Commander,

113
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
we just lost

114
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,720
in the East Street.

115
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,630
Their encirclement is getting closer.

116
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
Also, Mrs. Xiao…

117
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,670
She was just taken by Gu Yanting.

118
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,790
Since Gu Yanting seized the armory,

119
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,550
our ammunition supply has
been cut off.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If this continues,

121
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,670
Jiangcheng will soon fall
into Northern Division's hands in three days.

122
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,080
Get me the Warlord's Office.

123
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
It's Xiao Mansion.

124
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Xiao Li,

125
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,150
I have high hopes for you.

126
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
But Yanting is my foster son.

127
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,670
To me,

128
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,150
both of you are equally important.

129
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,630
It doesn't matter
who controls Jiangcheng.

130
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
Sir,

131
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,670
I treat Yanting like a brother,

132
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,960
but he not only took my wife,

133
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,320
but also seized the armory.

134
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
People of Jiangcheng are
complaining about him.

135
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
If this continues,

136
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,550
your reputation in Jiangcheng will
definitely be affected.

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
If this is true,

138
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,120
then it's Yanting's fault.

139
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,440
I'll have a talk with him.

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Old fox.

141
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,960
He wants me and Gu Yanting
to fight harder

142
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,030
and reap the benefits.

143
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,480
When you mentioned the armory,

144
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,240
his tone seemed to change.

145
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,440
The armory is the foundation

146
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,080
of an ambitious warlord.

147
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,720
Everyone wants it.

148
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,000
But he knows

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Du Hanqing wouldn't

150
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,200
hand over it easily,

151
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,270
unless there's a binding interest.

152
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,270
Binding interest?

153
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,360
You mean a marriage alliance?

154
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,390
The Warlord's support or Jiang Ruruo,

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,360
Gu Yanting has to make a choice.

156
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,240
Yanting.

157
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,320
Dad.

158
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,390
I heard
that after you took Jiangcheng Armory,

159
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,510
you handed it over to Du Hanqing.

160
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,490
The situation was urgent at the time.

161
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,720
I had to lead my men
to seize the armory first

162
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,940
to obtain the ammunition supply.

163
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,320
Du Hanqing is a cunning businessman.

164
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,030
You need to find a way

165
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,270
to keep the armory in your own hands.

166
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,750
I understood.

167
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,630
I'm thinking of it.

168
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:11,990
Dad,

169
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,630
I have something I need to handle.

170
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,470
Wait.

171
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,030
I heard that
Du Hanqing's daughter likes you.

172
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,630
Yanting,

173
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
marriage is the most stable partnership

174
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
in this world.

175
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,630
As for the lady you've taken,

176
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,750
if you like her,

177
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,960
keep her as a concubine.

178
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Don't let it ruin important matters.

179
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,670
I understood.

180
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,830
What's the matter?

181
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,870
Du Mansion sent an invitation

182
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,390
for you to come for tea.

183
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,960
What a coincidence.

184
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,840
Is there any connection?

185
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,750
We've been keeping the armory issue

186
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
from Warlord.

187
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,910
Now he not only knows about it,

188
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,040
but also that Du Hanqing
wants to marry his daughter to me.

189
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,720
He made this call

190
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,600

in taking back the armory.
