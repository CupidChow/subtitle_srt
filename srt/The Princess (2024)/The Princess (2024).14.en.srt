=Marry Me=

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,600
Mrs. Xiao.

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,120
You still have time to dress up?

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Yanting bombed Xiao Li's armory.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,150
Xiao Li is furious right now.

16
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,230
What's that got to do with me?

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
He's being hunted by Wangyuelou.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,950
His life is in danger.

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,790
Aren't you worried?

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,710
Wangyuelou?

21
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,640
Sis, you must be joking.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Isn't that just a theatre?

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,840
On the surface, yes.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,560
But it's really a secret force of Xiao Li,

25
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,510
that engages in killing.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,640
Once you're on Wangyuelou's kill list,

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,920
there's no chance of surviving.

28
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,070
What does that have to do with me?

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,630
Don't you want to save Gu Yanting?

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,550
Mrs. Xiao,

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,310
you should worry less about my ex,

32
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,710
and focus on your own situation.

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,990
Me?

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Once I marry Mr. Xiao,

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
I'll be the legitimate Mrs. Xiao.

36
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,750
And you will

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,590
always just be a concubine.

38
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,270
Jiang Ruruo!

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,430
You've been through so much
with Yanting.

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,910
Don't wait until he's dead

41
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,840
to regret it.

42
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,870
(Gu Yanting bombed the armory,)

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,870
(cutting off Xiao Li's deal
with Du Hanqing.)

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
(If Wangyuelou is what Qiyan says,)

45
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,000
(Xiao Li must be determined)

46
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,590
(to kill him.)

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,520
(If I can get Wangyuelou,)

48
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,360
(I might save him,)

49
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,960
(and recover my family's treasure.)

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,030
(Wangyuelou is your trump card,)

51
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,800
(but I will claim it for myself.)

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
Those earrings look stunning on you.

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,360
May I have this dance?

54
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,790
Ruruo,

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
marry me.

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
Mr. Xiao,

57
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,560
I'm not the right person for you.

58
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,800
This is me?

59
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,030
Yes.

60
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,360
Six months ago,

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
during my photography trip,

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,040
I saw you in a crowd.

63
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,190
You were so radiant

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
and at ease,

65
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,310
like a beam of light in my life.

66
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,560
When I saw you

67
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,360
in my office again,

68
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
I was so happy and excited.

69
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,430
But then I found out
you were Gu Yanting's wife,

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,680
I was heartbroken.

71
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,630
She's indeed my wife.

72
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,670
Ruruo,

73
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,270
I finally have my chance now.

74
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,120
Will you marry me?

75
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,680
(To save Gu Yanting,)

76
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,270
(I have to get Wangyuelou.)

77
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,630
(For the revenge of my family,)

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,560
(becoming Mrs. Xiao)

79
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,950
(might be my best choice.)

80
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,670
(Goodbye,)

81
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,830
(Gu Yanting.)

82
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,720
You've agreed to marry me?

83
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,710
I agree.

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,070
But I have a small request.

85
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,040
What is that?

86
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,000
I want to join Wangyuelou.

87
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,390
You know about Wangyuelou?

88
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,320
I know.

89
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,000
It's your most prized organization.

90
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,240
Outwardly, it's a theatre,

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
but secretly,
it's an assassin organization.

92
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,070
If you don't want to be a secretary,

93
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,560
I can give you an easier job.

94
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,240
Why join an organization like that?

95
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,670
Because

96
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,680
I want to do something for you.

97
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
You've done so much for me.

98
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I want to ease your burdens.

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,240
I can help you kill Gu Yanting.

100
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
You still care about him,

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,240
or you really hate him?

102
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,310
We had a child.

103
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,800
But he died

104
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,630
when he was young.

105
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,190
Soon after that,

106
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,040
Gu Yanting brought home a boy.

107
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,020
He said the boy was an orphan
from the war,

108
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,000
and wanted to adopt him.

109
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
That's Xiaozhentou?

110
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Turns out

111
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,600
Xiaozhentou was

112
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,750
his illegitimate son.

113
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,190
That's all in the past.

114
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,240
You have nothing to do with him anymore.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Mr. Xiao,

116
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,910
Gu Yanting is the foster son
of the Warlord,

117
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
so you can't kill him outright.

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,790
But I don't care.

119
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,200
I'll kill him myself

120
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,000
for my child,

121
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,720
and for my suffering
in the past seven years.

122
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,590
Ruruo,

123
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,600
from now on,
we're husband and wife.

124
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,600
Don't call me Mr. Xiao.

125
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,990
Then…

126
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,440
Xiao Li.

127
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,790
I accept your terms.

128
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,750
Xiao Li!

129
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,120
Xiao Li,

130
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,360
how could you do this to me?

131
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,630
Go back.

132
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,630
You'll marry her, but what about me?

133
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,670
Wangyuelou has

134
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,720
done so many terrible things for you.

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,030
How can you treat me like this?

136
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,960
Are you threatening me?

137
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
You indulge her!

138
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
She wants Wangyuelou,
and you hand it over!

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,550
How could you do this to me?

140
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,750
- Aren't you afraid…
- Desheng.

141
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,910
Concubine Lou seems unwell

142
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,360
and mentally confused.

143
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,200
Take her to reflect on her behavior.

144
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,590
Lady Qiyan,

145
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,440
please.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Xiao Li,

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,120
my father is Wangyuelou's master.

148
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,510
You can't do anything to me!

149
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,600
Take her away!

150
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,440
Let go of me!

151
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,680
Let go!

152
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,230
Let go!

153
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,080
Ruruo,

154
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,910
did it scare you?

155
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,630
I'm fine.

156
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,630
I'm just tired. I want to rest.

157
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,320
Is she locked up?

158
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,590
Yes.

159
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,240
She threatened you with Wangyuelou.

160
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
So,

161
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,720
this woman can't stay alive.

162
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,550
I only married her

163
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,240
for Wangyuelou.

164
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,390
If she dies…

165
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,230
We'll handle it secretly.

166
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,600
By the time it's known,

167
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,630
even her father can't oppose us.

168
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,870
Did you come here to mock me?

169
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
Desheng will be here soon.
Come with me.

170
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,390
Xiao Li wants to kill me?

171
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,440
You're lying.

172
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,630
Hurry, there's no time.

173
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,750
Handle it secretly.

174
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,480
No one can know about this.

175
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,470
- Yes.
- Go.

176
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
Where's she?

177
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,590
Dad,

178
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,320
I thought

179
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,200
I could win Xiao Li's heart.

180
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,750
But this is where I end up.

181
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,510
My poor daughter.

182
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,360
I warned you many times.

183
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,600
But you didn't listen,

184
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,480
and insisted on being with him.

185
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,230
Now that you're back,

186
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,840
it's not so bad.

187
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,550
You can stay safely

188
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,440
by my side.

189
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
Ma'am,

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,270
we owe you

191
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,200
for saving her life.

192
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,240
Mr. Lou, talk some sense into her.

193
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm leaving.

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
Ma'am,

195
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,080
Qiyan is my only child.

196
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,910
She's my life.

197
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,630
You saved her today.

198
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,240
If you ever need anything,

199
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,150
just ask.

200
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,080
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

201
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,270
You're safe now,

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,080
my dear.

203
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,910
Boss, we're in a bad spot now.

204
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,240
Once we leave the Northern Division,

205
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,600
we can't shake them off,
or finish them.

206
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,550
Boss, I'm out of bullets.
