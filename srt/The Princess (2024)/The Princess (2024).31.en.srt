00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,870
only to upset her.

189
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,280
What do you mean?

190
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,550
Only you care about her

191
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,870
and I don't?

192
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,390
You've blinded her eyes,

193
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,790
so she has to suffer all this.

194
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,750
It is you

195
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,030
who took her away from me.

196
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Xiaozhentou.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,390
You drugged your own child?

198
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,000
You'd better worry about yourself.

199
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,200
(Since Sister can't do it,)

200
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
(I will.)

201
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,500
(Armory)

202
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,720
Butler, you wish to see me in a hurry.

203
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,320
Any orders?

204
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
No, no.

205
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,240
I only want you to come with us.

206
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
You only have so few people with you,

207
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,790
and you expect to take me away?

208
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,780
(Ran)

209
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,270
Not take

210
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,360
but invite.

211
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
Sister.

212
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,200
No one answered the call.

213
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,630
Normally, Xiaozhentou should
be taking a nap at this hour,

214
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,120
How come no one answered?

215
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,920
I'll go with you.

216
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,920
Miss Jiang.

217
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,080
Gu Liang,

218
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
you and your men stay here.
