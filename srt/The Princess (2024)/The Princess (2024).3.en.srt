why he need such a large quantity of arms?

157
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
But,

158
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,960
purchasing raw materials
requires huge funding.

159
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,630

up to play games.

179
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,480
Then what was it for?

180
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,080
Because he misunderstood me,

181
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,630

182
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,790

189
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,780
I'll help you teach him a lesson.

190
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,040
Thank you, Commander.

191
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,750
Who's outside? Call the Ma'am.

192
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,910
Commander, I was just passing by.

193
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,130
I have prepared some Ginseng Tea.

194
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,080
You were looking for me?

195
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,870
Mrs. Gu caught a cold in prison.

196
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,320
Prepare hot water and clothes for her.

197
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Rest assured, Commander.

198
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,120
Mrs. Xiao.

199
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,480
Mrs. Gu, don't move.

200
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,510
Mr. Gu is really something.

201
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,440
Locking people up in the freezing winter.

202
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,870
Doesn't he worry about you freezing?

203
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,390
My husband really don't know
how to cherish his wife.

204
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,550
It's really infuriating.

205
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,840
Why not help me, sister?

206
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,630
Help me make him really mad this time.

207
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,470
Commander Gu!

208
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,600
Where is she?

209
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,120
Mrs. Gu was just taken away
by Commander Xiao.

210
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,110
Commander Xiao also said

211
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,400
he brought her back to the Xiao Mansion

212
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,840
and asked you to personally take her.

213
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,910
Mrs. Gu's change of clothes is all ready.

214
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
Thank you, Qi Yan.

215
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,080
I'm here to pick her up.

216
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,920
Where is she?

217
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,000
The prison is cold and damp.

218
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,630
Mrs. Gu is delicate and frail.

219
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
Aren't you afraid of freezing her?

220
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
She fell ill?

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,840
Fortunately, the Commander arrived in time,

222
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,390
and brought Mrs. Gu back.

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,910
After resting for a while,
she felt much better.

224
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,750
I think she's just pretending.

225
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,470
Where is she?

226
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,910
Haven't played cards in a long time.

227
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,550
We're waiting for you to play the cards.
