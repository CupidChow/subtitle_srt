00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,670
Mrs. Gu,

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,920
it isn't easy to meet you.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,680
Why are you at Qiu family's old house?

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,150
Back in the days,

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,150
your father Qiu Nianyuan

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,350
looked down on me.

18
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,760
Seven years have passed,

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,640
the Qiu family

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,350
is in ruins

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,870
whereas I, Du Hanqing,

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,040
has taken his place
as the richest man in the city.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,590
Where is Yanting and the boy?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,230
What's the rush?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,310
The reason why

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,310
I asked you here

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,680
is that I want your father

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,480
to witness how you
give his valued factory

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,760
away to me.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,960
Mrs. Gu.

31
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,280
(Property Transfer Contract)
This is the transfer contract,

32
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,350
please go over it.

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,790
Give me the Armory,

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,120
and I'll give the boy back to you.

35
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,270
Du Hanqing,

36
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,590
if I remember it correctly,

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,470
you were once hired by our family.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
My father said

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840
you were a slippery

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,870
and interest-driven man

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,520
who couldn't be trusted.

42
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,910
After all these years,

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,710
you remain the same way.

44
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,150
Qiu Ruoran,

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,000
like your father,

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
you are also very proud.

47
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,680
You don't mention my father, traitor.

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,280
Do you still think you are

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,630
the daughter
of the privileged Qiu family?

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
I tell you what,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,080
you are now nothing

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,000
but a homeless dog.

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,560
You aren't even worthy
of your real name,

54
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,150
and here you provoke me?

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,710
You have the same loathsome arrogance

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,150
in your eyes as your father's.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,710
I don't care you agree or not,

58
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,400
I will have your fingerprint
on the contract.

59
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,750
Control her.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,910
Put your fingerprint on it!

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
Du Hanqing!

62
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,430
Stop him.

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,750
You promised me

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,910
you wouldn't hurt her.

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,750
Muran, what are you doing here?

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,120
How is the boy?

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,840
Sister, don't worry.

68
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,630
Xiaozhentou is sleeping.

69
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,080
Take the boy away.

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
Du Hanqing!

71
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,190
Du Hanqing, you lied!

72
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,750
What are you doing?

73
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,840
Your fingerprint.

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,710
Sister, how about...

75
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,430
How about you sign it?

76
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,080
Yanting risked his life
taking the Armory back for me.

77
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,630
I will die guarding it.

78
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,120
Sister, in this critical moment,

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,430
you still care about Gu Yanting.

80
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,030
Sister, I really want to know

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,630
if Gu Yanting learns

82
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,960
that you get your kid killed

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,310
for the Armory,

84
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,680
will he forgive you?

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
What did you say?

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,960
I...

87
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,430
Xiaozhentou is Yanting's and my son?

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,640
Qiu Ruoran.

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,390
Will you sign it

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,480
or do you want to see your kid die?

91
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,310
You let him go.

92
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,030
Sister.

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,080
Muran.

94
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,870
Du Hanqing,
did you pray before you left home?

95
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,570
You two jerks.

96
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,190
Did you pray before you left home?

97
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,360
Who the hell are you?

98
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,830
(Yanting.)

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
(So that person)

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,950
(really was you.)

101
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,470
Mrs. Gu,

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,800
I will take you home now.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Come at me, you all.

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,520
I'm in a rush.

105
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Sister.

106
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,510
Hurry! Hurry!

107
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,480
(Greatest Virtue)

108
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
Hurry!

109
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,440
Run, sir!

110
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Sister!

111
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Sister!

112
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,510
Our boy.

113
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,270
Yanting,

114
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,750
Xiaozhentou is...

115
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Xiaozhentou...

116
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,710
I know.

117
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,670
Don't worry,

118
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,310
I won't leave him behind.

119
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,030
Gu Liang.

121
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,600
(So it turns out Xiaozhentou)

122
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,680
(is Yanting's and my child.)

123
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,310
Xiaozhentou,

124
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm so sorry.

125
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,620

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,040
I will ask Father to pay you.

130
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,030
OK.

131
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,720

132

Still bitter?

193
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,840
Very sweet.

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,160
Oh right.

195
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,790
You said,

196
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,750
"our boy."

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,840
What did you mean?

198
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,870
(Our family's hate for Xiao Shizhao)

199
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,000
(is not resolved yet.)

200
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,120
(If Yanting knew)

201
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,030
(Xiaozhentou is our biological son,)

202
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,750
(it would bring him)

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
(more pain.)

204
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,030
Is he not?

205
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,000
Xiaozhentou sees us
as his real parents, no?

206
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,870
Mrs. Gu, you are right.

207
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,720
(I will secure the love)

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
(no matter what.)

209
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,910
(Even if I learn)

210
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,390
(why I stabbed him.)

211
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,860
(Bugao Alley)

212
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,710
Sister,

213
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,670
Everything I have done is for you.

214
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,630
How come you still don't choose me?

215
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,140
(Bugao Alley)

216
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,680
Xiaozhentou,

217
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,870
come here.

218
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,790
Will you do Mum a favor?

219
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,110
Uncle.

220
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
Xiaozhentou.

221
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,230
Xiaozhentou,

222
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,270
is Sister getting better?

223
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,240
Mum said she's got better

224
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
and asked you to go home

225
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,150
because it's cold.

226
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,800
Thank you.

227
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,240
You're welcome.

228
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,960
Tell Sister for me

229
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,150
that I'll wait for her at home.
