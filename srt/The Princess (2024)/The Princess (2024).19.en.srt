hang out with us.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
Sister,

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,270
can you promise me

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
not to do anything so dangerous again?

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm really scared.

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
You saved me?

82
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,000
You don't remember?

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,070
I just recall trying
to transfer the station

84
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,240
and getting knocked out by Mr. Lou.

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,920
Stop thinking that.

86
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,430
You need to rest.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,430
I think I saw Yanting.

88
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,470
Yue!

89
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,150

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,640
B…

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,630
What are you doing up?

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,920
You're seriously injured.

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,510
You need to rest.

94
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Where's Yue?

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,070
When Xiao Li's men arrived,

96
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,720
she was already gone.

97
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,870
Fortunately,
I transfer the station in time.

98
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,830
Then she must have been taken
by Du Muran.

99
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,630
You need to rest!

100
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,480
Don't think about anything else.

101
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll check if the medicine is ready.

102
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,910
Muran,

103
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,750
when you saved me,

104
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,720
did you really not see Yanting?

105
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,350
Sister,

106
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,270
you don't trust me?

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,870
We grew up together,

108
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,120
and I've always seen you as my brother.

109
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,920
How could I not trust you?

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,830
(Brother.)

111
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,670
In my heart,

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,920
she's never just a sister,

113
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,830
she's my beloved.

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,390
Snap out of it!

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
She doesn't love you!

116
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,000
She had a child with another man!

117
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,240
So what?

118
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,630
I no longer want to just be her brother.

119
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,720
There's no future for you two.

120
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,710
Mom,

121
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,270
I've never asked you.

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
for anything.

123
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,450
This is the only thing.

124
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,950
If you won't help me,

125
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,330
forget you ever had a son.

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,780
You…

127
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,980
(Erudite and Virtuous)

128
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,980
(To Li Muran)

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Muran,

130
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,070
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,160
We've grown up together,

132
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,040
a match made in childhood.

133
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,950
That night was even more
of a deep connection.

134
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't blame you.

135
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,190
When you come back from your visit,

136
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,240
I have good news to tell you.

137
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,200
Ruoran,

138
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,600
you'd been burning up all day.

139
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,160
You're weak!

140
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Go rest.

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
Aunt,

142
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,720
who gave you this letter?

143
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,430
That's in the past.

144
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,680
You should just forget it.

145
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
Aunt,

146
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,360
my past lover,

147
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,910
the father of my child,

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,870
isn't Muran,

149
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,680
right?

150
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,870
Ruoran,

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,630
you know the truth.

152
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Why do you keep asking?

153
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
No way.

154
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,870
I've always seen him as my brother.

155
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,270
I never loved him.

156
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,790
Did you always see him as a brother,

157
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,120
or did you forget things

158
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,360
after losing the child

159
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,390
and just thought of him

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,270
as a brother?

161
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm leaving.

162
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,510
You should let you tempers settle,

163
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
and take your medicine.

164
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,550
Yanting,

165
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,840
I once thought

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,750
you were my past lover.

167
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,390
I didn't expect

168
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,550
it would turn out to be Muran.

169
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,200
Are you satisfied now?

170
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,110
Thanks, mom.

171
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,750
Commander,

172
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,910
now Jiangcheng is mostly
under Gu Yanting's control.

173
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,790
If Warlord sends help,

174
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
we may not be able to compete with him.

175
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,200
Send a telegram to Warlord,

176
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,080
saying if he's willing to withdraw

177
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
his support for Gu Yanting,

178
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,240
I'll give him

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
the treasure of Qiu Family.

180
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
Got it.

181
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,120
Is there news about Ruruo?

182
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,000
She is neither at the Gu Mansion,

183
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,480
nor the Du Mansion.

184
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,270
It's as if she vanished.

185
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,230
Keep searching.

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,230
Yes.

187
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,740
(Muran.)

188
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,470
Sister.

189
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,870
Muran,

190
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
I…

191
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,750
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,510
I only see you as a brother.

193
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,720
There must be
