=Whose Wife You Are?=

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,790
Mrs. Gu looks pretty,
whether be richly adorned or plainly dressed.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,520
This new qipao

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,960
fits her perfectly.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,900
Aren't you cold wearing so little?

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,350
I brought you a thick coat.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,790
It's much warmer here than in the prison.

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,510
You men

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,150
really don't understand a woman's heart.

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,870
Women

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,190
need to be cherished.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,560
Someone like Mr. Gu

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,230
who pulls out his gun
at the slightest provocation

24
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,150
and even locks his own wife in jail

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,710
will naturally not understand.

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,920
I have scolded him.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,760
He will change.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,590
You really don't know him.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,310
He will never change.

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,150
Whose wife you are?

31
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,910
East Wind!

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
I win!

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,870
You help him to win from the start?

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,790
Then why don't you help me to win?

35
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,010
Are you blaming me?

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Stop bickering.

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,350
You know bickering costs money, right?

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,880
I don't have money.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,430
Don't worry. Yanting is here.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm just afraid that
some one has too little salary

41
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,450
and struggle to support his family.

42
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,710
I see.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
So today's game

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,630
is intentionally trying to target me, huh?

45
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,870
If you were upright,
would you still be afraid of being targeted?

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Forget it.

47
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,240
I can't rely on men anymore.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,030
I'll have to pay the money I lost myself.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,470
These are the earrings my mother left me.

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,680
They also look nice when worn as a brooch.

51
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,120
Mrs. Gu,

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,960
how about this.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,590
Tomorrow, you come to be my secretary.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
I'll have Desheng help you set up your desk.

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes, commander!

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
What are you doing? I won't wear it.

57
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,520
Let go of me, Gu Yanting!

58
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,710
Let go of me!

59
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,470
Gu Yanting!

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,960
Let go of me, Gu Yanting!

61
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Gu Yanting, what did you make me wear?

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,680
As long as it's warm, it's fine.

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Put me down, Gu Yanting.

64
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
What are you trying to do?

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,840
You locked me up in prison.
What are you up to?

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400
I saw you just exchanged glance

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,240
with that Xiao Li.

68
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
Quite emotional, Uh?

69
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,470
Mr. Gu,

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,710
Didn't you already know

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,030
what kind of woman I am?

72
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,750
What's there to be angry about?

73
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
Moreover,

74
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,240
aren't you eager for

75
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,590
me to leave the house as soon as possible?

76
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,040
You're so angry right now.

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,270
I can understand it as

78
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,070
you're jealous.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,270
But it doesn't make sense either.

80
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,240
Aren't we a fake couple?

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,950
I don't want to argue with you.

82
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
What are you looking at?

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
Those earrings don't suit you at all.

84
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,560
They only make you look

85
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,590
very ostentatious.

86
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,880
This?

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,750
Compared to the things
you bought for Miss Yue,

88
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,630
it looks more attractive.

89
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,830
Commander Xiao likes it very much.

90
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,390
His taste is much better than yours.

91
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,830
You talk to me like this!

92
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,340
You don't worry about
that pretty guy in jail?

93
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
That's right.

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,920
He is your best bargaining chip.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,630
If you kill him,

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,680
I won't act with you anymore.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
I know you and Xiao Li don't get along well.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,800
You lied to him that I was your wife.

99
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,600
If he catches you red-handed,

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,750
we'll both be in trouble.

101
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,560
I really don't understand
what's so good about these high heels.

102
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,000
If you disdain me,

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,000
I can walk back by myself.

104
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,920
Who said I disdained you?

105
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,310
What did you say?

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
I said

Commander, things are clear.

144
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,600
The reason Mrs. Gu
was imprisoned by Gu Yanting

145
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,390
is that Gu Yanting suspected

146
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,390
she wanted to save
the assassin who tried to kill you.

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
Got it.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
Commander.

149
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,870
Commander,

150
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Gu Yanting went home.

151
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,550
It is said the execution of the prisoner
will be postponed until tomorrow.

152
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Mrs. Gu is at home?

153
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Yes.

154
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,670
What does she usually do?

155
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,360
Does she have any hobbies?

156
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
She quite likes flowers.

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
By the way,

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,750
how have you been getting along with Yanting?

159
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
He still refuses to touch me.

160
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,600
He just treated me as

161
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,390
a housekeeper.

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,670
Since that Mrs. Gu came,

163
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,790
I even have to take care of their child.

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Well,

165
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,150
you are lost

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,220
since Yanting treated you like this?

167
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,270
Commander is overthinking.

168
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
It's just a mission.

169
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,270
I work for you, Commander.

170
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,790
I dare not have any other thoughts.

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
It seems you really like it.

172
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,600
These flowers were originally bought for you.

173
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,710
I know.

174
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,790
These flowers

175
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,550
suddenly remind me of something.

176
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,110
What did you recall?

177
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,360
A vague figure

178
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,420
seemed to have given me
the same kind of flower before.

179
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,000
I did not completely lie to you.

180
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,680
I didn't lose my memory.

181
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,440
But I indeed forget some people and events.

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,590
The thing I regret the most

183
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,510
is meeting you!

184
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,510
Right now, I just want you to

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,080
disappear from my world.

186
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,000
(How much you must have hated me!)

187
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,000
(You only don't remember me!)

188
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,560
So,

189
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,320
am I really the Yue you know?

190
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,440
(Forget it.)

191
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,790
(Save Muran first.)

192
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,150
If I am absent,

193
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,750
take good care of the flowers.

194
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,710
Where are you going?

195
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,120
To work at the Xiao Mansion.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,630
You must do these?

197
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,840
(Gu Yanting.)

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,750
(After interacting during this period,)

199
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,390
(you don't seem that annoying anymore.)

200
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,900
(Xiao Mansion)
Mrs. Gu,

201
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,670
The main job of a secretary is

202
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,550
to organize the documents
from various departments

203
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,870
and place them
on the commander's desk immediately.

204
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,030
Yanting has agreed for you
to be the secretary?

205
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,600
He has no say over my matters.

206
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't quarrel with him.

207
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,670
He is busy executing the assassin.

208
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,560
He might not be able to take care of you.

209
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,670
I don't care about him.

210
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,990
Commander.

211
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,590
What's wrong?

212
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,510
That prisoner named Li Muran

213
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,630
escaped on the way to the execution ground.

214
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,330
Caught him and brought him back.

215
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,280
Yes.

216
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,270
Commander,
my child is not feeling well today.

217
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,840
He is still waiting for me at home.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,840
I need to head back first.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,150
I'll drive you back.

220
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,590
No, thanks.

221
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,790
I have booked a rickshaw.

222
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,870
(Mrs. Gu, I will bring him to you.)

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Go to Qing'an Alley

224
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,710
Okay.

225
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Sister!

226
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,680
Stop for a moment.

227
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,320
Run quickly!

228
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,550
Someone's been killed, run quickly!
