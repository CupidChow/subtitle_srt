Boss,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,030
Du Muran

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,790
is too thick-skinned.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,240
He just won't leave.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,430
Leave him be.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,280
Yue only has one little brother.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,480
And he's also Xiaozhentou's
biological father.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,710
Boss,

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,640
one thing confuses me.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,310
Ruruo loves you so much,

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,560
how come she has a child with another man?

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,560
She hasn't regained her memory,

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,200
so I don't know what happened.

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,920
Nor do I care.

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,510
Mum, do I have long legs?

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,710
You do.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,950
Your foot smells.

29
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,310
All right, time to sleep.

30
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,120
No. I want to sleep with Mum.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,590
Mum is still unwell.

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,150
- She can't sleep tight with you here.
- Be careful.

33
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,560
Time for you to sleep.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,430
I'm feeling much better now.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm all good.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,840
I'll put him to sleep.

37
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,990
I...

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,430
Will be right back.

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,840
- Let's go.
- Dad sleeps here,

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
I sleep here.

41
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,590
Don't give me this.

42
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,680
Put me down. Put me down.

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,560
- No, no.
- I want to sleep here.

44
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Muran,

45
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,430
just stop doing this.

46
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,750
She won't be back.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Also,

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,030
you are still injured.

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,030
I have done more harm to her.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
I am aware

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,870
that this time

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,030
she will never be back.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
That's good.

54
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630
It's time for you

55
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,560
to move on from this meaningless love.

56
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,430
Take this opportunity

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,240
to learn how
to handle Du family's business,

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,470
so you can be prepared

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
for taking over the family business.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Mum,

61
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,040
are you asking me to be a traitor?

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,560
Only by owning the business

63
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,360
will you have the right to choose.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
The right to choose?

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
Mum, tell me,

66
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,680
when you were pregnant
with Du Hanqing's child,

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,510
why did you choose to marry the Li family?

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,950
Why did you give birth to me?

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,190
Did you give a chance to choose?

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,920
Sister keeps telling me to go home.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,160
But the sad thing is,

72
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,510
I don't know where my home is.

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,750
Because I have no home.

74
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,070
This isn't my home.

75
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,750
Because I'm an illegitimate child.

76
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
You...

77
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
You...

78
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,670
Muran,

79
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,680
how can you talk
to your mother like this?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
You have no right to scold me.

81
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,150
Move.

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,270
Wanrou.

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,390
You irresponsible jerk

84
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,720
got me and Muran in this situation.

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
Why are you here?

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,630
I want this.

87
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,070
You remember everything?

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,190
I remember something.

89
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,590
Put this on me.

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
My mother

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
gave me this ring.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,600
I had it modified according to the size

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
of your finger.

94
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,950
But once it's on you,

95
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,040
you cannot regret it.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,840
Are you scared?

97
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,240
Of what?

98
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,590
What are you thinking?

99
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm thinking

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,190
that after what we have been through,

101
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,070
we are still together.

102
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,030
It is nice.

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,000
We will be together forever.

104
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,160
Sister.

105
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,390
Sister,

106
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,270
Mum pushes me again.

107
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,790
I never wanted to be the son of a traitor

108
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,440
or be an arms dealer.

109
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,670
If you are by my side,

110
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,720
you will surely understand me.

111
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,960
Sadly, you aren't talking to me anymore.

112
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,790
I didn't mean

113
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,390
to harm Xiaozhentou.

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,840
I only want you to be with me.

115
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,200
It's Gu Yanting's fault.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
He has tricked you.

117
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,270
Before he showed up,

118
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,360
we were fine.

119
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,080
Everything was fine between us.

120
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Sister, why?

121
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,960
Have you forgotten how he

122
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
hurt you seven years ago?

123
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,710
I see.

124
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,960
If you remember everything,

125
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,440
you will see who Gu Yanting really is

126
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
and return to me.

127
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,910
He's such a good-looker.

128
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,910
Admiring me while I'm sleeping?

129
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,080
Mrs. Gu, you have unique taste.

130
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,440
You knew I was awake,

131
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,480
and you teased me.

132
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,600
I was expecting you to do something to me.

133
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,360
Yet you are restrained.

134
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,470
Give me a kiss.

135
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,840
You wish.

136
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,670
You started it first.

137
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,230
Tickle.

138
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,440
Tickle.

139
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,480
- Enough, enough. Stop.
- You wish.

140
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,670
Enough. Enough.

141
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,320
How do I make you stop?

142
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
You didn't say yes.

143
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
Yes or no?

144
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,990
Say it.

145
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,590
Come on.

146
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
- Say it.
- Mum, Dad.

147
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,120
The sun has risen.

148
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
Get up for breakfast.

149
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,320
Coming.

150
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,720
Come on,
