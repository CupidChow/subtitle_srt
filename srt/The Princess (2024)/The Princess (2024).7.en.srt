Surprise!

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,070
It's been so long, Yanting.

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,950
Anni?

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,530
When did you return?

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,640
Just did.

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,310
Come here and sit.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,650
We've been waiting for you.

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,510
Here.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,230
Why me? Get Qi Yan here.

21
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,990
Qi Yan told us she'd play with her friend

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,840
and wouldn't join us.

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,170
I brought them specifically to you
from Europe.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,360
The latest sun-glasses.

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,120
Try them on.

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,040
There's no sun in this room.

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,950
They would look nice on you.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,390
A perfect match, right?

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,070
Thank you for your good will,

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,760
but these things are too fancy

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,030
for me.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,640
Miss Jiang, what's the meaning of that?

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Miss Du,

34
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,550
Yanting shouldn't be wearing those

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
when dealing with work.

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
Let's play.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,400
I thought you were after the great robber.

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,410
How come all investigators were dismissed?

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
In my opinion,

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,170
the robbed goods are out of town,

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
and cannot be found.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
Paul who lost the goods

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
are also dead.

44
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,960
No one will ask for the goods back.

45
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,550
Dead?

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,800
Gun went off.

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,360
A minor accident.

48
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710
Chow.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Yanting,

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,710
you intentionally

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,150
let Anni win, didn't you?

52
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,960
Yanting, you still remember my routine.

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,630
You know me well.

54
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,270
7 Dot.

55
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,550
Pong.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,240
7 Character.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
Pong.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,430
- 5 Dot.
- Pong.

59
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,500
5 Character.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Pong.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,240
Commander Xiao,

62
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,520
I think you are doing this on purpose.

63
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,280
Commander, what are you doing?

64
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,430
A gentleman caters to a lady's pleasure.

65
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,590
So why not?

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
Thank you, Commander.

67
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,680
Letting others win?

68
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,960
That's easy.

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360
This one, right?

70
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,790
I win.

71
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,650
Yanting,

72
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,030
look at you.

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,720
My next tile

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,430
would let Ruruo win,

75
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,190
but you had to help Miss Anni.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,400
Yanting,

77
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,210
you are so nice to me.

78
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,350
You don't need to pay me for this round.

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
The last time we played Mahjong,

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
I owed you.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,750
Now, we are even.

82
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,030
The last time?

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,390
When was that?

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,750
You just don't pay.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Mine is yours, right?

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,230
Let's keep playing.

87
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,480
(Xiao Mansion)
- 3 Bamboo. - I win.

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,630
- 5 Character.
- Winning.

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,380
Win again! A winning steak!

90
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,250
Yanting, don't pay me.

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
Only you paid me, Miss Jiang.

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,480
So sorry.

93
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
It's fine.

94
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,270
It's on me.

95
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
Commander.

96
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,310
Mr. Du said he had no time

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
and wouldn't come.

98
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,910
It's okay.

99
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,270
When he has time,

100
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,470
we make another appointment.

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
Commander Xiao,

102
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,540
I had fun.

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,560
When Father's free,

104
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,700
I can help make an appointment.

105
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,150
OK.

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
See you, Miss Anni.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
I've got business to attend to.

108
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,240
I won't drive you home.

109
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,910
It's still early.

110
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,680
Let's go home together.

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
I'm still at work.

112
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,360
- I'll wait.
- No need.

113
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
Yanting, could you drive me home?

114
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,130
I didn't drive here.

115
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,710
I'll drive you home, then.

116
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,510
My wife's still working.

117
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
I must drive her home.

118
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
OK, then.

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Bye-bye.

120
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,790
Commander.

121
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
The flowers match you.

122
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,150
So I bought them for you.

123
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,150
Thank you, Commander.

124
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,560
Miss Anni

125
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,070
is Du Hanqing's daughter.

126
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,430
Before you appeared,

127
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,190
she had a crash on Gu Yanting.

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Du Hanqing?

129
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,910
Yes.

130
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,270
He's a arms dealer.

131
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,390
So you killed Paul

132
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,070
because you have a new business partner?

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,510
I killed Paul for you.

134
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,470
Commander,

135
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,600
you know everything?

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,870
So why did you...

137
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,750
You live a frugal life with Yanting.

138
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,480
If you need money, just let me know.

139
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Thank you, Commander.

140
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,870
You are welcome.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,240
If it's okay,

142
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,750
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

143
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,900
Gu Yanting is still waiting for me downstairs.

144
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,750
I'm afraid I can't.

145
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,310
You two

146
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,680
are good now?

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,190
I'm still mad at him.

148
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,430
But after you taught him a lesson for me

149
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,800
at Wangyue Theatre,

150
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,000
he's now well-behaved.

151
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,200
Well-behaved?

152
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,680
He intentionally sided with Miss Du

153
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
to make you angry.

154
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,740
That's why I can't

155
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,160
leave them two together.

156
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,020
No chance for Du Anni.

157
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,000
The money you lost

158
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,100
will be deducted from my wage.

159
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes, it will.

160
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
You were there

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,690
to let her win my money.

162
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,240
That's ridiculous.

163
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
I came over because I heard

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,910
Paul was in Xiao Mansion.

165
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,240
I didn't expect Xiao Li to kill Paul.

166
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,420
He wasn't suspicious of you, was he?

167
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,710
He knows.

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,030
And he told me that he knew.

169
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
Did he do anything to you?

170
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,630
No.

171
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
He thought I needed money,

172
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
so I committed robbery.

173
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,270
He also said if life was hard

174
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,670
with Mr. Gu,

175
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,710
he could give me money.

176
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,720
He's causing trouble.

177
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
He has design on you.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,960
What about Du Anni?

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,150
She was hostile towards me because of you.

180
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,840
She's a rich-family girl.

181
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
We are at best friends.

182
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,720
Isn't that Xiaozhentou?

183
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Tuck in.

184
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,150
Sister Anni.

185
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,550
I have no reason

186
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,360
to eat the cake you bought.

187
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
What do you want from me?

188
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,600
Look at you.

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,320
You are quite like Yanting.

190
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,720
Well, I'm his son.

191
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Boy,

192
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
let me ask you.

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,850
If someday,

194
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,550
your dad divorces Jiang Ruruo,

195
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
will you agree

196
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,550
to live me and your dad?

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
I can promise you

198
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,080
unlimited supply of cakes.

199
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
No, I won't.

200
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,080
Why?

201
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,000
Because

202
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
a gentleman only takes clean money.

203
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,110
Anni.

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,440
Leave the boy alone.

205
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,030
Her mother and I won't be divorced.

206
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,470
Miss Anni,

207
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,510
my son isn't for you to raise.

208
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,660
I heard your son was in Jiangcheng City,

209
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,980
so I wanted to see him.

210
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,500
You should first ask for our approval.

211
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,100
Miss Jiang, don't make a big deal out of it.

212
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,220
I only wanted to offer

213
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,590
Gu Zhen a cake.

214
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,060
When he's finished,

215
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,300
I'd drive him home.

216
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,460
Anni,

217
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,100
my wife is right.

218
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,340
You wanted to see my son,

219
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,820
you should have informed us.

220
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,660
She failed to watch over her kid,

221
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,580
and didn't buy him a cake.

222
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,060
Look how much he wants a cake.

223
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,740
Come.

224
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,940
Choose whatever you want.

225
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,860
For real?

226
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,460
Or for show?

227
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,460
For real, of course.

228
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,260
But do you have money?

229
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,860
I...

230
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,060
Son, it's fine.

231
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,150
I'll pay.

232
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,540
This one.

233
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,340
Okay. 3 yuan.

234
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,220
That's a good one.

235
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,440
But do you have enough money?

236
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,580
Do you need my help?

237
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,740
I...

238
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,700
Take our son home.

239
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Miss Anni, goodbye.

240
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,820
Let's go.

241
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,260
Yanting,

242
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,770
I'm rarely home.

243
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,420
Can you hang out with me longer?

244
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,460
I must cook dinner for my family.

245
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,300
See you next time.

246
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,020
