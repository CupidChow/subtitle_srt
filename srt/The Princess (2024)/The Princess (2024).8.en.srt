I feel so happy right now.

Only the three of us,

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,070
you don't need to call us that.

But if you listen to your mum,

you can call us however you want.

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,760
Deal.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
I have to say,

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,150
you picked me up

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,310
and bought me cake

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,510

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,680
Xiaozhentou,

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,720
you hung out with Dad and Mum?

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,680
Yes,

27
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,040
Granny Liu. We had fun.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
Good.

29
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,490
We're going home, Mrs. Liu.

30
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,880
Acting weird.

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,400
When Du Anni asked you that question,

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
were you unsure?

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,790
She seems rich.

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,040
She's my potential customer,

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,680
I want to maintain
a good relationship with her.

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,560
But now I'm your employer.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,790
You are my son.

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,920
How could you hesitate?

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,920
But we had a three-day contract.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,530
Now I have worked two extra days,

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,870
and you haven't paid.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,000
We had a deal.

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,890
When I get paid, you get paid.

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,280
I must raise the price. 3 yuan per day.

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
This is not our agreement.

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,920
We agreed on 1 per day.

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,560
But this is a dangerous job.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm risking my life playing your son.

49
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,830

- 2.5.

50
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,590
2 yuan, final offer.

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Deal.

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,280

54
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,870
Mummy.

55
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,710
So dramatic.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,630

58
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,870
Aunt Zi Dai will put me to sleep.

I'll sleep on the coach.

64
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm used to coach.

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,030
It's your home.
You don't sleep on the coach.

- You go to bed first.

All 5 cities in the north

Jiangcheng City is also unstable.

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,390
For now,

88
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,240
I can only provide
limited provisions and arms.

89
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,190
Money will do, too.

94
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,800
I beg to differ.

95
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,190
Based on the situation,

96
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,310
name one thing

97
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,870

98
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,120
Yes, we're in chaos,

99
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,920
but the abyssal human desire

100
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,360
