Gu Yanting,

13
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,070
I am a human,

14
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,040
not a thing.

15
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,510
It is my choice.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,310
You must come with me.

17
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,760
Who do you think you are?

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,760
What a scene!

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,640
Muran.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,030
He's not dead.

21
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,870
But none of you is qualified for my sister.

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Muran.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Muran.

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,750
Muran, you are alive.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,030
Muran.

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Sister,

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,310
I'm back.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,360
Sister, stop crying.

29
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,680
Your make-up is in a mess.

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,360
Muran, are you alright?

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm okay.

32
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,870
I'm standing right in front of you, aren't I?

33
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm glad you are okay.

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,030
Ruruo,

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,470
let's continue the wedding.

36
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm here to take my sister home.

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Let go of her.

38
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,870
Don't shoot.

39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,630
Why didn't you tell me you didn't kill Muran?

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
Commander Xiao,

41
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,470
I'd like to make a deal with you.

42
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,310
But it doesn't seem a right time.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
A deal?

44
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
Sorry I didn't introduce myself.

45
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,910
My name is Du Muran.

46
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
Du Muran?

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,190
Du Muran is my half brother.

48
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,920
Father has been ill lately,

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,870
so he's been handling our family business.

50
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,160
Ah, Young Master of Du family.

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,310
Sorry about earlier.

52
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,160
We can talk business after the wedding

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,000
at Xiao Mansion.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,750
Commander Xiao, I'm in a rush.

55
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,560
You don't get a second chance.

56
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,560
Since we will talk business,

57
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,270
how about put down your guns

58
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,160
and have a civilized talk.

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Division Commander Gu,

60
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,190
why don't you listen to

61
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,680
my deal with Commander Xiao?

62
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm not interested in your deal.

63
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,110
Sister.

64
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,600
Now, you are married,

65
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,310
you are Commander's wife,

66
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,240
your beloved brother is back,

67
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,850
you don't need to think of him all the time.

68
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,670
Right,

69
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,030
Mrs. Xiao?

70
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,800
I'd like to ask you about Muran.

71
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,720
It's a shame that he's still alive.

72
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,950
Why didn't you tell me you didn't kill him?

73
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,160
You really wish to know?

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
Yes.

75
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,110
OK.

76
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
Get in the vehicle.

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,950
Yanting, can I come?

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,080
It's none of your business.

79
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,940
(Yun Mansion)

80
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,710
Aunt,

81
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,480
how come you know him?

82
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,720
In order to find the Qiu family treasure
taken by Xiao Li,

83
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,160
I learned when he withdrew the money

84
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,240
from a former servant of the Qiu family,

85
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,000
and told Division Commander Gu,

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
and asked him to search for the treasure.

87
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,190
So it was you who told him

88
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,070
Xiao Li's date of withdrawal.

89
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
So about Muran...

90
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,830
When Muran was arrested,

91
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,040
in a panic,

92
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
I used the connection

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,510
to ask Division Commander Gu
to save Muran's life.

94
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,950
Then why didn't you tell me

95
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
Muran was alive?

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,430
Ruoran, you know,

97
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,510
Muran would do anything for you.

98
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,040
He barely escaped death.

99
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,270
I didn't want him to get into another crisis.

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
So

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,430
I kept it from you

102
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,870
and asked Division Commander Gu
to not tell you either.

103
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,750
(I stabbed you)

104
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,800
(and then even tried to kill you)

105
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,390
(all because you
made a promise to my family.)

106
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,800
(It turns out
you kept everything to yourself.)

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
I see.

108
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,190
(I have been harming you.)

109
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,270
Ruoran,

110
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,750
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,960
I shouldn't have been so selfish.

112
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Aunt,

113
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,480
I understand.

114
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
I don't blame you.

115
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,750
Now that Muran has returned,

116
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,550
I'm very pleased.

117
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,750
How come

118
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,720
Li Muran is Du Hanqing's son?

119
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,590
Aunt,

120
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,360
is Muran really Du Hanqing's son?

121
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,750
Before marrying Li family,

122
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,510
I had an affair

123
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,870
with Du Hanqing.

124
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
On that day,

125
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,120
Muran was severely injured,

126
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,750
I wasn't sure if he could make it,

127
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,150
so I called Du Hanqing out of desperation.

128
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,870
All right.

129
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,390
It's gone so far.

130
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,390
This is the end for our collaboration.

131
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Young Master Du,

132
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,320
what's your relationship with my wife?

133
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,630
Your wife?

134
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
If I'm not mistaken,

135
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,550
your wedding wasn't completed.

136
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
Do you refer to Miss Jiang?

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Everybody knows

138
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
that Ruruo is my wife.

139
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,080
I don't care how you address her.

140
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,600
Two months ago, you tried to kill me,

141
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,320
but my wife did everything to save you.

142
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
Commander Xiao,

143
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,360
my relationship with her, as you can see,

144
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,720
is a life-and-death bond.

145
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,200
I'd like to know

146
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,480
why Gu Yanting let you live?

147
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Commander Xiao,
I'm not here to answer your questions,

148
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,480
but to talk business.

149
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,040
Young Master Du,

150
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,960
I always look forward

151
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,790
to working with the Du family.

152
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,240
So does Father.

153
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,840
In this chaotic time,

154
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,030
only the trade of arms

155
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,790
is a profit-guaranteed deal.

156
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,750
We are on the same page.

157
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,510
In our warehouse,

158
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,480
we have the supply of gunpowder and
refined iron for Armory's 2-month production.

159
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,550
Father is willing to
let you have them for free.

160
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,080
On what condition?

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,670
Father wants a share of the Armory.

162
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,750
Together, you two runs the Armory.

163
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,670
The Armory belongs to Jiangcheng.

164
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,630
It isn't my personal asset.

165
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,600
Commander Xiao, I have been told

166
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,960
the Armory

167
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,480
was originally a factory belonged to the Qius,
the riches family in the city.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You confiscated and made it an Armory,

169
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,080
turning it into your own asset.

170
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,720
I have to say

171
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,200
it is fortune from heaven.

172
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,000
Since you don't agree,

173
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
I'll go.

174
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,510
When you come around,

175
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
I'll come back.

176
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,550
We may have another discussion
about the Armory,

177
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,910
but about Gu Yanting,

178
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,080
do you think we need to talk further?

179
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,440
I got you wrong on Muran's .

181
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,320
We aren't going the same way.

182
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,790
I can't drive you home.

183
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,510
Wait.

184
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,990
Your face.

185
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,390
It may be good for the wound.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Sister,

187
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,350
control you.

188
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,450
♪Destiny always brings us together first♪

189
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,960
