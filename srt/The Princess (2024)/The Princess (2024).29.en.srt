12
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,510
All you cared about was this child,

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,150
I was worried you wouldn't seek revenge,

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
so

15
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,120
I used the excuse
of taking him to see a doctor

16
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,280
and dumped him at the hospital.

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,880
Aunt,

18
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,400
how could you do that?

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,000
He is also...

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,640
Muran's son.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,870
A child

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,200
is far less important
than the hate of our family.

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,790
Plus,

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
I never wanted

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,760
Muran to be with you.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,760
Aunt,

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,710
I realize I don't know you at all.

28
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,590
I can't tell

29
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,120
what you say is real

30
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,150
or fake.

31
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
Sister.

32
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll take Xiaozhentou home first.

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,400
Sister, this is your home.

34
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,990
Muran,

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,840
this is too much of a shock.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
I need some time to think.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,030
Sister, I don't understand.

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,520
What do you need to think about?

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,560
The facts and proofs
are right in front of you.

40
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,800
Xiaozhentou and I
were separated for six years.

41
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,840
Can you bear to see him

42
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,840
continue to be a fatherless brat?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,240
Watch your mouth!

44
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,910
Who are you calling a brat?

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
Du Muran, listen to me.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,750
I don't care about your facts or proofs.

47
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,280
As long as Jiang Ruruo is my wife,

48
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,910
Xiaozhentou is my son.

49
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,400
Move aside
if you don't want to get killed.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
One.

51
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,350
Two.

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,870
Muran,

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,430
don't threaten me with Xiaozhentou.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
Come on, Xiaozhentou.

55
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,670
Let's go home.

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,270
Let's go.

57
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,740
(Bugao Alley)

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
He's asleep.

59
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
The moment I think of

60
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,560
how he grew up

61
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,360
and eagerly attempts
to find his mother

62
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,630
in this chaotic age,

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,160
while I said

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,950
I wanted another baby.

65
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,480
How hurtful that must sound!

66
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,600
At this thought,

67
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,950
my heart is about to shatter.

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm so foolish.

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,190
I'm such a bad mother.

70
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
I can't imagine

71
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,190
what he has gone
through these years.

72
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,720
It isn't your fault.

73
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,030
Don't be hard on yourself.

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,190
Do you really not mind?

75
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,880
I do.

76
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,310
I understand how you feel,

77
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,750
but I won't allow my child
to be separated from me again.

78
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,390
What I mind is how come

79
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,600
you still don't believe me?

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,480
You still don't believe that I just want

81
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,270
to be with you and the boy.

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Stop crying.

83
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,950
You are the city's wanted man.

84
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,950
How dare you show yourself?

85
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,070
I do admire your audacity.

86
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Young Master Du,
you are now in a different position.

87
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,760
Let's get down to business.

88
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,680
I have a secret.

89
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
A secret of yours?

90
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,750
Then I'm not interested.

91
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,480
Of Ruruo's.

92
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,590
What?

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,360
Xiao Shizhao, former
commander-in-general of Jiangcheng,

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,630
was the one who harmed the Qiu family.

95
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,710
Yes.

96
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,030
Xiao Shizhao?

97
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,720
Wasn't he your father?

98
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,160
He was my foster father.

99
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
He had a illegitimate child

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,070
named Gu Yanting.

101
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,800
Do you have any evidence?

102
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,580
(Testament)

103
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
This is Xiao Shizhao's testament.

104
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,190
He was going
to acknowledge Gu Yanting

105
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,480
and pass the authority on to him.

106
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,830
(Written by Xiao Shizhao)
But his death came too soon

107
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,630
before the testament took effect.

108
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
So it means

109
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,190
Gu Yanting is the son of Sister's enemy.

110
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,270
Correct.

111
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
Why don't you tell her, then?

112
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,950
Ruruo hates me

113
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,030
and loves Gu Yanting so much,

114
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,600
would she believe my words?

115
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
I understand.

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
You regard me

117
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,550
as a tool to bring Gu Yanting down.

118
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,200
Likewise.

119
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,020
(Testament)

120
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,750
- Take it, please.
- Thank you.

121
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,390
This is the testament of Xiao Shizhao,

122
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,850
former commander-in-general
of Jiangcheng.

123
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,510
Before his death,

124
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,750
he planned to turn
the authority over to you.

125
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,270
So your claim is based
on this piece of paper?

126
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,360
But I don't even know
this Commander Xiao Shizhao.

127
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,630
I have had it authenticated.

128
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
This testament

129
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,840
was written by Xiao Shizhao himself.

130
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,720
What is your point then?

131
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,320
Why would

132
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Xiao Shizhao turn his power

133
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,750
over to an unrelated person?

134
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,470
Unless

135
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,000
you two are related.

136
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,320
Son,

137
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,360
when you are in Jiangcheng,

138
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,870
you will meet an Officer Xiao.

139
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,230
He...

140
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,030
He is your father.

141
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,000
Mum, please stop.

142
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,510
Before you get well,

143
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,720
I won't leave.

144
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,600
He will show you extra care.

145
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,480
You can accept his kind will.

146
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,630
Don't be stubborn all the time.

147
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,120
From what I have heard,

148
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,240
you grew up with your mother,

149
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,960
and when you were
recognized by Old Warlord,

150
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,670
you started calling him Father.

151
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,670
Have you never wondered

152
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,120
who your biological father is?

153
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Do you remember Sister stabbing you?

154
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,750
The reason why she did it

155
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,510
is that she knew at the time,

156
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,000
you were Xiao Shizhao's son.

157
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,000
The son of the murderer!

158
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
Gu Yanting,

159
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,790
you have no place
of being with Sister.

160
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,200
You're home.

161
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,960
What's for dinner?

162
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,670
The recent days have been weary.

163
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,870
I have made fish soup for you.

I'll fill a bowl for you.

166
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,200
The chef made a mistake.

167
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,560
You forgot to put salt.

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
Really? Let me taste it.

169
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,750
It was a joke.

170
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,120

I'm wondering,

177

when you were with Xiao Li,

178
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,790
you had the chance to kill him,

to kill everyone in Qiu and Li families.
