You're hungry? Go ask your mum.

She said she could do anything

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,870
but cooking.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
you can't let your mum cook.

27
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,560
You earn 3 yuan a day.

Listen, you'll cook for us.

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,590
Make lunch both for me and Mum.

31
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,550
Go.

32
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,750
Well, I'm not your biological son.

45
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,280
you have a bad reputation,

46
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,910
and now you abduct children?

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,910
Aren't you afraid
that the angry citizens

48
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,870
kick you and your soldiers out of Jiangcheng?

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
What a joke!

00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,080
He is as stingy as me.

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,630
Is that not enough?

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
The police sent two people
over the other day.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
They said the child was hired by you

is on every newspaper in Jiangcheng.

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,430

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,070
and I will do it.

70
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,160
Just confess that you
and Ruruo are a fake couple,

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,160
so it makes her innocent,

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
otherwise,

73
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,270
she'll be arrested as well

74
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,720

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,120

It's between you and me.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,070
Don't get her involved.

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Because you and Ruruo aren't a real couple.

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,720
You are a drag for her.

86
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,360
She often scolds and hits me.

87
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,190
She isn't gentle

88
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,510

89

or how many things have happened,

90

She is and will always be Mrs. Gu.

him to be a child abductor.

115
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Gu Yanting is such a scum.

116
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,920
We all have children.

117
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,510
Right. He deserves to be executed.

118
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,830
He should be shot to death.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
Yes. What he did is unthinkable.

120

121
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400

123
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,190
Are you really going to execute Gu Yanting?

124
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
You're here to beg for mercy on him?

125
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,390
Why would I?

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
But if he dies,

127
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,920
I'll have no one to rely on.

128
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,670
Did you say

129
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,320
you'd like to leave him
and stay in Xiao Mansion?

130
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,750
But as soon as he's in trouble,

131
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,440
I leave him,

132
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,120
won't people see me

133
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,550
as a cold-hearted woman?

134
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,080
I don't want a bad reputation.

135
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,360
So you mean if I release him,

136
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,390
you'll move into Xiao Mansion?

137
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,510
I have no other options.

138
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,910

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,560
Ruruo,

140
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,000
you should make a decision.

141
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,110

142
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,670
release Gu Yanting tomorrow,

143
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,670
and I'll leave him.

144
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,670
(I know you do this to save him.)

145
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,550
(But so what?)

146
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
(As long as I can have you.)

147
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,750
My wife

148
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,480

or how many things have happened,

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,270

158

(and even harmed you.)

(Vengeance is my destiny.)

162
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,390
(Maybe leaving you)

163
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,480
(is the way to get you out of all this.)

167

168

Why can't I be here?

169
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
Come on.

170
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,510
What's Xiao Li's problem?

171
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,600
You are friends.

172
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,870
How come he hit you so hard?

173
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
It's fine. Just minor injuries.

174
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,790
All the time you stayed in the cage,

175
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320

176
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,960
She's home with our son.

177
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,750
Stop fooling yourself.

178
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,600
Let's go. I don't like this place.

179
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,750
Hurry.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,840
- I need a smoke.
- Come on.

181
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,960
Do you expect Jiang Ruruo to come?

182
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,790
She would have come if she wanted to.

183
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320

(I'll go to a dangerous place.)

00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,240
(I can't take you with me.)

188
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,750
(Take care of yourself.)

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Where are you going?

190
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,150
Our divorce will be on the news.

191
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,240
We will be separated for good.

192
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,000
Wh-What are you talking about?

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,750
Remember? We are never a real couple.

194
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,510
This game should be over.

195
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,280
I refuse.

196
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,600
Give me an explanation,

197
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,450
or you don't leave here.

198
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,870
What explanation do you expect?

199
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,670
We cannot be together.

200
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,120
Separation is the best possible result.

201
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,550
Why can't we be together?

202
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,630
Can't we talk it out?

203
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,320
What's the point of this, Division Commander?

204
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,910
Xiao Li will come and take me away soon.
