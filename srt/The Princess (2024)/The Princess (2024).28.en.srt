what I said last night

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
and thought I'd abandon him,

109
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,750
so he left.

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200

the lock was on me,

125

He will be fine.

Uncle.

165
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,720
I know you don't get along
with Dad and Mum.

166
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,550
Please don't threaten them with me.

167
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,990
I won't.

168
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,270

169
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,030

171
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
where did you go?

172
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,720
Mum.

173
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,000
I went to find my mum.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
I know you have been nice to me,

175
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,910
but I still need my real parents.

176
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
You should have told us.

177
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
We will find them together.

178
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,840
You couldn't just run out by yourself.

179
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
But I was afraid

180
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
I couldn't bear to leave you.

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,150
You, after all, love me so much.

No matter what happens,

183
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,360
we will face it together.

184
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,910
We don't keep things from each other.

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
Let's go home.

186
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,960
I don't think so.

187
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,720
It's our family business.
You stay out of it.

188
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,750
Sister,

189
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
look.

190
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
Do you remember this lock?

191
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,590
Baby,

192
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,480
Mummy will put this longevity lock on you

193
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,670
to wish you lifelong peace.

194
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,550
Could it be

195
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
that Xiaozhentou is...

196
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,870
He is our child.

197
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,790
So he must be with me.

198
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,600
Mum, you are real mum.

199
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,480
I-I have finally found my mum.

200
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,270
Let me take him.

201
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,120
He will be fine.

202
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
Where's my child?

203
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,870
The child is gone.

204
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,120
But at the time,

205
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,960
Aunt said my child died of lung disease.

206
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,240
What on earth happened?

207
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,510
