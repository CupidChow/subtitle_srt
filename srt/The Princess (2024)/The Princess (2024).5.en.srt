What is a pretty guy?

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,530
This is adult stuff,
and kids shouldn't listen.

48
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's go. I'll take you outside to play.

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,190
Why did you kill Muran?

50
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,910
Xiao Li released Muran today

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,710
just to wait for you to take the bait.

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,280
I'm asking why did you kill him?

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,000
Apart from Li Muran,

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,430
you care about no one else?

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,280
You want to kill

56
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,310
all those I care about?

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,800
I'll end your life now!

58
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,270
Not that.

59
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,400
Your comprehension really...

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
What's going on?

61
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,430
Nothing.

62
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,540
Just a bit romance between a couple.

63
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
(Yun House)

64
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,590
Who?

65
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,230
Ruoran?

66
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,270
Why did you come so late?

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Aunt,

68
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,560
I failed to protect Muran.

70
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,270
I could only watch him
being killed, helplessly.

71
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm so sorry.

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,520
I...

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Ruoran,

74
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,680
it's not your fault.

75
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,350
If somebody is to blame,

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,950
it is our enemy.

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,950
Our enemy

78
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,720
is not only Xiao Li who exterminated
the Qiu Family and the Li Family.

79
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,950
Now,

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,920
there is also Gu Yanting, who killed Muran.

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,190
I need to remain by their side.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,120
Only then will I have the chance to revenge.

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,000
I have to keep acting

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,510
in this play.

85
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Aunt,

86
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,600
take care when you go out recently.

87
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm afraid Gu Yanting
will find out about our relationship.

88
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,790
That's could be harmful to you.

89
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright.

90
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
I understand.

91
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,270
(Xiao Mansion)
Commander, I find it troublesome,

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,310
so I burnt Li Muran's body.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Negligence of a soldier
is considered a major offense.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,390
You first, or I?

95
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,310
So nagging and fussing!

96
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,360
As usual. Let's do it together.

97
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,000
When did your shooting get so poor?

98
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,630
I am less skilled.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm willing to accept punishment.

100
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,240
You indeed deserve to be punished.

101
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,070
I said we had to keep Li Muran alive.

102
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,950
Why did you kill him?

103
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,510
He is just a bait.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,920
Killing him is

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,190
no big deal.

106
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,830
Treating human life as worthless.

107
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,000
You truly deserve the title of
Jiangcheng's number one executioner.

108
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,440
Commander,

109
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,920
the documents to be signed are ready.

110
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,030
They are all on the table.

111
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,230
Mrs. Gu,

112
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,740
there have been many documents these days.

113
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,160
I can stay out tonight.

114
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,590
The guest room last time is still available.

115
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Thank you, Commander.

116
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,500
(Jiangcheng Garrison)

117
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,790
(Gu Yanting,)

118
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,430
(you think you can pull the strings?)

119
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,000
(There's still Xiao Li in Jiangcheng.)

120
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,680
(I wonder if you two fight,)

121
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,800
(who will die first?)

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
Who is it?

123
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,520
Mrs. Gu,

124
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,110
are you asleep?

125
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,270
Wait a moment.

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,800
Commander.

127
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,000
Is there something urgent this late?

128
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,790
I'd like to invite you for a drink.

129
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,870
Come in.

130
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
Give it to me.

131
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Mrs. Gu,

132
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,030
you and Yanting are at odds.

133
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,320
How did you get married?

134
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,440
I married Gu Yanting

135
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,000
because

136
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,200
he's handsome.

137
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,440
Who knew

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,320
he would be a brutal and murderous person.

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,200
He's absolutely detestable.

140
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,600
So,

141
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,670
I envy Sister Qi Yan.

142
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,910
I envy that

143
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,270
she can marry

144
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,670
a man like you, both handsome

145
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,940
and gentle.

146
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,090
Commander,

147
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,390
if you can help me to

148
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,550
break free from this unhappy marriage,

149
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,630
and gain freedom,

150
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,240
I can stay at the Xiao Mansion forever.

151
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,120
You hate Gu Yanting that much?

152
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,670
Only by breaking free from that constraint

153
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,080
can I attain true happiness.

154
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,000
Tomorrow, come with me
to Wangyue Theatre to enjoy opera.

155
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,910
Enjoy opera?

156
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,990
Yes.

157
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,480
You can also invite Gu Yanting.

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Sir.

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,080
You've got guts now, daring to spit at me.

160
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,960
I wasn't spitting at you.

161
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,680
Sir,

162
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
you really won't

163
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,390
tell Mrs. Gu about saving Li Muran?

164
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
Mr. Gu,

165
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,250
I would like to ask for
your help to save someone.

166
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,420
During the day, we are closely watched.

167
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,790
I can only bring him at night.

168
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,350
I gave a shot to his leg,

169
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,050
and a shot to his chest,
avoiding the heart and lungs.

170
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,080
He was severely injured but won't die.

171
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,030
In front of so many people,

172
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,750
this is all I can do.

173
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,600
Why is Mrs. Gu always so irritable?

174
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,350
You!

175
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,840
Climb through the window in the dead night!

176
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
What are you here for?

177
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,230
To seek cooperation.

178
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,230
It's too late.

179
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,360
Just because of Li Muran?

180
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,910
Didn't you kill me once yesterday as well?

181
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,850
And you even stabbed me once.

182
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,600
Gu Yanting,

183
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,270
human lives are at stake.

184
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,080
How can you put it so lightly?

185
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,750
Mr. Gu,

186
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,790
you already know

187
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,320
the relationship between Jiang Ruruo and us.

188
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
I beg you

189
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,670
not to tell her that Muran is still alive.

190
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,240
Right now,

191
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,480
I only have this one son left.

192
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,910
He is my life.

193
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,480
But Muran

194
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,320
is only willing to
give up everything for her.

195
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,750
But she has also repeatedly
risked her life for your son.

196
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,720
She cares deeply about your son.

197
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,750
I beg you.

198
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,610
I beg you, for their sake,

199
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,610
don't let them meet again.

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,030
Does the person you care about

201
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
also care about you?

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,750
You killed my most intimate one!

203
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,440
How come you have the nerve to say that?

204
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,240
You'd better spare my life.

205
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,030
If I die,

206
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,060
who can help you
find the Qiu Family's treasure?

209
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,060
So you knew my identity.

210
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,670
Your real name is Qiu Ruoran,

211
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,200
the daughter of the Qiu Family.

212
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,630
After your family
was exterminated by Xiao Li,

213
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,000
the treasure also fell into Xiao Li's hands,

214
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,960
and was later transferred by him.

215
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,200
There hasn't been any news for years.

216
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
But tomorrow, Xiao Li will use the money

217
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,360
to buy materials for manufacturing weapons.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,240
As long as we work together,

219
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,550
we will definitely
find the hiding place of the treasure.

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
(So you tacitly allowed me
to get close to you, )

221
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,510
(just because you
covet the Qiu Family's treasure.)

222
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
But

223
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,080
just now, Xiao Li came to my room,

224
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,870
and invited me to
enjoy opera in Wangyue Theatre.

225
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,350
Wangyue Theatre?

226
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
Yes.

227
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,630
Wangyue Theatre.

228
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,600

hid the treasure in Wangyue Theatre?)
