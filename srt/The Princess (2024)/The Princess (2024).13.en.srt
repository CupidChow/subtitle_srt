74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
She wouldn't betray Mr. Li.

What do you mean?

90
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,040
Why would she risk everything

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,430
just for Mr. Li?

92
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,070
Just because she loves you?

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,510

94
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,270
does she really love you?

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,240
Mr. Li is my friend.

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Whatever her reasons,

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,600

The armory was bombed,
