It's been years
since you came home last time.

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,430
Are you worried
that you can't face them

believe me,

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,590
I will avenge the Qiu and the Li families,

24
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,870

(I know, for who I am)

28
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,470
(I shouldn't even be here,)

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,360
(but I guarantee)

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,750
(that as long as I can,)

31
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,680

32

Where are Du's men?

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,520
They have been driven out.

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,400
When did you do it?

37
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,960
Why didn't you tell me?

38
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,520
The Armory is now yours.

39
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,840
Both Xiao Li and Du Hanqing

40
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,790
will hold you in respect,

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,630
including my foster father.

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,680
In Jiangcheng,

43
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,590
no one will dare to threaten you.

44
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,030
Mine?

45
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm only managing it
for you for the time being.

46
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,960
Now that you have returned

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,030
and are in good shape,

48
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,990
the Northern Division should
be handed over back to you.

49
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,840
You are more suitable for it.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,630
Why me?

51
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
Because all the other people
have their own interest,

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,600
nobody is like you

53
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,160
or your father

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,000
who worked whole-heartedly

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,350
for the interest of Jiangcheng civilians.

56
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,110
What about you?

57
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,230
Me?

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
I have mine as well.

59
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,920
What is that?

60
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,830
My interest is

61
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,270
you.

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,040
Also, the Armory

63
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,390
was originally the Qiu family's asset.

64
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,560
You are the rightful owner.

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Dad, tea for you.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,840
Dad,

67
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,950
why must we

68
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,310
establish a machinery factory

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,830
to do business with foreigners?

70
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,480
Because in the modern age,

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,560
the Westerners
own the advanced technologies.

72
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,160
If we wish to develop,

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,870
we must first learn.

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,310
Like what Mr. Wei Yuan said.

75
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,800
"Learn from foreigners to beat them."

76
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,590
Ruoran,

77
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,360
I hope you return soon

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,160
and help me run the factory.

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Unfortunately,

80
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,070
Dad didn't achieve his goal,

81
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,270
instead, our family was ruined.

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,640
And this place

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,950
has become the target

84
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,000
of all those warlords.

85
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,920
I actually agree with Mr. Qiu.

86
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,270
However, in this day,

87
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,270
a peaceful and stable life

88
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,680
has become wishing thinking.

89
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,470
Yanting,

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,800
we may pick up your previous plan

91
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,630
and provide arms for everyone.

92
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,430
When the war is over,

93
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,070
we'll convert it
into a machinery factory

94
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,270
to provide resources for everyone.

95
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
This way,

96
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,800
our life will get better and better.

97
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,150
OK.

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Oh my.

99
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
A rare visitor.

100
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,040
Welcome.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,320
Mr. Du,

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,360
how things have changed.

103
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,560
It isn't easy to meet you.

104
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,800
You are out of Xiao Mansion.

105
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,800
Which, too, is quite a change.

106
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
What would you like to talk to me?

107
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,360
A good deal.

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,740
(Title Deed)

109
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,390
Title dead for the Armory.

110
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,950
Too bad,

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,360
you warlords

112
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,870
keep competing over the Armory,

113
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,560
so even if I have this deed,

114
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,360
what would be the point?

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,000
With this deed,

116
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,600
you'll be the legal owner of the Armory.

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
What?

118
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,270
Do you plan to buy me off with this?

119
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Mr. Du,

120
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,800
I remember

121
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,920
you were the largest shareholder

122
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,000
of the Armory initially,

123
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,720
but Gu Yanting took it from you

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,000
and gave it to a woman.

125
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,270
Word on Jiangcheng street

126
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,600
says you, as the biggest arms dealer,

127
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,120
couldn't even keep your own thing.

128
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,630
How can you tolerate it?

129
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,080
How would you like me to help you,

130
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,240
so I can have the deed?

131
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,200
Help me rebuild my Jiangcheng Army.

132
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,870
Mum, why are dressing like this?

133
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,270
Are you feeling unwell?

134
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
It's you. Where's your dad?

135
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,000
Dad said

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,320
he knew I miss you,

137
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,030
so he let you have me tonight.

138
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,270
He's avoiding me on purpose.

139
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,240
Mum, do you prefer Dad

140
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,550
over me?

141
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,790
No way.

142
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,960
I love Xiaozhentou.

143
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,440
Tonight, you sleep with Mum.

144
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,230
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,270
I thought your injuries
had gotten better,

146
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,550
but they are even worse.

147
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,960
Boss,

148
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,200
you wanted the Armory back,

149
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,200
I could have done it for you.

150
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,600
Why must you personally do it?

151
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,960
You weren't healed,

152
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,080
and now you're in a worse state.

153
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,080
I must get back
what belongs to Yue myself.

154
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,990
But...

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,030
