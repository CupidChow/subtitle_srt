13

Let me go!

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,320
Get off of me!

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Ruruo,

16
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,230
You may think I'm a gentleman
who puts up with anything,

17
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,190
sadly, I'm not.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,590
You and Gu Yanting met
privately before our wedding.

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,310
You held Du Muran's hand at our wedding.

20
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,310
And you even went away with another man.

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
Things like that,

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,870
I don't want them to happen again.

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,030
From today on,

24
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,630
you belong only to me.

25
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,870
Stop playing these games.

26
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,520
Stop testing my patience.

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,560
Otherwise,

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
I'll make Gu Yanting

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,680
and Du Muran pay double!

30
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
You!

31
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,240
You wish to know where the treasure is?

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,080
It is right in this mansion.

33
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,630
I had a long deliberation.

34
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,150
Perhaps only

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
by telling you everything

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,840
will you understand how much I love you.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
Commander, an urgent call.

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,870
I'll come back again tomorrow night.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,190
Don't test my patience again.

40
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,240
Otherwise,

41
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,630
I'll make Gu Yanting

42
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,470
and Du Muran pay double.

43
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Hello.

44
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,150
Division Commander Gu,

45
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,630
Commander wishes
to meet you at Xiao Mansion.

46
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Division Commander Gu.

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,020
(Xiao Mansion)

48
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,880
Salute!

49
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,240
What do you want?

50
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,600
The wedding ended in a rush yesterday.

51
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,070
I call you over to have more fun.

52
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't think it's necessary.

53
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,120
Nobody cares about your stuff.

54
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,870
Watch your tone.

55
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Ruruo,

56
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
I always see Yanting as my little brother,

57
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,430
so from today on,

58
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
he is your little brother as well.

59
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,600
This is the first time
you meet him as the sister.

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,950
Say hello to Yanting.

61
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,710
Sister.

62
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,710
Division Commander Gu.

63
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,190
My son is at home.

64
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
You can have fun without me.

65
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Yanting,

66
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,070
why didn't you tell me

67
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,160
you came to see Commander Xiao?

68
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,680
Didn't we say

69
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,430
we were going to see Dad together?

70
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,910
Sister.

71
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,680
Muran.

72
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,040
Now that we are all here,

73
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,000
let's announce the good news.

74
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Mrs. Xiao,

75
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,000
Muran sees you as his sister,

76
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,040
so will I.

77
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,950
In this case,

78
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,160
Yanting is your future brother then.

79
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,080
Sister,

80
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,470
your hand.

81
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,350
I'm okay.

82
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay how?

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I see blood.

84
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
It needs to be treated.

85
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Go.

86
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,030
It's pointless that you marry her.

87
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,910
To her,

88
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,790
Muran is more important than anyone.

89
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,150
I wish you happy marriage.

90
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
Thank you, Commander.

91
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
Come with me.

92
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,080
Wait.

93
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,010
What is this drama of yours?

94
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,960
Let's make a deal.

95
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Does it hurt?

96
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,910
Sister, what are you looking at?

97
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,750
Muran,

98
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,360
it's wonderful

99
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
that you are back.

100
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,390
It feels like a dream.

101
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,320
It is not a dream.

102
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
If you are unsure,

103
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
feel me.

104
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,440
How are your legs?

105
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,870
Healed.

106
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,990
Long ago.

107
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
Look.

108
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,150
Be careful.

109
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,710
I'm okay.

110
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,990
Sister,

111
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,910
I wanted to come to see you earlier,

112
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,600
but I wasn't able to stand stably.

113
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,030
Now, I can stand firmly

114
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,240
in front of you,

115
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,720
yet,

116
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,870
you are somebody else's wife.

117
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,990
Muran,

118
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I know Yanting injured your legs,

119
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,200
but your mum told me

120
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,080
he did that to save you.

121
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,390
Don't hate him for that.

122
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Sister, don't worry.

123
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,910
You should put priority on your mum

124
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,960
instead of risking your life for me.

125
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
But Sister,

126
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,910
you are the reason

127
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
why I struggled to stay alive

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,910
as the son of that traitor Du Hanqing.

129
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,230
Muran.

130
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,790
Sister, don't worry.

131
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,440
Whatever you wish to achieve,

132
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,790
I will help.

133
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
What do you want?

134
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,790
I want you to be my fiance.

135
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,030
A divorced man with a young boy like me?

136
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,030
Are you thinking straight?

137
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,360
I know Jiang Ruruo's true identity.

138
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,550
My little brother

139
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,510
has a sister he adores

140
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,510
since childhood.

141
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,790
She used to the daughter
of the richest family in Jiangcheng.

142
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,240
Qiu Ruoran.

143
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,480
Xiao Li is an exterminator.

144
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,030
7 years ago, he committed
the massacre of the Qiu family.

145
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,600
Think about it.

146
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,600
If he finds out
Jiang Ruruo's true identity,

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,320
will he let her live?

148
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,150
Up to this point,

149
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,440
do you think I care?

150
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,240
The Mahjong room is ready.

151
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,120
Commander expects to see you all there.

152
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
White Dragon.

153
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,510
Sister, I'm in bad luck today.

154
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,870
Please draw the next tile for me.

155
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,120
You are an adult.

156
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,790
Deal with bad luck on your own.

157
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,870
Draw it yourself.

158
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,920
Commander Xiao,

159
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,670
your ex-wife Qiyan disappeared.

160
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,510
How many days
do my new sister-in-law have?

161
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,510
Ruruo,

162
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,440
draw a tile for me.

163
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,750
What's wrong with your hand?

164
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,590
Six Bamboo.

165
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,990
What happened?

166
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,990
None of your concern.

167
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,200
Gu Yanting,

168
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,320
it's between us.

169
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,390
You mind your own business.

170
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,110
Xiao Li,

171
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,390
you fell over backwards to marry her

172
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,600
just to torture her?

173
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,800
Sister,

174
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,790
