12
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,150
Boss, I have a question.

13
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,760
Did she

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,350
cast a spell on you?

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm taking a rickshaw to Du Mansion.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
You handle two things for me.

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,520
Mr. Du,

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,120
let's get straight to it.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
How did the talks
with my foster father go?

20
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,760
You really can't be fooled.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,480
Yanting, once you marry Anni,

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,710
we'll be family.

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,070
As for the shares of the armory,

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
you get 20%,

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,870
the Warlord gets 30%,

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
and Du Family gets 50%.

27
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,080
I've drafted the contract.

28
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,240
Once you're engaged,

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,120
we'll sign it.

30
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,060
(Contract)

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,240
Where's Mrs. Li?

32
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,310
Wanrou?

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,910
Why are you asking about her?

34
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,630
She's an elder, after all.

35
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,870
Marriage is important,

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,710
she should be present.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,520
Get her here.

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,310
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Yanting,

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,470
Xiao Li's forces are

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,560
strong in Jiangcheng,

42
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,800
and could strike back at any time.

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,960
I suggest

44
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,520
you get engaged as soon as possible.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Engagement is so unnecessary,

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,550
and the longer we wait,
the more risks there are.

47
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,030
I've already ordered the wedding dress.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
We'll get married in a few days.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
Why the rush?

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah,

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,750
isn't this a bit too hasty?

52
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,310
Mrs. Li, what do you think?

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,520
I can't interfere

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
with Miss Anni's marriage.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
You're the most

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
important voice here.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,310
Because the one I'm marrying is

58
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,520
your niece, Jiang Ruruo.

59
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,590
What?

60
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,590
Mr. Gu,

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,680
what are you saying?

62
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,430
Anni.

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,910
Sir, the armory just called.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,360
A group of soldiers of Northern Division
kidnapped the young master.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
What?

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Don't worry, Mr. Du.

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,000
As long as your father lets my boss
marry Ms. Jiang,

68
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,560
you'll be safe.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,030
What do you mean?

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,310
Gu Yanting is using me to force she

71
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,240
to marry him?

72
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,600
Tell him,

73
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,800
I'd rather die

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
than let him…

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
let him…

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Now,

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,480
I have to handle the second task,

78
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,390
getting the wedding dress.

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Mr. Gu,

80
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,800
what does this have to do with Muran?

81
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,360
That depends

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,190
on Mr. Du's decision.

83
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,830
Gu Yanting!

84
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,390
If you do this,

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,430
the contract is off.

86
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,070
Aren't you afraid
the Warlord will side with Xiao Li?

87
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,590
Mr. Du,

88
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,830
you're confused.

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,270
You're the one being threatened,

90
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,600
not me.

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,870
If you don't sign the contract,

92
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,360
your son dies tonight.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Wanrou,

94
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,040
don't worry.

95
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,390
I won't put his life in danger.

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,040
How can I not worry?

97
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,240
From the day he was born,

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,480
what have you ever done for him?

99
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,390
You're just saying that,

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,270
but you never lift a finger to help.

101
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,790
Mr. Du,

102
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,800
you'd better sign it.

103
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,160
Otherwise I can't guarantee

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,680
your son won't

105
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,040
get hurt.

106
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,580

107
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,220
(Signature: Du Hanqing)

108
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,910
Good.

109
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,480
Don't worry, Mr. Du.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,270
I always keep my word.

111
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
I'll free him tonight.

112
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
Then Ruoran…

113
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,110
Mrs. Li,

114
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm marrying Jiang Ruoran.

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,390
This is a notice.

116
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,870
But I'd still like your blessing

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,950
for our marriage.

118
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,510
Am I dreaming?

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,510
I thought I'd never see you again.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm here to tell you

121
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
I've kidnapped Du Muran.

122
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,310
What?

123
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,630
Marry me,

124
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,510
then he'll be released.

125
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,560
If you refuse, he dies.

126
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,470
I agree.

127
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
You didn't hesitate at all.

128
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
You'd really do anything for Du Muran, huh?

129
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,720
You kidnapped him just to test me?

130
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,790
We're nothing…

131
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,200
Don't flatter yourself.

132
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,240
I don't need to test your feelings for him.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
I just remembered

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,390
you said you loved me.

135
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,030
So isn't it good
that I'm marrying you

136
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,200
and making you Mrs. Gu?

137
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,630
It is.

138
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,290
Jiang Ruruo,

139
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,750
does it even matter to you

140
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,790
who you marry?

141
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,270
Boss, are you really releasing Du Muran?

142
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,870
Yes.

143
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,150
So she's willing to marry you

144
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,960
just to save him?

145
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,360
Shut your mouth, and get out.

146
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,780
(Jiangcheng Evening News)

147
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,510
Commander,

148
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,550
Northern Division is pressing in closer,
and they'll reach the mansion soon.

149
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,000
But the Warlord hasn't move.

150
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,630
Looks like Gu Yanting

151
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,670
has settled things
between the Warlord and Du Hanqing.

152
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,840
Mr. Xiao,

153
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,030
how are you these days?

154
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,440
Mr. Du,

155
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,960
calling at a time like this,

156
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,960
are you asking for help,

157
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,790
or just mocking me?

158
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm calling you to tell you a truth.

159
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,440
You got bit by Gu Yanting,

160
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,600
and come to me for revenge, huh?

161
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,550
Jiang Ruruo is actually

162
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,240
the only daughter of Qiu Nianyuan,

163
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,270
the princess of Qiu Family,

164
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,150
Qiu Ruoran.

165
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
Qiu Ruoran

166
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,320
and Jiang Ruruo.

167
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,550
I didn't expect

168
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,390
we'd be bound together

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
by fate from so long ago.

170
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,030
Find out
where Gu Yanting bought the wedding dress,

171
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,200
bribe the person delivering it,

172
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,750
then

173
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,600
send this to her.

174
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,870
Commander.

175
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,550
I've been trying to win you back,

176
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,750
but now I don't have to.

177
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,510
You'll come to me on your own.

178
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,560

179
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,870
the suitcase has the clothes
Boss prepared for you.

180
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,510
If there's anything else you need,

181
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,360
just let me know.

182
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,510
Did Yanting tell you

183
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,120
when the wedding will be?

184
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,910
The situation with Xiao Li is tense.

185
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,790
But Xiao Li won't last much longer.

186
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,390
We'll take his mansion tomorrow.

187
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,270
Once it's over,

188
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,440
the wedding will happen.

189
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,160
Tomorrow?

190
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,590
