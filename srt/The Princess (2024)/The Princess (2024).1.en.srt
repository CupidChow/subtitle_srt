(you killed Muran,)

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,990
Commander Xiao.

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,590
(Yue.)

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm Jiang Ruruo.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760
I'm here for the secretary job.

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,230
Don't you know me?

23
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:41,990
Commander Xiao,

24
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,640
it's my privilege

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,040
if we've met before.

26
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,790
(Pretending the amnesia.)

27
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,990
Alright.

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
You say you're here for the job.

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,040
Then tell me,

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,680
what are the responsibilities
of a secretary?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,080
I apologize.

32
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,310
Sorry, Commander, I lost my footing.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,310
Should I call you Ruruo,

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
or

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Yue?

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Commander,

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,910
my name doesn't

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,430
get "Yue" in it.

39
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,630
Neither is my last name Xiao.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
What are you doing?

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,990
Gu Yanting,

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
why are you here?

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Commander Xiao,

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,750
I heard someone tried to assassinate you,

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,280
so I came to check on you.

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,280
(He is Xiao Li.)

47
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,630
You're right on time.

48
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,590
The assassin is in the prison.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
- You go deal with it.
- Okay.

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,280
(Muran is still alive.)

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,310
(I need to find a way to save him.)

52
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,270
Commander,

53
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm here for the secretary job.

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,710
You're Jiang Ruruo?

55
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,520
How could they bring you here?

56
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,630
I'll let you talk.

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Ms. Jiang, please follow me.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
Ms. Jiang,

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,080
the first condition

60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,560
as a secretary here is

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,630
you must be married,

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
and have a husband and a kid.

63
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,750
Don't worry, Ma'am.

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,030
Xiaozhentou.

65
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,560
Mom!

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,200
Be careful!

67
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,630
Ma'am, this is my son.

68
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,270
He's the one who tried to kill you?

69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,870
The assassin is in prison.

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,750
He's called Ding.

71
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,800
He secretly infiltrated the armory

72
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,000
to steal classified documents.

73
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,230
Ding?

74
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,870
Are you looking for trouble?

75
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,800
He might have gotten
reliable information.

76
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,430
You mean we have a mole?

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,270
We should assume so.

78
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
Tell us,

79
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,950
who told you the information?

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,600
You colluding executioners!

81
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,360
Pah!

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,160
He hasn't told us who the mole is.

83
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,040
Why did you kill him?

84
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
He insulted me.

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,430
He also insulted me!

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm not like you.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,680
I hold grudges.

88
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,750
What's your husband's name?

89
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,720
What does he do?

90
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,750
My husband...

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,870
Should I call you Ruruo,

92
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,870
or Yue?

93
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,560
The assassin is in the prison.

94
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,830
You go deal with it.

95
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Okay.

96
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,360
(Since he mistook me,)

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,800
(I'll use him to save Muran.)

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
Ma'am,

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,390
you just met my husband,

100
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,030
Mr. Gu,

101
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,560
Gu Yanting.

102
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,870
We've been fighting lately,

103
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,310
so there was a little conflict

104
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
in the study.

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,520
Yanting,

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,800
why didn't you tell me in advance

107
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,480
that your wife will be here for the job?

108
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
Yanting.

109
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,470
Qi Yan,

110
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,480
you can't easily trust just anyone.

111
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,670
Yanting,

112
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
isn't she your wife?

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,160
My taste isn't so poor

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,000
that I'd like such a heartless woman.

115
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,390
The Commander was just assassinated,

116
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,190
and now there's a woman
fabricating a story

117
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,310
to sneak into Xiao Mansion.

118
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,590
Guards,

119
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,040
put this unknown woman

120
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
in the prison

121
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,360
for further questioning.

122
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,360
She might be related to the assassination.

123
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,310
Move along now. Hear?

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,310
Put the kid too.

125
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,230
Yes, Ma'am.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,050
- Move.
- Let go of me!

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,480
You really aren't afraid of death.

128
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,160
Let go of me!

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,360
- Behave.
- What's going on?

130
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,600
She's disobedient.
I just give her a slap on the wrist.

131
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,430
Didn't you say she isn't your wife?

132
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,360
She's indeed my wife.

133
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,360
We've just had some arguments.

134
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,430
She's been spoiled in Ning City

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,750
and has become more defiant.

136
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,870
She just caused a scene upstairs.

137
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,680
It's all because you haven't come back
to visit me for so long.

138
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,270
Everyone leave.

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Yanting,

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,750
don't forget to go to the prison

142
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,910
and interrogate the assassin.

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Got it.

144
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,800
Come here,

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
son!

146
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,650
(Son.)

147
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,670
D...

148
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,870
Mom!

149
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,630
What's with that expression?

150
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,080
You scared our son.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Mr. Gu,

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,630
I dislike you,

153
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,750
but I still want to thank you.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Give it back to me.

155
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,960
Run! Run!

156
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
Murder!

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
Run!

158
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,030
Help!

159
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,910
(Tramcar Anren)

160
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,750
Murder!

161
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,000
- Move! Move!
- Don't push me!

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
Murder!

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,030
Seems like they came to kill you!

164
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,670
Who did you offend?

165
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
So many enemies,

166
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,360
how would I know which one?

167
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,210
Over there!

168
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,870
You are a dignified division commander,

169
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,030
stationed here
under the former warlord's orders,

170
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,480
and close with Commander Xiao.

171
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,240
Who dares to assassinate you so boldly?

172
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,200
What about you?

173
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,560
You intentionally approached Xiao Li.

174
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,960
What's your purpose?

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,790
I just want to find a job.

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,840
Finding a job requires me
to be your fake husband?

177
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,200
Where's your husband?

178
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,390
As long as I'm not dislike you,

179
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,390
I'll tell you.

180
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,240
Looks like

181
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,910
this ring is important to you.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,840
It's none of your business.

183
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,110
Where are you going?

184
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Don't follow me.

185
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,960
(Buao Alley)
Inform me

186
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,510
as long as the live one we captured
wakes up.

187
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,590
Understood.

188
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,540
Boss,

189
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,440
as for Jiang Ruruo you mentioned before,

190
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
what happened then?

191
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,480
Nothing to say about her.

192
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,790
So she really is the one...

193
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,750
Which one?

194
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,750
Who?

195
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,030
Boss,

196
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,790
do you think she can act that well?

197
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,120
If you didn't mistake her,

198
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,720
could it be she lost her memory?

199
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,270
Lost her memory?

200
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
Mr. Gu.

201
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Mr. Gu, you're finally back.

202
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,030
Mrs. Gu and your kid are waiting for you

203
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,480
at the door for a long time.

204
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I was just about

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,270
to bring them to you,

206
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,630
then we meet you.

207
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,630
What a coincidence!

208
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Dad!

209
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,550
Mr. Gu,

210
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,240
you finally brought Mrs. Gu over.

211
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,720
Your kid is really cute,

212
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,720
looks just like you.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,150
Exactly!

214
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
A happy family!

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
Mrs. Gu, you're a real beauty,

216
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,750
perfectly matched with Mr. Gu.

217
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,120
- Exactly.
- Mrs. Liu,

218
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,600
you forgot to do the laundry,
didn't you?

219
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,910
I'd forget if you hadn't reminded me.

220
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,870
Alright, I'm off.

221
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,360
Everyone about your business.

222
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
Don't delay Mr. Gu's

223
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,200
precious family reunion.

224
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,870
Sure, sure.

225
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,800
Okay, okay.

226
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,230
Well, Mrs. Gu,

227
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
I have a family matter.

228
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,750
I'm leaving.

229
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,160
I'll pick up the things later.

230
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,420
(Buao Alley)

231
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,440
There's nothing more I can do.

232
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,480
Leave here with your kid.

233
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,000
Now the whole neighborhood knows
I'm your wife.

234
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,390
That has quite an impact.

235
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
If you kick me out now,

236
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,790
Commander Xiao will surely find out

237
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,960
that we are deceiving him.

238
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Come on,

239
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,960
you have a husband and a kid,

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,320
but you still want to stay here.

241
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,150
Don't you have any shame?

242
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,440
In this world,

243
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,200
I just want to live well with my child.

244
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,140
