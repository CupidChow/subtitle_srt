Tianyao.

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,430
I'm all right.

27
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,710
I just find it

28
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,960
a little ticklish.

29
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,590
Do you want to know how it feels?

30
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,710
Get up now.

31
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,550
Come on, get up.

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,110
What did I tell you?

33
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,110
I wasn't lying, right?

34
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,670
You

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,360
look like you're in a good mood.

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,920
Why don't I teach you

37
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,550
how to absorb spiritual power?

It'll be all right.

Don't be scared.

42
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,750
You have such a broad mind's eye

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,710
even though you were just born.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,590
It was no wonder you had incredible skills.

No,

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,830
you're Tianyao.

58
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,230
I'm Yanhui.

No,

you're Tianyao.

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm Yanhui.

Look,

75
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,270
he's a quick learner.

76
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,320
Have you looked into

77
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,200
his mind's eye?

78
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,030
Yes.

79
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,640
It's vast and boundless.

80
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,560
I believe

81
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,790
he'll become the old Tianyao

82
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,710
in no time.

83
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,000
In no time.

84
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,030
Look,

85
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,320
he thinks so too.

86
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,710
That's great news.

87
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,680
What it is that's making you so happy?

88
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,120
We could hear you laughing

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
from outside.

90
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,350
Tianyao is getting better.

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,270
He is?

92
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,830
Getting better.

93
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,560
This is a happy occasion.

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,790
I have good news too.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,560
Father,

96
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,030
I'm going to marry

97
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,960
the Phantom Clan's Queen.

98
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,080
See this?

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,790
This is the marriage contract

100
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,120
Mr. Yan wrote for me and Huan Xiaoyan.

101
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,270
Marriage contract?

102
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,910
We never

103
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,710
had this tradition in Qingqiu.

104
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,320
It's not a Qingqiu tradition.

105
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,200
I saw how Dragon King did it for Yanhui

106
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,230
during their wedding.

107
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,520
I thought it was great.

108
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,440
-It was great.
-It looks like

109
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
you're all grown up now.

110
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,270
Since you love each other,

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,790
I have no reasons to object.

112
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,830
It's a good thing.

113
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,880
It seems to me

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,120
we have two pieces of good news today.

115
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,350
Let me spill the beans.

116
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,830
It should be three pieces of good news.

117
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,120
I'm going

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,440
to be a father.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,150
I'm going

120
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,560
to be a father.

121
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,760
See how quickly he catches up?

122
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,030
I'm becoming a father,

123
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,030
not you.

124
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,910
You...

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
You're pregnant?

126
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,000
Not me.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
It's Xiange. Xiange is the one who's pregnant.

128
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,910
Of course, it's Xiange.

129
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,710
Xiange is pregnant.

130
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,520
I want to go and visit her.

131
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,640
Why don't we go together?

132
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,790
It's three pieces of good news at the same time.

133
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,710
This calls for a big celebration.

134
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Why don't we celebrate

135
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
at the new Wangyu Tower

136
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,790
Xiange and I opened?

137
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,640
Sure.

138
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,080
Father, then we'll...

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,000
Go ahead.

140
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Come on.

141
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,880
-Let's go.
-All right.

142
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,150
I'm really impressed

143
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,760
that you can move Wangyu Tower anywhere you want.

144
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,390
Hey, wait for me!

145
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,080
Don't run.

146
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,390
The situation in Qingqiu has stabilized.

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,030
We no longer

148
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,640
have to keep hiding anymore.

149
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,390
It's so beautiful.

150
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,910
So we decided to settle down here.

151
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,470
For you and Xiange,

152
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,830
it's after the storm comes the calm.

153
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,400
Miss Yan, that's not right.

154
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,560
Every single day I spent with Xiange

155
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,040
has been sweet.

156
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,750
Your joke is killing me.

157
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Who died?

158
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,990
Let's go.

159
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,680
I've never seen these patterns before.

160
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,040
These tables and chairs

161
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,960
were all made by skilled craftsmen
from Yongzhou.

162
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,080
Yongzhou?

163
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,320
Where is that?

164
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,080
Is it fun?

165
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,160
Yongzhou is my hometown.

166
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,510
It's a lively and bustling place

167
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,710
where business traders gather.

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,320
But now,

169
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,510
it's under the Guanghan Sect's control.

170
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,560
It's like a forbidden area now.

171
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
You can't eat first.

172
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,800
You have to wait for everyone

173
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
and eat using chopsticks.

174
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,230
Everyone?

175
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,750
Chopsticks?

176
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,870
Eat?

177
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,590
Yes.

178
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,560
My hometown

179
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,400
used to be lively too.

180
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
But now...

181
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,160
Don't be sad.

182
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,590
Qingqiu is also your home.

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Hometown?

184
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,560
What's hometown?

185
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,870
A hometown

186
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,160
is a place you miss

187
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,040
no matter where you are.

188
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,110
Tongluo Village

189
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,510
and Dragon Valley.

190
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,800
You should go and visit these places.

191
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,750
Go...

192
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,750
Go

193
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,230
and visit?

194
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,510
You

195
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,710
and me?

196
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,990
Together?

197
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,400
Of course.

198
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,280
Would you remember anything

199
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,710
if we go back?

200
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,400
What are you talking about?

201
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,080
Let me carry this.

202
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,630
You're pregnant.

203
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,110
How can you carry heavy things?

204
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,830
-Sit down.
-Everyone, please sit down.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,320
This wine

206
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,590
is a 500-year-old collection of mine.

207
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,470
It's really precious.

208
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,320
No matter how precious,
it's not as precious as you.

209
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,920
Feng Qianshuo is known to have a sharp tongue.

210
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,400
But ever since he met you,

211
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,440
he speaks in a gentle way now.

212
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,040
Of course.

213
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,590
Everyone,

214
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,510
I propose a toast.

215
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,440
We have come a long way

216
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,510
and experienced many hardships.

217
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,630
A happy gathering like tonight

218
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,680
is truly hard to come by.

219
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,200
We have fine drinks,

220
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
great friends,

221
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,920
and three pieces of good news.

222
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Why don't we

223
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,750
make three wishes?

224
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,440
What do you say?

225
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm fine with that.

226
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,230
Have you thought what to wish, Your Highness?

227
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,160
May I grow old

228
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
with the one I love.

229
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,320
It's good.

230
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,230
May you and the child be safe

231
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,710
on the day of the child's arrival.

232
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,230
Yanhui,

233
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,350
make the last wish.

234
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,110
May we have this moment in the future,

235
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,080
year after year.

236
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,710
Now that's what I call

237
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,750
a perfect wish.

238
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,830
Everyone, lift your cups.

239
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,280
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

240
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,040
A draw.

241
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,160
Yes, it is.

242
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,800
After Xuelin's passing,

243
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,510
no one has played with me in a long time.

244
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,800
Let alone playing

245
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,320
so immersed like this.

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,560
Actually, I'm not too surprised

247
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,230
that you came to see me.

248
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,680
But your willingness

249
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
to work with the Spirit Clan

250
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,040
is somewhat unexpected.

251
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,990
It's our duty as fellow beings

252
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,710
to jointly resist Dark Phantom.

253
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
If the Taoists

254
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,710
all think this way,

255
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,830
then the Taoists and Spirit clans

256
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
wouldn't have been at odds

257
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,280
for the past two years.

258
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,870
Speaking of which,

259
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,470
this item

260
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,560
belongs to Chenxing Mountain.

261
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,630
Xuelin intended to use this artifact

262
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,200
to absorb the dark aura

263
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,590
and go to seal Dark Phantom back then.

264
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,080
But she didn't expect him

265
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,230
to find an opportunity

266
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,320
to slip into Master Qingguang's body

267
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,160
while he was busy maintaining the formation.

268
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,630
I've already repaired

269
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,990
this geomantic compass.

270
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,230
So it's time to return it to its rightful owner.

271
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,510
I hope it can be of help

272
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,400
to Chenxing Mountain.

273
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,590
Thank you, Great Leader.

274
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,200
How fortunate, how fortunate.

275
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,160
It is indeed wonderful.

276
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,440
This alliance to fight the enemies

277
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,990
between the Taoist and Spirit clans
after a century.

278
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,110
Such a historical moment,

279
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,750
I'll record it in the annals of history

280
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,920
with my Eternal Fame Ink.

281
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,200
Don't you think

282
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,990
Mr. Yan's action is too solemn?

283
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,710
Mr. Yan

284
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,350
has always been this way.

285
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,750
Come on.

286
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,510
Just do it.

287
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:54,870
Great.

288
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,510
That's right.

289
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,920
(From now on,)

290
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,320
(you're my brother)

291
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,080
from different parents!

292
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,560
Drink up!

293
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,320
All right!

294
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,470
We're brothers after this drink.

295
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,560
Brothers.

296
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,560
(This rascal can hold his liquor)

297
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,200
(much better than before.)

298
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,040
You hatched from your egg not too long ago.

299
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,350
You're still a dragon baby.

300
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,870
You have to stop drinking already.

301
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,350
Don't worry.

302
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,830
My 500-year-old alcohol

303
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,990
doesn't harm the body.

304
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,800
-As you say.
-Besides,

305
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,830
we should enjoy the moment and not worry too much.

306
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,040
Just let him drink to his heart's content tonight.

307
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,800
Xiange,

308
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,230
is your baby

309
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,350
having a good time

310
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,630
like us?

311
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes.

312
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,470
How do you know?

313
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Can he talk?

314
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,590
Of course.

315
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,470
Do you want to hear it?

316
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,630
Let's go to my room.

317
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,510
All right.

318
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,630
Yanhui, join us.

319
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,440
All right.

320
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,320
Don't drink too much.

321
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,630
You...

322
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,630
Sit down.

323
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,230
Just sit down.

324
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,680
The ladies want to have their own time.

325
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,800
Why do you want to join them?

326
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,320
He's right.

327
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,960
Dragon King,

328
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,750
-a toast for you.
-Let's drink.

329
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,040
Can you hear it?

330
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,920
Yes, I can.

331
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,830
His heart is beating.

332
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,350
Yanhui,

333
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,400
do you want to hear it?

334
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,400
Yanhui,

335
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,470
come and hear it.

336
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,080
What's wrong?

337
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,680
What happened?

338
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,920
Are you hurt?

339
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,710
No.

340
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,710
It's nothing.

341
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,680
Do you want to tell me yourself
or do you want me to investigate it?

342
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,560
Pick one.

343
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,160
Do you know

344
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,830
that the dragon fire
and the dark aura are incompatible?

345
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,350
I've heard it from Great Leader before this.

346
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,590
Could this be...

347
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,590
Since I've become

348
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,510
the Lady of Dark Aura,

349
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,040
I would get burned by his dragon scent

350
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,750
from touching Tianyao every day.

351
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,200
I can't believe such a thing exists.

352
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,640
Then what will happen to you two after this?

353
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,510
It's all right.

354
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,960
It's enough

355
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,200
that Tianyao has awakened.

356
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,230
Let's not worry about the future now.

357
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,230
By the way,

358
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,360
I plan

359
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,070
to leave Qingqiu with him

360
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,200
and go to Tongluo Village tomorrow.

361
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,550
You haven't been settled down for long.

362
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,790
Why are you leaving so soon?

363
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,360
Tongluo Village

364
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,990
is where Tianyao and I met.

365
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,990
He

366
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,790
made a vow

367
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,880
to protect the village there.

368
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
Maybe taking him back there

369
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,360
might help him

370
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,230
regain his memories.

371
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,640
Tongluo Village

372
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,310
is within the Taoist realm.

373
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,640
Will they

374
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,230
accept you?

375
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,710
It doesn't matter if they accept us or not.

376
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,470
In any case,

377
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,270
I won't let them take advantage of us.

378
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,640
Whatever happens,

379
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
you must be careful.

380
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,160
Don't worry.

381
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,750
I know what to do.

382
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,550
Dragon... Dragon King,

383
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,750
do you know

384
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,960
how much Yanhui suffered?

385
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,790
Huan Xiaoyan told me

386
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,310
that Yanhui used to like you so much

387
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,070
that she confessed her feelings to you.

388
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,270
But

389
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,160
you stabbed her twice.

390
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,920
Stab?

391
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,880
Her twice?

392
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,960
But luckily,

393
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,840
she still forgave you in the end.

394
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,200
This time,

395
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,070
Yanhui pulled herself out

396
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,960
of the Obsidian River

397
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,880
to rescue you.

398
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,440
Do you know how frightening

399
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,510
the Obsidian River is?

400
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,790
But what did you do?

401
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,360
You hatched out of your egg.

402
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,590
But you don't remember a thing.

403
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,230
Yanhui has suffered too much.

404
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,840
He's right.

405
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,310
In the past,

406
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,120
you treated her so well.

407
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,400
You spent a fortune just to make her smile.

408
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,400
Yes, you did.

409
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,400
Look at you, looking like a fool.

410
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,990
You even spit fire at her?

411
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,360
If the old you

412
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,880
saw what you did,

413
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,120
you'd beat yourself to death.

414
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,680
Yes, beat yourself to death.

415
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,990
You must drink as a punishment.

416
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,270
Yes, drink as your punishment.

417
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,070
Drink up.

418
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,640
Drinking punishment.

419
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,030
I'd

420
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,990
beat myself to death?

421
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,200
I had a great night tonight.

422
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,360
I didn't expect you

423
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,920
to hold your liquor this well now.

424
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,070
Yanhui,

425
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,880
what

426
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,990
was I like

427
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,960
before?

428
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,510
Before this?

429
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,510
It's a long story.

430
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,680
In the past,

431
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,750
you were

432
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,400
full of lies.

433
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,790
Me?

434
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,960
A liar?

435
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,790
Then...

436
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,550
Then,

437
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,600
did I hurt you?

438
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,550
Yes, you did.

439
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,840
You hurt me not only once.

440
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,510
So,

441
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,510
was I

442
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,470
a bad person?

443
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,470
It's not what you think.

444
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,120
You were lashing at the world

445
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,440
after you were hurt.

446
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,510
This time,

447
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll definitely protect you.

448
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,790
I won't let you get hurt again.

449
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,310
So you no longer

450
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
need to walk on thin ice anymore.

451
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,470
Have some.

452
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,750
Tongluo Village

453
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,920
is the place

454
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,960
where we first met.

455
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,310
At the time,

456
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,200
your name was Fu.

457
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,400
I was tied up...

458
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,070
Fu...

459
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,920
and thrown into the woodshed.

460
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
You came to deliver me mantou

461
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,550
and

462
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,120
I ended up biting you.

463
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,070
Tied up?

464
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Woodshed?

465
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,640
Why did I

466
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,680
only bring you mantou?

467
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,160
Why didn't I

468
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,310
untie you?

469
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,310
How are you going to eat mantou
if I don't untie you?

470
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,990
None of that matters.

471
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,990
In any case,

472
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,030
Tongluo Village is a beautiful place,

473
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,300
nestled by mountains and water.

474
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,120
It's a wonderful place.

475
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,440
In the village,

476
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,070
we also have many...

477
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,990
You could say happy memories.

478
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,550
When you return,

479
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,440
perhaps

480
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
you'll clear all your doubts

481
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,640
about the past yourself.

482
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,600
It's the first place I met you.

483
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm sure I'll like it.

484
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,120
Lingxiao?

485
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,680
What's wrong?

486
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,570
He hit me before.

487
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,570
I don't like him.

488
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,570
What are you doing here?

489
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,010
I brought some fruits

490
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,700
for your journey.

491
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,570
No need.

492
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,090
I know you're leaving Qingqiu

493
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,660
and heading into the Taoist territory.

494
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,570
I've discussed with the Great Leader Chenyi

495
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,140
that I'll protect you along the way.

496
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,220
No, thanks.

497
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,460
Your safety concerns

498
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,250
both the Taoist and Spirit clans.

499
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,460
I can protect myself and Tianyao.

500
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,940
I can protect myself and Yanhui.

501
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,940
Let's go.

502
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,980
When did this

503
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,180
happen to you?

504
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,490
Since when?

505
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,140
Since the time I saved you.

506
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,940
Since you awakened,

507
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,290
it was also the time I lost everything.

508
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,220
Suying,

509
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,180
don't you remember?

510
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,860
This is the place

511
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,050
where I used

512
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,420
all of my cultivation

513
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,620
to wake you up.

514
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,140
And this is

515
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,380
how you're treating me?

516
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,810
You've harmed Guanghan Sect's disciples.

517
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,330
They're just a bunch of trash!

518
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
They're worthless!

519
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,220
What's the difference

520
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,250
between them and the monsters in the prison?

521
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,770
You're brainwashed by Dark Phantom.

522
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,220
My mind's eye had been destroyed.

523
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,620
I can no longer cultivate immortality.

524
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,810
He gave me power.

525
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,250
What is wrong with that?

526
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,140
Yanhui is still alive.

527
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,330
She has returned.

528
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,810
She has returned!

529
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,490
Only Dark Phantom

530
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,010
can help me become stronger.

531
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,220
So I'll have the chance to kill Yanhui!

532
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,530
I did it to kill Yanhui.

533
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,290
I did it to exterminate bad people
for the Taoist clans.

534
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,620
I will kill

535
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,420
Yanhui and the evil dragon.

536
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,010
But I can never tolerate

537
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,570
what you did with Dark Phantom.

538
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,860
You want to kill me?

539
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,660
You're going to kill me?

540
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,940
Why?

541
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,010
It was hard for me

542
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,660
to make my recovery until now.

543
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,380
No one can stop me!

544
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,860
Since young,

545
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,420
you're better than me.

546
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,570
People can only see you.

547
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,660
They'd call you, "Master Suying".

548
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,250
It wasn't easy

549
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,460
for me to gain

550
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,290
such a supreme technique.

551
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,290
Yet you want to deprive me of it.

552
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,570
Suying.

553
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,380
Suying.

554
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
Suying.

555
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,090
You're my only family.

556
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,530
I can't let the dark aura

557
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,220
ruin you.

558
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,980
Do you understand?

559
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,770
Suying,

560
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,050
I rather

561
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,940
not have you as my sister

562
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,660
in my life.

563
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,570
Today,

564
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,010
I'll teach you Jingming Chant.

565
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,090
Jingming Chant?

566
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,770
This technique is the fundamental practice

567
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,700
of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

568
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,380
Countless techniques
of the Taoist and Spirit clans

569
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,730
have evolved from it.

570
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,980
Just like

571
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,220
the Three Character Classic you studied.

572
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,220
Tianyao,

573
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,620
you're a spiritual dragon.

574
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,570
Your mind's eye is vast and boundless.

575
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,810
You would be able to master it quickly.

576
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,770
"The tangible is born from the intangible,
the powerless gives birth to the powerful."

577
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,530
"The tangible is born from the intangible,
the powerless gives birth to the powerful."

578
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,010
"To bring existence to nothing
and returns to nothingness."

579
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,090
"To bring existence to nothing
and returns to nothingness."

580
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,180
(I...)

581
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,090
(I hope I didn't teach him anything wrong.)

582
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:50,900
After that?

583
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,490
After that...

584
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,810
"Perception is shaped by our mental states.

585
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,980
The realization of emptiness,
and emptiness isn't empty.

586
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,140
Empty is as empty does."

587
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,330
"Emptiness..."

588
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,420
"Emptiness..."

589
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,180
"The realization of emptiness,
and emptiness isn't empty.

590
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
Empty is as empty does."

591
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,090
So?

592
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,010
Do you feel a slight warmth

593
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,050
in your dantian

594
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,010
and wisps of spiritual energy

595
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,330
gathering in your mind's eye?

596
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,620
I can feel it.

597
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,730
Is it

598
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,220
this growling feeling?

599
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,380
No.

600
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,980
That's the sound your stomach makes
when you're hungry.

601
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,460
Forget it.

602
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,460
That's all for this morning's class.

603
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:43,620
Did...

604
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,770
Did I not do well?

605
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,700
Of course not.

606
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,180
Your progress these days

607
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,380
is faster than my ten years of cultivation

608
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,770
at Chenxing Mountain.

609
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,730
Chenxing Mountain?

610
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,490
Have you stayed in Chenxing Mountain?

611
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,570
Then... you...

612
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
What's your relationship

613
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,490
with him?

614
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,050
He

615
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,770
was my master.

616
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,620
But we have no relations with each other anymore.

617
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,050
Chenxing Mountain?

618
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,660
Master.

619
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,900
Whip!

620
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,620
He was the one who whipped you.

621
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,010
Tianyao,

622
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,220
let it go.

623
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,570
Yanhui, don't stop me.

624
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:46,980
Just forget it.

625
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,490
But he whipped you.

626
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:47,980
Tianyao.

627
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,250
Tianyao, calm down.

628
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:49,980
Tianyao, don't act impulsively.

629
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,140
I want to avenge you, Yanhui.

630
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,730
Forget it.

631
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,090
He doesn't want

632
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,290
to argue with us.

633
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,290
You said

634
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,900
we should seek revenge and redress grievances.

635
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,380
Why...

636
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,980
Why are you protecting him?

637
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,660
He's not a bad person.

638
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,530
He hit me,

639
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,660
and he even whipped you.

640
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,180
He's a bad person.

641
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,420
Even so,

642
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,420
he's not a bad person.

643
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,820
It's not easy

644
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,610
to differentiate

645
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,040
between good and bad.

646
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:30,780
I don't want you

647
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,520
to speak up for him anymore.

648
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,050
Don't look

649
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,170
in the direction he left.

650
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,460
Just look at me.

651
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,300
Are you

652
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,460
jealous?

653
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,010
He

654
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,780
was only my master.

655
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,050
Master?

656
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,170
What's a master?

657
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,570
A master

658
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,020
is someone who taught you to speak and read,

659
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,420
and a person
who practices martial arts techniques.

660
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,500
Then are you my master now?

661
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,690
I'm your wife.

662
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,130
Wife?

663
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,570
Then what's the difference

664
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,050
between a wife and a master?

665
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,650
Master

666
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,690
is family.

667
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,500
A wife

668
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,980
is a lover.

669
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,250
Then you're my master

670
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,250
and also my wife.

671
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,650
That means

672
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,050
you're someone who's both close and beloved to me.

673
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,340
What's the matter?

674
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,210
Tianyao,

675
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,530
you must not say such things

676
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,860
to anyone else

677
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,380
when you're out there.

678
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,500
I won't.

679
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,820
Other than you,

680
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,500
no one else

681
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,610
is both close and beloved to me.

682
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,900
Let's get going.

683
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,380
Come on.

684
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,460
Master Lingxiao,

685
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,340
you deliberately chose a route

686
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,340
where there's less patrol

687
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,860
by the Taoist and Spirit clans

688
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,130
to help your beloved disciple cross the river.

689
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,380
You even want us

690
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,090
to get things ready in advance too.

691
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,090
You truly dote on her.

692
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,500
Thank you for the favor.

693
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,500
They're coming.

694
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,690
You're here.

695
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,460
Since everyone is here,

696
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,650
you can cross the river now.

697
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,020
Thank you for preparing the raft for us.

698
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,170
I'm afraid

699
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,020
it's a bit too crowded with three people.

700
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,020
Are you being picky here?

701
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:06,940
No.

702
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,530
It's just

703
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,900
that it doesn't have to be crowded.

704
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,250
Let's go.

705
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,130
Come on.

706
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,570
I guess my job is done here.

707
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,980
Master Lingxiao,

708
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,340
it seemed

709
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,820
sending your disciple on her journey wasn't easy.

710
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,020
Well,

711
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,210
you didn't manage to see her off in the end.

712
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,090
Mr. Yan,

713
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,980
that was too much.

714
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,570
Not at all.

715
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,020
Yanhui,

716
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,690
hurry!

717
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,980
Walk faster!

718
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,610
Be careful or you'll trip.

719
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,730
Yanhui, look!

720
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,500
Over there!

721
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,650
It's beautiful.

722
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,500
Come on!

723
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,170
Let's go.

724
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,300
Why are you so happy today?

725
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,650
Of course, I'm happy

726
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:32,610
because we got rid
of someone we don't want to see.

727
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,500
Let's go.

728
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,130
I'm fine.

729
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,420
Today,

730
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,340
I'll walk on this side.

731
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,780
Your...

732
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,020
Your hand

733
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,170
is hurt.

734
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,690
Probably the road was too slippery yesterday,

735
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,980
so I accidentally fell.

736
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,610
Let's go.

737
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,900
When we were together yesterday,

738
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,130
I was holding your hand tightly.

739
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,940
Maybe I burned it

740
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,610
while roasting the chicken last night.

741
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,900
It's okay.

742
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,090
Look at me, I'm so skilled.

743
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:13,780
See?

744
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,980
That's amazing.

745
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,690
If you don't hurry,

746
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,500
the person you dislike

747
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,300
will catch up to us soon.

748
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,980
We should walk faster then.

749
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,940
Let's go.
