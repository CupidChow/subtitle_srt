00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,020
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,940
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,339
His Highness has arrived.

4
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,180
Second Uncle!

5
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,860
Second Uncle.

6
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,500
Second Uncle, I've returned.

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,180
Zhuli?

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,500
You're finally back.

9
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,060
You're much buffer now.

10
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,700
How is it?

11
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,619
(The palace of Qingqiu)

12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,220
(is pretty grand.)

13
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,420
What have you encountered?

14
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,780
I've done a lot of things

15
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,780
during my trip.

16
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,100
Hurry and tell me about them.

17
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,180
You'd been to Qingqiu many times before this.

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,620
Have you seen this "Second Uncle" before?

19
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,659
I went to many places.

20
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,180
I think so.

21
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,260
I saw many new and interesting things.

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,180
I even blew up three of Guanghan Sect's hill branches

23
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,300
and avenged my sister.

24
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,620
What?

25
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,500
You blew up their sect branches?

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,500
Zhuli,

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
how could you be so reckless?

28
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,219
I was avenging my sister.

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,140
How was I reckless?

30
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,180
Forget it.

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,860
Let me introduce them to you.

32
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,659
This is Yanhui, a former disciple

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,300
of Chenxing Mountain.

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,219
This is Bai Xiaosheng, a shadow spirit.

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,380
I got to know them on my way back.

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,580
Greetings.

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,500
Nice to meet you two.

38
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,540
Why are you bowing to him? He's blind.

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,380
Sorry about that.

40
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,620
He's uneducated.

41
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:01,659
That was quite rude of him.

42
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,380
Sorry about that.

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,740
It doesn't matter.

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,060
These are just empty forms.

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,060
By the way,

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,180
I've asked my men

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,980
to bring Tianyao to his chamber.

48
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,300
You guys don't need to worry.

49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,820
I'll catch up with him later.

50
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,220
Second Uncle,

51
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,580
you actually know the Dragon King?

52
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,700
We were once best friends.

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,900
Speaking of which,

54
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,820
it's been a long time

55
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,700
since we saw each other.

56
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,380
Zhuli,

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,460
why don't you

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,019
show our guests

59
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,700
around the palace for now?

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,899
Tonight, I'll instruct my men

61
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,860
to prepare

62
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,180
a grand welcoming feast for them.

63
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,420
Yes, Second Uncle.

64
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,780
Let's go.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,940
Farewell.

66
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,260
Let's go.

67
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,700
I never expected them

68
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,340
to know each other.

69
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,660
What's with that expression?

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,060
I was just amazed

71
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,820
that the dragon actually had a friend.

72
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,780
Don't you guys feel

73
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780
that today's especially quiet?

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,099
Where's the talkative

75
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,900
phantom spirit?

76
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,940
A ghost!

77
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,779
You're the ghost here. You're a short-legged ghost.

78
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,460
You're so noisy.

79
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,100
You...

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,420
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,539
You guys were entering the palace of Qingqiu.

82
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,300
I'm the Phantom Queen.

83
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,419
Don't tell me

84
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,380
you want me to bow to the Regent of Qingqiu?

85
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,380
Wait.

86
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,660
What were you doing in my belt?

87
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,500
It's because

88
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,820
I didn't dare to hide inside the Dragon King's belt.

89
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,179
I'm definitely safe hiding inside your belt

90
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,460
as no one would search your body.

91
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,300
You're pretty clear about that, huh?

92
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,620
Since we've already arrived at the palace of Qingqiu,

93
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,940
I need to start

94
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,180
looking for the visual spell master.

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,140
What's the matter?

96
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,460
In the palace of Qingqiu,

97
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,420
no one is allowed to mention

98
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,660
any dark practitioners like them.

99
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,980
Why can't I mention them?

100
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,740
I'll mention them.

101
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,019
A visual spell is cast

102
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,900
based on the dark aura.

103
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,339
My mother had always been trying

104
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,380
-to find a way to dispel the dark aura. -Is that true?

105
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,020
But you guys are looking for visual spell masters

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,300
right after arriving in Qingqiu.

107
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,820
Why are you looking for him?

108
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,820
To seek revenge.

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,659
You're the Crown Prince of Qingqiu,

110
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,459
yet you're afraid to mention that term.

111
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,300
Your mother worked hard her entire life

112
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,500
to dispel the dark aura.

113
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,340
Look at what you're doing.

114
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,660
I...

115
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:14,059
Even if you're afraid, I'm not.

116
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,940
I'll look for him myself.

117
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,780
Wait!

118
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,219
My geomantic compass

119
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,300
could be of use to you!

120
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,900
Since they have left,

121
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,300
we don't need to entertain them.

122
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:26,660
Let's go.

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,260
I'll bring you to find the secret treasure of Qingqiu.

124
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,900
I thought the secret treasure of Qingqiu was missing?

125
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,700
Why did you think

126
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,180
it went missing then?

127
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,140
I never expected us to meet again

128
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,540
since bidding farewell 20 years ago.

129
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,580
Changlan, how have you been doing

130
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,980
all these years?

131
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
I'm just barely surviving.

132
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,780
But I heard

133
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,899
that you sealed Suying away in Guanghan Sect.

134
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,420
Was that true?

135
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,940
Congratulations.

136
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
You finally avenged your clan.

137
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,460
There's nothing to congratulate.

138
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,060
This isn't something worth celebrating.

139
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,020
Now,

140
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,620
I can finally let go of the past.

141
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,580
But I

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,140
did something wrong.

143
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,300
You did something wrong?

144
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,540
In order to seek revenge,

145
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,580
I made another person suffer the consequences.

146
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,980
Another person?

147
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,260
It was the Taoist lady

148
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,940
that Zhuli mentioned to you.

149
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,740
So, you came to Qingqiu

150
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,100
for that lady's sake?

151
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,619
If you need anything,

152
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,820
I can help you out.

153
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,860
Her body is acting abnormally.

154
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,539
I came to Qingqiu

155
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,700
to seek a cure for her.

156
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,300
If it's a treatment you're seeking,

157
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,020
we have Physician Pufang with us.

158
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,820
She should be able to help.

159
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,260
No, thanks.

160
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,820
Her condition

161
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,020
is quite unique.

162
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,460
Tianyao,

163
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,420
why don't you stay in Qingqiu for now?

164
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,620
Although

165
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:03,780
I can't be of use right now,

166
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,100
I can still

167
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
chat with you

168
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,580
and come up with ideas for you.

169
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,940
Maybe I can help you

170
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,060
acquire Miss Yan's forgiveness.

171
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,660
I just hope that her condition can be cured.

172
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,100
I dare not desire anything else.

173
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,780
Even after so many years,

174
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,780
you're still the same.

175
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,980
By the way,

176
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,100
there's a book here

177
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,220
called Ghostly Eulogy.

178
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,460
The methods in the book

179
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,060
might be able to cure her.

180
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,140
Do you know

181
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,580
where the book is?

182
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,140
(That book)

183
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,420
(had always been kept)

184
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
(behind a screen.)

185
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,900
(It's waiting for its owner to retrieve it.)

186
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,180
(It's a shame)

187
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,060
that the screen disappeared

188
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,540
over a decade ago.

189
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,500
We still don't know

190
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,260
where it is even now.

191
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,980
We're here.

192
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,580
You actually hid the secret treasure of Qingqiu

193
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,220
inside this tree hole?

194
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,540
It's so near to Qingqiu Palace.

195
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,219
You actually committed a crime

196
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,500
under their nose.

197
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,100
You're truly

198
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,819
bold and skillful.

199
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,740
But don't worry.

200
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,179
This tree hole is connected

201
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,060
to my shadow cave.

202
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,500
No one will be able to dispel this formation.

203
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,540
Let's go.

204
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,300
It's so dark in here.

205
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,580
I can't see anything.

206
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,980
Why didn't you bring a candle with you?

207
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,300
Yanhui,

208
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,820
don't be scared.

209
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,180
Hold my hand.

210
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,180
I'll lead you there.

211
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,260
Who's there?

212
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,659
Why didn't you light them up

213
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,820
when you could light them in the first place?

214
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,900
Your hair.

215
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,620
-I forgot -Done.

216
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:21,740
That I could light them up.

217
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Is this

218
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:29,860
the screen you mentioned?

219
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,700
"Sailing on a boat under the moonlight,

220
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,500
as if visiting a friend under the mountain snow."

221
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,420
So, this screen belongs to Xuelin too?

222
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,420
The Ghostly Eulogy we're looking for

223
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,060
is inside.

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,900
What's the secret behind this screen?

225
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,740
Let me introduce it to you.

226
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,619
These three screens

227
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,980
represent three disruption techniques.

228
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,380
It requires a pair of Taoist-spirit couple

229
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,580
to solve them one by one.

230
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,180
It's a shame

231
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,619
that the couples I brought back

232
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,699
couldn't even solve

233
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,620
the first test.

234
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,379
That's why I have no idea

235
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,020
what we need to do

236
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:13,140
for the other two tests.

237
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,220
So, what's the first test?

238
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,660
Actually,

239
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:18,740
it isn't that complicated.

240
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,180
We just need to answer a question.

241
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,900
Answer a question?

242
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,299
What is this?

243
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,900
This is

244
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,780
a guide I made myself.

245
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,579
All questions

246
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,820
that the previous couples had

247
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,100
are in this guide.

248
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,300
What's the pet name of your male partner?

249
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,700
What's the favorite tea of your female partner?

250
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,340
How many moles are on your male partner's sole?

251
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,860
What color are they?

252
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,380
What kinds of questions are these?

253
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,100
There are so many of them.

254
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,739
How many couples

255
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,700
have you brought here?

256
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
There were too many. I lost count.

257
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,579
Anyway, I've been doing this

258
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,860
more than 10 years ago.

259
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:01,940
If so,

260
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,540
since you've tried it so many times,

261
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,819
I assume you can predict

262
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,019
the answers to the questions, right?

263
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,339
What's the use of that?

264
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,900
It requires both parties to answer correctly.

265
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,179
Say, where can I find

266
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,260
a ready couple?

267
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,780
I think we're the only ones left.

268
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,820
Bai Xiaosheng, you see,

269
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,340
you are

270
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,580
a spirit.

271
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,340
I am

272
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,300
a Taoist.

273
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,180
Although

274
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,460
we aren't a true couple,

275
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,139
I think we don't need a true couple

276
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,260
to solve the first test.

277
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,620
What do you mean?

278
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,500
You see,

279
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,780
you've already tried this so many times.

280
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,299
If we memorize

281
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,420
the questions and their answers

282
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
beforehand,

283
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,140
we might be able to solve them.

284
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,899
So, you wish

285
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,099
to cheat

286
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,780
to solve this test?

287
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,620
And you think

288
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,580
that it'll work?

289
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,460
Have you tried it before?

290
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,419
I've already tried all the things

291
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,700
you could think of.

292
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,460
In the past,

293
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,260
I brought a couple inside.

294
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,020
I brought a pair of sisters inside.

295
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,660
I brought a pair of brothers inside.

296
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,699
I even went inside

297
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,460
with another man while pretending to be a woman.

298
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,540
You made such a huge sacrifice?

299
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,260
It's a shame

300
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,900
that it didn't work.

301
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,620
But now,

302
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,219
that's our only way.

303
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,060
Doing something

304
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,540
is better than doing nothing at all, right?

305
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,460
Just listen to me.

306
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,500
Let's try and memorize

307
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,140
the questions and their answers.

308
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,420
Let's give it a try.

309
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,660
Why are you staring at me?

310
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,900
Stop staring at me.

311
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,980
Hurry and memorize them.

312
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,060
Let's hang in there for one more night!

313
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,259
Are you sure your geomantic compass

314
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,940
can help me locate the visual spell master?

315
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,700
I don't believe it.

316
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,740
Of course.

317
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,220
This artifact counters the dark aura.

318
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,900
If the visual spell master is nearby,

319
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,660
the geomantic compass

320
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,540
will definitely react to it.

321
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,820
Believe me, it's very useful.

322
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,659
But the geomantic compass

323
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,539
stopped reacting

324
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,900
after we left the wilderness.

325
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,259
Even the needle

326
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,140
isn't moving now.

327
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,820
Our Phantom Spirit Ring

328
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,580
only recognizes its owner.

329
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,900
Only its true owner

330
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,020
can summon

331
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:24,380
the power inside the ring.

332
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,580
Maybe

333
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,140
your compass is the same.

334
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,140
It doesn't recognize you as its owner.

335
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,179
I'm the only crown prince of Qingqiu.

336
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,259
I'm the lineal son of the King of Qingqiu.

337
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,100
How dare it not recognize me?

338
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,180
You have a point.

339
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,740
That means you don't know how to use it.

340
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,180
Nonsense!

341
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,700
If I must say,

342
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,500
I think the dark practitioner

343
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,340
you're looking for

344
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,660
isn't in Qingqiu.

345
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,220
Dragon King.

346
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,700
Dragon King.

347
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,260
-Dragon King -Great timing.

348
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,459
I heard that dragons

349
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,660
are the wisest beings on Earth.

350
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,820
Can you tell me why

351
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,100
my compass isn't working?

352
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,860
I don't understand

353
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,540
this artifact either.

354
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,180
What's with that stare and expression?

355
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,700
It doesn't matter.

356
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,180
Have you guys seen Yanhui around?

357
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,980
I couldn't find her.

358
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,660
She went back with Bai Xiaosheng.

359
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,899
They went to the courtyard

360
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,740
after crossing the drawbridge.

361
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,300
I wonder what they are busy with.

362
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,100
They are being so mysterious.

363
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,580
They even want me to keep it a secret.

364
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,020
Dragon King, but my compass...

365
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,539
Couldn't you tell

366
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,979
that the Dragon King is upset?

367
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,580
Dummy.

368
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,460
It's all because you said something you shouldn't.

369
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,660
Yanhui,

370
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,580
I guess that's all for today.

371
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,060
Let's continue tomorrow.

372
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,820
No.

373
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
We still have a long way to go.

374
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,700
I can still memorize some.

375
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,620
(What)

376
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,140
(are they doing?)

377
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,659
It's rare for you

378
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
to be this hardworking.

379
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,220
The Ghostly Eulogy is within our reach.

380
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,499
It concerns our lives.

381
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
How could I slack off?

382
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,460
Are you trying to die here?

383
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,860
You should memorize them too.

384
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,140
Fine, I'll do it.

385
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,500
(So, they know)

386
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,580
(where the Ghostly Eulogy is.)

387
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,060
How about this? I'll give you a test.

388
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,820
It can help you remember them.

389
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,700
Fine then. Bring it on.

390
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,579
What's

391
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,380
my favorite food?

392
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,020
How did you know

393
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:50,100
that I love baozi?

394
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,380
Baozi.

395
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,220
That's too easy.

396
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,819
Your favorite food

397
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,900
must be...

398
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,979
It's baozi!

399
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
It's baozi.

400
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,500
Hey, you spent so long memorizing them.

401
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,220
How could you not know this?

402
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,540
Next question.

403
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,939
I'll definitely get it right.

404
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,500
All right.

405
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,420
What's my dream?

406
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,220
Your dream?

407
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,819
I wish to lead a free

408
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,860
and successful life!

409
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,100
A free life.

410
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,299
A free

411
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,700
-and successful life! -And successful life!

412
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,060
I was going to say that.

413
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,579
Please memorize it

414
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,020
and copy it 100 times.

415
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,020
Memorize the answers by heart.

416
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,260
Baozi.

417
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,099
To spend money like water. A free...

418
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,980
A carefree life!

419
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,940
A carefree life. Got it.

420
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,579
Hey, what did you memorize

421
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,020
after

422
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:50,300
pulling an all-nighter then?

423
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,540
I feel sorry for these candles.

424
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,740
Their sacrifices were in vain.

425
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,420
Of course not.

426
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,660
It just so happens

427
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,420
that I didn't memorize the answers to the questions you ask.

428
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,220
What have you memorized then?

429
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,300
For example,

430
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,380
the most precious thing to you

431
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,460
is your life,

432
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,300
am I right?

433
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,780
You finally got one correct. That's right.

434
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,700
I told you I was memorizing them.

435
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,860
(Initially, she only wanted)

436
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,260
(to lead a peaceful life.)

437
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,019
(But I kept putting her)

438
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,940
(in danger.)

439
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,100
(I used her.)

440
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,380
(She was emotionally tortured by me.)

441
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,500
(I was a threat to her life.)

442
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,980
(I dragged her into the mess I was in.)

443
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,860
I've never done what Suying had done to you.

444
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,060
But you!

445
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,620
You're as evil as Suying herself!

446
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,020
(And regarding her most precious thing, )

447
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,780
(I actually...)

448
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:56,900
Please let me off.

449
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,420
I think it grew bigger.

450
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,140
It's been almost one month

451
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,660
since I saw the Lord of Dark Aura.

452
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,540
If I don't acquire the Ghostly Eulogy now,

453
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,340
even if I don't die, I'll lose my mind.

454
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,540
It's you?

455
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,300
It was just my hallucination.

456
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,380
I have to retrieve the Ghostly Eulogy soon.

457
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,660
I hope I can do it

458
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,540
tomorrow.

459
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,860
Who's there?

460
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,020
It's me.

461
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,860
What are you doing here?

462
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,900
Didn't we already make a pact?

463
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,060
Is the dark aura within your body

464
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,420
behaving erratically?

465
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,340
I know you're not willing to see me,

466
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,460
but this concerns your life.

467
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,020
Just listen to me.

468
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,939
To retrieve the Ghostly Eulogy,

469
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,220
we need two people who know each other well.

470
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,060
I can retrieve the Ghostly Eulogy with you.

471
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,780
You and I have been through a lot together.

472
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,180
When it comes to knowing each other,

473
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,700
I know you better than Bai Xiaosheng does.

474
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,900
No need for that.

475
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,300
I can't do it.

476
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,060
I'm still afraid of you.

477
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,940
Just ignore me.

478
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,540
I'll retrieve it myself.

479
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,300
I'll try my best to suppress the dark aura.

480
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,780
As for the Ghostly Eulogy,

481
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,820
Bai Xiaosheng and I will think of something.

482
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,580
You should go back.

483
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,540
Hurry and leave.

484
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,460
You...

485
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,220
Your favorite color is white.

486
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,620
Your favorite food

487
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,740
is apple.

488
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:17,860
Yanhui.

489
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,540
You hate it

490
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,460
when people call you Sheng.

491
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,140
Did you call me just now?

492
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,060
This is the first time

493
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,699
someone's trying this hard

494
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,820
to remember what I like.

495
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,539
How could you be so laid-back?

496
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,140
Why are you so anxious?

497
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,460
I've never passed my tests

498
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:42,820
in Chenxing Mountain with flying colors.

499
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,740
This time,

500
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,100
this test is related to our survival.

501
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,260
I'm nervous.

502
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,500
You should hurry and memorize them.

503
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:48,660
Don't forget them later.

504
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,260
I don't need to do any revisions.

505
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,380
It's all in my heart.

506
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,260
Can you speak decently for once?

507
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,100
Bai Xiaosheng

508
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,780
likes...

509
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:03,620
I'm not fooling around.

510
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,940
Don't forget.

511
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,099
Later, we need to pretend

512
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,500
to be a couple.

513
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,340
Give it a try.

514
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,380
Try and get into the mood.

515
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,340
I'm forgetting them already.

516
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,940
Can we hurry up and solve the test?

517
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,260
Okay.

518
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,540
Let's go.

519
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,220
We should

520
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,140
leave this here.

521
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
The old man inside

522
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,260
is a tough nut to crack.

523
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,260
(Treatise On Febrile Disease Caused By Cold)

524
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:56,940
Here.

525
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,940
(Yan Buhuo, Qingqiu)

526
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,339
We meet again.

527
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,740
The shadow spirit, Bai Xiaosheng,

528
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,460
and the Taoist of Chenxing Mountain, Yanhui,

529
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,180
are here to seek guidance.

530
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,500
It's you again.

531
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,780
You haven't given up yet?

532
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,219
How could I give up

533
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,340
when you're still alive?

534
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,100
What's with the spiteful words?

535
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,460
I've been

536
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,420
stopping you for several decades.

537
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,619
I exposed your so-called "couples"

538
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,780
every time you brought them here.

539
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,100
It's natural for him

540
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,140
to be spiteful.

541
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,739
You came here together with him.

542
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,899
Are you

543
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,740
his so-called fake lover?

544
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,540
We're a true couple.

545
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,700
We have a stable relationship.

546
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,700
This girl from Chenxing Mountain

547
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,939
does look a little better

548
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,379
than the women you brought

549
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,500
just to make up the number.

550
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,100
All right.

551
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
As per usual,

552
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,939
I will ask you guys three questions.

553
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,899
You two have to answer them at the same time

554
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,140
with the same answers.

555
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,659
Only then will you pass the test.

556
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,140
Bring it on.

557
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,859
What's your male partner's

558
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,540
favorite food?

559
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,820
(We memorized this before.)

560
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,500
-Apple. -Apple.

561
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
Next question.

562
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,579
What's the most precious thing to your female partner?

563
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,380
(We memorized this too.)

564
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,620
-Life. -Life.

565
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,059
Who will you save if your lover and kin fell into the water

566
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,900
at the same time?

567
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,780
(This is bad.)

568
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,300
(We haven't memorized that before.)

569
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,340
I'll count to three.

570
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,940
(Love has always been unreliable.)

571
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,900
(The person you love)

572
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,060
(will stab you in the heart anyway.)

573
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,100
(I don't need to save my lover.)

574
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,779
(Bai Xiaosheng has been searching for the right couple)

575
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,580
(for many years without any result.)

576
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,380
(I'm sure he's thinking the same.)

577
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,580
Three.

578
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,140
(The person who gave birth to me hurt me the most.)

579
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,540
(Whether my kin is alive or not doesn't matter to me.)

580
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,100
(Yanhui never mentioned her kin)

581
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,940
(to me before.)

582
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,820
(I'm sure she's thinking the same as me.)

583
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,140
Two.

584
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,500
One.

585
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,060
-Kin. -Lover.

586
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,220
Why did you say kin?

587
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:35,540
Why did you say lover?

588
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,179
A couple, huh?

589
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,340
I don't think you two

590
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,139
are a couple.

591
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,339
You two are a couple of thieves

592
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,980
that want to steal the secret treasure.

593
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,939
You wish to get your hands on the sacred treasure

594
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,700
with a selfish desire?

595
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,820
In your dreams!

596
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,499
Who will you save if your lover and kin fell into the water

597
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,260
at the same time?

598
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Even now, I don't understand.

599
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,660
You'd never said

600
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,420
that you liked anyone

601
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,820
ever since I knew you.

602
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,820
But when we were in the Dragon Valley,

603
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,540
you did have

604
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,340
a sorrowful look on your face

605
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,780
when you mentioned the massacre of the Shadow Clan.

606
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,900
Why would you choose to save your lover?

607
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,420
Did you know

608
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,060
how I ended up

609
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,340
in the hands of Lord of Dark Aura in the first place?

610
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,020
When I was still a child,

611
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,780
for some reason,

612
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,300
my clan members called me the evil child.

613
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,420
(Bai Xiaosheng)

614
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:47,259
is the evil child

615
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,100
stated in the prophecy.

616
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,060
We must offer him as a sacrifice to our lord

617
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,139
so that calamity won't befall the Shadow Clan.

618
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,060
You little lowlife!

619
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,300
(My clan members cast me away.)

620
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,340
(My mother was the one)

621
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,660
(who offered me to him.)

622
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,059
Since then,

623
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,500
I've never been at peace.

624
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,300
I was sorrowful

625
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,220
not because of my clan.

626
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,260
I just felt sorry for myself.

627
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,860
Sorry about that.

628
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,300
I had no idea.

629
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,740
It was a long time ago.

630
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,700
We should focus on the present.

631
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,219
Our failure

632
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,379
will definitely make that old man

633
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,140
keep his guard up.

634
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,260
Next time, the questions

635
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,620
he asks will be more difficult.

636
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,619
The Ghostly Eulogy is right in front of us,

637
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,380
yet we can't get it.

638
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,140
This is

639
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:45,660
so infuriating.

640
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,220
Let's go.

641
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,140
This is so infuriating.

642
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,660
(Bai Xiaosheng and Yanhui)

643
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,540
(don't know each other well enough indeed.)

644
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Tianyao, you're here.

645
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
Dragon King.

646
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,420
Someone can finally tend to him for me.

647
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,820
You may go first.

648
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,740
Tianyao,

649
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,500
do you need anything?

650
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,140
Is there

651
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,820
anywhere fun

652
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,980
or interesting in Qingqiu?

653
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,980
What's the matter?

654
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,260
Has that lady forgiven you?

655
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,220
She already found her lover.

656
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,420
What?

657
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,100
I'm here to inquire about this on her behalf.

658
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,540
Are you trying

659
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:50,620
to be her matchmaker here?

660
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,260
I'm willing to sacrifice everything

661
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,860
as long as I can save her.

662
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,379
So,

663
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,700
what brings you here?

664
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,819
Yanhui and I enjoyed ourselves thoroughly

665
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,660
in the past few days.

666
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,700
Did you guys manage to retrieve the Ghostly Eulogy then?

667
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,580
Don't act tough in front of me.

668
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,100
If you and Yanhui wish to know each other well

669
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,180
and acquire the Ghostly Eulogy,

670
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,260
you two

671
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,220
must follow

672
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:36,460
my instructions.

673
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,980
There's no shortcut.

674
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,460
I must try my best

675
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,500
to know Bai Xiaosheng

676
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,420
to stand a chance

677
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,300
at acquiring the Ghostly Eulogy.

678
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,620
You're awake already?

679
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,260
What's the matter?

680
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,940
I thought about it the entire night.

681
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I want to become

682
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,740
a true couple with you.

683
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,540
Tell me.

684
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,580
What are the steps I need to follow?

685
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:15,780
You...

686
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,300
You mean the real kind of couple?

687
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,459
So, are you saying

688
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,539
that you want to become

689
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,860
my closest kin?

690
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,460
I guess so.

691
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,099
I know it's a bit sudden...

692
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,020
(Couple Trial) I have a checklist here.

693
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,420
You can refer to it.

694
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,300
(Tianyao, Yanhui)

695
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,380
(Couple Trial)

696
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,220
There are some steps written on it.

697
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,180
(Beauty, Aesthetic, Looks) Take a look.

698
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:51,780
(Virtue, Loyalty, Trust)

699
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,660
(Love, Holding Hands, Hugs, Kisses, Consummate) Let's

700
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,540
(Strength, Stamina, Intelligence, Wealth) follow the steps.

701
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,860
Is that okay with you?

702
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,260
Okay.

703
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,420
Let's find a place and start.

704
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,540
Miss, take a look.

705
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,540
Are you regretting your decision?

706
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,180
Fresh flowers for sale!

707
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,539
Fresh flowers for sale!

708
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,380
Regret what?

709
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,460
Regret being a couple with me.

710
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,900
I've never said anything like that

711
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:24,420
on our way here.

712
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,540
It's because

713
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,820
you didn't say anything at all.

714
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,179
Don't tell me you still have feelings for Tianyao...

715
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
No way.

716
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,500
I was just thinking about

717
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,380
how we could

718
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:37,500
become a true couple.

719
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,260
It was stated

720
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
on the scroll, right?

721
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,980
You and I are compatible with each other in terms of looks

722
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,740
and intelligence.

723
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,900
The only thing that's left

724
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,860
is to hold hands, give hugs,

725
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,180
and...

726
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,140
Which one do you want to try first?

727
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,300
What about holding hands?

728
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,300
Holding hands?

729
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,860
Something feels off.

730
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,740
I guess so.

731
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,780
Before this, Tianyao said...

732
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,700
Forget it. Let's not bring him up.

733
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,820
When we were in the Dragon Valley,

734
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,580
you said we must cultivate an atmosphere for everything we do.

735
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,420
Let's try to cultivate the atmosphere here.

736
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,539
I think you're right.

737
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,979
Since you're a creative person,

738
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,260
why don't you try and think of something?

739
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,380
We'll try them out one by one.

740
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,700
(It's easy to make her happy.)

741
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,220
Just bring her out

742
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:47,380
and buy her favorite food for her.

743
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,660
Here.

744
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,580
Let me feed you.

745
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:59,300
It's your favorite food.

746
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,140
What are you doing?

747
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,300
This is called playing hard to get.

748
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,900
What do you think?

749
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,060
Did you feel your heart

750
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,979
beating rapidly?

751
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,339
No. It's pretty annoying.

752
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,020
What are you doing?

753
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,900
What about this?

754
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:17,220
Why don't we take a bite together?

755
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,419
Don't all loving couples

756
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,300
do that?

757
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,940
Come on.

758
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,700
Give it a try.

759
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,820
Let's give it a try.

760
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,300
You can have it alone!

761
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,820
(She likes money.)

762
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,020
Just give her money.

763
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,260
Isn't it boring to give her money directly?

764
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,499
I'm going to show her

765
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,860
how good it feels to make money.

766
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:36,860
Come!

767
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:37,899
Place your bets!

768
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,780
Big!

769
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,460
Small!

770
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,340
Open it!

771
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,020
Six, six, one. Big!

772
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,500
Place your bets!

773
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,060
Small!

774
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,620
Big!

775
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,100
Six, six, five. Big!

776
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,420
One, one, three. Small!

777
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,579
I finally understand

778
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,940
the happiness of being rich.

779
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,620
I'm glad that you're happy.

780
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,380
Aren't you happy?

781
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,500
If you're not,

782
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,180
I can share some of it with you.

783
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,500
You can have half of it.

784
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,540
What's the matter?

785
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,300
Where are you going?

786
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,220
I'll give you more.

787
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,900
She loses whenever she gambles.

788
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,180
What are you doing here again?

789
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,140
I told you to give her money,

790
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:24,460
but you brought her to the gambling den.

791
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,220
Are you here to mock me?

792
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,100
It's normal for her to be angry

793
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,980
since you won all of her money.

794
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,179
So, you came here

795
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,899
to mock her

796
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,580
after mocking me?

797
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
I just wish to help her.

798
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,779
Although

799
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,980
you're a heartless person,

800
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,019
at least

801
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,500
you do understand her to a certain degree.

802
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,900
After all, you were

803
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,020
the chosen one.

804
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,900
Fine then.

805
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,139
I'll bite the bullet

806
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:56,700
and take

807
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:56,738
another suggestion from you. and take

808
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,980
another suggestion from you.

809
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,220
Do you have any other suggestions?

810
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,900
What does she like?

811
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,180
What are you doing?

812
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,299
I'm just checking out what you're doing.

813
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,540
I'm taking a bath.

814
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,340
She loves to peek at people when they're taking a bath.

815
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,260
You aren't sincere

816
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,140
in helping me out at all.

817
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,940
Are you serious?

818
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,380
She does like it.

819
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,700
(I never expected Yanhui)

820
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,220
(to have such a fetish.)

821
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,660
That's a great idea.

822
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,260
(There's a cold spring behind the hill.)

823
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,460
(It can cure sickness and heal wounds.)

824
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,860
(It's also known as)

825
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,780
(Qingqiu's Spring of Love.)

826
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:48,980
(According to legends, )

827
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,899
(before the important figures of Qingqiu get married, )

828
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,980
(they'll head to the spring)

829
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,540
(and go for a seven-day baptism)

830
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,419
(to prove their feelings for each other.)

831
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,580
(Cold spring)

832
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,500
Look.

833
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,179
Did you bring me here

834
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,259
because you came up with an idea,

835
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,379
which is improving our relationship

836
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,500
in the spring?

837
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,219
I'm going to give you a surprise.

838
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,260
What surprise?

839
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,740
Close your eyes.

840
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,540
Don't peek.

841
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,420
What are you doing?

842
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,220
Wait a moment.

843
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,340
Hurry up.

844
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,140
I'm done.

845
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
You must've lost your mind!

846
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,620
Yanhui!

847
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,340
Did you trick me on purpose?

848
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,820
Do you feel like laughing at me now?

849
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,700
I don't even know

850
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:20,020
why I trusted you time and time again.

851
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,420
She didn't like it?

852
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,219
I finally understand now.

853
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,819
Even an idiot could figure out

854
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,499
that no girl would like something like this.

855
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,939
Pure-hearted?

856
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,660
You're obviously

857
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,659
a devious man.

858
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,500
How dare you trick me?

859
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,059
Sometimes, I do feel like killing you.

860
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,180
But she was happy

861
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,620
when she saw me taking a bath.

862
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,380
Why did she react like that when she saw you doing so?

863
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,940
Stop interfering

864
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,460
with our affairs.

865
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
I don't care if you're sincere

866
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,380
in helping her or not.

867
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,060
But now, her affairs

868
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,380
have nothing to do with you now.

869
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,180
Just like usual.

870
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,700
If you discover anything strange,

871
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,220
report to me immediately.

872
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,340
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
