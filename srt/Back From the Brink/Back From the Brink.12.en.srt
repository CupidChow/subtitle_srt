(Episode 12)
(Watch on www.kisskh.co)

3
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,659
(Strength: Wealth, Fitness, Martial Arts Skills)

4
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,510
Wonderful.

5
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
I found you.

6
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,350
What a perfect pair.

7
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,790
I won't budge on my choice.

8
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,510
Over the past decade,

9
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,540
I have been searching.

10
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,259
(Couple Trial) for Taoist-spirit lovers

11
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,380
who can make a perfect pair.

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,230
Finally,

13
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,630
my mission is almost done.

14
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,820
How great.

15
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,950
Yanhui.

16
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,540
How annoying!

17
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,820
Yanhui.

18
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,030
They're in such high spirits.

19
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,750
Yanhui.

20
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,310
Yanhui, stop running.

21
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,950
You haven't recovered yet.

22
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,190
I feel so terrible.

23
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,630
Very terrible!

24
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,100
Yanhui.

25
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,980
Stop it.

26
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,580
Are you

27
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,510
flirting with each other?

28
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,750
Shut up!

29
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,029
Calm yourself down.

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,470
I can't!

31
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,820
What's wrong with me?

32
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,146
Is it because

33
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,980
of the dark aura you transferred to me?

34
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,980
(It looks like)

35
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,860
(a noxious aura of dark practitioners.)

36
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,630
Don't tell me you're a dark practitioner.

37
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,070
Yes.

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,540
I'm a dark practitioner.

39
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,100
You mentioned about backfire.

40
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,820
Did you

41
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:40,470
turn me into a dark practitioner?

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,230
Just an iota of the dark aura isn't enough to transform you.

43
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,659
Remain composed.

44
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,260
It can be solved, all right?

45
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,030
Calm down.

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,070
Calm down.

47
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,350
Calm down.

48
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:58,950
What are you doing?

49
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,580
Bite me?

50
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,757
I want to bite you to death.

51
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,470
Let go!

52
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:05,860
I'm going to bite you to death!

53
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,820
Yanhui.

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,230
It's all right.

55
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,350
Just calm down.

56
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,700
Calm down.

57
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,550
You're out of danger now.

58
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,670
Don't be afraid.

59
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,989
I think I've gone berserk.

60
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,990
Tie me up now.

61
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,820
Tie her up.

62
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,510
What should we do now?

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,870
Hey, Flower Medallion.

64
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,950
Why does she act cranky?

65
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,990
(I'm in the middle of the charging process.)

66
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,340
(I can't answer you right now.)

67
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,430
How embarrassing.

68
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,630
Aside...

69
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,460
Aside from feeling grumpy,

70
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,670
what else makes you feel ill?

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,380
Before I woke up,

72
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,109
(I sensed that my mind's eye)

73
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,990
(is like boiling water.)

74
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,510
It sounded like

75
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:34,670
the spiritual powers repel each other.

76
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,670
Did she practice sorceries from two different schools?

77
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,460
(So, my Heart Protecting Scale)

78
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,630
(repels the spiritual power)

79
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,580
(inside her.)

80
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,990
(So, my dark aura)

81
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,190
(repels the spiritual power)

82
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,220
(inside her.)

83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,380
(So, the aurae from them)

84
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,020
(are mutually repulsive.)

85
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,900
Since we can't figure out a solution,

86
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,020
why don't you

87
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,379
try to juggle with

88
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,340
the two powers?

89
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,260
What is going on?

90
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,700
I can feel tempestuous waves in my mind's eye.

91
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,310
It's stuffy and hot inside.

92
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,220
I can't adjust my inner flow of qi.

93
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,110
I got pushed out when I tried to enter it.

94
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,430
The mind's eye isn't a real ocean.

95
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,820
That's not the way

96
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,870
to adjust the inner qi in you.

97
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,380
You need to calm your mind.

98
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,699
I just can't.

99
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,549
I'm overwhelmed with desires now.

100
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,579
The best way to eradicate desires

101
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,870
is to fulfill them.

102
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,900
Tell us.

103
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,340
What's your wish?

104
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,429
I want freedom

105
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,220
and to become rich.

106
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,990
What?

107
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,219
To obtain freedom is easy,

108
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,260
but you want to become...

109
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,580
rich...

110
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,629
All lucrative properties of the Feng family

111
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,380
have already been blown up.

112
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,220
You saw that.

113
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,899
Besides, Qique Agency was shut down

114
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,700
under duress from the Taoist clan,

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,870
not to mention the situation

116
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,820
in Tianxiang Workshop.

117
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,629
I didn't have time to prepare the money

118
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,869
during the escape.

119
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,550
For now,

120
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:22,579
I'm desperate

121
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,510
and I got nothing left.

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Truth be told,

123
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,630
I'm now going to start from scratch.

124
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,510
Living an extravagant life

125
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,900
is my lifelong dream.

126
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,140
Don't be so stingy.

127
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,310
We're friends

128
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,750
on the same side.

129
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,340
Are you going to stand idly and do nothing?

130
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,625
(Silver Parlor)

131
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,379
"The host takes a few days off

132
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,870
to celebrate good news."

133
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,550
(Yamen of Yongzhou's Governor-General, Sealed)

134
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,580
A roughcast house?

135
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,780
Isn't this the Silver Parlor?

136
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,780
Yes.

137
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,460
It was.

138
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,140
Previously, I was rich and successful.

139
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,429
Qique Agency is the leading organization

140
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,549
in the intel industry.

141
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,950
What a big name.

142
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,380
But now, it's all gone

143
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,430
and I'm broke.

144
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,550
My money isn't as abundant as dirt.

145
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,780
Instead, I have to live on dirt.

146
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,630
As the old saying goes,

147
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:29,110
"shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations".

148
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,630
Finally, I witnessed it with my eyes.

149
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,429
Living on dirt...

150
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,500
Cut that out.

151
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,390
I won't be poor forever.

152
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,630
She's sick now.

153
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:41,780
Lower your voice.

154
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,870
Yes, I'm sick of her.

155
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,590
Enough.

156
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,940
I will earn more money.

157
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,500
It's not easy to succeed, but it's easy to fail.

158
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,783
Do you think making money is that easy?

159
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,820
Yanhui.

160
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,430
What a petty man.

161
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,310
Wait for me, perfect couple.

162
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,390
Feeling any better?

163
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,390
No.

164
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,820
I can't stop.

165
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,340
What's wrong?

166
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,430
Look at this leaf.

167
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,190
Leaf?

168
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,270
This leaf...

169
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,820
Why did it

170
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,340
fall?

171
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,620
I will bury it.

172
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,740
Let me bury it

173
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,190
in the earth.

174
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,390
Is this the fall of life

175
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,220
or the end of the life cycle?

176
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,390
If you're tired,

177
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,700
let's head back.

178
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,500
No.

179
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,340
I'm not going back.

180
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,860
I will bury it well.

181
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,820
Why did it fall?

182
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,950
Just why?

183
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,580
How pitiful!

184
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,030
I want to bury it.

185
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,949
Together with the late autumn chill,

186
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,979
a withered leaf,

187
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,820
a fickle life,

188
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,099
and my wondrous youth

189
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
are buried in the earth.

190
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,310
You're having

191
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,460
a mood swing.

192
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,500
Get up.

193
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:02,910
It's nippy now.

194
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,550
Let's go back.

195
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,550
Look.

196
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,390
The leaves

197
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,270
are like falling snow.

198
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,030
It's like snowing in big flakes.

199
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,910
Just like that day.

200
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,076
Which day?

201
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,430
(On that day, )

202
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,549
(it was snowing heavily like today.)

203
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,819
Tanghulu!

204
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,550
Ma'am.

205
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,390
This is your baozi.

206
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,340
Take the money.

207
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,030
Thank you.

208
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,620
Don't let it fall.

209
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,550
I want this.

210
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,340
We have baozi!

211
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,190
My sweetheart.

212
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,550
I bought you

213
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,500
your favorite tanghulu.

214
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,700
Yeah, tanghulu!

215
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,070
It's snowing.

216
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,219
Let's cook some rice cake at home.

217
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,700
All right?

218
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,189
Rice cake!

219
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,820
Let's go.

220
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,860
I like rice cake.

221
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,860
(That's the most delicious baozi)

222
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,790
(I have had ever.)

223
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,620
(Sometimes I wonder.)

224
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,580
(I don't eat much.)

225
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,270
(I'm obedient)

226
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,740
(and have great strength.)

227
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
(But why don't I have a home?)

228
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,100
I'm so cold.

229
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,500
Are you still cold?

230
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,790
I...

231
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,790
I think I've lost it just now.

232
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,340
Do you feel better now?

233
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,580
Come on.

234
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,620
Let's go home.

235
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,390
Elder Su'e.

236
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,150
I've left Guanghan Sect

237
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,740
and joined Chenxing Mountain for years.

238
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,549
Stop calling me that.

239
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,950
Yes, Elder Lingfei.

240
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,310
Our leader is training in seclusion

241
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,500
and Immortal Yunmeng is guarding the formation.

242
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,820
We received the intel

243
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,859
that the monsters who escaped from Yongzhou City

244
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
are circulating some news.

245
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,700
About what?

246
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,740
The words have it

247
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,699
that Leader eliminated

248
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,670
the Princess of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan.

249
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,669
They claimed that Guanghan Sect

250
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,190
purposely provoked a dispute between the two realms.

251
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,070
Elder Lingfei.

252
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,739
What should I answer

253
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,980
if other sects confront us?

254
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,270
The one who killed that fox spirit

255
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,790
was that evil dragon, right?

256
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,820
What has it got to do

257
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,910
with Suying?

258
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,820
It was that evil dragon who threw Yongzhou City into disarray

259
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,950
and killed the Princess of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan.

260
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,740
Relay this message

261
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,150
to all sects that come.

262
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:17,910
Yes.

263
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,270
Yanhui

264
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,550
has calmed down much now.

265
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,580
This cranky girl

266
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,949
found someone

267
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,980
who can handle her.

268
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,739
That dragon seems different

269
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,790
from how he was in Yongzhou.

270
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,340
I can feel the warmth from him now.

271
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,860
Yes.

272
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,820
Perhaps

273
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,117
meeting the right one

274
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,629
makes each other

275
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:05,544
better.

276
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
I've become better

277
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,220
after I met you.

278
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,020
What's your plan?

279
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,459
When I was in town today,

280
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,980
I heard someone talk about Yongzhou.

281
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,540
They said.

282
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,739
Tianyao destroyed Yongzhou

283
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,870
and killed Princess Yunxi.

284
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,460
As expected.

285
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,780
Guanghan Sect intends

286
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,590
to make Tianyao take the fall.

287
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,150
I can't do anything about the Taoist clan.

288
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,429
But I won't allow them

289
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,670
to simply incriminate others.

290
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,060
Tomorrow,

291
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm leaving for Qingqiu.

292
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,190
Tomorrow?

293
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,740
Why the rush?

294
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,540
I have been

295
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,150
serving Qingqiu over the years.

296
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,830
Now that Wangyu Tower closed down,

297
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,220
I shouldn't stay in the territory

298
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,500
of the Taoist clan for long.

299
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,460
Within the land of the Taoist clan,

300
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,220
there's no place

301
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,020
for me either.

302
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,979
I wonder

303
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,350
if there is a place for me beside you,

304
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,910
Miss Xiange.

305
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,290
No.

306
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,700
But there's a place for you in my heart.

307
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,620
Xiange.

308
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,700
For the rest of our lives,

309
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,660
I will stay with you,

310
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,860
come what may.

311
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,180
All right?

312
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:18,425
(Fengya Town)

313
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,769
Have a look at the kites.

314
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,900
They are brand-new designs.

315
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,420
I hate to leave you.

316
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,860
Me too.

317
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,250
I haven't thanked you

318
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,090
on behalf of the monsters

319
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:31,980
in Yongzhou.

320
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,770
It's all right.

321
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,330
Xiange.

322
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,009
You're leaving for Qingqiu alone.

323
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,250
What if you run into danger?

324
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,249
I'm not dead yet, okay?

325
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,860
Xiange isn't leaving alone.

326
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,700
Quit squabbling.

327
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,860
Qingqiu

328
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:45,219
is where I grew up.

329
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,140
I will be all right.

330
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,220
You must take care of yourself.

331
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,570
If possible,

332
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,140
do visit Qingqiu.

333
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,090
Xiange.

334
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,090
You must protect yourself well.

335
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,660
I'm leaving.

336
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,050
No.

337
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,810
All right, we need to set off.

338
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,570
When you're leaving Fengya Town

339
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,050
after full recovery,

340
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,090
remember to exit via the east side.

341
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,460
The forest of the west

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,809
shrouds in mist for years.

343
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,220
Barely no one can leave there.

344
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,530
Be careful.

345
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,250
Sure.

346
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,330
Thank you.

347
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,140
We're off.

348
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,900
All right.

349
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,860
We should leave now.

350
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,770
Take care.

351
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,010
I'm over here.

352
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,730
Be careful.

353
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,980
The sun is scorching.

354
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,490
Let's go.

355
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,290
I'm sleepy.

356
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:26,940
Hold on.

357
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,139
-Have a look at the baskets. -We sell ornaments.

358
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,730
Yanhui.

359
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,010
-I can't bear... -Not leaving?

360
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,179
to leave Xiange!

361
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,980
I know.

362
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:36,115
But why do you want to bite me?

363
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,460
Yanhui, what's wrong?

364
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,700
I don't know.

365
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,660
Didn't she recover

366
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,330
last night?

367
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,076
I don't know. I just want to bite.

368
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:43,266
I want to bite.

369
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:43,836
Yanhui.

370
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:44,796
Calm down.

371
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:45,636
Calm down.

372
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:46,556
Tianyao.

373
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,875
What did you do to me last night?

374
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:48,596
Do it one more time.

375
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:50,076
Come on, Dragon.

376
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:54,116
Yanhui.

377
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,630
Yanhui.

378
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,211
Not this.

379
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,266
Yanhui.

380
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:05,876
Do you feel better now?

381
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:09,186
Not this one!

382
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:32,076
Yes.

383
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,226
This is it.

384
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:40,652
My flame?

385
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:09,706
Flame.

386
00:22:10,356 --> 00:22:11,156
Flame.

387
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:12,876
I want flames.

388
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:13,986
I want flames.

389
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,026
Here you go. Gosh, it's so hot.

390
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:16,916
Here you go.

391
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:18,116
Come on, breathe fire.

392
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:19,876
Come on.

393
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:37,796
Forget it.

394
00:22:38,116 --> 00:22:38,596
All flames in this room

395
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:39,556
were from him

396
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:40,946
despite his weak condition.

397
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:41,666
Don't you forget

398
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:43,556
that he got injured in Yongzhou.

399
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,543
His throat is dry and he coughs badly.

400
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:46,862
Do you still insist?

401
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:47,383
Yes.

402
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:54,063
You became calm

403
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:56,543
with a little flame on my palm

404
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:58,273
yesterday.

405
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:00,233
But it doesn't work now.

406
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:01,863
Has your sickness

407
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:03,273
worsened?

408
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:07,383
Your flame

409
00:23:07,495 --> 00:23:08,665
is only a temporary solution.

410
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,760
I will dive into your mind's eye.

411
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:15,782
I think you're exhausted now.

412
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:16,583
Leave it to me.

413
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:17,513
Hold on.

414
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:27,473
I don't need you two.

415
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:28,993
I can adjust myself.

416
00:23:29,303 --> 00:23:30,193
Leave me alone.

417
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:38,303
-Go out now. -Let's leave.

418
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:43,063
I'm leaving first then.

419
00:23:58,953 --> 00:24:00,542
(In the past, people experienced blowback)

420
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:01,673
(after accepting the inner qi, )

421
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:03,672
(but none of them lost control emotionally)

422
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,583
(to this extent, like she does.)

423
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:15,992
Why are you staring at me?

424
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:16,953
I keep forgetting this.

425
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,303
Why were you holding the dragon horns

426
00:24:18,713 --> 00:24:19,863
after Yanhui retrieved them

427
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,143
in the fight at Yongzhou?

428
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,823
Oh, goodness.

429
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,342
You've started suspecting me

430
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:27,583
already?

431
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:28,273
Evil dragon.

432
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:29,383
Why nervous?

433
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:30,473
It's just a common question.

434
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:32,193
Why were the dragon horns

435
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,823
with you?

436
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:36,513
Yanhui gave them to me.

437
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:37,713
When?

438
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:39,232
Right after she retrieved the dragon horns.

439
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:40,513
When did you see her?

440
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,783
I was with you all the time.

441
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,513
You're lying.

442
00:24:49,273 --> 00:24:50,382
Anyway, I didn't do anything

443
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:51,193
that cause you harm.

444
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:52,673
What have you done that harmed her?

445
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,583
No.

446
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,549
Let me ask you this.

447
00:24:56,673 --> 00:24:58,273
Why did you halt me

448
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,103
from entering her mind's eye?

449
00:25:01,863 --> 00:25:03,583
Halt you?

450
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:05,513
I was helping her.

451
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:06,433
Fine.

452
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,063
If so, I'm going to check it out

453
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,473
in her mind's eye now.

454
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:14,343
She's in the middle of meditation now.

455
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:16,103
Don't you think it's bad

456
00:25:16,823 --> 00:25:18,033
to interrupt her now?

457
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:52,383
You better not

458
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:56,583
enter her mind's eye.

459
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:06,623
You're a dark practitioner?

460
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:08,233
Oops! You got me.

461
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:20,342
You're fighting behind my back.

462
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:21,473
Let me join the fight.

463
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:22,953
What did you two

464
00:26:23,063 --> 00:26:24,273
try to keep from me?

465
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:26,673
What has happened?

466
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:32,953
Forget it.

467
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,143
He saw

468
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:34,993
my dark aura just now.

469
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:37,143
All right, I will come clean.

470
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:38,913
I'm a dark practitioner.

471
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:40,342
The reason why

472
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:41,303
she behaves like this

473
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:43,232
is because her body contains

474
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:44,543
my dark aura.

475
00:26:44,713 --> 00:26:45,992
And she didn't tell you that

476
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:46,713
because

477
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,062
she keeps this secret for me.

478
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:48,953
Your nonsense

479
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:49,953
isn't helpful at all.

480
00:26:50,473 --> 00:26:51,953
Tianyao, please hear me out.

481
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:52,913
I understand

482
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:54,102
that you hate lies

483
00:26:54,103 --> 00:26:54,713
and someone hiding things from you.

484
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,193
But I didn't mean to do that.

485
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:56,583
I...

486
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:57,953
I'm just keeping my word.

487
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,103
Drop that.

488
00:26:59,103 --> 00:26:59,623
Do you feel

489
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:00,383
calmer now?

490
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:01,273
Is it because

491
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:01,953
another emotion

492
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,063
is arising within you,

493
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:04,713
deflecting your anxiety?

494
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,103
Shut up!

495
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:07,863
Tianyao.

496
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:08,953
I swear.

497
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:10,472
The fact that I kept from you

498
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,193
wouldn't do you

499
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:12,233
any harm.

500
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:14,513
Are you sure?

501
00:27:15,953 --> 00:27:16,783
Do you think

502
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,673
this is convincing?

503
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:24,913
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,913
I shouldn't lie to you.

505
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:29,753
I will seclude myself for reflection.

506
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:39,343
Enough, man.

507
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,433
Get over it.

508
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,103
Think about this.

509
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:44,672
Because of your identity,

510
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,433
you've been discriminated against by the Taoist clan.

511
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:47,952
And yet you're discriminating against me

512
00:27:47,953 --> 00:27:49,623
because I'm a dark practitioner.

513
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:51,433
Let me ask you this.

514
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:52,783
Have I ever hurt you?

515
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:55,033
Just ask yourself

516
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,063
why she needed

517
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:58,953
my dark aura?

518
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,993
Because of those silly horns of yours.

519
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:07,712
(Do you really think)

520
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:09,472
(the spiritual power of those impotent monsters)

521
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:10,343
(was able to help her)

522
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:10,953
(break the seal)

523
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:11,913
(of that wicked woman from Guanghan Sect?)

524
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:15,513
Both of us

525
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:16,912
are detested by the Taoist clan

526
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:19,103
because of our identities.

527
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:20,193
Therefore,

528
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,822
don't fall out with her

529
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:22,992
because of me.

530
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:23,913
Crows don't pick

531
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:26,033
crow's eyes.

532
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,823
Our priority now

533
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:29,433
is to get her fixed.

534
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:34,863
See you.

535
00:28:51,428 --> 00:28:55,303
(Wuqi Hall)

536
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:05,433
Why are you so bratty?

537
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:07,033
Why there are

538
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,583
no good qualities in you?

539
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:15,623
You're good-for-nothing.

540
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,063
You don't deserve to live.

541
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:21,473
You'd be better off dead.

542
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:31,713
Are you hungry?

543
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:32,993
I am.

544
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:39,383
Next time...

545
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:45,433
Never mind.

546
00:29:49,273 --> 00:29:50,343
You've suffered a lot

547
00:29:50,953 --> 00:29:51,783
because of me.

548
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:58,753
If it wasn't for you,

549
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:00,713
we wouldn't have been sitting here

550
00:30:00,713 --> 00:30:01,433
safe and sound.

551
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:03,433
You...

552
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:04,863
You're not bratty

553
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:06,193
and

554
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:08,303
you're not good-for-nothing.

555
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:12,673
Please don't demean yourself.

556
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,433
Are you here to apologize to me

557
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:17,993
or to comfort me?

558
00:30:22,673 --> 00:30:23,433
Are you done?

559
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:26,913
Let me enter your mind's eye.

560
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,273
It's imperative

561
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:29,303
to get you fixed.

562
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:20,103
(Only dark practitioners who have gone off the deep end)

563
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:21,542
have the dark aura

564
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:22,193
you're enduring now.

565
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:24,543
Yes.

566
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:25,673
I find it odd too.

567
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,752
I become unstable

568
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,193
after receiving the dark aura from Bai Xiaosheng.

569
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:29,953
But he doesn't seem

570
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,233
to be bothered by that.

571
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:32,273
He acts very normally.

572
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:33,913
I've seen this dark aura

573
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,673
in the Dragon Valley.

574
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,913
Didn't you say that you've never seen it before?

575
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,303
I used to stay in the Dragon Valley for a very long time

576
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:42,993
and I only saw it once.

577
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:45,232
(Luochuan Dragon Valley) (Luochuan Dragon Valley assembles)

578
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,063
(the most abundant dragon scent.)

579
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,953
(Such a malicious aura shouldn't appear there.)

580
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:49,583
(But, on that day, )

581
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:54,383
(I severed it with my sword)

582
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:55,783
(and it never emerged since then.)

583
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:57,673
(I've already forgotten it.)

584
00:31:58,193 --> 00:31:59,342
(But when I saw the form of that dark aura)

585
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:00,513
(in your mind's eye just now, )

586
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:01,673
(it reminded me)

587
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:02,273
(of the dark aura)

588
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:03,143
(I encountered back then.)

589
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:04,993
They seem related.

590
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,753
What exactly is that?

591
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:13,863
I think he's the only one who knows the answer.

592
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:17,583
I will ask him to settle this for me.

593
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:18,953
If he's able to settle it,

594
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:20,273
naturally, he will do it

595
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:21,103
secretly

596
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:23,103
before long it happened.

597
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:24,033
He wouldn't

598
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:25,343
have exposed his identity to us either.

599
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:29,583
What's the story behind Bai Xiaosheng?

600
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,993
What turns them into dark practitioners?

601
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:33,993
What's the dark aura?

602
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:34,913
Practitioners in Chenxing Mountain

603
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,143
have been studying this for years,

604
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:37,143
but nothing

605
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:38,103
is found.

606
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,109
I'm going to ask him.

607
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:41,543
Yanhui.

608
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:43,513
This man is crafty

609
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,033
and deceitful.

610
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:47,233
Take his words with a pinch of salt.

611
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:49,473
I suppose it's not a fruitful effort

612
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:50,783
to ask him directly.

613
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:51,673
But

614
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:52,713
you are right about one thing.

615
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:54,783
Currently, he seems

616
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,753
to need our favor

617
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:59,233
and doesn't harbor an evil intention against us yet.

618
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:00,783
True, though.

619
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:02,432
He has been helping us out along the journey.

620
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:03,193
Without him,

621
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:03,713
we wouldn't be able

622
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,063
to retrieve the dragon horns.

623
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:07,913
As for now,

624
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:09,303
I have another way

625
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:11,063
to purge the dark aura inside you.

626
00:33:11,473 --> 00:33:12,712
There's a solution?

627
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:13,783
You should tell me this earlier.

628
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:16,623
When I encountered the dark aura before,

629
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,383
I slashed it with Flaming Dragon Fang.

630
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:19,913
Flaming Dragon Fang?

631
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:22,513
(It's my weapon.)

632
00:33:23,143 --> 00:33:24,103
(It's very helpful to my cultivation)

633
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:25,783
if I get it back.

634
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:28,673
Your weapon

635
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:30,383
is made of a fang?

636
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:32,583
Show me your fang.

637
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:35,863
Fine.

638
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:37,193
Please go on.

639
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:42,343
I think my dragon fire

640
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,433
can purge the dark aura.

641
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,622
But I can't do that now

642
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:47,583
because I've exhausted my power.

643
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:50,103
Concerning our situation,

644
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,103
both the dragon vein and heart

645
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:53,303
are beyond us.

646
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:55,193
Hence,

647
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:57,343
I should return to the Dragon Valley

648
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:58,673
for Flaming Dragon Fang.

649
00:33:59,143 --> 00:33:59,953
That's the fastest way

650
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:00,753
to get you fixed.

651
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,472
All right. Let's go.

652
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,193
You can't go.

653
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:04,233
Why not?

654
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:05,673
Flaming Dragon Fang

655
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:07,953
is left on the Snow Peak.

656
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,703
Twenty years ago,

657
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:15,353
(Suying and I had a duel on Snow Peak.)

658
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:18,623
(The malicious formation made by Suying)

659
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:19,873
(still lingers.)

660
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,353
(Snow Peak)

661
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:23,872
(is besieged by blustery wind)

662
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:24,913
(and malicious formation of the Guanghan Sect.)

663
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:26,663
Mortals like you

664
00:34:26,993 --> 00:34:27,873
can't stand against that.

665
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:33,143
I managed to retrieve dragon bone and horns before.

666
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:34,393
Such things

667
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:35,433
are just minor threats.

668
00:34:56,143 --> 00:34:57,263
What's this?

669
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:01,063
I've connected my dragon horns

670
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:02,513
with the Heart Protecting Scale.

671
00:35:02,873 --> 00:35:03,583
If anything bad happens,

672
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:04,473
tap the wrist strap

673
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:05,543
three times.

674
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,183
I can hear you

675
00:35:07,543 --> 00:35:08,873
even though I'm a hundred li away.

676
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:10,513
This is amazing.

677
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:17,993
Tianyao.

678
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,183
Yes.

679
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,103
I can hear sound from this.

680
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:28,473
This strap is more interesting than Flower Medallion.

681
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:37,433
Where are you?

682
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:40,263
Take a guess.

683
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:43,833
Yanhui.

684
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:54,583
Yanhui.

685
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:00,033
Tianyao.

686
00:36:00,313 --> 00:36:01,183
I'm here.

687
00:36:09,473 --> 00:36:10,393
You ought to be careful

688
00:36:10,623 --> 00:36:11,833
tomorrow.

689
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:13,703
Eat some baozi

690
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:14,623
when you get peckish.

691
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:24,183
Do dragons need to eat?

692
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:26,793
No.

693
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,913
We fill ourselves with nature's essence.

694
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,793
Are you drinking the wind?

695
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:33,143
You should eat some meat.

696
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,703
-I have more baozi. -What a lovey-dovey scene.

697
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:37,553
I'm going to drown in their sweet romance.

698
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:47,653
(Snow Peak, Luochuan Dragon Valley)

699
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,512
(Wuqi Hall)

700
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:28,263
-Bai Xiaosheng. -Don't come near me.

701
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:29,073
No!

702
00:37:29,143 --> 00:37:30,623
Hold still, Bai Xiaosheng!

703
00:37:31,913 --> 00:37:32,513
Stop!

704
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:33,913
Back!

705
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:35,993
Look at this.

706
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:36,623
Take a good look

707
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:37,553
at these bites.

708
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:38,742
Can you stop biting me?

709
00:37:38,743 --> 00:37:39,872
Who else can I bite then?

710
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:40,912
Tianyao just left for one day.

711
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:41,873
And you're so desperate now.

712
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:43,873
When is he coming back?

713
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:44,513
You know what?

714
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,433
I've had enough of this already.

715
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:46,073
Three days later.

716
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:47,302
He's coming back three days later.

717
00:37:47,303 --> 00:37:48,303
I miss him very much.

718
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:49,143
Also, I can't bear this anymore.

719
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:49,663
What should I do?

720
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:50,873
Did you even try to control yourself?

721
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:52,832
Perhaps I should show you how desperate I am.

722
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:53,623
No, thanks.

723
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:56,263
I'm more curious

724
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:57,953
about how you look

725
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:00,663
when you're calm.

726
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:02,223
Calm down.

727
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:08,473
What are you doing?

728
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:18,993
Yanhui.

729
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:20,743
Tianyao.

730
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:21,583
She's missing you.

731
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:22,615
Bai Xiaosheng.

732
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:23,703
He's doing something important.

733
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:24,303
Tianyao.

734
00:38:24,353 --> 00:38:25,143
Ignore him.

735
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:25,743
Everything is fine.

736
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:26,743
Don't let us keep you.

737
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:27,833
Tianyao.

738
00:38:28,143 --> 00:38:29,222
My arm is becoming a trotter soon

739
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,433
because of her.

740
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:32,073
(It seems that the dark aura inside Yanhui...)

741
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:32,833
I've had enough of her.

742
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,263
(is on the brink of bursting.)

743
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:34,302
Tianyao, don't mind him.

744
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:35,472
Just focus on your task.

745
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:36,623
I'm good. Don't worry.

746
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:37,833
See you.

747
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:39,183
Switch it off now.

748
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:39,833
No way.

749
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:41,473
Tianyao.

750
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:42,473
She becomes stable

751
00:38:42,474 --> 00:38:43,623
when she talks to you.

752
00:38:43,873 --> 00:38:44,912
Please don't hang up.

753
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:45,513
Never.

754
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:45,993
I...

755
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:46,743
Yanhui.

756
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,033
Eldest Senior!

757
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:56,953
Eldest Senior?

758
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:58,953
(Someone from Chenxing Mountain?)

759
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:00,473
-Eldest Senior. -Yanhui.

760
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:01,703
-What brings you here? -I...

761
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:04,103
Behave well.

762
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:05,873
(Why did he come?)

763
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:10,073
What brings me here?

764
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:10,993
Certainly, it's you.

765
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:12,072
Otherwise, you're going to turn the world upside down.

766
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:13,182
I'm not capable of that though.

767
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:14,033
How did you find me?

768
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:14,783
I can simply read the fortune

769
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:15,623
to locate you.

770
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:17,953
After I returned to the sect from a mission,

771
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:19,183
I heard

772
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:20,103
that you had been disrespectful to the leader

773
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,262
and were driven out.

774
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:22,552
I wanted to plead with Master

775
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:23,143
for your sake

776
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:23,976
upon his return.

777
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,111
Little did I know,

778
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:26,833
you'd already be mingling

779
00:39:27,353 --> 00:39:28,432
with this evil dragon

780
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,513
as soon as you came down.

781
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,552
Well...

782
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:34,433
You're not thinking straight.

783
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:35,553
Hey.

784
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,142
Practitioners of Chenxing Mountain

785
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,833
all seem to have a bad temper.

786
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:40,623
Shut your mouth.

787
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:47,183
This evil dragon is cunning.

788
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,363
(Seems like this man from Chenxing Mountain won't do Yanhui any harm.)

789
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:51,033
(I shall keep going then.)

790
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:52,393
You keep pestering Yanhui.

791
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:54,303
What are you after?

792
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:55,833
I'm not that evil dragon.

793
00:39:59,223 --> 00:40:00,033
Not you?

794
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,303
Where's that dragon?

795
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:03,473
The dragon

796
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,880
is gone.

797
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,081
Gone?

798
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,073
Then,

799
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,073
why are you here with him?

800
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:11,223
I've never stopped you

801
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:12,262
from befriending monsters.

802
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:13,622
However, that evil dragon blew up Yongzhou City

803
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:14,303
and has tarnished

804
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:15,433
your reputation.

805
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:16,513
Eldest Senior.

806
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,226
I was the one who blew up the city.

807
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:25,702
You're not capable of that.

808
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:27,073
It must be that evil dragon.

809
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:28,433
I can tell

810
00:40:28,553 --> 00:40:29,782
you must've tried to talk him out of it

811
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,222
and stop him.

812
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:32,302
But he didn't listen to you.

813
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:33,833
That evil dragon is ferocious

814
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:34,623
and he insisted

815
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:35,553
on tearing the city apart.

816
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,303
Eldest Senior...

817
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,303
Enough, don't defend him.

818
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,433
Since he isn't that evil dragon,

819
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,783
is he the spy left by the dragon to keep an eye on you?

820
00:40:43,263 --> 00:40:44,302
No, he's not.

821
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:45,582
Just be honest with me.

822
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,353
I'm here with you,

823
00:40:46,353 --> 00:40:47,103
so don't worry.

824
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:49,663
Although I can't fight that evil dragon,

825
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,703
finishing him is a piece of cake.

826
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,473
Eldest Senior.

827
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:54,622
Why did you come here?

828
00:40:54,623 --> 00:40:55,393
To bring you back.

829
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:00,474
I'm not going back.

830
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:01,623
Why not?

831
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:02,353
Why should I go back?

832
00:41:02,353 --> 00:41:03,033
I came to you under Master's order.

833
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:03,913
Master has expelled me.

834
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:04,743
I should be responsible for you.

835
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:05,433
-I... -You must go back with me.

836
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,183
I have something to accomplish.

837
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:06,993
I can't do anything if I go back...

838
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:16,513
Why did you hit him?

839
00:41:16,743 --> 00:41:18,223
He said he wanted to fetch you back.

840
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:19,553
I won't let that happen.

841
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,352
But why did you knock him out?

842
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,833
You alone are annoying enough,

843
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,262
and now hearing him blabbering,

844
00:41:24,263 --> 00:41:25,353
it will drive me crazy.

845
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:26,506
Listen up.

846
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:27,393
I won't let you off

847
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:28,393
if something were to happen to him!

848
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:28,873
Yanhui.

849
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:31,583
Don't go back.

850
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:32,783
I know.

851
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:34,393
I don't even want to go back.

852
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:38,263
Wait for me.
