[Episode 31]

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,110
It's over.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,640
Everything is over.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,470
This is all because of Yanhui
and that evil dragon!

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,750
I will make them

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,240
pay for this!

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Help...

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,870
Help me!

Help me!

Who are you?

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,270
I am the Lord of Dark Aura.

35
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,110
Lord of Dark Aura?

36
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,870
Immortal Yunmeng's

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,110
true master.

38
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,520
It's you!

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,110
You instigated Yunmeng

40
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,080
to awaken Suying

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
with the Art of Blood Sacrifice.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,990
I lost all of my power because of you!

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,110
You're blaming me?

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,870
You wanted to save Suying.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,200
I merely gave you

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,270
the method.

47
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,870
You made the choice.

48
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,920
Besides,

49
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,920
do you think it's not worth it

50
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,520
to trade your power

51
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,830
for Suying's life?

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
Do you regret it now?

00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,590
I...

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,640
If you know Suying,

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,430
you should let me out now.

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,920
If you dare harm me,

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,990
you'll pay!

58
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,200
Let you out?

59
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,800
You came here of your own will.

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,200
I know

61
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,760
you have great resentment.

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
(Let go of me.)

63
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,520
(Let go of me!)

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,080
Yanhui...

65
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,960
She is finally being punished.

66
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,110
(Why are you hitting me?)

67
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,870
(I won't accept this!)

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,040
-She deserves this.
-(I won't accept this!)

69
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
I also know

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,240
that you want more

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
than just punishments for her.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,350
Punishments are not enough.

73
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,120
This isn't enough.

74
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,760
It's never enough!

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
Do you want her dead?

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,910
I lost my power.

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,710
Your body is filled with the dark aura.

78
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,560
It's worth ten years of training

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,880
for a normal immortal cultivator.

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,080
Do you wish to control it?

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,230
Can I?

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,590
Of course you can.

83
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,710
Your envy and hatred

84
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,680
will grant you endless power.

85
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,350
Kneel.

86
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,830

Tianyao...

88
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,830
Tianyao...

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,960
Yanhui!

Zichen...

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,680
When you were unconscious,

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,230
you kept saying his name.

94
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,590
Have you heard

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,760
from Tianyao?

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,560
Now is not the time

97
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,000
to think about him!

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,350
He fell into the Heavenly Severance Formation.

99
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
He likely didn't survive.

100
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,320
No...

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,080
No!

102
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,230
Let me out!

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,910
I must save him!

104
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,350
Open the Sword of Heaven for me.

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
He's in there.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,830
He must be hurting.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,910
Zichen.

108
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,640
Please let me out.

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
The Starfall Terrace

110
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,880

111

by Master and the elder of Discipline Hall.

112
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,030
There's nothing I can do.

113
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,470
Wait here.

114
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,910
I'll plead with Master to grant you amnesty.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,000
Zichen...

116
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,390
Thank you.

117
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,080
Yanhui.

118
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll be back.

119
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,030
Master!

120
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,710
Yanhui had lived a lonely life.

121
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,790
She may be carefree,

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,560
but she is a kind person.

123
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,020
She went astray and made mistakes,

124
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,080
but she's never hurt anyone.

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Master, please.

126
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,790
Considering she's been

127
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,440
your disciple for ten years,

128
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,590
release her.

129
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,470
Go.

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Master.

131
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,760
This

132
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,500
has to be done.

133
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,590
Master!

134
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,800
Leave!

135
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,990
Ten years ago,

136
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,070
you saved me by the Soul Binding Wood.

137
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,020
(You carried me to Chenxing Mountain.)

138
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,140
(You told me)

139
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,860
it'd be my home

140
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,780
from then on.

141
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,500
You raised me for ten years.

142
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,070
If you wish to destroy all my cultivation,

143
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,500
I consider my debt to you cleared.

144
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,380
But I owe my life

145
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,140
to Tianyao.

146
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,310
I can't fail him.

147
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,500
He's in trouble.

148
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,470
I must rescue him.

149
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:17,950
Well...

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,140
My mind's eye

151
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,740
and power

152
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,780
can't be taken from me yet.

153
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,070
Let me out.

154
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,380
Once Tianyao has been rescued,

155
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,740
I'll come back for my punishment.

156
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,950
Then,

157
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,740
you can beat me up however you want.

158
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,350
Why must you

159
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,260
hurt people

160
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,470
for her sake?

161
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,230
She's taken nine lashes.

162
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,740
We'll continue tomorrow.

163
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,950
Tianyao...

164
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,110
Tianyao...

165
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,230
Tian...

166
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,230
(The dragon veins are nearby.)

167
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,130
(If I can harness the power,)

168
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,780
(maybe I could break the formation)

169
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,110
(from within.)

170
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,140
Yanhui!

171
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,260
(Stay safe at all costs.)

172
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,380
(Wait for me.)

173
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,710
Yanhui?

174
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,500
Yanhui?

175
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,590
Senior...

176
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,230
Don't take this wrongly.

177
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,110
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

178
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,350
Had Zichen not knelt

179
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,660
before the mountain all day long

180
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,020
to plead for your release,

181
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,660
you would've starved to death
before you got released.

182
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,660
Eat up.

183
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,380
(I have to live.)

184
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,860
(Even if my body is pulverized,)

185
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,990
(even if my mind's eye is crushed,)

186
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,710
(I must live)

187
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,260
(so I can save Tianyao.)

188
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,110
Slow down.

189
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,500
Slow down.

190
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,830
Eat slowly.

191
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,470
I used to hate you a lot.

192
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,590
I thought Zichen always showed favoritism
towards you.

193
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,620
But I never wanted you

194
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,660
to throw your life away.

195
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,380
This time,

196
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,310
I'll go with Zichen.

197
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
We'll plead with Master for your release.

198
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,020
Thank you.

199
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,620
I'm warning you,

200
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,310
Yanhui.

201
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,620
If you get released,

202
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,470
don't you mingle

203
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,620
with those monsters again.

204
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,710
Otherwise,

205
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,500
you don't deserve any sympathy.

206
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,710
The people of Chenxing Mountain

207
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,660
are very kind.

208
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,610
Of course.

209
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,350
However,

210
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,260
they were taught wrong.

211
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,430
Senior.

212
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,380
Not all monsters

213
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,860
are evil beings.

214
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,230
Stop saying that!

215
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,430
I'm meeting up with Zichen.

216
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,830
Finish it yourself.

217
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,740
(Master Suying,)

218
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,620
(you and I already joined hands)

219
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,780
(in our battle to slay the dragon)

220
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,380
(20 years ago.)

221
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,990
(Back then,)

222
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,110
(Master Qingguang was already
under your control.)

223
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,380
(Indeed.)

224
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,540
(Sooner or later,)

225
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,190
(you will take my side as well.)

226
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,900
Master Qingguang.

227
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,070
You want to control me?

228
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,620
In your dream.

229
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,110
You shouldn't have come here.

230
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,070
Qingguang has been consumed

231
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,140
by the Dark Phantom.

232
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,110
Starhaven

233
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,110
won't be safe for much longer.

234
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,580
Master Suying.

235
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,100
Please leave.

236
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,100
I could,

237
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,300
but you would have to

238
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,670
kill Yanhui

239
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,100
immediately.

240
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,820
I've told you.

241
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,630
I'll give her 81 lashes,

242
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,430
and nothing less.

243
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,540
The rest is up to our sect to decide.

244
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,670
Master Suying, do not overstep the boundary.

245
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,630
The Dark Phantom

246
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,190
wants the Heart Protecting Scale inside her.

247
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,100
Are you aware of that?

248
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,540
You know

249
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,340
the threat that monster poses.

250
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,020
The risk is greater with every passing day.

251
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,260
To save her,

252
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,950
you'd put the entire Taoist clan

253
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,740
at risk?

254
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,230
Yanhui is my disciple.

255
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,910
I will defend

256
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,150
the clan.

257
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,990
I'll defend

258
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,670
her life as well.

259
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,950
Yanhui should have been executed.

260
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,580
If you're reluctant to do it,

261
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,060
I'll see to it.

262
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,230
You have no right to punish my disciple!

263
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,340
Zichen,

264
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,060
are you sure about this?

265
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,670
Keep watch.

266
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,910
If you spot anyone coming,

267
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,580
signal me at once.

268
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,180
Yes.

269
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,780
But...

270
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,990
Zichen...

271
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,430
Yanhui.

272
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,470
I'm here to save you.

273
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,630
If Master wants to punish anyone,

274
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,950
I'll take full responsibility.

275
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,020
Zichen!

276
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,020
You know

277
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,100
the Starfall Terrace

278
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,540
can only be undone

279
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,670
by Lingxiao and the elder

280
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,820
of the Discipline Hall.

281
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,780
Zichen.

282
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,740
You should leave.

283
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,300
You shouldn't get involved any further.

284
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,300
Trust me.

285
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,470
I'll help you get out.

286
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,820
Once you've made it out of Chenxing Mountain,

287
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,300
go to Qingqiu.

288
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,060
You don't have a place here.

289
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,100
But

290
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,340
when you're in Qingqiu,

291
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,740
live on.

292
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,230
Okay.

293
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,150
Zichen!

294
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Zichen...

295
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,430
Ziyue!

296
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,740
Lingfei...

297
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm surprised.

298
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,430
You still recognize me.

299
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,710
Yanhui is a sinner of Chenxing Mountain.

300
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,740
I was wondering

301
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,710
who'd be bold enough to attempt a rescue.

302
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,300
So, it's you.

303
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,150
Zichen.

304
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,190
You are Senior Lingxiao's

305
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,670
first disciple.

306
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,190
He cherishes you more than anyone.

307
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,630
But

308
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,780
you are disobeying

309
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,870
your master's order!

310
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,650
Scram!

311
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,100
I'll pretend

312
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,580
I saw nothing tonight.

313
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,740
Zichen.

314
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,950
She was heavily wounded on Sanchong Mountain.

315
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,100
She might not have the strength to defeat me.

316
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,910
I will get you out of here.

317
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,020
Very well.

318
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,780
I shall show no mercy.

319
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,020
Spirit-Killing Staff!

320
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,190
Lingfei!

321
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,340
How could you activate

322
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,340
the Deadly Formation of the Starfall Terrace?

323
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,150
I am the elder of the Discipline Hall.

324
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,300
The Starfall Terrace

325
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,670
is within my jurisdiction.

326
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,260
Why couldn't I do it?

327
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,740
The Deadly Formation of Starfall Terrace.

328
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,340
The Deadly Formation of Starfall Terrace.

329
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,870
In the past millennia,

330
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,950
only two spirits of great evil were executed

331
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,100
on Chenxing Mountain.

332
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,150
Today,

333
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
I'll execute you with this formation.

334
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,740
Yanhui.

335
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,190
It's a great honor.

336
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,580
It's more than what you deserve.

337
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,630
Yanhui!

338
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,340
I won't let you save her.

339
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,260
It's Heaven's will.

340
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,020
Master Lingxiao.

341
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,990
You can't go against Heaven's will.

342
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,820
(I must find the dragon veins and get out.)

343
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,780
Zichen!

344
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
You must leave!

345
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,340
She is after my life,

346
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,580
this has nothing to do with you.

347
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,580
Leave now before she kills you!

348
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,670
Leave!

349
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm going to save you!

350
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,780
Leave!

351
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,910
Leave!

352
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,230
Leave!

353
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,670
I'll show you the might

354
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,740
of Chenxing Mountain's prized item.

355
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,150
What is going on?

356
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,950
Yanhui!

357
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,540
Yanhui...

358
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,540
Lingfei...

359
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,630
Lingfei!

360
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,020
Deactivate the formation!

361
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,780
Deactivate the formation!

362
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,260
The only thing capable of activating
the Deadly Formation

363
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,390
is this Spirit-Killing Staff.

364
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,990
It was

365
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,950
given to me

366
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,470
by Lingxiao himself!

367
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,500
You've gone insane...

368
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,670
No!

369
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,230
Lingfei!

370
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,820
Stop!

371
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,780
No one can save you now.

372
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,580
The Spirit-Killing Staff was destroyed.

373
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,740
The formation can't be deactivated.

374
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,230
I want a closer look.

375
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,870
Yanhui,

376
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,910
how will you die now?

377
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,260
(It's Yanhui.)

378
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,230
(The Heart Protecting Scale is getting weaker.)

379
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,060
(Is she...)

380
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Thankfully,

381
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,910
I can save you one last time.

382
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,430

00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,300
What do I do now?

575
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,340
What do I do now?

576
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,530
I have no spiritual power.

577
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,420
I lost my mind's eye.

578
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,690
Ghostly Eulogy...

579
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,530
Ghostly Eulogy...

580
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,380
"Emptiness..."

581
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,420
"Emptiness isn't empty.

582
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,900
Empty is as empty does.

583
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,500
Calmness condenses."

584
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,170
Why doesn't it work?

585
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,170
Why isn't it working?

586
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,900
Why isn't it working?

587
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,410
Why am I so useless?

588
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,300
Master Lingxiao.

589
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,300
Didn't take you long to get here.

590
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,420
You were my master for ten years.

591
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,780
And you so relentlessly

592
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,570
hunt me down.

593
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,610
Very well.

594
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,730
Very well.

595
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,780
Yanhui!

596
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,690
Yanhui!

597
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,380
Yanhui!

598
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,530
The water of the Obsidian River carries nothing.

599
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,340
She chose a painless way

600
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,690
to end it all.

601
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,540
With that said,

602
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,180
