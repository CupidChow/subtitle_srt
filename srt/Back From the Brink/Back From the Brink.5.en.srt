(Episode 5)

3
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
(Suying?)

4
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,230
(You are my sworn enemy.)

(Familiar Depositary)

6
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,509
(Qijue Agency Stable)

7
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,700
Buddy, do you want one?

8
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:12,764
Are you guys willing

9
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:13,894
to let them treat you as such?

10
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:15,134
Of course.

11
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,614
Why not?

12
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,414
Judging from your unhappy expression,

13
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:21,054
I assume this is your first time being a familiar.

14
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:23,204
That's fine.

15
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:25,173
Look at you, all clean and white.

16
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:26,014
You're not hurt at all.

17
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,734
Look at this buddy over here.

18
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,453
When you bring that up,

19
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,174
I can't help but feel sad.

20
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,054
My master

21
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,854
was jealous of my good looks.

22
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:37,893
That's why he left

23
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:40,084
a scar that would never disappear

24
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:41,614
on my

25
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:44,134
handsome face.

26
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:46,054
By the way,

27
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:47,054
you can give it to me

28
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:47,854
if he doesn't want it.

29
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,244
My master always thought I was a herbivore.

30
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:49,924
Actually,

31
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,414
I can have meat, too.

32
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,014
Have you two never thought of escaping?

33
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:56,414
Where can we escape?

34
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,923
In Yongzhou,

35
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,453
monsters die in abrupt ways

36
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:00,683
once they tear their pact of servitude.

37
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,334
Sometimes, their bodies are not even found.

38
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:06,173
The pact of servitude was created

39
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,573
by monsters for humans as a sign

40
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:08,484
of gratitude before.

41
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:09,334
However, no one expected it

42
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:10,524
to end up like this.

43
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:14,684
Tianyao?

44
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,644
Why did you guys chain him up here?

45
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:22,484
Ma'am,

46
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:24,294
familiars are supposed to be treated like this.

47
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,294
Release him immediately!

48
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:31,204
Okay, ma'am.

49
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,084
Please pay up, then.

50
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:37,804
(Vegetables for sale!)

51
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:39,804
(Fresh vegetables for sale!)

52
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:40,854
Sorry about that.

53
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,134
I didn't know

54
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,084
they would treat you like that.

55
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:45,414
They weren't that unkind to monsters

56
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,733
when I came to Yongzhou

57
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:47,894
three years ago.

58
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:52,364
Have you asked for information?

59
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,574
I don't have enough money.

60
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:56,924
I think I have to borrow money

61
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:57,764
from my friends.

62
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,574
You have friends in Yongzhou?

63
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:01,454
Of course.

64
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:02,574
You can even borrow money from them?

65
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:04,454
What do you mean by that?

66
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:07,644
I'm just curious.

67
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,684
You were cultivating in Chenxing Mountain before.

68
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,524
Why would you have friends in Yongzhou?

69
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:13,293
Three years ago,

70
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,054
I made a new friend

71
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,414
when I joined Master in subduing monsters.

72
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:17,854
Yongzhou City is a huge place.

73
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,244
I may not be familiar with other places,

74
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:20,324
but I know every single path

75
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,654
that leads to her place.

76
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:26,854
Keep it.

77
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,054
What is he doing here?

78
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,854
Was he the friend

79
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,444
you mentioned just now?

80
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:33,533
(The Richest Man in Yongzhou, Wang Pengyuan)

81
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,534
How is that possible?

82
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:36,094
It won't be this sum by next month.

83
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:37,004
Have you offended him before?

84
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:37,854
Don't be like that.

85
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,444
It's nothing worth mentioning.

86
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:40,484
Let's go.

87
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,704
(Wangyu Tower, Yongzhou)

88
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,174
Wangyu Tower.

89
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:51,684
Is your friend

90
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:53,244
here?

91
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:55,684
She's the owner of Wangyu Tower.

92
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:57,974
She's a famous businesswoman in Yongzhou.

93
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,174
Do you know her? She's a good friend of mine.

94
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:01,364
Let's go.

95
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:05,174
Sorry, ma'am.

96
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,094
According to our rules,

97
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:08,653
no familiars can enter this building

98
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:09,684
except those who are owned by our owner.

99
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:10,734
Is she really

100
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:11,614
your good friend?

101
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:15,774
It's me.

102
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:17,684
Look at me.

103
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,414
Can I enter the building with my familiar?

104
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:21,924
No.

105
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,733
Only familiars that belong to our owner or important guests

106
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,484
can enter the building.

107
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:28,294
Good friend, huh?

108
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:29,614
Where did you come from?

109
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:30,364
You must be new.

110
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,484
Get someone else here. Let me in.

111
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,653
I can't let you in even if I get someone else here.

112
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:33,004
Let me in!

113
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:33,564
No.

114
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:34,803
What do you mean? Get out of my way.

115
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:35,244
No.

116
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:35,804
Let me in.

117
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:36,444
No.

118
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:36,974
Get out of my way!

119
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:37,684
I can't.

120
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:38,244
I truly can't.

121
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:38,854
Get out of my way!

122
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:39,364
Ma'am!

123
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:40,214
What's going on?

124
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:42,854
First Young Master.

125
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:45,100
Yuli?

126
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:45,490
(Yuli, Xiange's familiar)

127
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,364
Miss Yan?

128
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,124
Great timing.

129
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:47,924
Tell him who I am

130
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:49,774
and if I can go inside with my familiar.

131
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:51,804
Take a look.

132
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:55,734
Miss Yan, please calm down.

133
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,174
He's new here. He has never seen you before.

134
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,534
This is our VIP.

135
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:02,004
If you mistreat her again, I won't let you off.

136
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:03,094
Yes, sir.

137
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:06,364
Miss Yan,

138
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:07,684
please.

139
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:09,924
I told you I had a good friend here.

140
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:14,734
Miss, it's been a long time since you came.

141
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,804
Our lady misses you.

142
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,804
It's because I had plenty of things

143
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,004
to do before this.

144
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:22,884
But speaking of which,

145
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:24,174
judging from Xiange's personality,

146
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,214
I find it hard to believe

147
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:26,324
that she would set so many rules here.

148
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:27,214
I thought Wangyu Tower

149
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,483
was a place for people to forget their differences

150
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:29,884
and enjoy themselves.

151
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:32,124
Now, they're classifying beings?

152
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:34,884
Miss, you came at the wrong time.

153
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,564
The Guanghan Sect keeps a close eye on everything now.

154
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:38,734
If Wangyu Tower

155
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:40,294
stays different from the rest,

156
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,654
people might get something on us.

157
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:47,884
Miss Yan, you just left the mountain not long ago.

158
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:49,443
You can stay here for a few more days

159
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:50,324
and take a breather.

160
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,614
-Miss Yan. -Miss Yan.

161
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:34,684
Miss Yan.

162
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:36,213
I missed you guys!

163
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,214
We missed you too!

164
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:38,884
It's been so long

165
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:39,923
since I last witnessed a scene like this.

166
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,774
Yan, you got yourself a familiar, too?

167
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:46,094
What kind of spirit is he?

168
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:47,244
I cannot detect any spiritual energy from him.

169
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,054
He...

170
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,324
Our lady is here.

171
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:52,244
My Lady.

172
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:07,354
(Xiange, the owner of Wangyu Tower)

173
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,484
You never came back

174
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,174
after we parted ways three years ago.

175
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,244
I'm afraid you already forgot about me long ago.

176
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,494
My lady, please do not blame me.

177
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,414
I missed you.

178
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:37,324
You're as mischievous as always.

179
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,083
I missed you so much.

180
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,014
They're having a ladies' talk.

181
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:41,894
You should come with us.

182
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:42,774
Did you miss me?

183
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:47,924
Let's go.

184
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:50,724
Treat him well.

185
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:51,804
Do not bully him.

186
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,444
They won't chain you up.

187
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,203
I'll pick you up when I'm done.

188
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:56,894
Let's go.

189
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:02,804
Please.

190
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,924
How did you end up getting yourself a familiar?

191
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,754
It's a long story.

192
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:20,084
Xiange,

193
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,594
actually, I came here

194
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,324
to ask you for a favor.

195
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:29,354
Go ahead.

196
00:09:29,474 --> 00:09:30,874
How much do you need this time?

197
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:33,324
You're my good friend indeed. You do know me well.

198
00:09:34,244 --> 00:09:35,634
Seems like you need a huge sum.

199
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,724
That's right.

200
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:39,684
It's...

201
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,154
1,000 gold?

202
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:43,434
10,000 gold?

203
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:46,964
100,000 gold?

204
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,204
Yanhui,

205
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,204
why don't you sell Wangyu Tower

206
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:50,924
while you're at it?

207
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,444
I know it's a huge sum.

208
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,594
What trouble did you get yourself into? Why did you need so much money?

209
00:09:58,404 --> 00:09:59,354
Did you leave the mountain

210
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:00,634
for another reason?

211
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:05,924
I need to buy a life-saving piece of information

212
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:07,954
from the Qijue Agency.

213
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:11,354
Qijue Agency?

214
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,714
What kind of info is it? Why does it require so much money?

215
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,444
I'm sick.

216
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:18,324
Sick?

217
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:19,084
You...

218
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:20,044
What's the matter with you?

219
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:24,874
My heart is pretty weak.

220
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,714
You should go to a physician, then.

221
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,324
-Come. -No.

222
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:27,924
I'll bring you there.

223
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:28,754
It's a long story.

224
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,203
My illness is peculiar.

225
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,874
Anyway, I lack money.

226
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:44,044
Wait here.

227
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:49,634
Let us introduce ourselves first.

228
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:50,954
All of us

229
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:52,353
are Miss Xiange's familiars.

230
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:53,443
I'm fifth in rank.

231
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,234
I'm ninth in rank.

232
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,284
You can call me Fifth.

233
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,404
You can call me Ninth.

234
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,564
(Fifth Young Master, Xiange's familiar) Look at his nose

235
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:00,833
and eyes.

236
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:01,714
You do look handsome.

237
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,114
No wonder Miss Yan took a liking to you.

238
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,994
Don't just pull a long face all day.

239
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:07,044
You need to learn how to smile.

240
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,404
You need to smile warmly.

241
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,834
Curve your brows and lift your lips. Do you know how to do it?

242
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,204
I can teach you.

243
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,403
Take note of the smiling angle.

244
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:13,524
The standard smile requires eight teeth to be shown.

245
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:14,284
Like this.

246
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:15,084
(Ninth Young Master, Xiange's familiar) Don't listen to him.

247
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,444
You won't be able to stay for long

248
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:17,684
if you only depend on your looks.

249
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:19,993
(Familiars' way of conduct) You need to study and learn more.

250
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:20,924
An outstanding familiar

251
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:21,924
isn't made in a day.

252
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,083
Any outstanding familiars

253
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,283
must be able to predict their owners' intentions,

254
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,523
observe their needs,

255
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:26,713
protect their owners' reputations when they're outside,

256
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:27,923
and make sure they don't need to worry.

257
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:28,993
When our owners take a glance at us,

258
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:29,954
you have to think of everything in advance

259
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:30,834
and act before them.

260
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,633
Act if they tell you to, and stop when they tell you not to.

261
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,163
If they tell you to go East,

262
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:34,954
never go West.

263
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,804
If they tell you to stand, never sit.

264
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:47,954
So, we must follow everything our owners...

265
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,324
What are you two doing?

266
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,164
Is our lady too lenient on you guys usually?

267
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,474
Is that why you guys are behaving rudely?

268
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:54,994
Fine.

269
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,044
I'll leave, then.

270
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:00,114
Sir, sorry about that.

271
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,234
Please wait here.

272
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,354
I'll make you a pot of tea.

273
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:03,164
It's fine.

274
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,084
Thank you, First Young Master.

275
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,114
I have something to ask you.

276
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:11,324
When I entered the city today,

277
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,284
I saw a pair of dragon horns on top of the city tower.

278
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,404
When was it placed there?

279
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:16,834
It's already been there for a few days.

280
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:17,954
I can't remember clearly.

281
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:19,594
It just appeared there

282
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:20,684
one morning.

283
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,323
Rumors

284
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,443
regarding the dragon horns

285
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,204
have been circulating

286
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,684
within the city, too.

287
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:26,924
What kind of rumors?

288
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,354
Some say

289
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,163
dragon horns are treasures

290
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:31,634
that absorb the essence of Heaven and Earth.

291
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:33,953
Even though they're placed at the city gate,

292
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,084
no one is guarding them.

293
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:36,563
That means the dragon horns

294
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:37,634
must be fake.

295
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:40,684
(Some say)

296
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:42,084
it's the sacred treasure of dragons,

297
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:44,444
and it'll protect itself.

298
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:47,874
It'll protect itself?

299
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:50,524
I heard that the pair of dragon horns

300
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,834
devours people.

301
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,564
It devours people?

302
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,324
To me,

303
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:58,594
those are just mere rumors.

304
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,444
The dragon horns

305
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,163
have attracted the attention

306
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:03,404
of many greedy people.

307
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,083
Many bodies would be dragged out

308
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,564
of the city gate tower every morning.

309
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:08,444
I speculate

310
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,164
that a strong master

311
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,234
is protecting the dragon horns secretly.

312
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:15,323
Those who have shallow cultivation

313
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:16,114
cannot tell that.

314
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,234
They thought no one was protecting them.

315
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,953
That's why they came up with rumors

316
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:19,684
of the dragon horns devouring people.

317
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:21,994
Dear guest,

318
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:22,924
please take care.

319
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,004
(Wangyu Tower)

320
00:13:25,994 --> 00:13:26,684
Look.

321
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,164
I got 20,000 gold from her.

322
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,564
She's my good friend indeed.

323
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:31,203
I'll definitely repay everything

324
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,834
once I start to make money.

325
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,324
You still lack 80,000 gold.

326
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,114
You have to find four other good friends.

327
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:38,714
How about I

328
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:40,114
sell you, then?

329
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:40,924
It's just for the time being.

330
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:46,804
Forget it.

331
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:48,084
You pull a long face every day.

332
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:49,354
I can't sell you for a good price, anyway.

333
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,444
You don't need to waste your money.

334
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,594
You can return the money

335
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:55,324
to your friend.

336
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,634
As long as I retrieve my body...

337
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:57,524
Stop.

338
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,634
I will never believe your words.

339
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:00,924
What should we do?

340
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:03,444
We need to make money somehow.

341
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:04,994
This is great!

342
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:05,924
They're gambling today.

343
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,593
We'll get rich in one go!

344
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,114
That's right. It all falls on you now.

345
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,834
Here's our chance.

346
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:12,084
You can enjoy yourself.

347
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,634
I have something to do. I need to go.

348
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,164
Wait.

349
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,084
This is for you.

350
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:22,834
This

351
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,234
is for your living expenses in Yongzhou.

352
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,474
Keep it well.

353
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,594
Take care of yourself.

354
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,204
Now we

355
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:28,564
are in the same boat.

356
00:14:28,804 --> 00:14:29,874
I'll make a move first.

357
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:45,634
(The dragon horns are harmless.)

358
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:47,874
(Suying did set up a trap around them.)

359
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:49,164
(Let me)

360
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,204
(see what's going on with it tonight.)

361
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:05,204
It's the Gold-eating Beast, indeed.

362
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:07,684
I should be able to lure it away

363
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,874
if I have enough gold pieces.

364
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,164
The dragon horns are right in front of me.

365
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:25,044
I'll take a gamble.

366
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:36,324
Come! The more you bet, the more you earn!

367
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:38,833
Big or small? Place your bet!

368
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,834
Come! Big or small?

369
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:44,524
Big!

370
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:47,114
Small!

371
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:50,924
Again!

372
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:54,204
Big!

373
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:57,234
Big!

374
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,804
Here!

375
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:06,724
Here. Big!

376
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,004
Small!

377
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:14,804
Big!

378
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:17,043
(I thought I could win enough money)

379
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:18,834
(to purchase the info from Qijue Agency by gambling.)

380
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:20,634
(What should I do now?)

381
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,523
We have a challenge today.

382
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:24,633
On the left is Qiang.

383
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:25,673
On the right is Fu.

384
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:26,803
Which one will you guys bet on?

385
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:28,003
My Fu will surely win.

386
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:28,964
Am I right? You guys should bet on it.

387
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,043
Wrong! My Qiang is the strongest!

388
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:31,634
Bet on Qiang!

389
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,484
Everyone, place your bet!

390
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,324
Do place your bet!

391
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:37,324
Fu is going to win!

392
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:38,284
I'll bet on Fu!

393
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,594
Fight!

394
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,194
Qiang, beat it up!

395
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,524
Shut up!

396
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:48,724
Fu?

397
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:49,484
Fu?

398
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,084
What's wrong?

399
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:50,964
What's wrong?

400
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:51,594
Fu?

401
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,434
What's the matter?

402
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:54,154
It won.

403
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:55,914
I won.

404
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:56,914
Miss,

405
00:17:57,354 --> 00:17:58,593
I think Fu

406
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,113
died suddenly!

407
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,194
Qiang won.

408
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,284
Even crickets

409
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:03,674
can die suddenly?

410
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:04,434
That's right.

411
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:06,634
Poor Fu.

412
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:07,434
It's been killed

413
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,244
on the battlefield.

414
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,674
Fu!

415
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,194
Fu!

416
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:22,674
Yanhui,

417
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:23,834
lend me 3,000 gold.

418
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:24,674
It's for an emergency.

419
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:27,114
I ran out of gold!

420
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:29,724
It took

421
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,354
all my luck

422
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:33,634
to get your Heart Protecting Scale.

423
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,194
Even Fu

424
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:38,114
died because of me!

425
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:40,394
You're wrong.

426
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,674
You were spending my luck.

427
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,433
(Wangyu Tower)

428
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:48,084
20,000 gold

429
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:49,524
was all gone

430
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:51,284
in one night?

431
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:53,524
Miss Yan,

432
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:54,634
pardon me for being straight,

433
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:56,523
but your familiar is too much of a spendthrift.

434
00:18:56,524 --> 00:18:57,564
You should get a new one as soon as possible.

435
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:00,594
You're right.

436
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:01,724
I will.

437
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:03,354
I'll consider it.

438
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:05,964
You two can resume your work.

439
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:07,874
Okay.

440
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:10,194
Mr. Fu,

441
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,594
you should rest early, too.

442
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,004
Yuli,

443
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:15,964
I have a question.

444
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:17,564
Is there a way for us to make money

445
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:18,914
in Yongzhou City?

446
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:19,724
Mr. Fu,

447
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:21,434
do you want to alleviate Miss Yan's trouble?

448
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:22,524
I guess so.

449
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:23,484
Actually,

450
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:24,803
there are many ways

451
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:25,564
you can do that.

452
00:19:26,284 --> 00:19:28,044
First, you can take care of her

453
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:29,523
so that she can be healthy

454
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:30,594
and happy.

455
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:32,153
Second, you can...

456
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:32,834
You just need to tell me

457
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,044
how I can make money.

458
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:35,324
We don't have any ways to make money.

459
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:36,564
We all depend

460
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,084
on our lady to make money.

461
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:55,114
Sir, who are you looking for?

462
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:57,394
The person in charge.

463
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:58,764
I'm looking for the person in charge here.

464
00:19:58,804 --> 00:19:59,114
I'm looking for someone.

465
00:19:59,114 --> 00:19:59,874
She's not here today.

466
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:00,354
Hurry up.

467
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:02,284
Is she around or not?

468
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:03,674
She's around.

469
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,004
Wang Pengyuan!

470
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:08,964
Hui!

471
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,003
Wasn't he the one

472
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,154
you were avoiding yesterday?

473
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:17,394
I'm no longer avoiding him.

474
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,354
I won't avoid him

475
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:19,914
today.

476
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,434
Hui,

477
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:27,873
I've finally seen you again.

478
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:28,874
Do you still remember...

479
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,913
You were captured by monsters

480
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:31,323
when you were going to pray in Huguo Temple.

481
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:32,044
I saved you.

482
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,324
I remember that.

483
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:34,244
Since then,

484
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,194
you'll remind me of it whenever you see me.

485
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:37,834
You still remember that?

486
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,113
If so, do you still remember

487
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,723
the moves you used to subdue the monsters?

488
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:41,634
Every frown and smile too.

489
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:42,634
Even the wind in the mountain valleys?

490
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:43,594
Even the incense in the temple.

491
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:45,084
You said you would come back and look for me.

492
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:46,483
I didn't say that.

493
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:49,114
I never expected our next encounter to be a few years later.

494
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:52,434
Hui,

495
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,564
I heard from people that you were looking for me today.

496
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:57,394
I was delighted to hear that.

497
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:00,804
Actually,

498
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,004
I need your help

499
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,284
to do something.

500
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:05,804
Just tell me.

501
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,964
What are you looking at?

502
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,044
Have you never seen a handsome guy before?

503
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:16,004
Hui,

504
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:17,244
he's...

505
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:18,874
He's

506
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:20,764
the new familiar I've subdued.

507
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,044
Serve our guest tea.

508
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:24,723
Hui, what kind of familiar

509
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,674
is he, then?

510
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,394
He's an auspicious koi.

511
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:31,284
So, he just brings good luck.

512
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,354
Although he's not very useful,

513
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:34,913
he can at least ward off bad luck for you.

514
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,243
That's great, too.

515
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,594
Drink it first.

516
00:21:40,354 --> 00:21:41,244
Come here.

517
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:43,564
Come with me.

518
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:44,524
Let's go.

519
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:45,594
I'm negotiating a deal here.

520
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,394
Don't mess it up.

521
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:47,244
You should head back first.

522
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:48,834
Go.

523
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:50,764
Just go!

524
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:51,724
Just go already!

525
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,194
Remember to clean the room.

526
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:55,674
I'll inspect it later.

527
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:57,004
Go now.

528
00:21:58,324 --> 00:21:59,004
Hui,

529
00:21:59,564 --> 00:22:01,354
you actually care about me?

530
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:03,044
I'm so happy.

531
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:04,484
I guess so.

532
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:18,004
He's a little dumb.

533
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:19,084
That's right.

534
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:20,484
Just now,

535
00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:21,674
you said you needed my help.

536
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,244
What do you need my help for?

537
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:25,044
Well...

538
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:26,764
It's not a big deal.

539
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,244
One day,

540
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,393
I saw your name

541
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:30,763
on the Richest Clients Leaderboard in Yongzhou,

542
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:32,874
published by the Qijue Agency.

543
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,154
I just spent a little money on that.

544
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,084
I never expect them

545
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:39,354
to jot down my name on the list.

546
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:41,964
A little money, huh?

547
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:44,044
A little money.

548
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:45,484
Hui,

549
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:47,154
do you lack money?

550
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:49,674
Yes.

551
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:51,084
I want

552
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,674
to borrow money from you.

553
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,564
I'll get upset if you say that.

554
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,154
Borrow?

555
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,833
You don't need to borrow money from me when we're this close.

556
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,394
You can spend my money all you like.

557
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:07,284
But I require quite a lot.

558
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,634
Money isn't an issue to me.

559
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,834
I can never finish spending them.

560
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:15,044
Hui, how about this?

561
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:16,674
Come with me.

562
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:17,524
See if

563
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:19,084
I'm rich enough to meet your standards.

564
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:19,914
Is that okay with you?

565
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:22,004
Sure.

566
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:25,679
(Free of rent for one month)

567
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:29,834
It looks like

568
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:31,804
they revere you.

569
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:35,394
This street belongs to my family.

570
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,194
They're just my tenants.

571
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,153
I even established a new business incubator.

572
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,594
Do you want to check it out?

573
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:41,914
I do.

574
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:43,873
However, it will be a bit far

575
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:44,874
if we walk there.

576
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:45,914
Hui, why don't you

577
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:47,324
pick a horse together

578
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,114
with me?

579
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,004
Sure.

580
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,914
This is my horse.

581
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,114
This is your horse?

582
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:56,154
But the horseshoes...

583
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:56,874
They are made of jade.

584
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:58,634
Jade?

585
00:23:59,084 --> 00:23:59,394
What if

586
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:01,243
the horse crushed them by accident?

587
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,764
I can just get a new one.

588
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:04,043
At first, the shopkeeper

589
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,284
wanted to make one with gold and jade.

590
00:24:05,484 --> 00:24:06,964
But that's so vulgar.

591
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:08,354
I demanded one entirely out of jade.

592
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:10,833
If so, how much does this horse of yours

593
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:11,724
cost?

594
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:13,004
It's only 100,000 gold.

595
00:24:14,674 --> 00:24:16,044
100,000 gold?

596
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:18,243
(I can't afford to pay you back)

597
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:19,484
(if anything happens to it.)

598
00:24:20,564 --> 00:24:21,284
Hui,

599
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:22,523
if you're unsatisfied with it,

600
00:24:22,524 --> 00:24:23,834
I still have many precious horses for you to choose from.

601
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,964
They're much more expensive than this steed.

602
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:25,764
It's okay.

603
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,484
I'll take this horse.

604
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:29,324
Okay.

605
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:31,324
We'll take you.

606
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:42,634
It's getting late.

607
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:44,084
Mr. Fu,

608
00:24:44,244 --> 00:24:45,283
what are you doing here alone?

609
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,484
Yuli, you're alone, too.

610
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:47,874
Our lady wanted some snacks.

611
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,244
She told me to buy some supper from the night market.

612
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:51,114
Mr. Fu,

613
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:52,244
do you want to try it?

614
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:52,914
It's fine.

615
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:57,114
Your hand is...

616
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:58,804
I burned my hands by accident

617
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,964
while I was cooking two days ago.

618
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:06,724
Let me take a look.

619
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:23,044
How did you do that?

620
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,154
My element is Water.

621
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:25,484
So I could treat your burn.

622
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,284
Mr. Fu, you can actually utilize such magic arts?

623
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,834
It's not difficult for you to make money, then.

624
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,283
I'll try to promote you.

625
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:31,154
Thank you so much.

626
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:32,874
Mr. Fu,

627
00:25:33,284 --> 00:25:34,634
are you waiting for Miss Yan?

628
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,634
I'm afraid you have to wait for some time.

629
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:40,804
When I came back,

630
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,004
I saw her visiting the night market

631
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:44,563
with the wealthy.

632
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:45,594
Mr. Wang.

633
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,004
She was smiling while chatting with him.

634
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,874
It looked like she was enjoying herself.

635
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,284
I heard from one of the stall vendors

636
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,201
that Mr. Wang might try

637
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:57,194
to propose to Yanhui tonight.

638
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:01,244
Hello, Mr. Wang.

639
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:02,004
Mr. Wang is here.

640
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:08,083
I never thought riding on an expensive horse

641
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:09,483
like this would be so cool.

642
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,564
I'm glad that you like it.

643
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:12,964
However,

644
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,243
it's much cheaper

645
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:17,114
compared to my turtle.

646
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:19,594
Mister, it's been so long since you came here.

647
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:21,003
This is the newest seasoning

648
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:22,083
we imported from the Western Regions.

649
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,194
Please take it.

650
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:24,484
That pepper of yours

651
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:25,523
is worth nothing.

652
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:26,114
Mister,

653
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:27,523
look at our Golden Ruyi.

654
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,114
This is a precious item.

655
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:30,523
It's just a mere Ruyi.

656
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:31,833
It cannot showcase.

657
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:32,914
Mister's domineering aura.

658
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:33,914
Mister, look.

659
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,563
These golden boots of mine

660
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:37,044
are the only pair in the world.

661
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:38,594
If you wear it,

662
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:39,724
you'll be the dashing man

663
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:40,963
in the entire city.

664
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:41,564
Take a look.

665
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:42,964
Mister.

666
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:44,154
Wait.

667
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:45,483
Does your family

668
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:46,914
own the entire street?

669
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:48,323
It's a business incubator.

670
00:26:48,324 --> 00:26:50,154
I'm giving youngsters a chance to start their businesses.

671
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:53,003
I just collect rent from them

672
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:53,484
every month.

673
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:55,044
Hui,

674
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:56,524
do you think I'm wealthy enough?

675
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:57,834
Of course.

676
00:26:58,394 --> 00:26:59,434
You're more than that.

677
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:01,804
Do you need more staff here?

678
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:04,044
Silence!

679
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:14,084
I cannot hear Hui.

680
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:17,044
Hui,

681
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,044
what were you saying just now?

682
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:20,084
Mr. Wang,

683
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:23,044
do you need more staff here?

684
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:24,434
No.

685
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:26,763
But I need a landlady.

686
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:27,394
What?

687
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:29,154
I need a landlady.

688
00:27:30,284 --> 00:27:31,354
I...

689
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:32,114
You...

690
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:33,084
Can I?

691
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:33,914
You can!

692
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,393
Can I?

693
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:36,634
You can!

694
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:38,874
I'm delighted today.

695
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:40,874
I'll distribute red packets to everyone!

696
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,244
(Look at all that money!)

697
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,524
(I wouldn't need to go to the gambling den)

698
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,114
(if I had known about this sooner.)

699
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:11,484
Hui,

700
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,764
you truly can.

701
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,084
I...

702
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:27,634
You!

703
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:32,354
Tianyao?

704
00:28:37,434 --> 00:28:38,244
Time for you to head back.

705
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:40,674
Wait for me!

706
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,524
I'll consider it first. I'll give you an answer later.

707
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:44,194
-Wait for me! -Hui!

708
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:45,724
I'll wait for you!

709
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:47,284
What are you doing?

710
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,244
Why did you awaken

711
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:49,524
my conscience and dignity?

712
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:50,594
Do you know

713
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,153
there are many important decisions in life

714
00:28:52,154 --> 00:28:52,834
that we have to make immediately

715
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:53,804
when the situation

716
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:54,594
is still blurry?

717
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:55,634
Why did you do so?

718
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:56,524
Why did I do so?

719
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:57,724
I was just trying

720
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:58,674
to help that mister

721
00:28:58,834 --> 00:28:59,914
to sober up.

722
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,804
Do you think I'm not good enough for him?

723
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,290
He's wealthy enough that he can fill the sky with gold.

724
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:04,434
Do you think you're good enough for him?

725
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:06,083
And, when he was

726
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:07,044
walking alongside you,

727
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:08,394
his eyes were glued to you

728
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:09,594
all night long.

729
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,524
I assume he truly fancies you.

730
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:12,834
But you?

731
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:14,284
You only had eyes

732
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,434
for his wealth.

733
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:17,154
You have no feelings for him at all.

734
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:19,114
You're just using him.

735
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:21,674
You're speaking as if you know me inside out.

736
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:23,434
Who said I was after his wealth?

737
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:25,434
I'll explain things to him tomorrow.

738
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,763
Tomorrow? You should do it today...

739
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:27,724
Stop it!

740
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:28,914
Tell me, then.

741
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:29,834
They assigned us

742
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:30,874
to this place.

743
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:31,874
Those are members of the Guanghan Sect.

744
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,004
We have nothing to do here.

745
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,874
Why should we stay here?

746
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:41,044
Tianxiang Workshop?

747
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:43,484
It's my first time

748
00:29:43,485 --> 00:29:45,003
hearing about this place in Yongzhou.

749
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:46,803
(Tianxiang Workshop)

750
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:47,914
Mister,

751
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,964
what does Tianxiang Workshop sell for a living?

752
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:52,284
Tianxiang Workshop

753
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:53,564
sells incense.

754
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:54,764
It's just an incense workshop.

755
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:55,594
Why are the immortals

756
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:56,674
of the Guanghan Sect guarding this place?

757
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:59,003
I can tell you guys

758
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:00,244
are new to this place.

759
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:01,963
Tianxiang Workshop

760
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:03,113
is the property

761
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:04,084
of the famous.

762
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:05,434
Feng Family in Yongzhou.

763
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,724
Its owner, Feng Ming,

764
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,153
is the best incense maker

765
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:10,594
in the world.

766
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:12,964
The incense he makes has mystical effects.

767
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:14,154
I speculate

768
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,153
that his reputation as an incense maker

769
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:17,323
has attracted the attention

770
00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:18,634
of an important organization like Guanghan Sect.

771
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,564
If Feng Ming is that amazing,

772
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:22,114
why have I not seen his name

773
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:23,284
appear in Qijue Agency before?

774
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:24,593
You see,

775
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:25,634
revealing your income to others is never a sensible idea.

776
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,043
Ordinary people like us

777
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:28,243
have no chance to see

778
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,764
truly wealthy people.

779
00:30:32,154 --> 00:30:33,874
What kind of incense are they producing?

780
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:34,914
It smells

781
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:35,964
pretty strange.

782
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:39,194
Sorry, it's the smell of this excrement.

783
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:40,524
Sorry about that.

784
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,594
You possess the Heart Protecting Scale.

785
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:54,874
Don't run around.

786
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:56,244
I know that.

787
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:04,153
(Tianxiang Workshop)

788
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,004
Keep an eye on the entrance.

789
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:05,964
Do not allow anyone to enter

790
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,194
without my permission.

791
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,004
Yes, sir.

792
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:20,524
Nine-Tailed Fox,

793
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,324
(Dungeon Arena) how dare you seduce Mr. Lu?

794
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:26,154
I will make you suffer so much.

795
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,244
(Yunxi, Princess of Qingqiu) that death seems like the easy way out.

796
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:36,634
Master,

797
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:38,084
(Feng Ming, the owner of Tianxiang Workshop) this is the incense

798
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:39,723
made from the extract

799
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:40,764
of this nine-tailed fox.

800
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:42,114
Open it.

801
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,244
Fox Incense?

802
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,483
Mr. Feng, you're known as

803
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:58,594
the number one incense maker in the world.

804
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,594
How dare you attempt

805
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:00,634
to trick me with this?

806
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:02,394
Pardon me, Master!

807
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:03,874
Master, I thought you wanted

808
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:04,874
an incense

809
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,724
that could make Mr. Lu fall for you again.

810
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,084
Fall for me again?

811
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:13,804
I just need him

812
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:16,154
to recover his memories.

813
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:17,804
Master, please pardon me.

814
00:32:18,194 --> 00:32:19,323
I misunderstood

815
00:32:19,324 --> 00:32:20,044
your intention.

816
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:21,324
I will see to it immediately.

817
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:23,434
However,

818
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,193
it's extremely difficult to produce

819
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,564
incense that could help one recover their memories.

820
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:29,394
I'm afraid I can't do it alone.

821
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:31,084
May I

822
00:32:31,724 --> 00:32:34,914
borrow the power of the dragon horns?

823
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:36,674
You are planning to steal the dragon horns, too?

824
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,004
Master, you're overthinking it.

825
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:39,523
If you didn't kill that monster for me

826
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,764
back then,

827
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,593
I would have no way

828
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,724
to avenge my wife and child.

829
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,393
Now, it's my time

830
00:32:47,394 --> 00:32:48,354
to repay the favor.

831
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:49,673
I will offer everything I have.

832
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:51,324
Please believe me!

833
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:53,244
Master,

834
00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:54,803
I do not intend

835
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:56,153
to steal the dragon horns.

836
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:58,043
Once the incense is completed,

837
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:58,564
I'll definitely

838
00:32:58,674 --> 00:32:59,914
return them to you.

839
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:01,484
All right.

840
00:33:02,244 --> 00:33:03,524
You have three days.

841
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:05,764
You will get what you desire

842
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:06,804
tomorrow.

843
00:33:19,354 --> 00:33:20,914
Mr. Wang, please come inside.

844
00:33:21,724 --> 00:33:22,724
Mr. Wang,

845
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:25,194
why did you come here personally?

846
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:39,804
Do you guys

847
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,193
have any incense

848
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:42,243
that can boost one's charm?

849
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:43,874
Mister, you mean...

850
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:47,244
I've admired a lady for a long time.

851
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,083
Today, I finally mustered enough courage

852
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,634
to propose to her.

853
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,563
She was going to say yes,

854
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,564
but in the end,

855
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:55,324
she said she would consider it.

856
00:33:55,874 --> 00:33:56,484
I guess

857
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:58,044
I must be too fat.

858
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:00,764
Or I'm not tall enough.

859
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:02,244
Or maybe

860
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:03,434
I'm not humorous enough.

861
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,634
That's why she hesitated.

862
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,084
Mr. Wang,

863
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:11,444
in my opinion,

864
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:13,523
I'm afraid

865
00:34:13,524 --> 00:34:15,194
you're not the issue here.

866
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:18,964
I think that lady doesn't fancy you enough.

867
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,674
She doesn't fancy me enough?

868
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:22,404
If so, I...

869
00:34:22,404 --> 00:34:23,084
Mister, calm down.

870
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:24,193
Calm down.

871
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:26,043
Since you're here,

872
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,714
I will surely solve your trouble for you.

873
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:30,444
Mister, please wait a moment.

874
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:38,564
Mister, look.

875
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:40,563
This is Fox Incense.

876
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:41,524
Fox Incense?

877
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:42,594
This incense

878
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:45,233
was made by the workshop owner himself.

879
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:46,234
The person who consumes this

880
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:48,084
will fall deeply in love

881
00:34:48,314 --> 00:34:50,234
with the first person they touch

882
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:52,564
and cannot stop themselves from loving them.

883
00:34:57,964 --> 00:34:58,564
No.

884
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:00,484
I need to clarify things with Wang Pengyuan.

885
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:01,924
Clarify what?

886
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,194
What are you doing here?

887
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:05,633
They said you were in the backyard.

888
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:06,674
That's why I came.

889
00:35:07,964 --> 00:35:08,634
Great timing.

890
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:10,443
I have something to tell you, too.

891
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,154
Please go ahead.

892
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:15,483
I've thought about it the entire night.

893
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:16,924
I think I still need to tell you the truth.

894
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:17,794
I...

895
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:18,714
Wait.

896
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,633
I'm sure you haven't eaten anything

897
00:35:20,634 --> 00:35:22,194
after you woke up, right?

898
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:24,114
I brought you some breakfast.

899
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:25,404
It's made

900
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:26,924
with nutritious ingredients.

901
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:29,754
Wang Pengyuan,

902
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:32,084
I have to reject you, anyway.

903
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,443
I cannot accept your feelings

904
00:35:33,444 --> 00:35:34,314
like this.

905
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:35,044
I...

906
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:36,404
You should try this first.

907
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,364
It won't be as nice

908
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:38,563
when it gets cold.

909
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:39,084
Here.

910
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:42,754
Okay.

911
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,674
(The Fox Incense)

912
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,234
(has a plain taste.)

913
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:48,793
If you mix it in food,

914
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,634
no one will find out.

915
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,483
Once she consumes it,

916
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,194
she will fall helplessly in love

917
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:56,633
with the first person

918
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,234
she touches.

919
00:35:58,444 --> 00:35:59,404
(Remember, )

920
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:02,114
(you must)

921
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:03,714
(be the first person she touches.)

922
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:05,044
I've finished it.

923
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:13,364
What are you doing?

924
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:14,004
I...

925
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:15,444
There was a bug.

926
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:18,044
A bug flew by just now.

927
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:18,754
A bug?

928
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:20,004
Where?

929
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:21,274
Over there!

930
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:24,964
I don't see any bugs.

931
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:26,114
I don't see anything.

932
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:27,844
Fatty, what are you doing?

933
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:30,484
I just want to touch you.

934
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:31,964
No.

935
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:33,484
I'm rejecting you.

936
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:34,714
What are you doing?

937
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:35,524
You...

938
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:36,713
Just let me touch you!

939
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:37,754
I won't do anything else!

940
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,634
Hui, just one touch. I promise.

941
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:43,523
Hui, stop running.

942
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,524
Are you out of your mind?

943
00:36:49,154 --> 00:36:50,044
What are you doing?

944
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,924
You touched her!

945
00:37:08,564 --> 00:37:09,004
He...

946
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:10,314
He touched you.

947
00:37:12,154 --> 00:37:13,274
Where did he touch you?

948
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:15,234
My hand.

949
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:17,794
Whose hand did he touch?

950
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:20,794
Mine.

951
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:27,084
Did you beat him up?

952
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:28,564
No, I didn't.

953
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:50,754
Well...

954
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:52,404
What's wrong with you?

955
00:37:53,044 --> 00:37:54,924
You look especially

956
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:57,484
pleasing to the eyes today.

957
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:02,964
Don't be ridiculous.

958
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:06,634
Where did you go this morning?

959
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:07,634
I...

960
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:10,044
Yuli found a way

961
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,884
for me to make money.

962
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:15,564
All right.

963
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,844
(Although we've been sticking together for some time, )

964
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:30,674
(it's my first time realizing that he's so handsome.)

965
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:44,924
Why are you together with him?

966
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,114
I've already fallen for him.

967
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:51,313
I will leave with him.

968
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:52,114
(Bai Xiaosheng, Shadow Spirit)

969
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:52,754
You!

970
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:54,044
Terminate

971
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:55,524
our pact of servitude.

972
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:58,234
Just treat it as if I'm buying her from you.

973
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,114
Are you willing?

974
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:05,524
She's just a lowly familiar.

975
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,794
Of course, I'm willing.

976
00:39:15,444 --> 00:39:17,084
Xiaosheng, let's go.

977
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:19,964
I'll send you there first.

978
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:21,594
Send me there?

979
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:28,273
I was initially looking for a couple

980
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:29,634
in which a Taoist and a spirit were in love.

981
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,594
I thought you guys were it.

982
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:34,044
But I never expected you

983
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,234
to break up that easily.

984
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,484
Such a waste of my time.

985
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,043
You're also a jerk.

986
00:39:48,044 --> 00:39:49,404
(Couple Trial)

987
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,884
Such couples

988
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,194
are infuriating indeed.

989
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:07,923
It seems like I need to find

990
00:40:07,924 --> 00:40:09,754
a new couple again.
