00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 16)

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,830
I don't want you

4
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:42,910
to get yourself injured

5
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,600
by attempting to pull out the sword in the valley.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,880
You're not putting in effort

7
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,160
for the sake of a better future.

8
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,110
You're just punishing yourself.

9
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,160
That's right.

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,359
So what if that's the case? What has that got to do with you?

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,270
It breaks my heart.

12
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,080
Not for kids to see!

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,590
I know you blame yourself for this.

14
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,150
I know you feel guilty about it.

15
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,320
But what happened in the past wasn't your fault.

16
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,710
No.

17
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,520
It was all my fault.

18
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,110
No, it's not.

19
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,670
I...

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,870
I exposed our clan to danger.

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,550
It was me.

22
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,320
I trusted the wrong person.

23
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,519
You'd already punished yourself

24
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,550
for many years.

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,710
You should forgive yourself now.

26
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
Tianyao!

27
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,269
Tianyao,

28
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,270
I said

29
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,480
I had to cross the line you drew

30
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,240
because...

31
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,640
Because I still have ulterior motives.

32
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,150
I should've...

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,590
Forget it.

34
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
What do you want?

35
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,870
I want

36
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,590
you.

37
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,320
Me?

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,320
What do you want me to do?

39
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,320
I don't want you to do anything.

40
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,350
I just want you.

41
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,520
I

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,030
Like you.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,470
You!

44
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,230
What type of reaction is that?

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,120
I...

46
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,270
I know.

47
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,390
I know I said that before.

48
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,200
But

49
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,880
I said that because I was influenced by Fox Incense.

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,520
This time, it's different.

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
This time,

52
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,120
there's no external influence.

53
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,320
I like you

54
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,960
sincerely,

55
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,710
honestly,

56
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,830
and from the bottom of my heart.

57
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,960
But I...

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
I don't have a heart.

59
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,640
If so,

60
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,230
I can lend you mine.

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
In the future,

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,640
I'll retrieve your real heart for you.

63
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,710
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,230
Her heart

65
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,320
is broken.

66
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,440
Isn't this what I wanted?

67
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
Stop thinking about it.

68
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,560
I should go to sleep first.

69
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,550
(Tianyao's Mind's Eye)

70
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,710
If so,

71
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,280
I can lend you mine first.

72
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
In the future,

73
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,680
I'll retrieve your real heart

74
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,800
for you.

75
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,510
Yanhui.

76
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,280
I hope that after I retrieve my body,

77
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,510
you...

78
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,750
can live a peaceful life.

79
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
Flaming Dragon Fang,

80
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,960
the sword of protection.

81
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,160
So, you came back

82
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,800
to prove

83
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,200
that my feelings for Yanhui...

84
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,350
From now on,

85
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,680
only a pure person

86
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:31,230
like you,

87
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,320
with the intention of protecting others,

88
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,110
can wield this sword.

89
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
(But even so, )

90
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:39,870
(I cannot let go)

91
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,200
(of my past grudge.)

92
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,470
(I will sever all my emotions)

93
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,200
(before I)

94
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,040
(succeed in taking revenge!)

95
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,229
Why are you sighing again?

96
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,160
You two have been sighing all morning.

97
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,350
Right now,

98
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,470
it's just like what the poem has described.

99
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,440
My heart yearns for it ceaselessly,

100
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,110
even in the deepest slumber and...

101
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,400
Waking light.

102
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,040
That's right.

103
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,320
Even in the deepest slumber and waking light.

104
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
Your sigh is even louder than mine.

105
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,960
You yearn for your love,

106
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,990
while I yearn for something else.

107
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,109
When

108
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,350
can our lord be cured?

109
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,160
He's going berserk in the ring.

110
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm sure he's suffering.

111
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,800
Actually, this is the case.

112
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,680
You see,

113
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:46,280
I don't think yearning for someone is an issue.

114
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,280
However,

115
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,560
there's no need to lose sleep over him.

116
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,990
If it doesn't work out, why don't you

117
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
seek another partner?

118
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,040
Seek another partner?

119
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,680
Do you think

120
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,710
that I'm not good enough for him?

121
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,920
Are you suggesting I should give up?

122
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,110
I think he's not good enough for you.

123
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,560
Flaming Dragon Fang?

124
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,110
Flaming Dragon Fang.

125
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,230
When did you pull it out?

126
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,710
Have you recovered your pure heart?

127
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,350
So,

128
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,320
are you...

129
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,280
Where's the ring?

130
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,830
Before this, we said

131
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,400
we would save the Phantom King

132
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,230
right after recovering the sword.

133
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,320
That's right. We should save my lord first.

134
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,590
Begone!

135
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,470
My Lord!

136
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,079
The Dragon King saved you.

137
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,920
The Dragon King?

138
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
Dragon King, thank you for saving me.

139
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,870
Phantom King,

140
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,750
spare the formalities.

141
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,080
My Lord.

142
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,710
My Lord,

143
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,989
you've finally returned to normal.

144
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,560
I missed you.

145
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,440
Xiaoyan,

146
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,110
long time no see.

147
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,470
How have you been?

148
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,870
Don't pull my hair again.

149
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,990
Everyone, sorry about that.

150
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,960
It was embarrassing.

151
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,149
Since you've recovered,

152
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,589
why don't you explain

153
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,099
the presence of the dark aura

154
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,550
within the Misty Forest to us?

155
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,750
Are you a dark practitioner?

156
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,180
Yes.

157
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,260
And you...

158
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,620
You have a fetish for nostrils.

159
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,709
I had no grudges against you,

160
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,660
yet you attacked

161
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:40,460
my vital point, which is my nostrils.

162
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,099
I'm the largest victim

163
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,030
of the incident.

164
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,780
Sorry about that.

165
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,590
I attacked you

166
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,750
because I thought

167
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,820
you were the villain who annihilated the Phantom Clan.

168
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,620
It's because that villain

169
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,270
was a dark practitioner too.

170
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,460
You're not him.

171
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,550
He's from Qingqiu.

172
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,740
He's a visual spell master.

173
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,620
He lured people who went berserk

174
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,070
into the Misty Forest.

175
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,700
After that, he tortured them

176
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,460
and let them die there

177
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,390
to gather the dark aura.

178
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,430
The forest of tombstones

179
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,270
deep inside the forest

180
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,550
is the place where dark aura gathered.

181
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,175
(Weeping bitter resentment day and night, wandering souls with endless grievances.)

182
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,750
(From Zitai to the desert, a lonely grave faces the sunset.)

183
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,030
However, you need to finish your epitaph beforehand.

184
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,670
I'll carve them on your tombstone later.

185
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,499
No wonder they harbored resentment

186
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,070
before they died.

187
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,220
I understand now.

188
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,219
So, the Phantom Clan

189
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,620
is just like the Shadow Clan.

190
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,620
Both of our clans are victims of the dark aura.

191
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,070
Someone from Qingqiu was actually committing such evil deeds?

192
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,700
Why were the Taoist clans and Spirit Clans

193
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,150
kept in the dark?

194
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,030
That person didn't want others

195
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,070
to discover his evil deeds.

196
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,950
Thus, he targeted

197
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,100
the Phantom Clan.

198
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,580
He used the power of our entire clan

199
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,270
to create

200
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,980
the mist trap within the Misty Forest.

201
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,790
Even we phantom spirits

202
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,670
were trapped within the spell.

203
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,030
We were forced to suppress

204
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,950
the dark aura for the rest of our lives.

205
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,500
Luckily, Dragon King,

206
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,030
you helped us out personally.

207
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,190
Do you still remember

208
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,430
what the dark practitioner looks like?

209
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,070
I only remember

210
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,070
that he

211
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,500
has the scariest pair of eyes

212
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,950
in the world.

213
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,500
So,

214
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,460
do you guys

215
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,310
believe in my words now?

216
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,110
Since you were also trapped by the dark aura,

217
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,500
why don't I help you out?

218
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,709
What are you doing?

219
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,230
Listen.

220
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm different from him.

221
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,619
If you do that to me,

222
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,710
I might die.

223
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:14,740
Yanhui,

224
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,310
his killing intent is so strong.

225
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,380
It's not like he's truly going to kill you.

226
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,110
Fine then.

227
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,950
Since no one

228
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,310
is defending me,

229
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,350
I guess I'll make a move first.

230
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,020
My Lord,

231
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,620
what's happening to your hands?

232
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,190
It is

233
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,950
about time.

234
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,380
Time?

235
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,950
What do you mean?

236
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,670
Don't tell me

237
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,230
you're going to vanish,

238
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,870
just like the people trapped in the forest?

239
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,820
Xiaoyan,

240
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
don't be sad.

241
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,670
It's fine.

242
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,710
This is normal.

243
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,020
This is my end.

244
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,630
I was trapped

245
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,390
by the dark aura within the forest

246
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,990
for 100 years.

247
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,740
It wasn't my will

248
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,630
to linger around for so long.

249
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,190
Now,

250
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,100
my wish

251
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,020
has been granted.

252
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,870
No!

253
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,100
If you vanish,

254
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,430
I'll be all alone!

255
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,779
You're the only descendant of our clan.

256
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,780
I'll leave the Phantom Clan

257
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,190
to you now.

258
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,150
This is the root of the Phantom Clan.

259
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,190
You need to put it on.

260
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Put it on.

261
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,820
No!

262
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:18,189
When you put it on, you'll represent our hope.

263
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,230
No!

264
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,100
I hope that one day,

265
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:25,990
you can

266
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,390
revive our clan.

267
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,630
Show the world

268
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,189
how glorious and noble

269
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,540
the Phantom Clan is.

270
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,820
Here.

271
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,540
No!

272
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,260
Listen to me.

273
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,910
Remember this.

274
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,630
You must stay strong.

275
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,949
Don't dwell on your sorrows.

276
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,150
Never lose hope for the future,

277
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,950
understood?

278
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,260
I'll entrust our future

279
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,020
to you.

280
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,190
My Lord!

281
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,430
My Lord!

282
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,710
My Lord!

283
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,340
My Lord!

284
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,259
Why didn't you erect a tombstone

285
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,710
to mourn the Phantom King?

286
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,539
My lord has been trapped within the Misty Forest

287
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,740
his entire life.

288
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,260
He should be like me.

289
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,870
He should be

290
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,710
as free as the wind.

291
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,150
Dragon King,

292
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,740
I have a favor to ask.

293
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,670
Ask away.

294
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,540
Can you escort me to Qingqiu

295
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,060
and help me locate the villain who annihilated my clan?

296
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,060
Do you wish to seek revenge?

297
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,870
That's right.

298
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,390
The path to vengeance is arduous.

299
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,390
Moreover, I'm sure Phantom King

300
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,540
doesn't want you to live for the sake of vengeance.

301
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,190
I'm not afraid.

302
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,820
Lord of Dark Aura has harmed so many beings.

303
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,429
If everyone backs off

304
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,869
and lets the villain lead a carefree life

305
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,740
because they fear

306
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,740
the setbacks and hardships of vengeance,

307
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,260
there's no justice

308
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,910
in the world.

309
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,060
Let me interrupt you for a second.

310
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,229
I do agree

311
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,780
that we should head to Qingqiu.

312
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:46,990
However,

313
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:48,260
we should follow the order of arrival.

314
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,430
You two

315
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,670
have to help me with my issues first.

316
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,540
Wait.

317
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,910
I think

318
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,820
both of you have missions

319
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,740
that are equally important.

320
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,990
Due to that,

321
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,469
don't you guys think

322
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,949
we should retrieve Tianyao's body before we do anything else?

323
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,910
I can't afford to wait any longer.

324
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,630
Come here.

325
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,020
Didn't I tell you already?

326
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,190
Tianyao and I were deceiving you.

327
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,910
We aren't a real couple yet.

328
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,820
Even if

329
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,740
you bring us with you,

330
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,710
we won't be able to help you out.

331
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,670
However, I've been waiting

332
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:16,100
too long for this.

333
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,579
You two are the closest thing

334
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,630
to a real couple.

335
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,740
I'll only know if it will work out or not

336
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,989
if it will work out or not

337
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,710
by bringing you guys there first.

338
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,780
Moreover,

339
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,259
what if you encounter Suying again

340
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,540
and put yourself in danger?

341
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,910
I can't stand that.

342
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
You don't get to tell me

343
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,740
what to do.

344
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,340
I promise you

345
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:45,390
I'll take care of the dark aura.

346
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,340
But first,

347
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,300
I need to accomplish my duty.

348
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,540
I can't disregard the lost souls of the Dragon Valley.

349
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,540
I understand.

350
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,950
Dragon King, you have your own vengeance to seek out.

351
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,870
All right then.

352
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,430
I'll bring Yanhui with me.

353
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,230
It's not like I need you

354
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,820
to accomplish my task.

355
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,540
But I need her

356
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,500
to accomplish my task.

357
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,870
You should go.

358
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,780
I have to help him out first.

359
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,820
I promised to help him

360
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,390
before you.

361
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,710
You're just

362
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,950
using her.

363
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,430
If so,

364
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,300
can I tag along?

365
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,740
Maybe I can be of help.

366
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,670
Your Majesty,

367
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,060
Yun said you were leaving.

368
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,340
Your Majesty,

369
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,470
are you angry at us?

370
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,190
Why did you say so?

371
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,500
You're just like Mr. Beiguo.

372
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,909
You were hurt

373
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,340
because of your kindness.

374
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,949
We shouldn't request you

375
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,060
to sever your feelings.

376
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,230
You're not at fault here.

377
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,390
The person who let you down is at fault.

378
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,020
Why would I be angry at you guys?

379
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,820
I've retrieved the Flaming Dragon Fang.

380
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,990
It's time for me to depart

381
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,150
and retrieve my dragon veins.

382
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,630
Your Majesty, I can't bear to part with you.

383
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,059
Me too.

384
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,950
Your Majesty,

385
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,060
why don't you stay here

386
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,300
for one last dinner?

387
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,259
We'll prepare a farewell dinner

388
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
for you.

389
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,950
You can depart tomorrow.

390
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,870
All right.

391
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,230
I seek death.

392
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,190
How many times can you revive me?

393
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,100
As long as I'm alive,

394
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,780
I won't let you die.

395
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,990
Take this.

396
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,260
Once you take this, you'll remember everything.

397
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,870
You'll regain your memories.

398
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,020
Everything will be fine by then.

399
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,820
Musheng.

400
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,260
You regained your memories,

401
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,340
am I right?

402
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,630
Musheng!

403
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,230
Musheng!

404
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,060
Did I still fail?

405
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,150
You didn't regain your memories?

406
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,990
How many times can you save me?

407
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,989
Although you've used your magical power

408
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,390
to extend my lifespan,

409
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,989
one day,

410
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,020
maybe today or tomorrow,

411
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,950
fate will take me away.

412
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,100
I will find the Heart Protecting Scale.

413
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,820
I will keep you alive with dragon-scale armor.

414
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,190
No one

415
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,670
can take your life away from me.

416
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,230
Not you.

417
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,430
Not even

418
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,540
fate.

419
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,380
Delicious.

420
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,819
Your Majesty,

421
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,420
will you come back?

422
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,340
I will.

423
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,300
Will you bring that woman back?

424
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,700
If we do return,

425
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,940
it depends on her will.

426
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,740
Eat up.

427
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,420
It's the eighth time.

428
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,940
What eighth time?

429
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,940
His Majesty has been staring at her for the eighth time.

430
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,580
Peng.

431
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,220
Don't tell me His Majesty has also fallen for her?

432
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,340
We should help His Majesty out then.

433
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,100
Why did you steal my drumstick?

434
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,860
I want to try yours.

435
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,540
You recover pretty quickly, huh?

436
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,420
I'm used

437
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,899
to seeing people passing away,

438
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,460
so it's common to me.

439
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,580
I know

440
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,580
that I'll pass away

441
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,819
suddenly

442
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,300
or slowly one day.

443
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,180
That's why

444
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,980
I'll cherish every day I have.

445
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,740
What are you guys doing?

446
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,099
I'm leaving tomorrow,

447
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,260
yet you guys still want to pick on me?

448
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,820
We'll be honest with you.

449
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,179
We didn't treat you nicely

450
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,699
when you were here.

451
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,980
Mainly, it's because you were evil.

452
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,660
You!

453
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,780
Don't be angry. We've amended our ways.

454
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,740
I admit.

455
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,059
We were being unfair

456
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,460
to you in the past.

457
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,659
Now, we're here

458
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,060
to apologize to you.

459
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,980
I'm sorry, Miss Yanhui.

460
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm a generous person.

461
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,420
I forgave you guys long ago.

462
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,500
Do you want this?

463
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:15,780
Here.

464
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
If so,

465
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,139
you mustn't vent your anger on His Majesty

466
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,500
because of us in the future.

467
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,460
Come here.

468
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,220
Sit down.

469
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,500
Sit down!

470
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,740
Why are you hiding in this corner

471
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,580
instead of joining us out there?

472
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,020
Why are you still in the mood to eat?

473
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,740
Aren't you going to avenge your clan?

474
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,980
I'm waiting

475
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,419
for the Dragon King to retrieve his body

476
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,460
so that he can help me seek revenge.

477
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,059
Retrieve his body?

478
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,539
Do you think it's easy for that dragon

479
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,940
to retrieve his entire body?

480
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,020
Listen.

481
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,020
You've been staying

482
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:02,419
in the Misty Forest for too long.

483
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,220
You have no idea

484
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:04,380
what's going on outside.

485
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,060
Listen.

486
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,740
Guanghan Sect,

487
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,860
Chenxing Mountain,

488
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,659
and all of the Taoist clans

489
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,699
don't want the Dragon King

490
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,860
to retrieve his body.

491
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,539
Right now, he only lacks two more body parts.

492
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,100
Let me ask you this then.

493
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,340
Will you be flustered

494
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,660
if you're a member of one of the Taoist clans?

495
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,500
Will you try to stop him?

496
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,499
That means

497
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,299
you should never let your guard down.

498
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,100
Or,

499
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,499
if there's an opportunity for you to strike,

500
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,619
will you try

501
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,580
to strike him down?

502
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,780
Doesn't that mean

503
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,899
the Dragon King will be in danger?

504
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,740
Of course.

505
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,020
Think about it.

506
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,860
If that dragon dies,

507
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,020
you won't be able to find your sworn enemy.

508
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,860
In the end, you will vanish.

509
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,820
How could you face your lord

510
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,020
in the afterlife then?

511
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,180
What should I do then?

512
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,860
You and I should join hands

513
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,340
and bring Yanhui to Qingqiu.

514
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,619
Why should we bring Yanhui to Qingqiu?

515
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,020
Didn't you hear what the dragon said?

516
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,019
He said he required Yanhui

517
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,060
to accomplish his task.

518
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,459
If we bring Yanhui to Qingqiu,

519
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,620
he'll definitely come after us.

520
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,420
By then,

521
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:11,899
I'll force him to accomplish my task

522
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,379
and then your task.

523
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,379
After that, we can go and retrieve his body

524
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,539
without any worries.

525
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,059
And everyone can live happily ever after, right?

526
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,540
All right!

527
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,699
So, how can we

528
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,500
bring Yanhui to Qingqiu?

529
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,540
You drank the dew we offered you.

530
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,780
That means

531
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,500
you forgave us for what we'd done.

532
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,059
In the future, if His Majesty does fall for you,

533
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,980
you shouldn't be

534
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:43,139
prejudiced against him

535
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,300
because of the pranks we pulled on you.

536
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,900
You said if.

537
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,059
If only it were true.

538
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
I hope

539
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,619
we can see you in the valley

540
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,780
again.

541
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,660
What's wrong?

542
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,459
I saw

543
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,140
something weird

544
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,740
over there.

545
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,620
Something weird?

546
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,980
It's...

547
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,700
Why don't you follow me?

548
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,780
Let's go.

549
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,340
Come on.

550
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,260
Where's the thing you mentioned?

551
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,820
It's...

552
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,500
It's...

553
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,460
It's that thing.

554
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,380
Where?

555
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
This one.

556
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,020
This is the one.

557
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,740
This one?

558
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,340
Where is it?

559
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,180
Yanhui.

560
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
What should I do?

561
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,979
Have I done something bad?

562
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,180
Cut the crap. Let's go.

563
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,260
Suying.

564
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,900
Suying,

565
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,580
why are you doing this to yourself?

566
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm fine.

567
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,380
Our priority right now

568
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,540
is to locate

569
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:20,620
the Heart Protecting Scale.

570
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,060
You've already exhausted

571
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,460
90 percent of your powers because of Lu Musheng.

572
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,780
Right now, your breathing is unstable.

573
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,460
-You have to recuperate! -It's fine.

574
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,100
Master, please forgive us!

575
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:29,260
The evil dragon was cunning.

576
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,980
We lost track of him

577
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,220
after the fight in Yongzhou.

578
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,980
I know where he is.

579
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,300
(Pursue)

580
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,260
Master, no wonder you said

581
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,780
he would definitely retrieve his dragon horns.

582
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,860
So,

583
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,900
you were prepared.

584
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,060
Luochuan Dragon Valley.

585
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,260
Here.

586
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,020
Rock, paper, scissors! Paper!

587
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,620
Yun.

588
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,020
Go and join them.

589
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,900
Wait here for me.

590
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,900
No, Your Majesty.

591
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,460
I want to join you.

592
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,060
Okay.

593
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,099
You're using Scissors too much.

594
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,940
You'll lose.

595
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,620
Guys, wait here for me.

596
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,580
I'll return in a second.

597
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,260
Rui,

598
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,140
look after them.

599
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,260
Okay.

600
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:49,980
Let's go.

601
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,700
Yun!

602
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,020
Evil dragon,

603
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,940
hand over the Heart Protecting Scale.

604
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,980
(Don't hurt His Majesty!)

605
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,220
Without the Heart Protecting Scale,

606
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,180
you're mere trash.

607
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,220
I'll wait for you in the Guanghan Sect.

608
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,419
You can exchange them...

609
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,500
(Your Majesty!)

610
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,900
with your Heart Protecting Scale.

611
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,500
(Save us!)

612
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,260
(Your Majesty!)

613
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,540
(Save us!)

614
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,100
(You'd better hurry.)

615
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,060
(I'll kill one of your clan members)

616
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,859
(every two hours.)

617
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,500
Yun!

618
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,540
Yun!

619
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,700
Yun!

620
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,420
Yun!

621
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,060
Come on!

622
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,860
Yun!

623
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,420
Suying!

624
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,740
Tianyao!

625
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
The Heart Protecting Scale

626
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,860
sent me a warning just now.

627
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:45,980
Bai Xiaosheng!

628
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,500
Stop!

629
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,660
Stop right now!

630
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,980
Put me down!

631
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,460
What's the matter?

632
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,140
Put me down!

633
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,860
What's the matter?

634
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,660
-What's wrong? -No.

635
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,620
Tianyao is in danger!

636
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,100
Must you stay

637
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,940
with that dragon all the time?

638
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,020
Yanhui!

639
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,340
What should we do?

640
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,700
Did we get into trouble?

641
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,220
Let me think about it.

642
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,980
Let's go after her.

643
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,140
After her!

644
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,500
Tianyao!

645
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,020
Tianyao, what's the matter?

646
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,980
Are you okay?

647
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,220
What happened?

648
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,460
Where are Peng, Rui, and Yun?

649
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,500
Tianyao.

650
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,860
I'm sorry.

651
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
Starhaven's barrier

652
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,700
has finally stabilized.

653
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,700
So, the seal on the Heart Protecting Scale has been broken?

654
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,380
Yanhui!
