00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,830
Why are you here?

4
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I didn't hurt him.

5
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,830
He hurt himself

6
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,080
to gain your sympathy

7
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,750
and blamed me.

8
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,440
It does sound

9
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
like something he would do.

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,550
I will apologize...

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,470
You don't have to apologize on his behalf.

12
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,830
I don't want you to apologize to me

13
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
for him again.

14
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,480
Did you come here

15
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,710
just for this?

16
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,150
I wanted to explain it to you.

17
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,550
Explain?

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,080
You don't seem like

19
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,519
the type of person

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,640
who would waste time on such matters.

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,960
I wasn't before this.

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,960
But now,

23
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,240
I really don't want you to misunderstand me.

24
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,800
(He doesn't want me to misunderstand him?)

25
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
(What does he mean by that?)

26
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,200
(Don't tell me)

27
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,320
(he has fallen for...)

28
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,480
(No, stop thinking about it.)

29
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:45,519
(I must be overthinking this.)

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,959
(This dragon has no emotions.)

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,640
(Haven't you suffered enough before this?)

32
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,990
I didn't misunderstand you.

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,920
I've got everything ready

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,390
as you instructed.

35
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,080
Very good.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,829
It's time to move on

37
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,430
to our next step.

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,760
Yes.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,239
Is your second uncle still against your idea

40
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,430
of investigating Zhao Yu?

41
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,519
That old fox Zhao Yu

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,550
hides himself too well.

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,360
He took advantage of my second uncle's trust.

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,390
You're a problem too.

45
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,710
Why do you need to

46
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,040
rely on your second uncle every time?

47
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,829
As the Crown Prince of Qingqiu,

48
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,800
you're truly

49
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,430
a letdown.

50
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,040
You don't know anything.

51
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,039
Zhao Yu has been running Qingqiu for many years

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
and has many supporters.

53
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,639
If we order an investigation

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
without sufficient evidence,

55
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,080
it'll cause chaos in Qingqiu.

56
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,270
My second uncle

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,430
is also considering the bigger picture.

58
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,670
Just watch me.

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,080
I can rely on myself

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,270
to make that old man

61
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,080
expose his evil scheme.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,040
It's no use just talking tough.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,080
What's the plan?

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
We'll wait for him to show himself.

65
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,670
That's still not a solution.

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,990
How can you avenge your clan

67
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,480
with that brain of yours?

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,270
Think about it.

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,349
If Zhao could destroy the compass

70
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,200
in front of me,

71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,959
it means he doesn't want anyone

72
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,710
to get their hands on the Ghostly Eulogy.

73
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,270
So now...

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,640
So you're saying

75
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,829
someone wants to steal the book?

76
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,880
Exactly.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,080
You're not that foolish.

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,230
So,

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,000
as long as we guard the Ghostly Eulogy,

80
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
we won't have trouble catching the real culprit.

81
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,790
Bai Xiaosheng.

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,320
Your injuries...

83
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
What happened?

84
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,119
You rested all night.

85
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,199
Why does it seem to have worsened?

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,390
It's the Venerable One.

87
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,559
He found out that I obtained the Ghostly Eulogy.

88
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,150
But I didn't hand it over to him.

89
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,790
So he is angry at me now

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,590
and punished

91
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,879
my true effigy...

92
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,269
Your true effigy is with him?

93
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

94
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,030
He used my true effigy

95
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,759
to make a shadow robe

96
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,230
and he wears it every day.

97
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,350
He even used your true effigy

98
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:13,640
to make a shadow robe?

99
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,879
He used my true effigy

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
to control me.

101
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,230
So I had to do what he says.

102
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,470
Then will he...

103
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,470
He won't do it now.

104
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,879
So long as he still needs

105
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
the shadow robe,

106
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,760
my life

107
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,080
won't be in danger for now.

108
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,200
But

109
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,590
those strands of dark aura

110
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,829
slash my body

111
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,030
left and right.

112
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,470
It's so tormenting.

113
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,910
It's all because of me.

115
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,470
It's my fault that you're suffering.

116
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,270
It's all right.

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,450
If I could soak in the cold spring with you...

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,829
If the cold spring can heal you,

119
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,269
I'm willing to take you there

120
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,080
as many times as you want.

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,520
(This trick of being weak sure is effective.)

122
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Thank you,

123
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,520
Yanhui.

124
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,079
But it's not a long-term solution

125
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
to be under his control like this.

126
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,030
Once I've mastered the Ghostly Eulogy,

127
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I'll find a way

128
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,910
to help you regain your true effigy.

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,880
Yanhui,

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,270
let's go to the spot over there.

131
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,230
Come on, let's go.

132
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,200
It's freezing.

133
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,960
It's really cold.

134
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,790
Sit here.

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,910
You...

136
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,030
Just stay at that spot.

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
Both of you can sit together.

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
It's freezing.

139
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,550
It's too cold.

140
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,600
Where's the warm stone from yesterday?

141
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,550
What?

142
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,640
Yesterday,

143
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,870
there was a warm stone.

144
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,350
I'll help you find it.

145
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
All right.

146
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,669
Where is it?

147
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,840
What kind of warm stone?

148
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,430
It was around here somewhere.

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,190
I don't see it.

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,870
It must be here.

151
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,280
Yesterday, that stone was the thing

152
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,280
that kept this cold spring water from being horribly cold.

153
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,600
Otherwise, I would have frozen to death.

154
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,520
It's over here.

155
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,670
It's here.

156
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,550
I found it.

157
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,230
It's so warm.

158
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,550
It feels nice.

159
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,190
(Isn't this the dragon's...)

160
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,110
Did you guys soak

161
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:57,670
in this cold spring like this yesterday?

162
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,750
Yes.

163
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:00,160
We have to soak for two hours.

164
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,280
But don't worry.

165
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,480
It'll feel warm soon.

166
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,869
(This dragon sure likes)

167
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,720
(to do something good without getting any credit.)

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,040
Could it be

169
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,110
this stone?

170
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,230
Yes.

171
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
It sure feels warm.

172
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,350
I know, right?

173
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,430
Let me warm myself up.

174
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Warming myself up.

175
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,670
(Bai Xiaosheng, )

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,470
(I told you to obtain the Ghostly Eulogy.)

177
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,760
(And you're here soaking in a cold spring.)

178
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,550
(Are you trying to speed up your death?)

179
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,430
Are you all right?

180
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,310
(If you keep delaying, )

181
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,830
(I'll make you wish you were dead.)

182
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,190
You two can keep soaking.

183
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,070
It's too cold.

184
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,040
I'm getting out of here.

185
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,790
Why did he just leave like that?

186
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,360
Tianyao!

187
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,310
Tianyao!

188
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,640
Are you all right?

189
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,790
Tianyao.

190
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,430
Tianyao.

191
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,000
I forgot

192
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,590
it's the full moon tonight.

193
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,190
Tianyao,

194
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,919
you've got your Heart Protecting Scale back.

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,280
Why are you still so weak?

196
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,470
Both of you sure are shirking from your responsibilities.

197
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,039
If I didn't show up without notice...

198
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,640
We were not lazing around. Can't you see he's not well?

199
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Didn't you see us

200
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,190
just come out of the water?

201
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,400
Quickly check

202
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,830
and see what's wrong with Tianyao.

203
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,159
The Dragon King's body

204
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,549
is unexpectedly incomplete.

205
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,550
You can see through it?

206
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
I've been here since the former leader...

207
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,589
All right. Stop bragging.

208
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,070
I...

209
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
Tianyao's body

210
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,400
is indeed incomplete.

211
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,070
Whenever it's the full moon,

212
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:53,310
he suffers from unbearable pain.

213
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,550
But his Heart Protecting Scale

214
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,400
is back in place.

215
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,070
By reason, he shouldn't be suffering anymore.

216
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,640
Today is the day

217
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,430
when he feels the weakest.

218
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,309
And he still forcefully used his skills

219
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,190
in the water.

220
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,950
He deserves it.

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,310
He used his skills?

222
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,520
This cold spring water originates from the Obsidian Riverhead.

223
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,120
It's the purest

224
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,429
and coldest.

225
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,759
It was originally meant

226
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,710
to contain all the power in the world.

227
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,470
Yet

228
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,759
he still forcefully used his skills

229
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,470
to warm up the water

230
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,669
while submerged.

231
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,280
So it's normal for his energy to be depleted.

232
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,190
(Why is the cold spring)

233
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,430
so cold?

234
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,430
(Maybe the water)

235
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,920
(will become warmer later.)

236
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,549
Aren't you leaving?

237
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,360
My legs

238
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,070
are numb from the cold.

239
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,760
(Dragons sure are strange.)

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,520
(You get numb from being cold?)

241
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,399
It's nothing serious.

242
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,160
He'll be fine in a while.

243
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,640
Do all newlyweds in Qingqiu

244
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,789
have to soak in this water

245
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,190
for seven days?

246
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Does your heart break for him?

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,640
No.

248
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,360
Your hearts break for each other.

249
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,709
Supporting each other as a couple

250
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,070
is good.

251
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,830
I'm glad you're awake now.

252
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,040
We've been in Qingqiu for so long.

253
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,119
But I don't even know where you're staying.

254
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
So I carried you back here.

255
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,760
Why do you have to act tough?

256
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
It's fine if the cold spring is cold.

257
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,919
You didn't have to warm it

258
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,070
during the full moon.

259
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,710
I don't want you to feel cold.

260
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,190
I need some fresh air.

261
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,430
Calm down.

262
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,920
Be rational.

263
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,160
I mustn't act this way.

264
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,000
I must not make the same mistake again.

265
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,670
Absolutely not.

266
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,400
Even if I misunderstood,

267
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,310
I need to explain it to him clearly.

268
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
The Venerable One said

269
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,120
I'll take over

270
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,790
what you failed to complete.

271
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,400
Are you the only one who is capable?

272
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,519
The Venerable One ordered you

273
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,640
to confine the old fox from Qingqiu.

274
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,470
But where is he now?

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
He escaped, right?

276
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,920
I didn't expect

277
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,550
you would investigate me

278
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,520
right under my nose.

279
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,640
That's not even close to your level of scheming nature.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,920
Well,

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,360
I may have not obtained the Ghostly Eulogy.

282
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,590
But you failed to keep

283
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,159
that old fox locked up

284
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,550
despite being ordered by the Venerable One.

285
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,119
If I report this matter

286
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,280
to the Venerable One,

287
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,090
do you think

288
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,299
you can still act superior to others

289
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,850
like now?

290
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,380
Bai Xiaosheng,

291
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,420
you've overstepped your boundaries.

292
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,659
If you weren't still useful to me,

293
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,730
I would have killed you right now.

294
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,899
He should be translating the Ghostly Eulogy

295
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,850
in there.

296
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,450
Later,

297
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
you'll guard this door,

298
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,850
and I'll guard the other side.

299
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,033
Don't let a single mosquito in.

300
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,850
Understood.

301
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,779
Your Highness may be rude to me

302
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,420
in the hall previously.

303
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,330
But today, you came to pay your respects to me.

304
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,059
You sure have room for improvement.

305
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,179
You sure do.

306
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,420
Shut up, stupid old man.

307
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,300
I didn't come here to greet you.

308
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,210
I'm here to check on the Ghostly Eulogy.

309
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:56,810
You...

310
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,939
You little brat!

311
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,260
You're so disrespectful.

312
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,540
Just get back to your work.

313
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,380
Stop talking already.

314
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,329
For Qingqiu to have a crown prince like you

315
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,060
is a sign of the downfall of Qingqiu.

316
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,610
Absolutely no manners!

317
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,260
What?

318
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,260
Go away.

319
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,689
Morally corrupt!

320
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,090
I...

321
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,210
It's an omen of the country's downfall!

322
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,209
Don't you think

323
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,260
you're too rude to this elderly man?

324
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,659
He wasn't very polite

325
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,850
when he spoke to my second uncle either.

326
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,419
Look at him.

327
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,180
He already reaches the age where he'll die soon.

328
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,690
You know what?

329
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,660
I may not be experienced in other things.

330
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,939
But we must be tolerant

331
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,730
when getting along with someone

332
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,660
who'll die soon.

333
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,140
Do you hear yourself cursing him?

334
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,609
Young Master Changlan wants to see Your Highness

335
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,090
in the study.

336
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,260
That's it?

337
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,300
It's a trap.

338
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,810
As the saying goes, "luring the tiger out of the mountain."

339
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,849
I'm certain he's trying to lure me elsewhere

340
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,780
and then steal the Ghostly Eulogy.

341
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,570
But I won't fall for his trick.

342
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,850
But

343
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,210
why did he only lure you away?

344
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,730
Never mind that.

345
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,090
I should go.

346
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,450
He won't dare

347
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,610
to use my second uncle to set a trap.

348
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,850
If my second uncle

349
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,490
really needs me for something,

350
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,690
I should be there for him.

351
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,780
All right. Go now.

352
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,140
Just go.

353
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,209
What could Second Uncle want

354
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,490
with me?

355
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,570
I've been practicing my martial arts recently.

356
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,850
Second Uncle?

357
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:02,940
What's this...

358
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,340
You don't have to warm the cold spring today.

359
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,100
With these secret weapons of mine,

360
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,250
I'm not afraid of the cold.

361
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,660
I feel cold.

362
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,620
No, you don't.

363
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,290
Other than soaking in this cold spring,

364
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,970
I have a few matters to tell you.

365
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,730
Firstly,

366
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,770
I don't know

367
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:21,970
if I'm just being presumptuous.

368
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,210
But I've noticed

369
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,139
that you've been acting

370
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,730
like our marriage is a real thing.

371
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,210
If I misunderstood,

372
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,620
that's great.

373
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,290
But if I happened to be right,

374
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,450
please restrain yourself.

375
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,620
We can never be together.

376
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,900
Secondly,

377
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,900
I want to tell you solemnly

378
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
that I'll not fall for you again.

379
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,530
I will not

380
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,860
make the same mistake again.

381
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,660
And I can imagine

382
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,770
how tiresome I would be

383
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,100
if I were with you.

384
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,860
And you

385
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,620
have dangerous things to do,

386
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,340
obtaining the dragon veins and heart,

387
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,659
which are as dangerous

388
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,940
as licking a blade's edge.

389
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:57,970
As for me,

390
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,619
I just want to live

391
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
a peaceful life.

392
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,620
Lastly,

393
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,100
you're a good dragon.

394
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,180
I sincerely advise you

395
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,769
to stay true to yourself

396
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,140
and be a spirit dragon that roams the heavens and earth.

397
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,250
Don't be immersed in worldly emotions.

398
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,940
Being obsessive with love leads nowhere.

399
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,620
All right. I'm done.

400
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Do you understand?

401
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,450
Yes.

402
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,660
Stop it! I don't need you to do it!

403
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,050
Why is everyone

404
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,770
so stubborn?

405
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,660
It's been a day.

406
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,960
Why is Zhuli not back yet?

407
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,940
So,

408
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,420
you finally showed up.

409
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,100
All that useless ostentatious moves.

410
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,000
(Ghostly Eulogy)

411
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,340
Do you think I'll let you escape?

412
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,770
Excuse me.

413
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,580
What happened?

414
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,490
Someone stole the Ghostly Eulogy.

415
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,250
We've sealed off the Royal Palace,

416
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,210
and we are searching for the thief.

417
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,380
Huan Xiaoyan!

418
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,380
Is she all right?

419
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,180
What happened to her?

420
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:29,249
She was injured

421
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,529
while fighting

422
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,250
the thief.

423
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,940
I just gave her medicine.

424
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,010
She'll wake up soon.

425
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,580
What about the Ghostly Eulogy?

426
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,770
Don't worry.

427
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,490
The Ghostly Eulogy is still here.

428
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,010
It's the treasure left by the Queen of Qingqiu.

429
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,139
I wouldn't

430
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,290
let that thief steal it away.

431
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,290
I'm glad to hear that.

432
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,010
This person's aura seems

433
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,290
to be from the Royal Palace of Qingqiu.

434
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,579
I also find his figure and the way he walks

435
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,450
resemble those of guards in the Royal Palace.

436
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,450
Guards in the Royal Palace?

437
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,770
Why didn't you say so earlier?

438
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,450
Tianyao,

439
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,530
quickly notify Changlan

440
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,769
to seal off the Royal Palace of Qingqiu.

441
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,820
Don't let the thief escape.

442
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,660
Why bother going to someone

443
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:12,659
with questionable status?

444
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,969
I've already ordered

445
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,179
to seal off the Royal Palace.

446
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,340
You can issue orders?

447
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,730
I have the decree of the former leader of Qingqiu,

448
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,730
allowing me to exercise

449
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,140
the right of execution before reporting.

450
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,380
The former leader?

451
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,009
It's Zhuli's father's father...

452
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,380
His grandfather.

453
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,820
I didn't know you have great seniority.

454
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,450
Do you remember

455
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,770
what the thief who stole the book looked like?

456
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,970
I haven't seen him before.

457
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,249
The thief was dressed in a purple robe

458
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,050
with his face covered,

459
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,140
and his whole body

460
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,820
covered up.

461
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,900
But

462
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,139
as long as he appears

463
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,420
in front of me again,

464
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,010
I'll be able to recognize him.

465
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,529
How will you recognize him?

466
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,489
When I fought him,

467
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,340
I splashed him

468
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:59,050
with ink to mark him.

469
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,970
The ink

470
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:01,770
on his neck

471
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,660
can't be washed off for ten thousand years.

472
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,010
Ten thousand years?

473
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,939
Ten thousand years is nothing.

474
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,180
(Dragon King's wedding, Yanhui as his spouse) I also have my Eternal Fame Ink

475
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,340
that can leave a permanent mark forever.

476
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,660
But this ink is too precious

477
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,140
to waste on him.

478
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,820
What a terrible Brush Sprite.

479
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,420
I hope

480
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,580
you can help me

481
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,730
find the translated version too.

482
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,900
Please rest assured.

483
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,690
To avoid alerting the enemy,

484
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,179
we can invite everyone from the Royal Palace

485
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,620
to attend the wedding tomorrow as a pretext.

486
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,940
Then catch the thief in his own trap.

487
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,939
In order to avoid more trouble,

488
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,140
I'll let the Dragon King

489
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,450
keep this Ghostly Eulogy for now.

490
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,690
You old fool!

491
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,380
On what grounds

492
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,340
did you seal off my Royal Palace?

493
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,770
Seeing this jade is like seeing the Leader.

494
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,010
Get on your knees now.

495
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,620
You...

496
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,860
Are you trying to order me around with that jade?

497
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,970
It's from your grandfather.

498
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,970
Why can't I use it to issue orders?

499
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,010
On your knees.

500
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,140
What's the matter?

501
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,970
Why are you showing such respect?

502
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,970
You really chose a good time to wake up.

503
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Since we entered Qingqiu,

504
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,730
you two are always together.

505
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,250
Why weren't you together

506
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,530
when something happened today?

507
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,770
What do you mean by something happened?

508
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,180
The translation of the Ghostly Eulogy was stolen.

509
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,940
You brat.

510
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,620
Why did you leave

511
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,490
this lass alone

512
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:48,940
at such a critical moment?

513
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,690
It's not Zhuli's fault.

514
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,290
Earlier, Zhao Yu came to deliver a message

515
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,450
asking Zhuli to meet his second uncle.

516
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,180
Zhao Yu?

517
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,010
Yes.

518
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,490
How are you feeling?

519
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,380
You were away all day.

520
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,340
Did Zhao Yu do something to you?

521
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,970
I didn't see him.

522
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,050
I went to the backyard of the Royal Palace.

523
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,140
My second uncle wanted to test my cultivation.

524
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,289
So I entered my mind's eye.

525
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,100
When I came out, I heard

526
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:22,289
that the old man had sealed off the Royal Palace.

527
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,250
So I rushed over.

528
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,340
On the way,

529
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,580
I ran into Bai Xiaosheng.

530
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
Bai Xiaosheng?

531
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,860
I haven't seen him all day.

532
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,100
He was very sad to hear

533
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,940
about the wedding tomorrow.

534
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,690
He said he wanted to be alone.

535
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,380
He won't be attending the wedding ceremony tomorrow.

536
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,180
He's not attending it?

537
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,380
He did say

538
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:42,730
something similar before.

539
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,660
Just let him be.

540
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,420
I...

541
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,290
Everything is all right.

542
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,580
The Ghost Eulogy is still here.

543
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,690
Since everyone is here,

544
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,420
let's discuss tomorrow's plan.

545
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,339
(Tomorrow is the Dragon King's wedding.)

546
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,100
(Everyone in Qingqiu)

547
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,050
(must attend the ceremony.)

548
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,420
We'll close the city gates tonight.

549
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,690
No one is allowed to leave and enter.

550
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,490
Yes, sir.

551
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,140
It seems that I have no choice

552
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,730
but to attend the ceremony tomorrow.

553
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,690
Is this necessary?

554
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,210
Stop right there.

555
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,010
Line up.

556
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,530
Go ahead.

557
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,250
Wait.

558
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:32,200
(Spirit Dragon Tianyao's written proof to take Yanhui as bride)

559
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,450
Congratulations, Dragon King.

560
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,660
Everything is settled.

561
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,139
Today, everyone in the Royal Palace

562
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,339
must enter the main hall for the ceremony.

563
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,449
Those who are absent and asked for leave

564
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,689
must be recorded.

565
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,899
They can only enter

566
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,530
after the Brush Sprite's inspection.

567
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,250
Whoever

568
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:11,449
has the scent of his ink on them

569
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,290
will get caught.

570
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,490
I'd like to see who's causing trouble in Qingqiu.

571
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,420
I'll never let the thief get away once caught.

572
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,250
By the way,

573
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,900
after we left that day,

574
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,620
did the Brush Sprite

575
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:23,770
tell you anything else?

576
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,690
Is there

577
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,210
any secret plan?

578
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:31,125
(Dragon King's Wedding)

579
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,730
Dragon King?

580
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,690
Why are you still here?

581
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,819
This is your wedding invitation.

582
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,340
They will be sent throughout Qingqiu.

583
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:53,970
Mr. Yan,

584
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,100
you mentioned a kind of ink

585
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,420
that can last forever.

586
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,769
Dragon King, are you suspecting

587
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,660
that I lied?

588
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,530
Mr. Yan,

589
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,860
I have a favor

590
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,380
to ask of you.

591
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,530
Nuptial agreement?

592
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,380
Qingqiu

593
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,530
has never had the tradition

594
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:17,250
of writing nuptial agreements.

595
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,860
People across the Obsidian River do have it.

596
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,290
I see. It's the custom on the bride's side.

597
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,940
In that case,

598
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,860
I'll use Eternal Fame Ink

599
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,449
to write the agreement for you.

600
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,050
It will ensure the nuptial agreement last forever.

601
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,620
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

602
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,180
"On this auspicious day,

603
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,860
we celebrate a joyous occasion

604
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,010
as we begin a good marriage that will last forever.

605
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,490
I pray for future blessings

606
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,770
and a harmonious, loving relationship...

607
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,820
"that will last until old age."

608
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,250
(I found)

609
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,420
that I've fallen for you.

610
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,530
Yanhui,

611
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:28,820
thank you.

612
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,770
"Our fated union shall be blessed..."

613
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,420
with happiness and bliss.

614
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,450
(Where are we going?)

615
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,530
(Dragon Valley.)

616
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,220
Are you taking me back to your hometown?

617
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,249
(After you've become successful, )

618
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,329
you must return the money

619
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,330
you owe me.

620
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,530
Till the end

621
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,180
of time.

622
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,460
(We shall be together and never part until old age.")

623
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,810
"Spirit Dragon Tianyao

624
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,620
writes this as proof

625
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,290
and wishes eternal happiness...

626
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,980
"to his bride Yanhui."

627
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:31,700
(Tianyao and Yanhui)

628
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,140
(The auspicious time for the Dragon King's wedding is approaching!)

629
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,090
Dragon King,

630
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,049
you should change into your wedding attire.

631
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,010
We'll go and gather first.

632
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,180
Yanhui.

633
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,010
Yanhui.

634
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,290
Yanhui,

635
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,180
wake up!

636
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,050
It may be a fake marriage.

637
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,530
But it's still a marriage.

638
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,980
You should take it seriously.

639
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,730
It's still early.

640
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,460
It's not.

641
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,249
You need to wash up, adorn yourself,

642
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,290
and get changed.

643
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,219
On my way here this morning,

644
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,729
I heard from the regent

645
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,139
that they've prepared a wedding gown for you

646
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,809
and even sent someone

647
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,620
to deliver gold, silver, and jewelry as gifts.

648
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,220
This is quite grand, isn't it?

649
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,860
Well,

650
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,770
there are not many major occasions in one's life.

651
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,420
Life and death,

652
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,940
marriage.

653
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:09,770
All right.

654
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,730
Let's begin.

655
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,810
Don't move.

656
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,180
It's been a while

657
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:22,489
since I helped someone with their big events.

658
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,490
Stay still.

659
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,660
Perfect.

660
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
Miss Yanhui,

661
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:47,529
Young Master instructed me to deliver the Qingqiu wedding dress

662
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,490
to celebrate your wedding day with Dragon King.

663
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,730
Miss,

664
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,179
are you holding a wedding

665
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,330
or a funeral?

666
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,530
Huan Xiaoyan,

667
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:05,980
what have you done to my face?

668
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,050
Is it not beautiful?

669
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,329
When I held ghost marriages

670
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,379
for those dying

671
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,529
in the forest of tombstones,

672
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,220
they loved this kind of makeup the most.

673
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,330
They say this kind of makeup

674
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,729
is the most auspicious.

675
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,730
Stop talking already.

676
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,660
Otherwise, Tianyao would hold

677
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,090
a ghost wedding with me.

678
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,050
Is it really that scary?

679
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,420
But I think you look pretty.

680
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,089
Miss,

681
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,860
you sure have a unique taste.

682
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
Of course.

683
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,770
I've refined my skills

684
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,569
on many dead faces

685
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,049
over the years.

686
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,220
Quiet!

687
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,180
For thousands of years,

688
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,660
after the intermarriage

689
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,179
of our Great Leader,

690
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,660
you and Dragon King will be the next couple.

691
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,379
It would be wonderful

692
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,419
if everyone from both clans

693
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,290
could get married freely

694
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,290
like you two.

695
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Miss Pufang,

696
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,090
do you also have someone you love?

697
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Could it be someone from the Taoist clan?

698
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,730
I'm not interested in Taoist men.

699
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,810
I just think

700
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,809
it's nice to grow old

701
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,900
with the person

702
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,050
you love.

703
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
I think

704
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,090
she has a Taoist man

705
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,050
whom she likes.

706
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,820
You shouldn't expose her.

707
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,459
Today is your big day.

708
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,340
Let's not talk about me.

709
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,569
The auspicious time is approaching.

710
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,980
Let me do your makeup.

711
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,650
You may pass.

712
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,340
Greetings, Mr. Changlan.

713
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,460
Thank you for coming.

714
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,260
Why

715
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,530
is everyone still outside the main hall?

716
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,490
Mr. Yan is overbearing.

717
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,210
He set up a checkpoint outside the hall

718
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
and said that he'll personally examine everyone

719
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,050
who wants to enter the hall,

720
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,900
even Mr. Changlan and us

721
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,340
are not exempted.

722
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,420
It's really inexplicable.

723
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,340
Yeah.

724
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,780
Come closer.

725
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,490
We sincerely come

726
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:04,779
to celebrate with Dragon King.

727
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,530
But Mr. Yan

728
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:06,860
is still making things difficult for us.

729
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,050
Let's go.

730
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,170
I heard my father talk

731
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,210
about this old man before.

732
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,940
He was very strict with his rules and was very conservative.

733
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,529
When he was in Qingqiu,

734
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,820
he was very strict with his rules and very conservative.

735
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,860
After that, he disappeared for a while.

736
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,860
And now he showed up again

737
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,260
to torture us.

738
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,740
Come closer.

739
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:23,010
Mr. Yan took such measures

740
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,010
to ensure

741
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,340
Dragon King's wedding can be carried out smoothly.

742
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,740
You should cooperate

743
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,940
and stop complaining.

744
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,010
-Yes, that's right. -You're right.

745
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,050
Of course.

746
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,459
Dragon King managed to find

747
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,340
the secret treasure in Qingqiu

748
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,130
and marry his loved one.

749
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,210
It's indeed a joyous event

750
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,940
that needs everyone's best wishes.

751
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,049
It's so beautiful.

752
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,460
The view is beautiful.

753
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,460
Camellia is Qingqiu's guardian flower.

754
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:12,650
Is anything

755
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:14,170
happening in Qingqiu?

756
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,089
The Taoist clan learned that the evil dragon has escaped to Qingqiu

757
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,169
and obtained the Qingqiu treasure.

758
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,259
Today, he's getting married to Yanhui,

759
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,170
a fellow disciple of your sect.

760
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:22,993
Qingqiu has two joyous events.

761
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,860
So they celebrate both occasions with a sea of camellia flowers.

762
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,170
Qingqiu is insulting us

763
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,690
and taking advantage of us because we have no leader.

764
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,570
You

765
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,649
head back to Guanghan Sect,

766
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,610
gather everyone,

767
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:38,739
and request support from all Taoist clans

768
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,570
to aid Sanchong Mountain.

769
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,649
Master Suying has fallen,

770
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,089
and Master Lingxiao is missing.

771
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,499
If we engaged in war with Qingqiu now,

772
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,729
it would be like hitting a rock with an egg.

773
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,860
What do you mean by that?

774
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,379
How could you boost their morals

775
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,460
at the expense of our prestige?

776
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,569
Qingqiu has repeatedly picked on

777
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,650
the Taoist clans.

778
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,420
If we do not teach them a lesson,

779
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,859
it will be too late

780
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,650
if they cross Sanchong Mountain

781
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,650
and the Obsidian River.

782
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,730
-That's right. -She's right.

783
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,570
She's right about that.

784
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,020
When that happens, it'll be too late.

785
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,130
When all the sects of the immortal world gather,

786
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,130
I will make sure Qingqiu

787
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,570
is razed to the ground.
