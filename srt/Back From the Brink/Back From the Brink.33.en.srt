[Back From The Brink]

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,980
[Adapted from the novel of the same name
in jjwxc.net by Jiu Lu Fei Xiang]

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 33]

25
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,670
Leader Chenyi,

26
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,360
the dragon egg is warm now.

27
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,670
Please help me take a look

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,750
at how Tianyao is doing.

29
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,160
The Dragon Consciousness
is indeed gathered together completely.

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,080
Then how long will it take for him

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
to transform into a physical form?

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,800
All things are different.

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,670
The Spirit Dragon is born and nurtured by Heaven.

34
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,590
It's even more mysterious.

35
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,960
I cannot say for sure

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,870
when he will

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,390
be awakened.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,430
It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,830
So long there is hope,

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,110
I'm willing to wait as long as it takes.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,640
By the way,

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,200
can you tell me

43
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,830
under what circumstances

44
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,960
you succeeded

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,040
in mastering the Ghostly Eulogy?

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,270
Ghostly Eulogy...

47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,550
It seems

48
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,150
I managed

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,920
to control the dark aura

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
after refining

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
the Heart Protecting Scale.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,240
Your strength is so powerful,

53
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,920
and your Divine Consciousness is so clear.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,710
It seems the Heart Protecting Scale
has played a significant role.

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,710
Such a turning point in adversity

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,830
is fate indeed.

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,920
It seems Xuelin was missing

58
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,360
a bit of luck back then.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,870
If this opportunity

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
requires sacrificing Tianyao

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
as the price,

62
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,240
I'd rather not have it.

63
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,640
All right, stop hiding.

64
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,390
You can come out now.

65
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,110
Yanhui.

66
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,830
Huan Xiaoyan.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,710
Zhuli.

68
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,360
Your clothes and demeanor

69
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,590
have changed.

70
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,550
Are you really okay?

71
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,710
Are you sure?

72
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,430
So the dark aura can no longer harm you?

73
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,670
I'm truly okay.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,670
It's just

75
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,550
that Tianyao

76
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,760
has to suffer.

77
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,430
The Dragon King turned into an egg?

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It was my fault.

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
How is this your fault?

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
It's all because of Chenxing Mountain.

81
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,000
I heard

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,470
it was Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain's doing.

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,390
I can't believe he was your master.

84
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,590
How can there be a master

85
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,350
with such a bad character

86
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,000
in this world?

87
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,520
Indeed, there isn't a good person
in the Taoist clans.

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
Except for my mother.

89
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,560
Father,

90
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,710
I know that peace
between the Taoist and Spirit clans

91
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,080
is your lifelong wish.

92
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,910
But now, the Taoist clans are pressuring us.

93
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,710
How long do we

94
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,470
have to put up with them?

95
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,150
Zhuli,

96
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,710
it's a good thing that you hate evil.

97
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,960
But you can't

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,230
ignore people's lives

99
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,830
because of personal grievances.

100
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,270
But look at what happened to Tianyao now.

101
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,910
Are we going to let it go?

102
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,680
Of course not.

103
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,350
I'm now

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,710
the Lady of Dark Aura.

105
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,520
I belong neither to the Taoist clans

106
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,830
nor the Spirit Clan.

107
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,590
I'm the most suitable
for settling personal grievances.

108
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,900
After Tianyao's condition stabilizes,

109
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,380
I'll go and settle the score with them

110
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,100
one by one.

111
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,180
When that happens,

112
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,580
all of you could just feign ignorance.

113
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Excellent plan.

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,420
Enough already.

115
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,020
Yanhui just returned.

116
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,340
We should let her get some rest.

117
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,780
You're right.

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,700
Then

119
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,860
we'll get going.

120
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,500
Come on.

121
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,020
Let's go.

122
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,660
The Fallen Star Platform Deadly Formation

123
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,940
has two keys.

124
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,660
This key is mine.

125
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,220
Master,

126
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,940
what's the meaning of this?

127
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm afraid I have given in to my inner demon.

128
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,500
Inner demon?

129
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,540
Why aren't you

130
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,500
going to Starhaven

131
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,620
to ask Grandmaster for help?

132
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,180
Master Qingguang

133
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,980
has passed away.

134
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,660
I'll explain the situation

135
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,100
when I have the chance.

136
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,140
Chenxing Mountain is currently
in imminent danger.

137
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,940
If I go astray,

138
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,860
activate the Deadly Formation.

139
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,100
Don't hesitate

140
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,260
or show mercy.

141
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,820
But, Master...

142
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,260
This is an order.

143
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,900
Yes, Master.

144
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,060
(May the former leaders of Chenxing Mountain)

145
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,500
(protect my master.)

146
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,020
(Don't let anything happen to him.)

147
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,300
(If the Heart Protecting Scale is destroyed,)

148
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,300
the power to aid the Dark Phantom
will cease to exist.

149
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,340
Master Lingxiao,

150
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,660
-what's the matter?
-Why are you helping her

151
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,020
to harm others?

152
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,740
You don't have the heart
to personally execute the criminal?

153
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,180
(She may have made mistakes.)

154
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,740
But she has never done anything to harm others.

155
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,580
This is the hope
of the Taoist clans and the people.

156
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,340
It looks like this is fate.

157
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,900
Ten years of master-disciple relationship...

158
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,260
For the sake of being together for ten years...

159
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,340
No one can go against Heaven's will.

160
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,260
Please let her go.

161
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,100
Destroy it.

162
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,500
You've driven me to a desperate end,
to the point of killing me.

163
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,380
Promise me.

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,220
Lingxiao!

165
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,140
No one in this world can stop me anymore!

166
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,340
You're such a hypocrite!

167
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,260
Such a strong resentment here.

168
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,220
I didn't know

169
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,580
there was such a place in Chenxing Mountain.

170
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,820
This place is called Fallen Star Platform.

171
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,460
It was established by our first leader

172
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,980
to execute great evil spirits.

173
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,260
For hundreds of years,

174
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,980
we have executed

175
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,780
two millennium evil spirits,

176
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,900
including three Taoist masters

177
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,100
who became dark practitioners.

178
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,740
I thought the Taoist clans

179
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,860
cultivate the right path?

180
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,540
How could they become dark practitioners?

181
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,380
Because they became obsessed.

182
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,060
Obsessed?

183
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,380
Since they had become masters,

184
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,900
why couldn't they let go of their obsessions?

185
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,660
If they had managed to let go, it would be good.

186
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,180
Do you know where obsession originates?

187
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,580
Between causes and effects,

188
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,500
there are many regrets.

189
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,660
If they can make up for regrets,

190
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,140
they can let go of obsession.

191
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,020
But you don't have so many chances

192
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,740
to make up for regrets

193
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,940
in this world.

194
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,060
Don't have any regrets.

195
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,740
Don't do things you'll regret later.

196
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,020
This will be

197
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,860
the first lesson I teach you.

198
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,180
Master,

199
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,620
have you successfully gotten rid
of your inner demon?

200
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,100
I can suppress it for now.

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,860
Don't worry.

202
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,380
I won't let it control me.

203
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,300
Where's Yanhui now?

204
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,180
In Qingqiu.

205
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,700
I'll be away for a few days.

206
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
So help me watch over Starhaven.

207
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,460
If there is any abnormality,

208
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,060
notify me through Snow Owl.

209
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,620
Yes, Master.

210
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,100
Master,

211
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,380
please

212
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,300
make sure to bring Yanhui back.

213
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,940
Stop!

214
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,300
Stop right there!

215
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Who are you?

216
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,820
Lingxiao.

217
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,460
Your Highness!

218
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,660
Your Highness!

219
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,420
Why are you so flustered?

220
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,580
The Leader of Chenxing Mountain, Lingxiao,

221
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,300
has come to our doorstep with the intent to kill!

222
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,500
Lingxiao?

223
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,020
He sure is bold.

224
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,820
I'll go and take care of him.

225
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,500
Wait a minute.

226
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,740
If Lingxiao came to kill us,

227
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,700
why isn't there

228
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,380
any commotion?

229
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,620
He hasn't had the chance to do anything yet.

230
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,180
Tell me.

231
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,100
How many of them are here?

232
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,700
He came alone.

233
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,820
What weapon did he bring?

234
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,540
None.

235
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,820
Where is he now?

236
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,620
Outside.

237
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,820
This

238
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,780
doesn't look like

239
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,700
he's coming here to fight.

240
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,860
I'm sure he has an ulterior motive.

241
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,940
Have you forgotten Leader Chenyi's teachings?

242
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,900
Don't act impulsively.

243
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,140
Why didn't you even dodge?

244
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,340
His attacks missed me.

245
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Why should I dodge?

246
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,780
Are you trying to provoke me?

247
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,540
Even if you didn't miss it,

248
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,060
I wouldn't dodge anyway.

249
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,860
Many of the Qingqiu clansmen

250
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,460
have already died
at the hands of the Taoist clans.

251
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,060
Chenxing Mountain
is the leader of the Taoist clans.

252
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,740
As the Leader of Chenxing Mountain,

253
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,220
it's natural for me to apologize.

254
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,500
Really?

255
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,220
He seems to really be here to apologize.

256
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,140
How pretentious.

257
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,420
His Majesty, Leader Chenyi,
has invited Master Lingxiao

258
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,340
to the palace for an audience.

259
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,780
Why didn't you hit him

260
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,140
for real just now?

261
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,220
He's Master Lingxiao.

262
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,060
How could I possibly defeat him?

263
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,300
Greetings, Leader Chenyi.

264
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,900
Since you're here,

265
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,580
there's one thing

266
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,620
I wish to discuss with you.

267
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,540
Leader Chenyi, please ask.

268
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,340
Saving one person

269
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,580
or saving the world,

270
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,260
which would you choose?

271
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,420
I thought

272
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,060
the world

273
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,140
was made up of countless individuals.

274
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,700
So if we save the world,

275
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,860
we save each individual.

276
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,300
But

277
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
I was wrong.

278
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,220
Not only did I harm one person,

279
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,820
but I've also

280
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,300
put the world in danger.

281
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,060
I know what you're worrying about.

282
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,060
I do have the same concern.

283
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm afraid Starhaven

284
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,380
can no longer contain him.

285
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,060
I came to Qingqiu this time

286
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,740
to ask for a chance

287
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,220
to make amends.

288
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,740
In this matter,

289
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,420
Qingqiu will join forces

290
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
with Chenxing Mountain to face the enemy.

291
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,420
I also have a question

292
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,380
to ask you.

293
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,900
How did Yanhui

294
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,060
master the dark aura?

295
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,980
I gave her the Ghostly Eulogy.

296
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
Ghostly Eulogy?

297
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,820
Yes.

298
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,180
That is Dark Phantom's cultivation method.

299
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,020
Will Yanhui be consumed

300
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,140
by the dark aura and lose her senses

301
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,220
by using the Dark Phantom's method?

302
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Yanhui

303
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,860
is different

304
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,580
from those dark practitioners
who have gone off the deep end.

305
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,900
She and the Dark Phantom

306
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,540
are both masters of dark aura.

307
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,940
They have a symbiotic relationship

308
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,340
with the dark aura.

309
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,820
So they can control

310
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,900
the dark aura

311
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,980
instead of being consumed by it.

312
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,700
So long as

313
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,020
she stays on the right path,

314
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,940
this will be a good thing

315
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,180
for both the Taoist and Spirit realms

316
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,900
as she can help

317
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,700
in restraining the Dark Phantom.

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,540
But

319
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,380
restraining

320
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,380
is only a temporary solution to the danger.

321
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,620
Dark Phantom

322
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,780
has completely taken over Qingguang's body

323
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,460
and amassed 100,000 Devil Army,

324
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,700
only waiting for an opportunity

325
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,020
to return to the mortal world

326
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,180
through Starhaven.

327
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,860
If we want to defeat Dark Phantom,

328
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,660
we still need Millennium Spirit Dragon

329
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,060
to use its dragon fire to overcome it.

330
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,860
Now that we don't have dragon fire,

331
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,900
do you have a way

332
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,180
to awaken the Spirit Dragon?

333
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,380
Yanhui has already gathered

334
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,980
Tianyao's

335
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,500
scattered Dragon Consciousness.

336
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,940
As for when Tianyao

337
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,540
would be awakened,

338
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,180
it still depends on fate.

339
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,100
Tianyao,

340
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,380
are you cold?

341
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,740
Do you want me to cover you

342
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,540
with another blanket?

343
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,140
You've suffered too much

344
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,100
in this life.

345
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,340
I thought

346
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,260
I could share your burden.

347
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,300
But I didn't expect

348
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,700
that you would die because of me.

349
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,860
You even

350
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,620
experienced death twice.

351
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,380
Stay away from me.

352
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,660
I'm scared.

353
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,140
You've never died before.

354
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,100
So you don't understand how I feel.

355
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,420
I even said

356
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
such mean things to you at the time.

357
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,700
When you're awake,

358
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,580
I'll give you

359
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,060
a proper apology.

360
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,900
Tianyao,

361
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,980
can you please wake up soon?

362
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,940
Ma'am.

363
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,100
Ma'am.

364
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,860
Ma'am,

365
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,380
we heard Su'e activated a formation

366
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,580
in Chenxing Mountain

367
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,180
that harmed her fellow disciples

368
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,340
and was expelled because of it.

369
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,340
We thought

370
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,220
she would not behave like this

371
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,780
when you brought her back to Guanghan Sect.

372
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,700
But we never expected her

373
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,060
to do...

374
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,940
She's such a cruel and vicious person.

375
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,700
Ma'am, you must not...

376
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,020
You must not be partial in this matter.

377
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,180
-Please remove her from the sect!
-Please get rid of her!

378
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,500
Are you sure

379
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,540
Su'e is the killer?

380
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,260
It's definitely her.

381
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,940
The day you left,

382
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,500
Su'e suggested going to the place

383
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,580
where the Guanghan Sect hunts monsters.

384
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,940
So I brought her there.

385
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,260
She went on a killing spree

386
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,780
without restraint

387
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,620
like a mad woman!

388
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,940
It was

389
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,060
as if she was the legendary dark practitioner

390
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,780
who was surrounded by the dark aura.

391
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,100
It was terrifying.

392
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,780
If...

393
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,420
If my junior didn't save me...

394
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,540
I witnessed it too.

395
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,340
My senior was killed by her.

396
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,300
-Ma'am, please seek justice for us.
-Please stand up for us.

397
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,180
Please rid the sect of dishonorable people.

398
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,860
All right.

399
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,660
Since you're sure

400
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,700
that Su'e is the killer,

401
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,380
I shall not tolerate it.

402
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,620
From today on, Guanghan Sect will do everything

403
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,580
in its power to hunt down the criminal, Su'e.

404
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,420
She shall pay

405
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
with her life.

406
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,300
-Ma'am, you're indeed righteous!
-Ma'am, how upright you are!

407
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,700
Who's there?

408
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,700
Yanhui!

409
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,860
Xiange?

410
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,740
Yanhui.

411
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,380
Yanhui, are you all right?

412
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,100
I heard you became the Lady of Dark Aura

413
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,180
to save him.

414
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,860
Fortunately, we had the opportunity

415
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,740
to get our hands on the Ghostly Eulogy.

416
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,220
Or else Tianyao and I

417
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,380
would have been in a dire situation.

418
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,980
I'm glad you're okay now.

419
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,900
Look how thin you've become.

420
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,420
But anything

421
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,860
is worth doing

422
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,380
as long as I can save Tianyao.

423
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,660
Now that you've saved him,

424
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,500
you should relax a little.

425
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,420
I would never expect

426
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,940
that the famous Spirit Dragon

427
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,180
would appear

428
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,740
in such a state one day.

429
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,580
How wonderful.

430
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,580
Let me touch it.

431
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,740
Don't touch him.

432
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,700
What if you break him?

433
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,540
This is a dragon egg, not a chicken egg.

434
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
It won't break that easily.

435
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,740
How do you know?

436
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,180
I used to be the owner of the Qijue Agency.

437
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,820
Even if the Flower Medallion is damaged now,

438
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,380
who else knows more

439
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,740
about the worldly rumors

440
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,940
and hearsay than me?

441
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,060
It's said that this dragon egg is indestructible.

442
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,060
Even a diamond couldn't break it.

443
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,340
If you don't believe me,

444
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,820
you can try and tap it.

445
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,100
You'll never know

446
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,700
if he'll give you a response.

447
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,740
Tap it.

448
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,300
What do I do now?

449
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,180
What should I do now?

450
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,020
Yanhui.

451
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:37,820
It's hatching...

452
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,980
It's hatching! It's hatching.

453
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,020
Look at it.

454
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,180
It's hatching.

455
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,940
What did I tell you?

456
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,220
You need to tap it.

457
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,140
Stop it.

458
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,620
Are you tired of living?

459
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,820
Yanhui,

460
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,100
we'll take our leave now.

461
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,620
You...

462
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,580
You...

463
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,260
Yanhui is really different

464
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,500
ever since she became the Lady of Dark Aura.

465
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,700
She scared me to death.

466
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,500
Well, you deserved it.

467
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,140
Don't you feel sorry for me?

468
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,460
All right.

469
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,220
Since the egg is starting to hatch,

470
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,020
that means Tianyao

471
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,180
will come out of it soon.

472
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,940
You scared Yanhui earlier.

473
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,220
So it's only right

474
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,980
that we should

475
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,100
prepare a gift

476
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,500
to welcome Tianyao's return.

477
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,620
Indeed.

478
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,300
My wife sure

479
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,900
is a thoughtful person.

480
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,500
Stop flattering me.

481
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,260
Tianyao.

482
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,820
Tian...

483
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,700
Tianyao.

484
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,780
He just came out like that?

485
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,060
That was fast.

486
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,980
Let me see if he's missing any limbs.

487
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,900
♪Couldn't help but be gentle♪

488
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,340
That's...

489
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,460
That's great.

490
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,060
♪Time stops when you love someone♪

491
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,700
Tianyao.

492
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,500
Why are you...

493
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,100
Tianyao!

494
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,420
You...

495
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,820
Tianyao,

496
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,580
what's wrong?

497
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,180
Don't get out of bed

498
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,100
without your clothes on!

499
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,020
Tianyao.

500
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,940
Tianyao!

501
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,380
Mr. Yan,

502
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,060
have some tea.

503
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,940
Yesterday,

504
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,100
Yanhui brought Tianyao back.

505
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,900
I thought about it last night.

506
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,300
If I were to encounter something like this,

507
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,740
I would be helpless.

508
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,780
Even if my loved one died in front of me,

509
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,420
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

510
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,500
I don't wish to be helpless

511
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,940
if I ever going to encounter

512
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,900
a similar incident in the future.

513
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,540
When Changlan

514
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,420
was in Qingqiu before,

515
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,780
he indulged me

516
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,780
and let me fool around all day

517
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,100
without any responsibilities.

518
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,620
I thought he was being nice

519
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,980
to me at the time.

520
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,900
But now I realized

521
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,700
that some people were just pretending

522
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,220
to be kind and agreeable to me.

523
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,500
But they were not doing it for my own good.

524
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,940
So I would like to ask you

525
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,180
to discipline me strictly

526
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,380
in the future

527
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,940
and help me learn

528
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,340
how to manage the family and the country.

529
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,660
It's not too late to learn.

530
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
You can still learn.

531
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,020
Your Highness,

532
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,140
you've finally grown up.

533
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,740
Mr. Yan, drink your tea.

534
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,740
All right.

535
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,460
This gift

536
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,900
is perfect

537
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,420
for the current Tianyao.

538
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,500
Yes.

539
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,980
After all, you stayed up all night

540
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,900
to make it yourself.

541
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,940
Yanhui takes loyalty seriously.

542
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,780
I'm sure she'll let it go

543
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,020
seeing how sincere you are.

544
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,460
That day, I didn't do it for no reason.

545
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,380
If I didn't remind her

546
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,180
to give it a tap

547
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,100
out of good intentions,

548
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,140
the dragon egg

549
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,660
would not have hatched yet.

550
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,060
Come on.

551
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,860
Zhuli,

552
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,980
something bad is happening!

553
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,860
Why are you in a rush?

554
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,580
What happened?

555
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,580
I saw fire

556
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,540
in Yanhui's courtyard.

557
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
A fire seems to break out.

558
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,780
Let's go and check it out!

559
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,340
Come on!

560
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,620
Yanhui,

561
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,940
what's going on here?

562
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,380
Tianyao, calm down.

563
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,780
Calm down.

564
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,020
That's it.

565
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,060
Calm down.

566
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,380
It's on fire!

567
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:37,940
Hurry!

568
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,900
What's going on here?

569
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,260
The water in the basin.

570
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,660
Tianyao.

571
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,500
You...

572
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,780
It took me all night to make it.

573
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,660
Heavens...

574
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,460
Tianyao hatched out so big.

575
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,020
He's causing such a commotion.

576
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,100
Why aren't you stopping him?

577
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,740
Yes, stop him!

578
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,220
Come here.

579
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,060
If I can stop him,

580
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,780
would I be in this state?

581
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,340
Why do I feel

582
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,700
he's spitting fire at you?

583
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,540
Stay away from me.

584
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,660
Why are you so mean?

585
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,940
Tianyao.

586
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,740
Tianyao,

587
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,740
it's me.

588
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm Yanhui.

589
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,740
Don't you remember me?

590
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,780
Leader Chenyi?

591
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,860
-Leader Chenyi.
-Father.

592
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,580
Don't worry.

593
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,740
I just put him to bed

594
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,900
for a while.

595
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,940
The Dragon King

596
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,340
doesn't look smart in this state.

597
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,820
You're the one who's dull.

598
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,260
Don't speak ill of Dragon King.

599
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,980
How did he grow

600
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,740
so big?

601
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,100
The gifts

602
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,540
I prepared are useless now.

603
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,380
What is that?

604
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,660
I wouldn't know

605
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,540
if a baby or a dragonet

606
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,220
would hatch from the dragon egg.

607
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,900
So I prepared two sets of gifts.

608
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,700
But who knew that such a small egg

609
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,140
could hatch a tall strong man?

610
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Leader Chenyi,

611
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,260
what's the matter with Tianyao?

612
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,460
Tianyao

613
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,420
has just been reborn from the dragon egg.

614
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,460
He's now like a newborn.

615
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
How can we help him regain

616
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,540
his Divine Consciousness?

617
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,220
I'm not very sure about this.

618
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,620
But if you can take him back

619
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,780
to the mortal world

620
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,140
to experience more,

621
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,140
he may grow up faster.

622
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,220
Father,

623
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,900
if Dragon King knows nothing,

624
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,220
why does he only treat Yanhui like this?

625
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,420
Did he show

626
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,940
any affection toward you?

627
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,620
No.

628
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
He has some hostility

629
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,380
toward me.

630
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,900
He started spitting fire at me when he woke up.

631
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,100
The dark aura and dragon fire

632
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,300
counter each other.

633
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
Perhaps he sees you

634
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,580
as an enemy.

635
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,380
It's okay.

636
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,900
What matters is that he's alive.

637
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,140
I'll help him recover.

638
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,100
I have

639
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,460
some divine talismans here.

640
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,740
You can use it on him

641
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,180
to control his actions

642
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,580
and prevent him

643
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,340
from hurting anyone.

644
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
You can have them now.

645
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,820
Thank you, Leader Chenyi.

646
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,740
Tianyao,

647
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,100
listen.

648
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,220
I spent

649
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,100
a very long time

650
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
preparing this soup for you.

651
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,180
You must drink it.

652
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,140
I'll remove

653
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,620
the talismans for you in a while.

654
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,980
You mustn't spit fire.

655
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,020
All right.

656
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,660
What's the matter with you?

657
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,500
I heard

658
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,900
the Dragon King

659
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,700
is behaving like a child.

660
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,020
If that's the case,

661
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,140
his rude behavior

662
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,580
should be stopped.

663
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,300
You must not indulge and spoil him.

664
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,020
What are you doing here?

665
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,460
You...

666
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,700
Yanhui,

667
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,860
he's your master.

668
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,340
He was the one

669
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,500
who put Tianyao and me in this situation.

670
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,220
He deserves to die!

671
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,860
Stop it!

672
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,980
The Dragon King was just born.

673
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,860
Are you going

674
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,500
to kill someone in front of him

675
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,180
as his first lesson?

676
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,660
I will remember that you ever used
the Soul-Annihilating Whip

677
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,100
on me at Fallen Star Platform.

678
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,980
After Tianyao recovers,

679
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,700
I'll seek justice

680
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,540
and revenge.

681
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,660
I whipped you

682
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,500
to save you.

683
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,340
Of course you did.

684
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,860
If you didn't push me over the edge,

685
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,140
I would have died.

686
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,100
I was wrong.

687
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,620
Well,

688
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,740
you can blame me.

689
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,380
But the Taoist-Spirit realms

690
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,060
are suffering because of Dark Phantom.

691
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,620
Only you and Tianyao

692
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,060
can resolve this situation.

693
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,180
I'm willing to assist you...

694
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,780
No need.

695
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,940
Yanhui,

696
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,580
once a master,
he'll always be your lifelong guide.

697
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,220
Since an elder is apologizing sincerely,

698
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,820
you should...

699
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,980
Let's go out and take a stroll.

700
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,580
Tianyao!

701
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,180
His spiritual power hasn't fully recovered yet.

702
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,100
So he won't go far.

703
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,340
We'll definitely find him

704
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
within the Royal Palace of Qingqiu.

705
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,060
This team, search over here.

706
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,220
The rest can search over there.

707
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,420
Comb the area.

708
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,380
Yes, Your Highness!

709
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,300
Let's go.

710
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,460
Dragon King and Yanhui's life

711
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,020
are full of adversities.

712
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,180
Every moment is a matter of life and death.

713
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,580
They always look for each other.

714
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,940
But

715
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,140
fortunately, either one of them

716
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,980
is persistent

717
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,220
and never gives up.

718
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,780
That's because they have a tacit understanding

719
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,980
that ordinary people don't have.

720
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,900
We also have a tacit understanding.

721
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,180
I was talking about Dragon King and Yanhui.

722
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,580
What are you talking about?

723
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,700
I'm serious.

724
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,340
I'll treat you well.

725
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,740
I've studied

726
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,420
under Brush Sprite previously.

727
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,820
I still lack a lot of knowledge

728
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,220
about this world.

729
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,580
But I'll work hard.

730
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,060
I want you

731
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,980
to live a good life

732
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,820
after you become my wife.

733
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,820
A very good one.

734
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,700
I'm not your wife yet.

735
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,460
But you already promised me.

736
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,900
But we haven't

737
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,420
had a wedding yet.

738
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,740
After everything is over,

739
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,860
I will give you

740
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,500
the grandest wedding in the world.

741
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,740
You're holding my hands too tightly.

742
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,820
You're going to be my wife anyway.

743
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,180
Why are you blushing?

744
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,740
Isn't your face redder

745
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,500
than mine now?

746
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,940
You've been eating

747
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,380
too much recently.

748
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,660
I can't even stop you.

749
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,340
See? You get sick from overeating.

750
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,420
I didn't overeat.

751
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,460
If you didn't, then why...

752
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,380
I...

753
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,340
Your waist does look a little wider now.

754
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,020
But it doesn't matter.

755
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,500
You're the most beautiful

756
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,580
in my heart.

757
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,380
I...

758
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,140
You're usually very smart.

759
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,340
Why are you so clueless today?

760
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,060
If you didn't overeat...

761
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,580
I'm...

762
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:05,860
I'm...

763
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,340
Then you're...

764
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,180
I'm...

765
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,420
What? You're...

766
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,420
Am I...

767
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,140
Am I...

768
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,660
I'm...

769
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,260
I'm going to be a father?

770
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,140
I'm going to be a father?

771
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,140
I'm going to be a father.

772
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,860
I'm going to be a father.

773
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,500
What are you doing?

774
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,740
Be careful and put me down.

775
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,300
We still need to go and look for Tianyao.

776
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,700
No, we're not.

777
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,140
Our baby is more important.

778
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,460
Put me down!

779
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,900
I'm going to be a father!

780
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,140
Put me down.

781
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,580
No!

782
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,420
Tianyao.

783
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,940
Tianyao!

784
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,900
Tianyao!

785
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,980
Tianyao.

786
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,220
My apologies.

787
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
I thought you were someone else.

788
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,380
(This person looks familiar.)

789
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,380
You're...

790
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,540
I'm Lu Musheng.

791
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,940
(The one Suying loves.)

792
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,140
Lu Musheng?

793
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,860
And you are...

794
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,700
I'm Yanhui.

795
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,700
Have you seen Tianyao around?

796
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,580
No.

797
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
I came

798
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,140
to bring flowers

799
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,700
to mourn Yunxi.

800
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,660
But you mistook me for someone else.

801
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,860
I'm sorry about that.

802
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,540
It's okay.

803
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,300
You have a deep affection

804
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,740
for Princess Yunxi.

805
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,380
We've been married for 20 years.

806
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,260
I thought I would pass away before her.

807
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,700
But I didn't expect...

808
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,620
Every day I would bring

809
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,940
some things here

810
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,860
to express my longing for her,

811
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,180
hoping to use the supernatural or divine powers

812
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,260
to let her come to me

813
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,460
in my dreams.

814
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,620
Even if it's only once.

815
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,460
My days are numbered,

816
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,900
and I'm afraid

817
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,100
I can't live to the day I meet her in my dream.

818
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,660
I've mastered the Ghostly Eulogy

819
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,580
and become the Lady of Dark Aura.

820
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,220
If you want,

821
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,140
perhaps

822
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,300
I can extend your life.

823
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,740
No need for the trouble.

824
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,380
To me,

825
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,180
this is the best for me.

826
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,940
Then,

827
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,140
I shall not be in your way.

828
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,540
The Spirit Dragon was just born.

829
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,540
So everything is unfamiliar to him.

830
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,820
Perhaps he's hiding

831
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,020
because he's afraid.

832
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,540
He should be hiding

833
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,220
in a place he finds to be the safest.

834
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,940
(He can't go far
because his spiritual power hasn't recovered.)

835
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,500
(The safest place?)

836
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,260
(No place is safer than the Royal Palace)

837
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,580
(since there are least people here.)

838
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,940
Thank you for reminding me.

839
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,220
I hope you both will live
happily together forever

840
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,780
and never be separated.

841
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Tianyao!

842
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,420
Tianyao.

843
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
It's okay.

844
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,180
I won't hurt you.

845
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,380
Don't move.

846
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,700
See?

847
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,260
I'm not going to hurt you.

848
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,700
Listen carefully.

849
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,700
Down below

850
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,260
is a very deep cliff.

851
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,180
It will hurt a lot if you fall.

852
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,420
Let's not go that way.

853
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,060
All right?

854
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,100
Tianyao!

855
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,540
Tianyao,

856
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,140
you don't like this, do you?

857
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,860
Tianyao, watch.

858
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,260
It's gone.

859
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,420
Tianyao,

860
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,700
it's all gone.

861
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,780
You don't like it.

862
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,380
So I put it away, right?

863
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,500
Tianyao,

864
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,300
why is your face injured?

865
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,220
Does it hurt?

866
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,620
Why don't I apply some ointment for you?

867
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,340
It won't hurt after you apply it.

868
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,740
Smell it.

869
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,100
It's aromatic.

870
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,940
It doesn't stink.

871
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,860
Besides,

872
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,540
your injuries won't hurt
after you apply it on them.

873
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
It smells nice, right?

874
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,700
This is a medicinal ointment.

875
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,020
So I'll apply it on you.

876
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,740
Is that all right with you?

877
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,740
Your injuries won't hurt after I apply it on them.

878
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,860
Here I go.

879
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,860
(This burning pain...)

880
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,420
(Indeed,)

881
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,500
(I'll get burned for touching him)

882
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,500
(since I'm the Lady of Dark Aura now.)

883
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,820
It's all right.

884
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,500
I'll keep applying the ointment on you.
