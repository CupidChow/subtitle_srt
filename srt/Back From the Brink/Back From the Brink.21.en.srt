(Yanhui's Promissory Note)

4
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,470
I lost money

5
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,240
at the gambling stall

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
and owed you some money, right?

7
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,750
But I don't have money now.

8
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,110
Let me give you a promissory note first.

9
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,910
I'll definitely pay you back when I have the money.

10
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,360
Sit down first.

11
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,240
Sit down.

12
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,470
Yanhui,

13
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,470
you're so nice to me.

14
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,830
It's only right to repay debts.

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,080
All I did is give you a promissory note.

16
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,920
Is that considered nice to you?

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,990
Of course.

18
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,240
But I don't think

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,150
this promissory note is necessary.

20
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,390
No, you must keep it.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
A loan is a loan.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,870
My gambling luck may be bad.

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,040
But I still need

24
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,550
to keep my word.

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,040
All right, then.

26
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,550
I'll keep it then.

27
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,670
I also have something to discuss with you.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,590
Our relationship

29
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,110
did not make much progress

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,320
in these few days.

31
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,200
But we do know each other better now.

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,990
I don't have much time left.

33
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,800
So let's go and give it a try.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,960
Who knows, maybe we'll succeed?

35
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,040
All right, I'll do

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,200
whatever you want to do.

37
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,430
As expected from a professional.

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,800
You sure can adjust your state in such a quick manner.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,960
I should do the same too.

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,520
We can leave once you're ready.

41
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,760
Xiaosheng, let's go.

(Compendium of Spirit Clan's Magical Artifacts)

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,710
Is this not the right technique?

46
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,760
I still can't activate it.

47
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,960
How am I supposed to activate you?

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,590
It's working now.

49
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,150
It is.

50
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,480
It's heading in that direction.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,710
After it.

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
That direction is...

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,830
What's wrong?

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,200
It's the place my father goes into seclusion.

55
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,270
Your father? The Great Leader?

56
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,670
Could the visual spell master your father?

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,670
That's impossible. Don't talk nonsense.

58
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,200
I'll go over and take a look first.

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,029
How dare you stop me?

60
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,880
This is where His Majesty, the Leader of Qingqiu practices in seclusion.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,560
Your Highness,

62
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,830
please go somewhere else to play.

63
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,320
I'm not here to play.

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,850
Move aside!

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,320
What...

66
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,730
Zhuli.

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,760
Tell me.

68
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,240
Who is he?

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,050
His Highness, the Crown Prince.

70
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,880
Then who's inside?

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,490
The Leader of Qingqiu.

72
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,440
What's their relationship?

73
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,440
Why? Don't you know?

74
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,850
They're father and son.

75
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,200
The son comes to visit his father

76
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,530
out of filial piety.

77
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,200
Why are you two trying

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,170
to stop him?

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,880
That's right.

80
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,000
I haven't seen my father for more than ten years.

81
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,090
I came by to visit because I miss him.

82
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,120
How dare you stop me?

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Let me pass quickly.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
But...

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
Mr. Zhao ordered us to guard this place

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,930
and not let anyone disturb His Majesty's cultivation.

87
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,560
I hope Your Highness

88
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,760
won't make things difficult for us.

89
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,320
I was wondering who gave you the order.

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,560
It turns out to be that old man, Zhao Yu.

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,440
Are you saying

92
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,610
Qingqiu has a new ruler now?

93
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,880
-Please forgive us. -Please forgive us.

94
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,000
-We don't think of it that way. -We don't think of it that way.

95
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
The compass wants to break in.

96
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,290
Could it be that the visual spell master

97
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,360
is inside?

98
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,880
Who is making a commotion?

99
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,357
Why are you here?

100
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,237
Give me back the compass!

101
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:20,117
Give it back!

102
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,437
Your Highness, please stop making a scene.

103
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:24,557
You're the one making a scene.

104
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:25,997
This is my mother's compass.

105
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:26,917
The compass points to a place

106
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:28,407
where dark aurae and evil spirits are at work.

107
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,327
Mr. Zhao, you first hindered me in every way,

108
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:31,437
and now you snatched my compass.

109
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,727
Could it be that you're sheltering evil spirits?

110
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,327
That's utter nonsense.

111
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,287
Qingqiu has been peaceful for many years.

112
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:38,677
How could there be evil spirits?

113
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,237
It must be this inferior object

114
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,287
that you found somewhere

115
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:43,607
that misled you.

116
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:45,797
It should be destroyed.

117
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:47,367
Don't you dare!

118
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,387
You're trying to destroy it because you're guilty.

119
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:51,557
Let go!

120
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,987
My mother's magic artifact.

121
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:19,837
Mr. Zhao,

122
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:21,197
His Majesty has long decreed

123
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:22,837
to treat Madam Xuelin's possessions well.

124
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:24,347
But you...

125
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,717
Her belongings have been properly preserved

126
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:27,787
in her chamber

127
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,316
in an orderly manner.

128
00:07:29,317 --> 00:07:30,277
Back then,

129
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,317
His Majesty personally sealed and stored them.

130
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,717
How could there be

131
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,667
such an inferior object scattered elsewhere?

132
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,427
Your Highness is used to behaving ridiculously.

133
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,667
You actually wanted

134
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:38,987
to use such an unfounded reason

135
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,277
to slander me.

136
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,197
Forget it.

137
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:44,227
If I pursue this,

138
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,547
it'll disrupt His Majesty's cultivation.

139
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:48,867
Your Highness,

140
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,027
please leave.

141
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,907
What's wrong?

142
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,157
What's happening to the screen?

143
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:11,427
I don't know.

144
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,227
This never happened before.

145
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,397
The illusion inside the screen is abnormal.

146
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,397
I'll go with you.

147
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:22,637
Why are you here?

148
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:23,757
How did you get in here?

149
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,107
Breaking your illusion formation wasn't difficult.

150
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:29,157
Our priority now

151
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:30,197
is to take the book.

152
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:31,677
I'll help you break the formation.

153
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:32,347
We must go now.

154
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,467
I know I shouldn't show up in front of you.

155
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:42,987
But the situation is urgent.

156
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,147
After you get the Ghostly Eulogy,

157
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,317
I'll leave

158
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,107
after you've recovered.

159
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,597
This will be the last time.

160
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,507
After obtaining the Ghostly Eulogy,

161
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:56,717
we will go

162
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:57,987
our separate ways.

163
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:01,717
Can three people

164
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:03,627
enter this screen?

165
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:06,837
There's no rule stating that we can't.

166
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:31,467
It's the same in here

167
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:32,837
as it is outside.

168
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:33,957
It's getting unstable now.

169
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:37,747
You're right.

170
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,627
It seems like we can't afford to lose anymore.

171
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:43,227
How do you plan to pass the test?

172
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,867
So there are three of you now?

173
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:51,987
Listen to me, old man.

174
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:53,507
This screen's secret realm

175
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,147
is not stable right now.

176
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,467
I think it's about to collapse.

177
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:56,627
If you don't want to perish

178
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:58,437
with this screen,

179
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,227
I suggest you

180
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:00,197
just give me

181
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:01,037
the secret treasure.

182
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,467
I'm entrusted with the task of guarding the secret treasure here

183
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:05,227
by an old friend.

184
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:07,717
I won't abandon it

185
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,717
even if the world falls apart outside,

186
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,957
or if this screen's secret realm disappears

187
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,627
in the next moment.

188
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:17,107
I can't let unworthy people

189
00:10:17,227 --> 00:10:18,227
take it away

190
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,987
even if it means I have to perish

191
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:22,917
with the secret treasure.

192
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:25,797
I am willing to take the risk.

193
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:28,987
Stubborn fool.

194
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,467
If that's the case,

195
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,077
please give us your questions.

196
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,347
We don't have time to waste.

197
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,597
Three of you.

198
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:39,467
No wonder I felt something was off between this young lass

199
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,867
and this little sly fox last time.

200
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,197
So it's about the relationship

201
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:45,796
between the three of you.

202
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:47,467
In that case,

203
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,347
I have a question

204
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,746
that I can ask now.

205
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:51,597
All right. Be quick about it.

206
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:53,267
Can you just cut the crap?

207
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:55,747
In this love triangle relationship

208
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,107
between the three of you,

209
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,717
if the other two people

210
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,317
abandoned you

211
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:05,837
and got together,

212
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:07,987
what would you do?

213
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:14,987
(They two in a relationship?)

214
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,987
(Won't it be weird?)

215
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,077
(I'll choose to leave quietly.)

216
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,437
(I tried)

217
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:22,837
(so hard)

218
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:24,107
(to bring them two together back then.)

219
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,107
(But this dragon)

220
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,437
(dug her heart out.)

221
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:28,077
(Can they still be together after that?)

222
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:29,557
(Of course I must separate them.)

223
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:30,717
(This dragon doesn't deserve her.)

224
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:31,597
(But I do.)

225
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:32,957
Are you done thinking?

226
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,227
I'll count from three to one.

227
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:37,347
Three.

228
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:45,717
Two.

229
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:50,677
One.

230
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,317
-Of course I'll leave... -I'll separate them.

231
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:52,227
I'll wish them happiness.

232
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,627
The correct answer

233
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,227
is to wish them happiness.

234
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:03,717
What?

235
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:06,147
Wish them happiness?

236
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:08,037
The chemistry

237
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:09,746
between the three of you is a mess.

238
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:10,987
None of you

239
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:11,987
can stay together

240
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,077
peacefully.

241
00:12:13,197 --> 00:12:14,197
Wait a minute, old man.

242
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,957
This thing

243
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,077
is subjective.

244
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,797
There's no correct answer.

245
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:19,837
That's right.

246
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:21,467
How can one wish them happiness?

247
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:22,837
How big-hearted can a person be?

248
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:24,957
He... He doesn't count.

249
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,037
He's an exception.

250
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:27,037
There's no right or wrong answer

251
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:28,197
since it's subjective.

252
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:30,917
There's no point arguing.

253
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:33,596
In my opinion,

254
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:35,227
I guess the person

255
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:36,987
whom the former owner anticipated

256
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:39,387
didn't come to take the treasure.

257
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,867
All the grudges and grievances

258
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,747
should end here.

259
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:45,317
No, you can't do that.

260
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,107
Please give us another chance.

261
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:48,037
Let us try one more time.

262
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:49,347
Just one more time.

263
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:52,317
(The screen can't hold up)

264
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:53,467
(for much longer.)

265
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,557
Flaming Dragon Fang?

266
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:01,677
You're the Spirit Dragon, Tianyao?

267
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:03,627
What do you want to do?

268
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:04,507
You...

269
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:05,837
Please forgive me.

270
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,197
What are you doing?

271
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,437
We can pass the trial this way too?

272
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,147
We have no second chance here.

273
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,267
You must obtain the Ghostly Eulogy.

274
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:28,837
I won't let anyone

275
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:29,797
get in your way.

276
00:13:30,747 --> 00:13:31,467
I'll make sure

277
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:32,557
you live well.

278
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:47,677
How dare that old fool

279
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:49,507
to humiliate me like that!

280
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:51,317
When I become the Leader,

281
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,037
I'll humiliate him in return!

282
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,507
How do you plan to humiliate him?

283
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,077
Pull down his pants

284
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:00,917
and carve "Screw You"

285
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:01,597
on his bottom.

286
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:02,347
"Screw you?"

287
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:04,077
Then make him run

288
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,197
five hundred laps around the palace.

289
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:06,147
Five hundred laps?

290
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:08,507
You...

291
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,037
I was messing with you.

292
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,957
With a crown prince like you, I wonder

293
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,267
if the Qingqiu is blessed or cursed.

294
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,507
What did you say?

295
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:16,837
I said

296
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,317
you're a grown-up now.

297
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:20,037
You'll have to ascend the throne one day.

298
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,037
You can't cry

299
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:22,267
when someone bullied you.

300
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:23,267
Don't you feel ashamed at all?

301
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:27,597
I'll stop crying.

302
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:30,107
There, there.

303
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:31,627
Do you think

304
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,437
Zhao Yu is the person

305
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:34,627
I want to take revenge on?

306
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,147
In any case, he's definitely my enemy.

307
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,267
I'm being serious here.

308
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:40,557
He's always at the palace.

309
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:42,147
If he really practices evil arts,

310
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:42,677
everyone in the palace

311
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:44,037
would know about it.

312
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,347
There must be more to it than meets the eye.

313
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:47,747
What do you mean?

314
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:48,557
Have you forgotten

315
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:50,437
that your compass can absorb dark aurae?

316
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,677
Yanhui! Dragon King!

317
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:01,227
(Last time, the Dragon King and the rest)

318
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:02,596
(were sucked into the compass.)

319
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:03,467
(Didn't it take us a lot of effort)

320
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:04,557
(to get them out?)

321
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,910
However,

322
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:07,917
this time the compass didn't seem to be reacting.

323
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,797
(I thought it was strange.)

324
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:12,227
(Since the compass)

325
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:14,197
(was following the dark aura, )

326
00:15:14,317 --> 00:15:15,677
(why didn't it suck him in?)

327
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:17,957
(Or is it because he is not)

328
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,317
(the one the compass is looking for?)

329
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:26,507
But besides him,

330
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,227
there is no one else

331
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,387
where the compass is pointing.

332
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,147
Could it be the Great Leader

333
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,717
who's cultivating inside?

334
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:35,877
Don't talk nonsense.

335
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:37,877
I know it's not your father.

336
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,956
Isn't it obvious

337
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,307
who's the most suspicious, right?

338
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,307
If it really is him,

339
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:46,957
then Qingqiu will be in danger.

340
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:59,877
"Completing this path will lead to victory."

341
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,427
That's it?

342
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:08,837
This is the first time

343
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,637
I'm facing the second trial's disruption technique.

344
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,837
I don't know what secrets are hidden within it.

345
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:19,717
The spiritual energy on the screen

346
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:20,597
is getting weaker and weaker.

347
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:22,757
We don't have time to think, let's go.

348
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,427
It's so dark here.

349
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,307
Everyone, be careful not to get separated.

350
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,637
This is my first time here too.

351
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:49,757
Yanhui.

352
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:52,077
Yanhui, what's wrong?

353
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:02,987
That's weird.

354
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,387
They were walking in front of me.

355
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,037
Why am I alone now?

356
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:18,637
Where are they?

357
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:22,597
Why are they gone?

358
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,227
(This place)

359
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,467
(is not as simple as it seems.)

360
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:44,597
It's not working.

361
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,317
I can't use magic here.

362
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:55,707
I'll move forward, then.

363
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:01,467
"Completing this path will lead to victory."

364
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:10,077
"Completing this path will lead to victory."

365
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,517
(Could it be)

366
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,317
(that they're also trapped in this darkness like me?)

367
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:00,987
Go back.

368
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:03,277
Who are you?

369
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,797
I am a guide.

370
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,667
If you are a guide,

371
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,077
why are you advising me to stop?

372
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,907
I do not wish to see others

373
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:11,147
get trapped in this place.

374
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:14,517
Who are you?

375
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,317
I'm a guide.

376
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:18,707
You sure are a pitiful man.

377
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,317
I don't want to see you fall into the abyss.

378
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,187
The abyss?

379
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,227
What do you mean?

380
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,797
This road has no end.

381
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,747
If you keep going,

382
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:32,907
you'll only fall into endless darkness.

383
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,557
Only those who turn back

384
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:36,797
can leave alive.

385
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:41,147
Please turn back now.

386
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,947
The person you love has already turned back.

387
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:48,877
If you keep going,

388
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,837
you'll never get out.

389
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:53,667
She'll not turn back.

390
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,797
Do you trust her that much?

391
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:56,747
Yes.

392
00:19:58,387 --> 00:19:59,667
I may doubt the whole world.

393
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:01,877
But she's the only one I trust.

394
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:04,187
She's not worth your trust.

395
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:08,357
Whether she's worth it or not,

396
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:10,667
it's for me to judge.

397
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,947
Your companions have already left.

398
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:26,637
If you continue to go forward,

399
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,277
you'll be trapped here

400
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,277
like me forever.

401
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,117
(Sheng, )

402
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,987
(let's play hide and seek.)

403
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,467
Stand still.

404
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,037
Count to one hundred

405
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:41,907
and I'll come to find you.

406
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:05,837
I think I've been walking

407
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,907
for almost four hours now.

408
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:10,187
Why is it still so dark?

409
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:19,037
I've arrived.

410
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,467
(Xuelin?)

411
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,637
(Your mother is Xuelin?)

412
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:35,557
(Insolent!)

413
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:37,117
How dare you address my mother by her name?

414
00:21:37,637 --> 00:21:39,747
(I didn't expect you to come to Qingqiu)

415
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,077
(Lin) (and ended up as the Queen of Qingqiu.)

416
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,427
You're the Queen of Qingqiu?

417
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:46,797
What are you doing here?

418
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:47,907
I don't wish to see anyone

419
00:21:48,077 --> 00:21:49,147
trapped in this place.

420
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,907
This road has no end.

421
00:21:52,357 --> 00:21:53,516
Only those who turn back

422
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:54,637
can leave alive.

423
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,117
They have all left.

424
00:21:58,637 --> 00:21:59,557
If you don't leave now,

425
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:00,877
you'll be trapped forever.

426
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:04,227
But didn't the words at the entrance tell us

427
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,597
to just walk to the end?

428
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:06,557
You can't reach the end.

429
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:08,667
There is only endless darkness here.

430
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:09,837
Wait.

431
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:11,277
-If you continue moving forward, -Hold on.

432
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:13,077
You'll be trapped in here forever.

433
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:13,947
Wait a minute.

434
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,187
Thank you for your kindness.

435
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:20,667
But I still want to complete this.

436
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:22,117
Forget about this.

437
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:22,907
I have some questions

438
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:23,637
to ask you.

439
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:24,987
Do you have a secret treasure?

440
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:26,037
Is it a compass?

441
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,117
When I was inside,

442
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,667
I saw you and two men.

443
00:22:28,837 --> 00:22:29,747
You were laying a formation.

444
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:30,987
Are you trying to seal someone?

445
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:31,987
What's going on?

446
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:33,837
Does that person

447
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:34,987
have a dark aura?

448
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,467
Is it related to "Ghostly Eulogy?"

449
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:40,636
Does shaking your head means you're related

450
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:41,837
or not?

451
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:44,637
Don't ask too many questions. Go now.

452
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,666
If you don't leave now, it'll be too late.

453
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,797
I asked you so many questions.

454
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,387
Can't you at least answer one of my questions?

455
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:50,187
Just leave.

456
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,077
The screen is yours.

457
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:54,427
This secret realm is also yours.

458
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:56,117
You're the one who told us to take the tunnel.

459
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:57,637
You're also the one who wants us to leave.

460
00:22:57,797 --> 00:22:58,837
What on earth is this?

461
00:22:58,987 --> 00:23:00,387
Do you want us to obtain the Ghostly Eulogy

462
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:01,837
or you don't?

463
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:04,877
I asked so many questions.

464
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,277
But she never answered them.

465
00:23:09,317 --> 00:23:11,317
How could I forget such an important matter?

466
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,427
Madam Xuelin is already dead.

467
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:14,667
I'm sure it's an illusion created

468
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:16,427
by the disruption technique.

469
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,357
All she knows

470
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:18,277
is to tell me to turn back.

471
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:20,357
Where can I go if I turn back?

472
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:21,987
At least if I'm here,

473
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,227
I can obtain the Ghostly Eulogy

474
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:25,557
after I reach the end as the sign states at the entrance.

475
00:23:25,707 --> 00:23:26,837
If I just turn back,

476
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:28,387
I would only have several days to live.

477
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:29,187
Then I'll...

478
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:34,467
So,

479
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,277
I came out just like this?

480
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:39,597
Why did I come back here again?

481
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:40,877
Where are they?

482
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:43,837
Don't tell me they're still inside.

483
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:45,467
They walked even slower than I did.

484
00:23:53,987 --> 00:23:54,877
I can only leave

485
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:56,907
and not enter through this barrier?

486
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:58,877
Am I really

487
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,117
going to end up alone

488
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:01,597
after they abandon me as she said?

489
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:02,387
Am I the only one

490
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,517
who managed to get out of there?

491
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:05,387
Don't tell me

492
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,517
I'm trapped here.

493
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:28,087
They say the spirit dragon is raised and nurtured

494
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:29,227
as the most honorable.

495
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:30,387
But now it seems

496
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:32,667
he's nothing but a brute.

497
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,747
You forcibly expelled me

498
00:24:34,947 --> 00:24:36,036
from the secret realm

499
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:37,357
just to break the first disruptive technique.

500
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:39,556
That's absolutely unruly

501
00:24:39,557 --> 00:24:40,667
and ridiculous behavior!

502
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:47,147
Oh, it's you.

503
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:48,797
How dare you treat me

504
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,596
with such disrespect?

505
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:51,467
How did I end up here?

506
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:52,187
Where's Yanhui?

507
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:53,387
Where's the dragon?

508
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,797
They must have already passed it.

509
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,117
You're the extra one

510
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:02,517
among the three of you.

511
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,387
Did they pass it?

512
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:05,387
They didn't come out?

513
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:10,227
The second trial tests trust.

514
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:12,427
If you and your lover

515
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:14,187
don't trust each other,

516
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,277
why did you choose to go in?

517
00:25:16,797 --> 00:25:17,747
Trust?

518
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:20,147
What's wrong? You don't agree?

519
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:23,947
It's not fair.

520
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,637
How is it not fair?

521
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:27,987
As long as you truly love each other,

522
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,077
you would naturally have trust.

523
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:31,637
Don't you know that?

524
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:40,317
Only those who have never been abandoned

525
00:25:42,147 --> 00:25:43,227
have trust.

526
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:56,747
Stop! Don't come out!

527
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:57,797
Don't come out! Stay inside!

528
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:58,387
No...

529
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:02,427
Yanhui.

530
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:11,427
We're done for now. Even you came out.

531
00:26:11,597 --> 00:26:12,467
What's wrong?

532
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:14,597
We're trapped here.

533
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:25,277
We passed the trial.

534
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:26,707
What?

535
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,077
We passed?

536
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:29,947
Didn't the wooden sign said,

537
00:26:30,117 --> 00:26:31,277
"Completing this path will lead to victory?"

538
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:34,747
Then where's Bai Xiaosheng?

539
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,147
Yanhui.

540
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:45,707
You're... You're disappearing.

541
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:47,557
I...

542
00:26:49,077 --> 00:26:49,877
Tianyao!

543
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:01,722
(Our swords subdue all evil spirits, and our chivalry will rid the world of demons.)

544
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,317
Chenxing Mountain?

545
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:05,797
How did I get back to Chenxing Mountain?

546
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:07,387
Yanhui!

547
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:12,427
Get up.

548
00:27:14,227 --> 00:27:15,387
Zichen?

549
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:16,517
You're finally back.

550
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:17,467
Master descended

551
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,317
from Starhaven.

552
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:20,387
I've pleaded with him for you.

553
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:21,317
I've also explained

554
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:22,077
to him

555
00:27:22,227 --> 00:27:22,907
what happened previously.

556
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:25,187
Master said you can come back now.

557
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:26,277
I've prepared

558
00:27:26,427 --> 00:27:27,387
a new disciple ring and clothes

559
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:28,467
for you.

560
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:29,317
By the way,

561
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,116
I asked your favorite cook

562
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:31,667
to prepare

563
00:27:31,877 --> 00:27:32,667
your favorite baozi.

564
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:55,517
(Your Majesty!)

565
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:58,987
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

566
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:01,387
Your Majesty!

567
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:02,467
Go and wash up.

568
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,747
You're all dirty.

569
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:09,387
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

570
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,597
Tian... Tianyao?

571
00:28:40,187 --> 00:28:40,797
Why...

572
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,077
Why did you kill him?

573
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:44,637
You killed me

574
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:46,357
for their sake.

575
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,117
So I killed them.

576
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:51,837
Then,

577
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:54,987
we'll be even.

578
00:29:07,227 --> 00:29:09,277
Tianyao! What are you doing?

579
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:22,557
Zichen!

580
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:35,797
Master?

581
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:42,467
There's one more coming.

582
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:47,187
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

583
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:48,877
I'm here, Your Majesty!

584
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:52,667
Don't come over here.

585
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:53,427
Go now!

586
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:13,947
Your Majesty.

587
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:15,387
Your Majesty.

588
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:16,387
Tianyao,

589
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:18,707
she has become

590
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:19,947
the Lord of Dark Aura's puppet

591
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:21,837
with brutal and overbearing strength.

592
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:24,277
You can only use the Ghostly Eulogy

593
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,837
to go up against her.

594
00:30:28,387 --> 00:30:31,117
The dark aura has consumed the spirit dragon's mind.

595
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:32,277
The Ghostly Eulogy

596
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,707
has a way to get rid of the dark aura.

597
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:35,637
Ghostly Eulogy?

598
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:37,117
Yanhui!

599
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,187
Use the Ghostly Eulogy and kill the spirit dragon!

600
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:41,947
Tianyao,

601
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:43,427
you must kill her.

602
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:45,987
Or else the world will be in grave danger.

603
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:47,467
Ghostly Eulogy.

604
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,387
(Something's not right.)

605
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:55,907
Kill him now.

606
00:30:59,187 --> 00:30:59,837
(Something's wrong.)

607
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:00,797
Kill the spirit dragon!

608
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:02,317
(Master would never do this.)

609
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:04,797
(Zichen cares about me.)

610
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,036
I've asked the cook

611
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:06,667
to prepare your favorite baozi.

612
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,467
(But he's usually mean to me.)

613
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:09,797
(And Tianyao)

614
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:11,277
(would never be possessed)

615
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:12,357
(by the dark aura at all.)

616
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,427
(Why is Changlan here?)

617
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:17,797
(Our matters)

618
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:20,317
(have nothing to do with Changlan at all.)

619
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,187
(What's going on here?)

620
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:28,987
(These are all the things)

621
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:30,387
(that the disruption technique wants me to see.)

622
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,357
(It has been obstructing me)

623
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:32,517
(from obtaining the Ghostly Eulogy.)

624
00:31:36,117 --> 00:31:37,317
(What kind of test)

625
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:39,357
(is the third trial?)

626
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:44,427
What kind of person

627
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:46,277
can obtain the Ghostly Eulogy?

628
00:32:24,227 --> 00:32:25,227
No!

629
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:32,317
Tianyao.

630
00:32:49,357 --> 00:32:50,117
Why?

631
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,797
It's because I let you down.

632
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:54,747
I'll bear

633
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,317
the consequences.

634
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:12,837
I should have repaid you earlier.

635
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:51,747
Tianyao,

636
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:54,077
no matter what happens,

637
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:55,707
I'll face it

638
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:56,837
with you.

639
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,437
(It seems that this final trial)

640
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:37,477
(is testing whether we have feelings)

641
00:34:37,557 --> 00:34:39,307
(of reluctance and love for each other.)

642
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:41,267
(Tianyao, )

643
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:43,597
(what will your answer be?)

644
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,337
Yanhui, are you okay?

645
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:53,827
I'm okay.

646
00:34:54,227 --> 00:34:55,997
I didn't expect to be thrown out

647
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:56,957
by this screen.

648
00:34:57,307 --> 00:34:58,307
Everything

649
00:34:58,437 --> 00:34:59,557
we do here

650
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:00,667
is unexpected.

651
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,347
I'm glad you're okay.

652
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:07,557
Your Majesty, Queen of Qingqiu.

653
00:35:08,227 --> 00:35:09,187
Queen of Qingqiu?

654
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,707
I saw her before

655
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:11,867
in that compass.

656
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,187
That's how I recognized her.

657
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,867
It's probably an image left

658
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:15,997
by the Queen of Qingqiu.

659
00:35:16,117 --> 00:35:17,117
After waiting for so long,

660
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:19,187
someone finally passed the four trials

661
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:20,307
and obtained the Ghostly Eulogy.

662
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:21,517
Four trials?

663
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:22,957
Wasn't it three?

664
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,827
This disruption technique

665
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,866
requires both Taoist and spirit to enter together

666
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:28,957
to activate it.

667
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:31,517
There was already a hidden trial

668
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:33,397
before the first trial began.

669
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:35,997
Without bias in the heart.

670
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:37,307
That's right.

671
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:39,597
The Ghostly Eulogy is a book for saving people.

672
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,437
I can only entrust it

673
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,227
to those with a righteous heart without worries.

674
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:45,917
Anyway, we finally passed.

675
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:47,557
The first trial in this illusion asked

676
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,077
if there is anyone in your heart.

677
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:50,867
If there is no one else in your heart,

678
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:52,037
it means you lack compassion.

679
00:35:52,147 --> 00:35:53,557
So you can't have this book.

680
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:56,917
It turns out that it was asking about compassion.

681
00:35:57,517 --> 00:35:58,637
Bai Xiaosheng misunderstood the trial

682
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:00,077
and thought he needed to find lovers.

683
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:03,707
The reason you passed the first trial

684
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:05,187
was also that you have compassion.

685
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,667
You didn't harm the person's life when you had the chance.

686
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:08,787
Great compassion.

687
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:11,477
The second trial

688
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,597
was about trust in an uncertain future.

689
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:15,997
To trust him is to trust yourself.

690
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:17,397
Those who lack trust

691
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:18,637
and consistency

692
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,187
cannot obtain this book.

693
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:23,477
The third trial was about making a choice.

694
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:25,557
Saving one person or saving the world.

695
00:36:25,637 --> 00:36:26,827
How would you choose?

696
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:31,917
Saving one person

697
00:36:32,517 --> 00:36:33,517
is the correct answer.

698
00:36:33,637 --> 00:36:35,077
There are many who claim to save the world

699
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:36,597
but end up destroying it.

700
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:39,556
How can you save the world without saving one person first?

701
00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:41,307
Then save me first.

702
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,997
Ghostly Eulogy.

703
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:53,347
You may not be of the same clan.

704
00:36:53,517 --> 00:36:54,597
But you are of the same heart.

705
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:55,787
I am very pleased.

706
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:57,347
Cultivate well,

707
00:36:57,557 --> 00:36:58,517
and I hope you

708
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:00,187
can accomplish

709
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:01,957
what Chenyi and I failed to do.

710
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:19,307
After all the effort,

711
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:21,227
we finally obtained it.

712
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:25,597
You can finally do something

713
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,827
about the dark aura inside your body now.

714
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:37,867
If I think about the time

715
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,597
we first met

716
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:41,147
in Tongluo Village,

717
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:42,307
it has been

718
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,307
a long time since then.

719
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:45,997
Along the way,

720
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,147
you may have harmed me

721
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:48,997
several times.

722
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,597
(She killed me)

723
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:55,637
(the way I'm doing now.)

724
00:37:59,077 --> 00:37:59,957
Forgive me.

725
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:07,477
But you have also saved me

726
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:08,667
several times,

727
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:11,307
like

728
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:12,827
when Wujin was after my life,

729
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:29,036
and when I was trapped

730
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:30,397
in the Misty Forest.

731
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:33,707
Stay behind me.

732
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:57,597
You might have used

733
00:38:58,517 --> 00:38:59,867
(an unusual way)

734
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:01,397
(to obtain the Heart Protecting Scale.)

735
00:39:02,957 --> 00:39:03,787
But you also helped me

736
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:04,997
obtain the Ghostly Eulogy.

737
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,867
From now on,

738
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:10,437
we no longer owe

739
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:12,397
each other anything.

740
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:21,707
Then...

741
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,077
Then are you still afraid of me?

742
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:33,307
I don't feel

743
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,997
as afraid anymore.

744
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,917
After

745
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:38,557
all that has happened in Qingqiu,

746
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:41,117
I should let go.

747
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,117
All right, then.

748
00:39:44,397 --> 00:39:45,347
I should go now.

749
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:47,917
Yanhui.

750
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,077
Will you keep

751
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:04,227
the promise you made

752
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,267
during the shadow play that night?

753
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:13,786
I'll lend you one for now.

754
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:14,867
After that,

755
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:16,917
I'll find the real one

756
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,787
for you.

757
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:47,557
What do you think?

758
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:53,867
With the tension rising

759
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:55,557
between the Taoists and the Spirit Clans,

760
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:57,997
it may be even harder for you

761
00:40:58,597 --> 00:40:59,667
to obtain your body in the future.

762
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:03,747
I'm unable to help you anymore.

763
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:07,437
Take care of yourself.

764
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:09,827
I hope

765
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:11,517
you can retrieve your body soon.

766
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:14,437
Once you do,

767
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:15,917
I hope you

768
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:16,787
won't be fixated

769
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:18,077
on your past grudges.

770
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:23,637
And this.

771
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:32,227
People

772
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:34,747
should keep moving forward.

773
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:56,637
Then will you

774
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,267
give me your heart again?

775
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:05,707
(I already gave it to you once.)
