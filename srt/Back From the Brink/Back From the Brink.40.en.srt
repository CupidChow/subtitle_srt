00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 40)

3
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,350
Yanhui,

4
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,430
don't come any closer.

5
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,899
The barrier will hurt you.

6
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,740
It's too dangerous.

7
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,467
I have something to say to everyone.

8
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,460
Zhuli.

9
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,100
I'll gather everyone here.

10
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,540
There is something.

11
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,950
I must tell all of you.

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,030
Dark Phantom

13
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,420
is the manifestation of everyone's greed, anger, ignorance,

14
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,027
and unfulfilled desires.

15
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,510
All the negative thoughts

16
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,260
in this world

17
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,700
will contribute to his growth.

18
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,070
He may even

19
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,859
be reborn out of nothing.

20
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,580
-Reborn? -Reborn?

21
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:38,980
What do we do if he's reborn all the time?

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,580
How can we defeat him?

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,310
Tianyao and I

24
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,470
have no way to truly defeat him.

25
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,260
Perhaps only the Dragon Valley

26
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,660
can provide

27
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,630
a place

28
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,510
for everyone to survive.

29
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,910
What should we do?

30
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,700
How could this be?

31
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,580
Forgive me.

32
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,630
In the past,

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,310
no matter how difficult the situation was,

34
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,230
I always tried my best to live

35
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,540
because I know.

36
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,350
(I could feel the warmth of the sun, )

37
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,510
(the rain, )

38
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,470
(the taste of sourness and sweetness, )

39
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,580
(bitter hardship, )

40
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,790
(and the warmth of people.)

41
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,310
But if Dark Phantom

42
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,860
is taking all of this away,

43
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,230
I would rather

44
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
take the risk

45
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,700
and fight him to the death.

46
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,100
After today,

47
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,790
I'll be heading to the Misty Forest

48
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,140
to help Tianyao fight against Dark Phantom

49
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,820
with all my strength.

50
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:12,889
I know

51
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,977
that even if there's no hope,

52
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,550
I would rather

53
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:19,220
not live in such a world.

54
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,140
Yanhui...

55
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,110
I'll go with you.

56
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,220
You know I hold a grudge

57
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
against him.

58
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,340
And I'm not willing

59
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,870
to live a life without a purpose.

60
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,140
-I don't want that either. -Me too.

61
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,070
Dark Phantom destroyed my homeland.

62
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,630
Rather than waiting for death,

63
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,990
I'll fight to the death instead.

64
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,820
He's right.

65
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,950
The Phantom Clan

66
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,340
will never live a meaningless life like this.

67
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,356
I'm also willing to fight.

68
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,580
Chenxing Mountain naturally takes it

69
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,380
as its responsibility to uphold justice in the world.

70
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,950
We'll go too.

71
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,460
I don't wish our child

72
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,670
to be born trapped,

73
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,636
only knowing a limited world.

74
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,276
We're going too!

75
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,515
We will fight him!

76
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:29,866
Yes!

77
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:30,426
Yes, let's fight him!

78
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:31,986
We will all go together!

79
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,426
We will go!

80
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:34,516
We are going too!

81
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:35,596
We will fight to the death!

82
00:05:36,396 --> 00:05:37,226
We are going!

83
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:37,866
We will go!

84
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,755
Fight to the death! Fight to the death!

85
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,195
We must also go and fight to the death.

86
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:42,106
Fight to the death.

87
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:43,226
We must also go.

88
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:45,276
We must also go

89
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:46,956
and fight to the death.

90
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:48,196
Fight to the death.

91
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:52,226
All right.

92
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,426
Fight to the death.

93
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,036
Exhaust all options.

94
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,756
Do not fear fate!

95
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,986
-Well said! -Well put!

96
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,155
Fight to the death.

97
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:03,905
Exhaust all options.

98
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,156
Do not fear fate!

99
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:13,426
Dragon fire?

100
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,596
It's dragon fire.

101
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:15,786
It's dragon fire.

102
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:17,756
Dragon fire.

103
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:24,986
We'll keep the dragon fire.

104
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:25,546
All right.

105
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,426
-I want one too. -Me too.

106
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:27,956
I'd like one too.

107
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:33,786
(Tianyao, )

108
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,546
(did you feel it?)

109
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,196
Everyone,

110
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:40,956
if we win

111
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:42,226
in this endeavor,

112
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:44,466
the sky's the limit.

113
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:46,636
If we lose,

114
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:49,596
we'll retreat and return to our lives.

115
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:07,216
(Never retreat. Feng Qianshuo and Xiange)

116
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,516
(Our swords subdue all evil spirits)

117
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:13,793
(Always remain true to myself. Yanhui)

118
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:14,932
(and our chivalry will rid the world of demons.)

119
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,310
(Tomb of the Queen of Qingqiu)

120
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,161
(I don't want a life without a purpose. Bai Xiaosheng)

121
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,036
(Our swords subdue all evil spirits)

122
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:30,226
(and our chivalry will rid the world of demons.)

123
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:33,166
(Being trapped in a place is not freedom.)

124
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:34,986
(I don't want a life)

125
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,937
(without a purpose.)

126
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,106
(I, Queen of Phantom Clan.)

127
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:39,756
(The tomb of the Queen of Qingqiu.)

128
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,226
(We may not share a grave.)

129
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:43,106
(But we will forever be of one mind.)

130
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:46,516
(Beyond life and death, nothing is more important)

131
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:47,956
(than moving forward.)

132
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,986
(Yun was our best friend.)

133
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:51,466
(Even if standing at the edge of an abyss, )

134
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,426
(we shall not waver.)

135
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:46,326
It seems

136
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,236
that I have devoured

137
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,046
the last remaining source of spiritual power in the world.

138
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:53,996
The spiritual dragon has nowhere to go now.

139
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:56,116
Without the Heart Protecting Scale,

140
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,926
you are already in a situation of inevitable defeat.

141
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,606
Still struggling?

142
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,806
But you're already at the end of your rope,

143
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:22,966
you should just give up now.

144
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:15,876
Dragon King,

145
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,476
we'll treat you.

146
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:40,276
There are still many people

147
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,356
who are willing to accompany you in death.

148
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:56,131
Yanhui!

149
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,131
You're doing the impossible!

150
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,081
Yanhui, run!

151
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:01,491
Yanhui.

152
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,411
I have been cultivating for thousands of years

153
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,681
for this moment.

154
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,371
I am tired of the changes in the world.

155
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:19,771
From now on,

156
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,491
there is no suffering,

157
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:23,921
no joy,

158
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:25,531
no happiness,

159
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:26,961
and no sorrow in the world.

160
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:31,561
Only eternal peace and obedience.

161
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,961
Accept your fate.

162
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:36,251
The winner is virtuous,

163
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,651
and the loser is deemed evil.

164
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,081
From now on,

165
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,011
the good and evil in the world will be determined by me!

166
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,281
Tianyao!

167
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:49,771
Yanhui!

168
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:11,771
(This...)

169
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,251
(This seems like the Obsidian River.)

170
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:18,851
(How...)

171
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:21,201
(How did I get here?)

172
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,561
(The dark aura within me)

173
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,651
(seems to be able to dispel Dark Phantom's dark aura.)

174
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,131
(How is my dark aura)

175
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,281
(able to do this?)

176
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:46,731
(Was it because I used)

177
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,161
(Heart Protecting Scale)

178
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:49,611
(to master Ghostly Eulogy?)

179
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:00,411
(No, that's not right.)

180
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:02,251
(Dark Phantom said, )

181
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,201
(the winner is virtuous, )

182
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,771
(and the loser is deemed evil.)

183
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:08,801
(That's not right.)

184
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,281
(What is good?)

185
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,851
(What is evil?)

186
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,771
(Dark Phantom feeds)

187
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,491
(on the evil in people's hearts.)

188
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:19,771
(But how can we differentiate between good and evil?)

189
00:14:20,681 --> 00:14:22,371
(If there is evil in people's hearts, )

190
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:24,921
(why can't there be good as well?)

191
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,411
(Good and evil, )

192
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:28,851
(righteousness and evil, )

193
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,321
(truth and falsehood, )

194
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:31,961
(right and wrong, )

195
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:33,561
(light and shadow, )

196
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:35,281
(Yin and Yang, )

197
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,011
(they have a mutually nurturing and a mutually restraining relationship.)

198
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,561
(The dark aura is evil, )

199
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,201
(but the Dragon Flame is righteous.)

200
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:43,561
(No way.)

201
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:44,681
(That's not right.)

202
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,371
(I mastered Ghostly Eulogy)

203
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,041
(by refining the Heart Protecting Scale)

204
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,201
(at the riverbed of Obsidian River)

205
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,251
(But the Heart Protecting Scale)

206
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:55,011
(is the power of the spiritual dragon.)

207
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,201
(It naturally restrains the dark aura.)

208
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:00,041
(Why was I able to refine it?)

209
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:03,561
(Back then)

210
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,161
(in Chenxing Mountain, )

211
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,411
(I used the dragon's technique.)

212
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,531
(Emptiness isn't empty.)

213
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,731
(Empty is as empty does.)

214
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,800
(What kind of connection)

215
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:21,161
(do Ghostly Eulogy and Jingming Chant have?)

216
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,121
(Empty is as empty does.)

217
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:24,841
(Emptiness isn't empty.)

218
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:26,651
(These two can switch places.)

219
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,891
(If I can use Heart Protecting Scale)

220
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,081
(to master Ghostly Eulogy, )

221
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,960
(that means I can use dark aura)

222
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:33,121
(to remold the Heart Protecting Scale.)

223
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:12,601
Yanhui!

224
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:37,755
You actually turn my dark aura

225
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:39,355
into dragon fire?

226
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:40,475
Yes.

227
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:42,475
The dark aura is Yin

228
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:43,805
and the Dragon Flame is Yang.

229
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,380
Yin and Yang naturally don't go together.

230
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,912
It's impossible!

231
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,880
Give my power back!

232
00:16:56,574 --> 00:16:58,912
The Yin and Yang of heaven and earth change naturally.

233
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,420
Good and evil are not determined by you.

234
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,690
Justice lies

235
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,140
within the hearts of people,

236
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:25,819
and it's just a matter of choice in a moment.

237
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,075
Choice?

238
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:31,341
This world

239
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,620
has never given me any choice!

240
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,031
When Xuelin saved you,

241
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,311
she gave you a choice.

242
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,711
But

243
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,861
you never chose to be good.

244
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:45,341
What...

245
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:48,791
What do you know?

246
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,138
What do you even know?

247
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,820
What I was unwilling to accept at first

248
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,930
was simply...

249
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,260
Yanhui,

250
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,820
don't touch me.

251
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,300
You'll get hurt.

252
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,020
Tianyao,

253
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,450
I'm no longer the Lady of Dark Aura.

254
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,620
Tianyao.

255
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,170
Yanhui.

256
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,210
Tianyao.

257
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,340
You...

258
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,130
If I could master Ghostly Eulogy

259
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,060
with Heart Protecting Scale,

260
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,890
I would naturally use Ghostly Eulogy

261
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,890
to transform into Heart Protecting Scale.

262
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,450
I should've realized it earlier.

263
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:43,890
Are you...

264
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,100
It seems.

265
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,210
I had a dream just now.

266
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,300
I dreamed

267
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,929
you had already ascended to become immortal.

268
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,780
Tianyao,

269
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,260
you've become a great dragon in the world

270
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,730
with a majestic

271
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,450
and domineering aura,

272
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,930
roaming freely

273
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,370
between heaven and earth...

274
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,930
No longer bound

275
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,690
by the earthly fetters.

276
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,450
What about you?

277
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,650
I...

278
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,580
I'll be in here.

279
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,820
You were already in here.

280
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,370
I will be

281
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,660
in a lot of places.

282
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,929
(Who on earth are you?)

283
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,820
(I'm Tianyao.)

284
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,450
I'm a Millennium Spirit Dragon.

285
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,820
You lie as soon as you speak.

286
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,580
Why are you following me?

287
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,860
Looking for chicken.

288
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,580
I think it's better for us

289
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:00,690
to part ways now.

290
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,970
Goodbye.

291
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,300
Yanhui.

292
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,900
(It sure is fate.)

293
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,170
(Your Heart Protective Scale saved my life.)

294
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,620
And now,

295
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,170
I have released your soul here.

296
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't worry.

297
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
I will help you

298
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,664
find all

299
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,620
of your body parts.

300
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,183
(If you want to come with me, )

301
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:31,783
(the journey will be dangerous.)

302
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:33,633
All the more reason we must work together.

303
00:23:39,913 --> 00:23:40,633
Yanhui.

304
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:46,643
(I'm just a nobody)

305
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:48,758
without any ambition.

306
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,730
(I'm still waiting for you)

307
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,080
(to gather all of your body parts)

308
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,970
and repay my kindness

309
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:53,280
so I can be successful.

310
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,880
We're now

311
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:56,080
in the same boat.

312
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,120
(I may have bad luck at the gambling table.)

313
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,799
(But I have a good judgment of people.)

314
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,009
(It's very accurate.)

315
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,360
And you

316
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,560
are one of them.

317
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,560
So be honored.

318
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,210
(I've seen how you emerged)

319
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,600
(from the abyss)

320
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:23,170
(that no one else has ever come out of.)

321
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,530
(It's this abyss)

322
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,770
(that made you tough in a way)

323
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,530
(that others have not experienced.)

324
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,450
(Hatred)

325
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,770
(has not changed the real you.)

326
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,490
(You still)

327
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,280
(have)

328
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,839
(a sincere heart here.)

329
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,800
(Since you met me, )

330
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,450
(you've faced more adversities)

331
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,210
(and an unpredictable future.)

332
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,490
(I always thought)

333
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,209
(that one day, )

334
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,170
(when the dust settled, )

335
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,730
(I would find a place)

336
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,690
(to live in peace with you)

337
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,120
(and wait for the flowers to bloom.)

338
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,600
(We'll live the life)

339
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,800
(you call free and easy)

340
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,600
(and rise to fame and wealth.)

341
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,410
Yanhui.

342
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,450
Yanhui.

343
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,450
("On this auspicious day, )

344
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,080
(we celebrate a joyous occasion)

345
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,690
(as we begin a good marriage that will last forever.)

346
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,450
(I pray for future blessings)

347
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,320
(and a harmonious, loving relationship)

348
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,010
that will last until old age.

349
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,970
For a long time

350
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,690
with time.

351
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,799
We shall be together and never part until old age."

352
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,280
Yanhui!

353
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,930
Everything is all right now. Don't be scared.

354
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,250
Are you hurt?

355
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,730
Xiaoyan.

356
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,560
Are you all right?

357
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,280
I'm all right.

358
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,040
What's going on?

359
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,490
Slow down.

360
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,410
Look at the sky.

361
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:12,800
Is it a deity showing its presence in the sky?

362
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,930
It's so beautiful!

363
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,280
Mother, come and see.

364
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,450
Father!

365
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,450
Come and see.

366
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,120
It's so beautiful.

367
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,080
Mother.

368
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,930
Yanhui.

369
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,450
Tianyao,

370
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,640
I'm here.

371
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,690
From now on,

372
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
every person who has passed by you

373
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,530
will also be me.

374
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:05,500
(Years later)

375
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,170
I am a member of a Taoist sect,

376
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,320
and you are a prince of a Spirit Clan.

377
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,170
My family always worries

378
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,170
that you have ulterior motives toward me.

379
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,250
They still won't

380
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,280
let us be together.

381
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,970
Come and see.

382
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:23,450
What year is it now?

383
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,410
Listen up.

384
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,690
Right now,

385
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
a Taoist-Spirit couple is the trend.

386
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,450
Your thinking

387
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,080
is too traditional.

388
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,490
I understand that you want to matchmake us.

389
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,690
But...

390
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,450
There is no but.

391
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,600
All right.

392
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,560
(Back From The Brink) Look at this.

393
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,450
-"Back From The Brink?" -"Back From The Brink?"

394
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,040
You're right.

395
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,880
This is Mr. Yan of Qingqiu's latest book.

396
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
It tells the love story

397
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:50,839
between a Taoist disciple

398
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,450
and the Spirit Dragon.

399
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,249
They went through hardships

400
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,800
and finally managed to live happily ever after.

401
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,880
And I was the one

402
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,360
who matchmade them.

403
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,560
Here you go.

404
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,640
Go along now.

405
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:18,730
Wait a minute.

406
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,930
I really wish

407
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,729
you both the best

408
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,410
from the bottom of my heart.

409
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,410
Go.

410
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,280
Indeed, it's you.

411
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,450
After so many years,

412
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,249
you haven't changed at all.

413
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,359
Unlike you,

414
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,490
whose hair had turned white

415
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,930
in just 15 years.

416
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,930
You come here every year.

417
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,730
I wonder

418
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,170
if you want to pass on

419
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,880
your dragon technique to everyone.

420
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,880
And you, the God of Marriage,

421
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,730
tirelessly worry

422
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,360
about people's love relationships.

423
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,600
I had to do it.

424
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,690
So have you found her?

425
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,770
I'll get going now.

426
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,690
Not valuing the talented...

427
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,730
prevents people from competing.

428
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,450
Not overvaluing rare goods...

429
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,560
Not overvaluing rare goods...

430
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,560
prevents people from stealing.

431
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,690
prevents people from stealing.

432
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,360
Dragon King is here!

433
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,210
Mister, Dragon King is here.

434
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,170
-Dragon King! -Dragon King!

435
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,210
Dragon King, are you coming back here

436
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
to teach us some Spirit Dragon Spell

437
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
this time?

438
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,210
We practice hard

439
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:14,530
the one you taught us previously.

440
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,530
You were right.

441
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,010
Books.

442
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
Greetings, Dragon King.

443
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
How are Zhuli and Huan Xiaoyan doing lately?

444
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,880
They're all doing quite well.

445
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Stop tugging at me.

446
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,640
I want a divorce!

447
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,530
Be careful, you're pregnant.

448
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,410
The stairs, watch the stairs!

449
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:41,930
Be careful.

450
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,800
Mr. Yan,

451
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,169
I want to write a divorce letter

452
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,120
to this jerk.

453
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,170
I only told you to eat less meat.

454
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
It's not good for the baby.

455
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,040
Dragon King?

456
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,640
Dragon King, you're here just in time.

457
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Please take me with you.

458
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,250
I'll go to the Mortal Realm with you

459
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,360
to search for Yanhui.

460
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,320
I can't stay

461
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,530
in Qingqiu anymore!

462
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,170
Dragon King.

463
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:01,970
Lately,

464
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,250
she has been irritable.

465
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,730
It's nice to see

466
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,120
such affection.

467
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,530
No, it's not.

468
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,249
At the time of the Dragon Valley's farewell,

469
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,970
his epitaph was written so well.

470
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,080
Now,

471
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,639
he won't even

472
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,600
let me have a piece of meat.

473
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:16,729
You eat too much.

474
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,600
Isn't greasy food bad for the baby?

475
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Then you can tell me to eat less.

476
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,490
I'll get going then.

477
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,119
I'm going to Yongzhou City

478
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,530
to visit Feng Qianshuo and Xiange.

479
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,210
Dragon King.

480
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,970
Look what you've done.

481
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,320
You've driven Dragon King away.

482
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,280
I told you

483
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,170
not to bring up the past

484
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,040
in front of him.

485
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,450
It's your fault

486
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,120
for making me upset.

487
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,559
Since the Obsidian River

488
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,640
no longer causes things to sink,

489
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,039
it's much more convenient for the Taoists and Spirit clans

490
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,840
to interact.

491
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,530
You're right.

492
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,039
The Obsidian River's jetty

493
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,250
was never this busy.

494
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,640
Be careful.

495
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,530
Thank you.

496
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,120
Off we go!

497
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,320
Faster, faster!

498
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,450
Be careful.

499
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,719
-Are you having fun? -Faster!

500
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,560
Let's soar!

501
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:23,970
Be careful.

502
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,160
You can get down.

503
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,120
Did you have fun?

504
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,890
You're going to spoil him.

505
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,200
Who else is going to do it if not me?

506
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:29,810
Xiange.

507
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:30,600
Qianshuo.

508
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,490
It's been a long time.

509
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:56,890
You're truly lucky.

510
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,409
(Dragon Clan's Chant)

511
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,640
Here are the new techniques.

512
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,010
After so many years,

513
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,759
you're willing to help those

514
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,850
who are in pursuit of immortality

515
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,810
and teach them dragon martial arts techniques.

516
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,200
It's her wish.

517
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,890
I'll get going then.

518
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,240
Tianyao,

519
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,490
how long do you plan

520
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,930
to keep searching for her?

521
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,810
(I am searching for her.)

522
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,240
(But not really searching.)

523
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,010
(I only happened)

524
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,741
(to encounter her in this world.)

525
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,160
Scented sachets and pendants for sale!

526
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,970
Don't drop your baozi.

527
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,040
Take care!

528
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,970
Scented sachets, pendants, and trinkets for sale!

529
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,810
Come and take a look.

530
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:50,875
(Wu's Baozi)

531
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:07,930
Mister,

532
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,040
can I have two baozi?

533
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,600
Mister,

534
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm really sorry.

535
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,410
Baozi is sold out.

536
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,759
There was a young lady

537
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,370
who bought ten baozi all at once.

538
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,240
Over there.

539
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,240
She was the one.

540
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,120
Yanhui.

541
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,040
Do I know you?

542
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,080
Do you want some bread?

543
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:24,700
(The End)

544
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,240
Be together, be together!

545
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,370
Be together, be together!

546
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,810
Get together, get together!

547
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:34,905
Be together, be together!

548
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,160
Be together, be together!

549
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,530
Stay together!

550
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,890
Stay together!

551
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,040
Be together, be together!

552
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,720
Be together, be together!
