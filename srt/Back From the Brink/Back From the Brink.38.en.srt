Why do I have no parents?

Why does everyone fear me?

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,710
You were born

Is there anything important?

165

Master Suying, I heard that you traveled
all around the world

169

However, no matter

170
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,900
how effective the herb is,

171
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,860

Master, do you have a way to save him?

174
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,460
The dragon-scale armor is impregnable.

175
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,540
It can even

176
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,900
delay time itself.

177
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,820

179
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,940
(The evil dragon is extremely powerful,)

180

182
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,420

183
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,020

186
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,660
I will use your dragon scales

187

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,780
The evil dragon is seriously wounded.

193
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,540
Hurry! Harvest his scales
and extract his inner core!

194
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,340
(You old geezer,)

195
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,100
(don't spoil my plan!)

196
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,580
(You brought chaos upon the world with my body.)

197
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,300
(Luckily, the dragon fire woke me up
from my slumber.)

198
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,460
(I will seal you away again!)

199
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,340
Master?

200
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Lingxiao,

201
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,700
pay attention to the seal

202
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,380
in Starhaven constantly.

203
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,220
Remember to come here

204
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,460
on the same day every year

205
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,180
and assist me

206
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,460
in strengthening the seal.

207
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,300
Yes, Master.

208
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,260
You were

209
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,780
the cause of everything.

210
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,300
You were the source

211
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,380
of everyone's tragedy.

212
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,620
You should feel lucky

213
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,300
that your tragedy

214
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,460
will end here.

215
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,220
You practiced my techniques

216
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,860
and filled your body with the dark aura.

217
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,300
People in the world

218
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,180
will only fear you.

219
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,860
Why don't you submit to me?

220
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
In your dreams!

221
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,500
Dragon King, since you know

222
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,420
where Yanhui is,

223
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,860
why are you still pulling a long face?

224
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,940
Naturally, he's fretting about how to save her.

225
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,900
The entrance to Dark Phantom's mind's eye

226
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,060
is always well hidden.

227
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,740
The entrance at Misty Forest

228
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
vanished long ago.

229
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,820
Now,

230
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
getting into Dark Phantom's mind's eye

231
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,900
is an ordeal.

232
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,940
What should we do then?

233
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,660
We can't just sit idly by.

234
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,620
Starhaven

235
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,660
is directly connected
to Dark Phantom's mind's eye.

236
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,180
But...

237
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,140
Will Master Lingxiao

238
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,540
let you break the seal in Starhaven?

239
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,020
If Dark Phantom escapes during the chaos,

240
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,060
we'll be in deep trouble.

241
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,020
Lingxiao will aid us

242
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,220
if I promise to deal a huge blow to Dark Phantom.

243
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,060
Your presence counters the dark aura.

244
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,260
It's easy if you're just

245
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,980
dealing with Dark Phantom here.

246
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,940
However,

247
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,380
Yanhui and Dark Phantom are in the same place now.

248
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,700
What if you hurt her by accident?

249
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,220
Shadow spirits can isolate their bodies

250
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,940
from all things in the world.

251
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,140
To prevent himself from getting injured
by foreign objects,

252
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,900
he used my true effigy

253
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,060
to create a shadow robe.

254
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,340
Then when you're here with us,

255
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,620
he can harm you easily.

256
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,460
He has other plans for me.

257
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,220
If my true effigy perishes,

258
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,460
he will be in trouble too.

259
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,380
Do you know where Bai Xiaosheng is?

260
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,380
Yanhui tried

261
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
to locate him too.

262
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,780
He's in the Misty Forest.

263
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,660
Dragon King!

264
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
Repair the shrine

265
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,300
and collect the dark aura.

266
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,020
Repair the shrine

267
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,740
and collect the dark aura.

268
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,220
[Dark Phantom Shrine]
Repair the shrine

269
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,740
and collect the dark aura.

270
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
Repair the shrine

271
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,940
and collect the dark aura.

272
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,620
Repair the shrine

273
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,260
and collect the dark aura.

274
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,540
The dark aura is controllable.

275
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,700
You were led astray by your selfish desires.

276
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,940
But now, you're blaming it

277
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,660
on the dark aura?

278
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,460
How ridiculous.

279
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,700
The dark aura only exists
because of the greed of humans.

280
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,500
It's the malicious intent

281
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,300
that people wish to get rid of, yet couldn't.

282
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,820
You took this path,

283
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,500
yet you're going against me?

284
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,980
You even intend to suppress this evil?

285
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,740
You're the joke here.

286
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,700
Once I strip you

287
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,740
of all your dark aura,

288
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,820
you will know

289
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,020
that there are no wrong paths in the world.

290
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,180
The winner takes all is the only truth here.

291
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,180
(He's actually)

292
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,340
(absorbing all of my dark aura?)

293
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,500
(He's under Dark Phantom's spell.)

a lonely grave faces the sunset.]

[Taoist Zihuan, Tiandao Sect]

296

Bai Xiaosheng!

298
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,780
You useless fool!

299
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,140
(Dark Phantom has merged himself)

300
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,060
(with Bai Xiaosheng's true effigy.)

301
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
(If I want to damage him,)

302
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
(I have to remove)

303
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
(his shadow robe.)

304
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,540
Tianyao?

305
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,380
Get up.

306
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,340
Yanhui is trapped
within Dark Phantom's mind's eye.

307
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I need your assistance.

308
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,060
How can I assist you?

309
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,460
My presence counters the dark aura.

310
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,420
If I head to Dark Phantom's mind's eye hastily,

311
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm afraid Yanhui, another master
of the dark aura,

312
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,020
will be hurt.

313
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,380
You once said

314
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,660
that Dark Phantom used your true effigy

315
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,500
to create a shadow robe

316
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,020
that could isolate himself
from all other objects in the world.

317
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,180
Are you telling me

318
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,340
to strip the shadow robe

319
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,620
from Dark Phantom

320
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,980
and put it on Yanhui?

321
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,260
That's right.

322
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,580
Once Yanhui is wearing the shadow robe,

323
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,140
I will enter his mind's eye

324
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,500
and eradicate him.

325
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,100
Although this is risky,

326
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,220
it's worth a try.

327
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,700
We have no time to waste.

328
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,780
We need to rush toward

329
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,660
Starhaven.

330
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,260
But why?

331
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
The entrance in Misty Forest

332
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,820
was destroyed long ago.

333
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,420
Right now, Starhaven

334
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,820
is our only way of getting there.

335
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm around.

336
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,020
There's no need to complicate things.

337
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,420
This is?

338
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,500
It's an upgraded version of the shadow cave.

339
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,620
I didn't just sit idly by

340
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,380
when I was imprisoned.

341
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,940
Wait for my signal.

342
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,420
You and I were born from the same source.

343
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,820
You cannot hurt me.

344
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,980
I will take back

345
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,900
Bai Xiaosheng's

346
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,180
true effigy today!

347
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,980
It's just a shadow robe.

348
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,100
You cannot do anything about me.

349
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,940
This is my mind's eye.

350
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,820
You're but a part of me.

351
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,420
Time to die!

352
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,820
Great timing!

353
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,660
Here you go.

354
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,380
I thought I would need to endure

355
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,580
a tough battle to get back my true effigy.

356
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,500
I didn't expect you two

357
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,940
to be thinking of the same thing.

358
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,500
Although I only got a small part

359
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,260
of the shadow robe,

360
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,540
it's enough to protect you.

361
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,180
Bai Xiaosheng,

362
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,540
how dare you betray me and join her?

363
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,780
I would've destroyed

364
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,060
my true effigy and perished with you long ago

365
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,740
if it weren't for her.

366
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,580
By the way,

367
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,380
I even brought

368
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,420
your old friend here today.

369
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,420
Tianyao?

370
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,660
Tianyao.

371
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,660
What are you doing here?

372
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,860
I'm here to reunite with you.

373
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,620
I'm afraid this isn't the time

374
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
for you two to be lovey-dovey.

375
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,300
Leave with Bai Xiaosheng.

376
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,460
I will take care of it.

377
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,780

378
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,380
Yanhui!

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,420
There's a shadow cave here.

380
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,340
I'll bring you outside.

381
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,860
You can actually travel with people now?

382
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,820
Not just that,

383
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,500
but I can also take you anywhere you like.

384
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,420
I have a plan.

385
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,380
Let's leave for now.

386
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,180
Both you and I

387
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,620
were toyed by fate.

388
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,660
Why don't you join me

389
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,540
in oversetting this world?

390
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,660
I have the shadow robe!

391
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,140
You cannot hurt me with your dragon fire!

392
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,740
Tianyao, now!

393
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,500
Tianyao.

394
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,500
Yanhui.

395
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,740
His mind's eye is collapsing.

396
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,700
Let's go!

397
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,940
I sense a dragon scent.

398
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,900
Could it be that the dragon

399
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,340
had retrieved his body

400
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,740
and defeated Dark Phantom?

401
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,860
Tianyao,

402
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,540
we actually succeeded.

403
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,740
What's the matter?

404
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,420
♪Feelings start swirling secretly
with every tiny leap♪

405
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,220
Yanhui,

406
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,340
I can finally touch you again.

407
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,140
This is great.

408
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:15,100

Tianyao,

411
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,660
I think

412
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,500
I hear your heartbeat.

413
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,420
Why is it

414
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,980
beating faster and faster?

415
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,860
Do you feel uncomfortable

416
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,260
after retrieving your heart?

417
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,660
No.

418
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,820
Suying returned the dragon heart to you

419
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,340
when we were at Guanghan Sect.

420
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,340
I'm sure she wanted us

421
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,860
to end up like her and Lu Musheng.

422
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,900
She wanted us to suffer like her.

423
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,300
Yanhui,

424
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,620
trust me.

425
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,700
Although we counter each other,

426
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,860
we won't

427
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,940
end up like them.

428
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,060
As long as we believe in each other,

429
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,100
I don't fear the future.

I wonder

437
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,180
who was the one

438
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,020
who made your plan to steal his shadow robe

439
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,420
work?

440
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,460
Thank you for your help.

441
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I'm only helping you

442
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,740
because of Yanhui.

443
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,940
We could only defeat Dark Phantom
because of your help.

444
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,900
Yanhui,

445
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,220
I need to thank you too.

446
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,300
Thank you for retrieving my true effigy for me.

447
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,660
It's a shame that it's in tatters.

448
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,940
It's fine.

449
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,260
These are the scars of my battle

450
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,460
with Dark Phantom.

451
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,820
I'll take this half.

452
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,940
As for the other half,

453
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,620
you have to keep it on all the time.

454
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,300
Especially when this guy

455
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,340
is by your side.

456
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,700
You mustn't remove it at all costs.

457
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,220
I'm just kidding.

458
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,580
You guys only became a couple

459
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,740
all thanks to my contribution

460
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,820
as your matchmaker,

461
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,060
right?

462
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,820
Now,

463
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,180
I sincerely

464
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,260
give you two my blessing.

465
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,460
All right.

466
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,940
Your matchmaker is done for the day.

467
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,740
I'll slip into your shadows.

468
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,860
Why is there still no news of them?

469
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,300
Could it be that something had happened

470
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,340
to the Dragon King and Yanhui?

471
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,740
I knew we should go there together.

472
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,260
Your Highness,

473
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,420
you're the only

474
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,620
royal descendant of Qingqiu.

475
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,660
You mustn't try anything risky.

476
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,740
Dragon King is the only dragon in the world.

477
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,500
Why can he do it then?

478
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,900
You!

479
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,660
Mr. Yan,

480
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,500
don't be angry.

481
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
His Highness is just worried
about the Dragon King.

482
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,500
I'm worried about the Dragon King too.

483
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,580
However, Dark Phantom

484
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,780
excels at manipulating people's hearts
with his dark aura.

485
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,500
If we act recklessly,

486
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,180
it might backfire on us instead.

487
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,580
With Tianyao's and Yanhui's

488
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,420
current strength,

489
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,380
they will stand a chance

490
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,500
of defeating Dark Phantom.

491
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,420
Therefore,

492
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,060
Your Highness,

493
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,340
please calm down.

494
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,620
I don't wish

495
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,500
to lose anyone again.

496
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,860
You won't lose anyone.

497
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,780
Yanhui?

498
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,060
It's the Dragon King and Yanhui!

499
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,660
Yanhui!

500
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:29,980
Yanhui!

501
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,090
Yanhui, you're back!

502
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,300
Are you okay?

503
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,060
I'm fine.

504
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,780
Luckily, Tianyao made it in time.

505
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,180
Enough already.

506
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,060
Come back.

507
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,340
Come here.

508
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,620
Our baby is more important.

509
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,740
The Dragon King was so flustered

510
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,940
when you were gone.

511
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,700
He even called your name in his dreams.

512
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,380
Is that so?

513
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,820
We were worried about you too.

514
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,100
It's fine now.

515
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,380
Dark Phantom's mind's eye has been destroyed.

516
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,460
You guys don't need to worry now.

517
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,140
Where's Xiaosheng?

518
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,620
He has retrieved his true effigy.

519
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,540
He's merging it with his body.

520
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,540
We've sent him back

521
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,620
to his room.

522
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,140
Dragon King, congratulations
on completing your body.

523
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm sorry

524
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,100
about Chenyi.

525
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,220
I couldn't make it in time.

526
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,700
Luckily,

527
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,820
the Dark Phantom is out of the picture now.

528
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,100
His Majesty's

529
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,140
and Her Majesty's wish
has finally been fulfilled.

530
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,580
Mr. Yan, please allow us

531
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,980
to proceed with their mourning.

532
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,940
Lanterns!

533
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,860
Pray.

534
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
They're floating to the sky.

535
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,780
Have these grudges

536
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,060
finally ended?

537
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,020
What's with that question?

538
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,540
Maybe it was because of
the numerous things we'd been through.

539
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,220
I was always tensed up.

540
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,220
Now that I can finally relax,

541
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,900
I feel strange.

542
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,740
There are no feuds or grudges now.

543
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,580
In the future,

544
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,700
no matter where you want to go

545
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,420
or what kind of life you want to lead,

546
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,340
I will always stay by your side.

547
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,020
I'm free.

548
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,540
Master,

549
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,940
the nebula on Starhaven

550
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,740
had dispersed.

551
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,580
Master, you must've

552
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,900
sealed Dark Phantom away successfully.

553
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,580
It was the dragon.

554
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,900
He had retrieved all of his body parts.

555
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,780
He already vanquished the dark aura

556
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,460
inside Dark Phantom's mind's eye.

557
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,740
This is great,

558
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,380
Master.

559
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,820
You two, head to Qiyun Monastery

560
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,540
and tell Master Qiyun

561
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,500
about this news

562
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,620
so that she can have some peace of mind.

563
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,100
-Yes, Master.
-Yes, Master.

564
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,780
(Yanhui,)

565
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,980
(I knew you could do it.)

566
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,900
Are you okay?

567
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,860
Why did you bring me here?

568
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,620
I prepared something nice for you.

569
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,900
This is

570
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
the fruit wine I had chilled
with the cold spring water.

571
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,780
Try it.

572
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,740
What do you think?

573
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,860
It's delicious.

574
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,580
You finally smiled.

575
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,940
You stopped smiling

576
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,460
ever since His Majesty passed away.

577
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,780
My mother passed away when I was young.

578
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,020
My sister died in a foreign land.

579
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,660
And now, my father is gone too.

580
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,620
I'm the only person left

581
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,020
in the family.

582
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,780
You're not alone.

583
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,460
You still have me.

584
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,940
Yes,

585
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,340
I still have you.

586
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,300
However,

587
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,060
my family will never be complete again.

588
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,420
I can understand

589
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780
your feelings.

590
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,860
Although the Dragon King
had defeated Dark Phantom,

591
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,700
our kin

592
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,580
who had left this world,

593
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,420
they will never return again.

594
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,820
Here.

595
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,380
Drink up.

596
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,460
It's moving.

597
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,380
It's moving!

598
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
The baby is so strong!

599
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,820
Be gentle.

600
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,860
Don't scare the baby.

601
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,220
Okay.

602
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,980
I'll keep it down.

603
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,660
I'll lower my volume.

604
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,900
Well,

605
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,300
do you think this is a boy or a girl?

606
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,060
I hope it's a girl.

607
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,820
She'll take after you.

608
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,700
But I heard from other people

609
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,370
that daughters take after their fathers.

610
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,620
But you don't resemble

611
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,060
Leader Chenyi at all.

612
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,380
Actually, Leader Chenyi

613
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,300
isn't my biological father.

614
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,060
I'm just a foster daughter

615
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,900
he picked up from the battlefield.

616
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,060
Sorry about that.

617
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,500
I made you upset again.

618
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,740
It's fine.

619
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,100
I was just wondering

620
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,700
if I resemble my father

621
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,620
or my mother.

622
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,980
If my in-laws can give birth to a beauty like you,

623
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,020
I'm sure they're someone extraordinary.

624
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,180
Actually,

625
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
I've never seen them before.

626
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,620
All these years,

627
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,300
I've been traveling between the two realms.

628
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,340
I tried

629
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,300
to locate them too.

630
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,180
However, there was never any news of them.

631
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
It seems like

632
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,740
they're no longer

633
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,700
in this world.

634
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,700
Gone away from us is the day of yesterday.

635
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,580
My dear,

636
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,180
you shouldn't be too upset about it.

637
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,180
You should smile more often

638
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,260
for our child's sake.

639
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,540
Tianyao?

640
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,700
You...

641
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,260
Tianyao!

642
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,020
Yanhui,

643
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,380
rest well.

644
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,300
I'll make a move first.

645
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,220
Wait!

646
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,060
Don't you remember

647
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,940
what happened here?

648
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,740
I don't.

649
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,740
You don't?

650
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,500
That's fine.

651
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,780
I'll tell you what happened.

652
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,780
Look.

653
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,860
This is no ordinary bed.

654
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,660
Back then,

655
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,900
you hatched out from your egg

656
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
on this very bed.

657
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,900
It's very meaningful

658
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,860
to me.

659
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,580
And this blanket

660
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,860
is very special too.

661
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,460
(When you hatched out from your egg,)

662
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,660
you used this blanket

663
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,340
to cover your...

664
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,900
I remember now.

665
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,260
Really?

666
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,140
I...

667
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,420
I never forgot about it.

668
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,660
If so, why did you say

669
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,500
you don't remember it?

670
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,180
When I hatched out from my egg,

671
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,090
I was completely naked.

672
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,580
It was disgraceful of me.

673
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,020
I don't want to remember it.

674
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,620
We've been through so much together.

675
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,020
We even got married twice.

676
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,340
There's no need to hide anything.

677
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,060
I still think there's a need

678
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,220
to hide it.

679
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:49,900
You...

680
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,220
Where did you come from?

681
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,140
You have my true effigy with you.

682
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,420
I know all about

683
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,820
the conversations you had

684
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,660
and the things you did.

685
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,380
If so,

686
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,140
what did you hear?

687
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,940
I heard everything.

688
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,620
-Is that so?
-You wish to fight?

689
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,500
You want to fight me?

690
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,100
I'll leave then.

691
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,180
You guys can deal with it yourselves then.

692
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,500
Listen up.

693
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,820
The three of us

694
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,620
have to live together now.

695
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,260
I know you guys are madly in love with each other,

696
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,820
but you should think about my feelings too.

697
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,580
Tell me.

698
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,940
What's our next mission?

699
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,180
The death anniversary of the valley's elves

700
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,660
is in a few days.

701
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,340
Tianyao and I

702
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,700
plan to return to the Dragon Valley.

703
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,700
That won't do.

704
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,460
You two mustn't go there together.

705
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,980
-Why?
-Why?

706
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,540
You guys are only able to see each other

707
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,140
all thanks to my effort.

708
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,660
The dragon scent in the Dragon Valley
is stronger.

709
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,700
What if you go there

710
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,140
and the dragon power overwhelms you

711
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,700
and kills you?

712
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,900
Forget it.

713
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,420
I wanted to return

714
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,620
to Chenxing Mountain anyway.

715
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,900
I need to tell my master

716
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,500
about Dark Phantom's defeat.

717
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,020
All right.

718
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,460
Look at you two.

719
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,060
Although you two
have been through much together,

720
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,420
you two still have many regrets.

721
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,610
The formed

722
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,260
is born out of the formless.

723
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,020
All things are born out of nothing.

724
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
All things belong to nothing.

725
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,140
The formed is born out of the formless.

726
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,620
Sect Leader!

727
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,380
Greetings, Sect Leader.

728
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,100
Use your dantian to breathe
and maintain a steady rhythm.

729
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,060
Do not slack off.

730
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,180
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

731
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,380
Sir, have you come out of your retreat?

732
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,820
I intend to leave the sect for a few days.

733
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,100
Since Zichen and Ziyue aren't around,

734
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,020
you shall be in charge of the sect

735
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,940
for the next few days.

736
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,860
Yes, sir.

737
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,300
Proceed with your lesson.

738
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,660
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

739
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,660
(Is that Dark Phantom's mind's eye?)

740
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,060
(Something's wrong!)

741
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,900
I thought our sect leader
was leaving the mountain?

742
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,820
-Yeah.
-That's right.

743
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,460
Yeah.
