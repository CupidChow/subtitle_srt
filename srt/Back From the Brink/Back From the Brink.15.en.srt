00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,080
Who is it?

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Who threw out my blanket?

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,190
Didn't I already promise you all

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,160
that I'd move downstairs?

7
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,110
How dare you still prank me?

8
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,440
I have to retrieve my blanket this early in the morning.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,880
But it's good to move downstairs too.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,670
This way,

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,440
Tianyao won't discover my plans.

12
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,440
I can make plans by myself.

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,200
Black clothing

14
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,430
does suit Tianyao better.

15
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,200
Has Tianyao recovered from his injuries?

16
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,320
Don't tell me he forgot

17
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,960
to apply his ointment?

18
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,670
(I fell for him.)

19
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,270
(If you like someone, )

20
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,350
(you should court him.)

21
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,000
(What do you like to drink?)

22
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,070
(Pick one.)

23
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,760
(Maybe some dew.)

24
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,320
(Find out what he likes.)

25
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,120
(After that, )

26
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,710
(cater to his liking.)

27
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,840
What are you doing?

28
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,710
Tianyao.

29
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,240
Come here.

30
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,040
Take a sniff.

31
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,310
There's a floral scent to it.

32
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,280
This is the morning dew

33
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,560
I gathered.

34
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,760
Morning dew?

35
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
If you're that free,

36
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,640
you should go and train.

37
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,990
I'll go and train

38
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,230
when you go to pull out the sword.

39
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,110
Don't worry.

40
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,400
I still remember

41
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
that I need to help you retrieve your body.

42
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,520
Just try it.

43
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,550
I gathered this

44
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
early in the morning.

45
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,750
It contains a floral scent too.

46
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,840
Sorry about that!

47
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,040
I didn't mean it!

48
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,600
You little fatty!

49
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,400
He pushed me!

50
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,280
You're pretty bold, huh?

51
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,190
He pushed me!

52
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:55,870
Forget it.

53
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,350
Let them be.

54
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,790
At least there's someone sensible here.

55
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,399
Who are you calling insensible?

56
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,160
You!

57
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,230
This woman is so fierce.

58
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,310
She's like a tigress.

59
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,160
That's right.

60
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,520
Listen up.

61
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,040
You guys have ruined my plans

62
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,920
time and time again.

63
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,990
He might be able to tolerate you guys,

64
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,790
but I can't!

65
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,550
No matter how fierce you are,

66
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,600
we'll defend the rules of our valley

67
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,480
with our lives!

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,870
That's right!

69
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,310
Here, you're not allowed to do that!

70
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,960
I didn't do anything!

71
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,400
You're not even allowed to think of it!

72
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,400
Falling in love will bring bad luck.

73
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,110
Where did you guys learn that nonsense from?

74
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,920
It's the truth.

75
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,160
Twenty years ago,

76
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,160
His Majesty

77
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
fell for

78
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
a female Taoist.

79
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,960
That's how the Dragon Valley

80
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
was massacred.

81
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,640
(Within the Taoist clan, )

82
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,870
(only husbands)

83
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,480
(can comb their wives' hair.)

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
(Didn't you say)

85
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,230
(that you'd feel better)

86
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,350
(if you stayed close to the Heart Protecting Scale?)

87
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,480
(This is...)

88
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,190
(This is what I deserved.)

89
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:05,953
A love relationship

90
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,990
is the biggest scourge in the world.

91
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:10,750
That's right.

92
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,870
That wasn't

93
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,640
the Dragon King's fault.

94
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,400
It wasn't the fault of the relationship too.

95
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,080
It was the fault

96
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,480
of the evildoer

97
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
who used their relationship to deceive him.

98
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,750
We don't understand.

99
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,040
Anyway, no one is allowed

100
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
to fall in love here.

101
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,310
Smoke is coming out!

102
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,790
Huan Xiaoyan?

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,520
There's a spirit!

104
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,430
What are you doing outside?

105
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:42,670
Help!

106
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,040
Everything's fine now.

107
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,400
We've escaped from the forest.

108
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,400
We aren't in the Misty Forest now.

109
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,430
That's not it.

110
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,080
It's the ring.

111
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,040
Look!

112
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
The ring?

113
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,920
Our lord is in the ring too.

114
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,870
Now, he has gone berserk

115
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,920
due to the dark aura.

116
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,750
When I was in the ring,

117
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I saw you vanquishing the dark aura

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,670
in the forest with a stroke of the sword.

119
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,520
You should hurry

120
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,310
and do the same for my lord.

121
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,350
I'm begging you.

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,190
Look.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,310
I'm going bald because of him.

124
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,550
The sword you mentioned just now,

125
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,720
it flew off on its own.

126
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,640
The sword they were referring to,

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,960
could it be the Flaming Dragon Fang?

128
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,840
That's impossible.

129
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,670
I stood guard over it every day.

130
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,230
I always kept an eye on it.

131
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,350
No one pulled the sword out.

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
That's not true.

133
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,790
Someone did pull that sword out.

134
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Look at this.

135
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,120
Now, you know what happened, right?

136
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,720
So, he's truly the Dragon King.

137
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,790
The Dragon King

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
has finally returned.

139
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,030
He's truly the Dragon King.

140
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,430
Let's go to His Majesty!

141
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,720
Wait for me!

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Wait.

143
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,080
It's useless to go to him now.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
Right now, he can't pull out

145
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,480
the sword you need.

146
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,910
But why?

147
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,120
Only a pure-hearted person

148
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,670
can pull out

149
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,030
the Flaming Dragon Fang.

150
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,360
Right now,

151
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,880
he's trapped

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,720
by the past.

153
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,120
He's no longer pure-hearted.

154
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,320
What should we do then?

155
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,510
We need to think of a way to cure him.

156
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
You have to help me out.

157
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,030
I need that sword too if I wish to save my lord.

158
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,600
All right.

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,790
I'll lend you a hand.

160
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,750
What are you guys doing?

161
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,150
Your Majesty, welcome back.

162
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,080
Hurry!

163
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,480
Get up!

164
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Get up.

165
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,960
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,430
Sometimes, I sleep on duty!

167
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,960
But I never expected

168
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Your Majesty to come back!

169
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,550
How could we

170
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,390
treat His Majesty like that?

171
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,320
It's fine.

172
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,550
It's all in the past now.

173
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,320
Enough already.

174
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,030
You should let the Dragon King

175
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,080
rest now.

176
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,960
Your Majesty,

177
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,510
although we did

178
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,960
commit a heinous sin before this,

179
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,840
you must never

180
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,150
fall in love with a woman again.

181
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,390
What nonsense are you talking about?

182
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,270
Your Majesty,

183
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,910
this woman is trying to court you.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,080
Your Majesty!

185
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,150
You're talking nonsense again.

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,200
Let him go!

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,720
Don't mind him.

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,030
Let him go!

189
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,150
Your Majesty,

190
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,430
do you have feelings for this lady then?

191
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,550
I don't.

192
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:43,960
Let's go!

193
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,510
Time to go!

194
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,430
Let's escort His Majesty to his room.

195
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,670
Time to go!

196
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Time to return!

197
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Time to send His Majesty back!

198
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,880
Don't be sad.

199
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,020
(Dark Phantom's Mind's Eye)

200
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,880
Bai Xiaosheng,

201
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,030
do you know your fault?

202
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,080
My Lord,

203
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,200
I had no idea

204
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,360
that the Misty Forest

205
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,200
was the entrance to this realm.

206
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,720
However, you brought the Spirit Dragon here,

207
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,840
destroyed the entrance to the Misty Forest,

208
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,600
and almost ruined my plan.

209
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,200
I know my fault now.

210
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,150
How was the progress

211
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,550
of the task I had assigned you?

212
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,120
I've already found a suitable couple.

213
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,390
I'm planning to bring them to Qingqiu

214
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,430
to retrieve the secret treasure for you, My Lord.

215
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
You've made me wait too long.

216
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,550
Do not try anything funny.

217
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,550
I will keep a close eye on you.

218
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,000
So filthy.

219
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:10,987
What a jerk.

220
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,360
Wait.

221
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,510
I used the blood of the entire phantom spirit clan

222
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,030
to create the entrance

223
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,000
to our lord's mind's eye.

224
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,320
Since you brought the dragon here

225
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,960
and destroyed the entrance,

226
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,120
you have to repair it.

227
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,000
This is also

228
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,910
an order from our lord.

229
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,270
Shadows, come.

230
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,080
All good now?

231
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,480
Although we both serve the Lord,

232
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
you shall do your things

233
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,790
while I shall do mine.

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
Do not cause trouble for me.

235
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,000
You're so talkative.

236
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,790
One day,

237
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll take your life.

238
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,630
Before that,

239
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,080
I'll surely take your life first.

240
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,720
Try me then.

241
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,390
I'm already tired of living

242
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,390
anyway.

243
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,790
My Lord,

244
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,600
I will seek out

245
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
more power for you

246
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,080
so that you can regain your freedom earlier.

247
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,840
What a huge drumstick.

248
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,600
(Your Majesty, )

249
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,840
do you have feelings for this lady then?

250
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,430
I don't.

251
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,750
Let's go.

252
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,910
Your Majesty, time to go!

253
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,240
Let's go! Time to head back!

254
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,960
Let's go!

255
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,120
This fatty is crushing me.

256
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,190
Your Majesty, why are you still awake?

257
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,150
You guys can sleep.

258
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,950
Your Majesty, aren't you sleepy?

259
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,040
Your Majesty, will you attempt

260
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,040
to pull out the sword again tomorrow?

261
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,520
I have to.

262
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,040
Your Majesty, why can't you

263
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,880
pull out Flaming Dragon Fang now?

264
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,080
Maybe it's because

265
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,630
I've changed.

266
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,710
Your Majesty, no matter how much you change,

267
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,470
we'll defend you with our lives.

268
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,150
Especially when it comes

269
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,230
to having a relationship.

270
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,040
Don't worry.

271
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,630
I won't repeat the same mistake.

272
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,910
Go to sleep now.

273
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,880
So, was that considered a rejection?

274
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,840
I haven't even confessed to him yet.

275
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,990
There is still a long way to go.

276
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,040
I mustn't give up this easily.

277
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,120
But now that I think about it,

278
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,190
if I was hurt

279
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,630
by a person I loved,

280
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,120
I assume I would be fearful of love too.

281
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,670
I need to give him some time.

282
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,710
I'll wait for him.

283
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,520
Were you waiting for me?

284
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,950
Bai Xiaosheng?

285
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,710
The sunflower seeds here are delicious.

286
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,950
My... My Lord?

287
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,279
You can't just appear randomly

288
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,710
without telling anyone.

289
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,630
You scared me.

290
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,353
After so long,

291
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,670
you and I

292
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,950
were still reunited in this valley.

293
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,800
Is that so?

294
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,150
Where did you go?

295
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,430
It's a long story.

296
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Actually...

297
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,120
Bai Xiaosheng!

298
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,630
Kill!

299
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,470
Who is this?

300
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,759
Kill!

301
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,990
You're digging your own grave here.

302
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,430
Have mercy!

303
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,470
Please have mercy!

304
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,710
What's going on?

305
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,630
I don't know

306
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,990
what triggered my lord

307
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,520
to escape from the ring!

308
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,710
He's your lord?

309
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,390
Don't be scared.

310
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,390
Stay here and wait for my return.

311
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,520
A life for a life!

312
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,150
My Lord!

313
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,879
A life for a life!

314
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,520
I'm going to kill you!

315
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,560
You!

316
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm sorry!

317
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,040
My lord is usually a nice person.

318
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,040
Right now, he's influenced

319
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,080
by the dark aura.

320
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,280
That's why he lost control.

321
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,080
Bai Xiaosheng,

322
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,560
you were controlled by the dark aura too before.

323
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,990
You should understand

324
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,360
how my lord is feeling right now.

325
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,360
I do!

326
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,670
But I'm a victim too!

327
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,430
Not only is he hitting me,

328
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,230
but he's also digging my nose!

329
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,670
This won't do.

330
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,320
Why don't we sit down and talk it over?

331
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,910
That's right.

332
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,430
Let's talk it over.

333
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,520
My Lord!

334
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,910
A life for a life!

335
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,800
Kill him!

336
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,520
Is my nose crooked?

337
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,470
No.

338
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,760
What happened?

339
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,800
Are you okay?

340
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,390
You're here again?

341
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,880
What do you mean by again?

342
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,950
My heart

343
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,560
has never left.

344
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,320
Who exactly are you?

345
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,990
What's your connection

346
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,040
to the dark aura within the Misty Forest?

347
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,990
Since it has come to this,

348
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,800
there's no need for me

349
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,670
to hide this from you guys.

350
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,360
Actually,

351
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm a victim of the dark aura too.

352
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,670
How can I speak when you're dragging my collar?

353
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,630
Let him speak.

354
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,520
Yeah.

355
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,670
You should give him a chance

356
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,950
to explain himself.

357
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,990
Just look at my lord.

358
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,630
He's truly a victim.

359
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,800
This story

360
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,600
starts from

361
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,430
a long time ago.

362
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,670
Once upon a time, there was this person.

363
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,150
He manipulated the dark aura

364
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,560
and annihilated the Shadow Clan.

365
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,800
My mother protected me.

366
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,470
That's how I was able to survive.

367
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
But I wasn't immune

368
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,910
to the dark aura.

369
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,670
All these years,

370
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,560
I've been searching for a solution

371
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,320
to purge the dark aura in my body.

372
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,360
After many years of searching,

373
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,230
I finally found it.

374
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,040
There's one secret treasure in Qingqiu

375
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,280
that can relieve me of my suffering.

376
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,990
However, the secret treasure

377
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,880
can only be acquired

378
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,230
by the cooperation

379
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,470
of a loving couple.

380
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,080
So,

381
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,710
about the loving couple you mentioned,

382
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,990
was that why you kept trying

383
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,390
to be our matchmaker?

384
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,320
That's right.

385
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,360
A couple that truly loves each other

386
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,600
is much more precious

387
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,390
than the secret treasure.

388
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,320
And I'd failed countless times

389
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,560
until the day

390
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,900
I encountered you guys.

391
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,900
No wonder you've been

392
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,180
helping us along the way.

393
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,940
You do sound like you have a point.

394
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,460
Both of you were influenced by the dark aura.

395
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,540
Why is the Phantom King delirious

396
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,220
while you're perfectly fine?

397
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,620
That's because my true effigy

398
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,100
is still under someone else's control.

399
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,500
My body hasn't been fully corroded by the dark aura yet.

400
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,700
How could I know if someone

401
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,060
didn't manipulate you to say all of that?

402
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,620
It feels terrible

403
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,580
when your life is in someone else's hands.

404
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,100
I've trained hard for so many years

405
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,980
in order

406
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,900
to escape his control

407
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,860
and to get back my true effigy.

408
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,700
Who's the mastermind behind you?

409
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
It's the creator of the dark aura.

410
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,140
He's a visual spell master in Qingqiu.

411
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,540
It's a shame

412
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,460
that I don't know

413
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,980
what he looks like.

414
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,180
I don't even know

415
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,940
his name.

416
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,020
But of course,

417
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,940
my words alone are no proof.

418
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,740
It's normal for you

419
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,980
to be doubtful of me.

420
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,420
Therefore, I have a suggestion.

421
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
We should vanquish the dark aura

422
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,380
that's residing within the Phantom King's ring.

423
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,660
When he comes back to his senses

424
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,460
and exits the ring,

425
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,780
he'll tell you guys

426
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,860
that I'm not the culprit

427
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,500
behind the dark aura

428
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,660
within the Misty Forest.

429
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,100
That's right. You should vanquish it first.

430
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,060
But

431
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,060
he can't

432
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,420
pull out that sword of his.

433
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,940
This matter

434
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,620
concerns my reputation.

435
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,580
Therefore,

436
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,380
I'll do my best

437
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,860
to lend you guys a hand.

438
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,620
You're willing to lend us a hand?

439
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,860
Of course.

440
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,060
Come with me.

441
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,220
I don't need his help.

442
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,500
I know.

443
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,460
I know you don't need his help.

444
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,380
But I do.

445
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,260
Let's go.

446
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Rest early.

447
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,840
I'll make a move first too.

448
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,860
I'm doing this to help you guys out.

449
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,180
Wait for me!

450
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,940
You said that dragon rejected you?

451
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,460
But why?

452
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,060
It's common for people

453
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,260
to not have the same feelings

454
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,660
for others.

455
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,060
I finally figured it out.

456
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,020
What are you perplexed about?

457
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
By the way, I need to be honest with you

458
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,860
on one thing.

459
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,700
What is it?

460
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,540
Before this,

461
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,580
the lovey-dovey acts between me and Tianyao,

462
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,300
they were all fake.

463
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,420
We put on an act

464
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,020
because we needed your help.

465
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,220
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,620
What?

467
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,660
Are you serious?

468
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,180
But now,

469
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,700
I've truly fallen for him.

470
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,020
I'm being serious here.

471
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,060
It's no longer an act.

472
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,340
Good.

473
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,820
It's good as long as

474
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,860
you two love each other.

475
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,740
But now, I'm facing a situation.

476
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,660
How do I

477
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,660
help him

478
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,900
to get over his tragic past

479
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,180
and mend his broken heart?

480
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,060
Mending a broken heart?

481
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,660
I don't know how to do that.

482
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,060
I only know how to hold funerals.

483
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,980
Don't say inauspicious things like that.

484
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,420
I think she has a point.

485
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,780
Marriages and funerals,

486
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,340
they feel the same to me.

487
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,940
What I'm trying to say is

488
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,940
that both marriages and funerals

489
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,700
are major events in life, right?

490
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,660
We have to make preparations for them, right?

491
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,580
You're right.

492
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
You, tell us.

493
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,140
How do you usually hold funerals for other people?

494
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,340
I just play some music

495
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,180
with my instruments,

496
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,260
carve their epitaphs onto their tombstones,

497
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,460
and send them on their last journeys.

498
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,220
Must we hold a funeral for him?

499
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,980
This won't do.

500
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,460
It'll irritate him instead.

501
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,100
We should

502
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,420
think about events for the living.

503
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,980
I don't know anything else.

504
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,860
I don't understand

505
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,420
why he rejected you.

506
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,300
You're beautiful.

507
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,260
You have a great temper.

508
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,820
And you're kind too.

509
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,500
Are you talking about me?

510
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,940
You still trust me?

511
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,260
You were the one

512
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,300
who found me in the Misty Forest.

513
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,100
When you dragged me

514
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,900
out of the vines,

515
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,140
back then, my heart

516
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,060
was...

517
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,020
So, you like her?

518
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,500
Seems like you know nothing about the world of the living.

519
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,100
He's just trying to console me

520
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,060
so that I have the confidence to face Tianyao.

521
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,020
Listen.

522
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,980
Before this, when he tried

523
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,780
to set me up with Tianyao,

524
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,620
he made us

525
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,820
sleep in the same bed.

526
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,180
Really?

527
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,180
And,

528
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,940
not long ago,

529
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,220
he even monitored me on Tianyao's behalf.

530
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,740
He didn't allow me to talk to my eldest senior too.

531
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,860
That's right.

532
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,700
You've spent a lot of effort.

533
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,900
It must've been tough.

534
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,180
No choice.

535
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,540
They're the loving couple

536
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,780
that I've chosen

537
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,060
after all.

538
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,100
Don't worry.

539
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:14,987
I'll treat you as my buddy

540
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,300
because of your matchmaking effort.

541
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,620
If I do get together with Tianyao,

542
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,980
we might be able

543
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,820
to fulfill the promise I made to you.

544
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,740
But this is so difficult.

545
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,900
He has already shut his heart away.

546
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,500
How do we cure him?

547
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,180
How do we mend his broken heart?

548
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,140
Who wants to be your buddy?

549
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,140
Maybe Tianyao shut his heart away

550
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,060
because

551
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,980
he was shouldering

552
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,340
too many responsibilities and guilt.

553
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,820
He thinks

554
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,740
that the elves died 20 years ago

555
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,020
all because he fell for Suying.

556
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,300
If we want to reach his heart,

557
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,780
we have to make him reconcile with his past self.

558
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,020
Reconcile?

559
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,740
You have an idea?

560
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,580
Greetings, Your Majesty!

561
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,380
Greetings, Your Majesty!

562
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,220
Get up.

563
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,540
Your Majesty, you woke up early today.

564
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,900
Your Majesty, did you sleep well?

565
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,380
Your Majesty, are you going to pull out your sword?

566
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,180
Everyone, look!

567
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,980
It's that lady

568
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,380
and the newcomer again.

569
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,500
It looks like

570
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,940
they've been spending a lot of time together.

571
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
I'm sure she wants

572
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,420
to get into a relationship with him.

573
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,900
What a jinx.

574
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,820
You should leave the valley if you want to do that.

575
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,420
They've been together for quite some days.

576
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,140
I think they're already deeply in love with each other.

577
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
Your Majesty, you can go and retrieve your sword.

578
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:45,980
We'll

579
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,100
chase these jinxes out of our valley.

580
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,220
Just let them be.

581
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,620
His Majesty's cold and strong demeanor

582
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,580
looks so cool.

583
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,180
Is that so?

584
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,140
But I feel like

585
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
something's off.

586
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,180
What do you mean?

587
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,220
I think His Majesty is angry.

588
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
His Majesty is angry?

589
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,420
I didn't feel that.

590
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,780
No!

591
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,140
You mustn't go inside!

592
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
What are they doing?

593
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
Nothing.

594
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,740
They're not doing anything.

595
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,100
I don't wish to fight you.

596
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,540
Move aside.

597
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,820
And I can't defeat you.

598
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,580
I'm just here

599
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
to be on the lookout for them.

600
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,060
I'm begging you.

601
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,660
Just treat it as if they aren't here.

602
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,740
They've been working on it

603
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,980
for a long time.

604
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,180
They've been working on it

605
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,940
for a long time?

606
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,220
What exactly are they up to?

607
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,660
I...

608
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,860
I cannot tell you.

609
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,860
You'll know when they

610
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,100
feel like telling you.

611
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,260
Remember,

612
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,140
no falling in love in the Dragon Valley!

613
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,140
Okay.

614
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,980
Let me see yours.

615
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,780
It looks pretty cute.

616
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,340
Why are you so near to me?

617
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,100
Be serious.

618
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,980
I'm very serious.

619
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,020
Listen.

620
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,300
We don't have much time.

621
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,180
Let me show you something.

622
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,340
Look.

623
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,380
The puppy is happy.

624
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Be serious!

625
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:34,780
I'm being serious.

626
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,340
You're a shadow spirit, right?

627
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,420
Utilizing them

628
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,500
should be no problem for you.

629
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,460
That's right.

630
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,660
But it'll only be touching

631
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,060
if we put in

632
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,940
our true feelings.

633
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,820
If so, you need to memorize your lines.

634
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,580
Do you still remember

635
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,180
the line I utter

636
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,419
before you make an appearance?

637
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,020
What line?

638
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,500
The line where I say "Snow Wolf".

639
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
What do I do after that?

640
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,620
You'll then make an appearance.

641
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,220
Yanhui!

642
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,860
This is bad!

643
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,260
What's the matter?

644
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,540
Just now,

645
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,340
the dragon tried to come here.

646
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,300
I think

647
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,220
he found out

648
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,420
what we were up to.

649
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,620
Were we up to something?

650
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,620
He...

651
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,060
I think he cast away his worldly feelings.

652
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,700
He came here to remind us

653
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,660
that no falling in love is allowed in the Dragon Valley.

654
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,419
Was he trying

655
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,020
to tell us

656
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,140
to stop?

657
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,539
Yanhui, what should we do?

658
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,660
I think

659
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,100
you might not be able to win his heart.

660
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,020
Why don't we...

661
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,060
I don't care what he thinks.

662
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,500
I'm going to do it

663
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,540
if I've set my mind to it.

664
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
We cannot afford to wait any longer.

665
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,460
It all falls on tonight.

666
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,500
(It's that lady)

667
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,860
(and the newcomer again.)

668
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,940
(It looks like)

669
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,460
(they've been spending a lot of time together.)

670
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,620
(I'm sure she wants)

671
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,700
(to get into a relationship with him.)

672
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,740
I know.

673
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,660
I know you don't need his help.

674
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,660
But I do.

675
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,540
Let's go.

676
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Rest early.

677
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,580
(They've been working on it)

678
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,060
(for a long time.)

679
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,820
You'll know when they

680
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,340
feel like telling you.

681
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,140
Stupid sword!

682
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,980
What's wrong?

683
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,300
Your Majesty,

684
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,580
we're here to escort you.

685
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,620
The other elves aren't here today

686
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,300
because they went

687
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,380
to the tree by the lakeside

688
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,460
to watch a shadow play.

689
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,660
Shadow play?

690
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,780
It's the act that lady and her lover

691
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,820
had been preparing for.

692
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,940
Don't say the term "lover".

693
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,820
It's unlucky.

694
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,020
Her acquaintance.

695
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,900
I heard that they prepared it

696
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,540
for us.

697
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,940
They even prepared sunflower seeds and tea for us.

698
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,780
Stop looking.

699
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,020
Those who only think about love

700
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:50,900
won't be able

701
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,940
to come up with anything good.

702
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,260
That's right. We won't go there.

703
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,460
You guys can go there

704
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,700
if you wish to.

705
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,220
We don't want to.

706
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,980
Your Majesty,

707
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,100
but if you wish to go there,

708
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,660
we can join you.

709
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,860
-That's right. -That's right.

710
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,300
-Your Majesty, we can join you! -Your Majesty, we can join you!

711
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,460
I don't wish to go there.

712
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,940
Ladies

713
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,380
and gentlemen,

714
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,540
good evening.

715
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,940
In order to thank you all

716
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,380
for taking care of us

717
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,980
in the Dragon Valley,

718
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,379
we've prepared

719
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,980
an amazing shadow play for you all.

720
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,140
Are you ready?

721
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,420
Yes.

722
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Louder.

723
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,220
Are you ready?

724
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,420
Yes!

725
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,660
Good.

726
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,660
Let's begin!

727
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,140
Once upon a time,

728
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,140
there was a hermit

729
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,020
called Mr. Beiguo.

730
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,340
He lived

731
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,020
in a valley.

732
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,700
He kept plenty of

733
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,100
adorable pets.

734
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,580
He has always lived

735
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,220
a happy life.

736
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,820
You're too early.

737
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,980
One day,

738
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,580
the Snow Wolf came to the valley.

739
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,740
Snow Wolf,

740
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,140
what's wrong?

741
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,060
I'm hurt.

742
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,020
Can you please help me?

743
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,140
The kind Mr. Beiguo

744
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,580
helped the wolf out,

745
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,220
just like how he helped the other animals.

746
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,980
However,

747
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,940
he never expected

748
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,860
the Snow Wolf to bite the hand that feeds him.

749
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,660
It ate all of the animals

750
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,140
in the valley.

751
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,180
Mr. Beiguo

752
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,340
was also bitten by the Snow Wolf.

753
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,820
He only recovered after resting for a long time.

754
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,420
But Mr. Beiguo

755
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,300
regretted his decision.

756
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,940
And he blamed himself for it.

757
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,740
Until today,

758
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,180
he encountered someone

759
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,780
who knew about the incident.

760
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,980
Mr. Beiguo,

761
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,620
why did you choose to save the Snow Wolf?

762
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,900
Mr. Beiguo,

763
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,660
why did you choose to be kind?

764
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,700
It's because he didn't know about the wolf's intention.

765
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,660
That's right.

766
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,060
The animals died

767
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,740
because of you!

768
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,700
You committed this sin!

769
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,580
You should atone

770
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,820
for your sin!

771
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,740
Why did you hit me?

772
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,660
Why are you guys treating

773
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,900
Mr. Beiguo like this?

774
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,900
If you treat him like this,

775
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,500
Mr. Beiguo won't save other animals

776
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,180
if he finds them in danger next time.

777
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,460
He's not wrong for saving the Snow Wolf!

778
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,220
You're wrong.

779
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,820
Mr. Beiguo is in the wrong here.

780
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,540
The animals died

781
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,820
due to his kindness.

782
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,580
No.

783
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,260
No!

784
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,260
He's not at fault for being kind!

785
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,900
It's...

786
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,880
The Snow Wolf is in the wrong here!

787
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,580
That's right! It's the wolf's fault!

788
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,780
It's the wolf's fault!

789
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,460
You're right.

790
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,900
I also think

791
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,780
it isn't Mr. Beiguo's fault.

792
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,780
Don't spout nonsense again.

793
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,100
Sorry about that.

794
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,500
Tianyao!

795
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,980
Your Majesty!

796
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,740
Yanhui!

797
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,460
Yanhui!

798
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,300
Tianyao!

799
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,940
Yanhui, you crossed the line.

800
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I know.

801
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,660
But I have to cross the line

802
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,140
you drew.

803
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,220
My past

804
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,700
has nothing to do with you.

805
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,420
But your present

806
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,100
has everything to do with me.

807
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,860
Move aside!

808
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,420
I won't!

809
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,940
I don't want you

810
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,060
to get yourself injured

811
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,060
in the valley.

812
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,780
You're not putting in effort

813
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,340
for the sake of a better future.

814
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,820
You're just punishing yourself.

815
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,420
That's right.

816
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,220
So what if that's the case?

817
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,940
What has that got to do with you?

818
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,820
It breaks my heart.

819
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,660
Not for kids to see!
