00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:46,427
Yanhui…

4
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:49,427
Yanhui!

5
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,627
It's me.

6
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:58,357
Where's Yanhui?

7
00:01:58,427 --> 00:01:59,596
She was worried about you,

8
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,077
so she is preparing food for you now.

9
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:05,466
You used a significant amount of spiritual power.

10
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,867
How are you feeling?

11
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:11,597
Everything feels fine.

12
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:14,987
You did great yesterday.

13
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:15,987
I didn't expect you

14
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:16,877
to be able

15
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:18,037
to use your sword so soon.

16
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:20,397
Did you attain some sort of enlightenment?

17
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,147
All I knew at that moment

18
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:50,187
was I had to protect her.

19
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,397
Even without your memories,

20
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:53,507
you wish

21
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,187
to continue to protect her.

22
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,187
This is good.

23
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,707
You protected her

24
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,987
in front of those villagers too.

25
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:05,757
You acted as a master should.

26
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:12,117
I would've liked to protect her

27
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,517
if I didn't have so many other responsibilities.

28
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,427
You want a lot of things,

29
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:17,517
but

30
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:19,547
I only want Yanhui.

31
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,867
I will keep her safe.

32
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:28,347
Yun!

33
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:30,867
Yun!

34
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:34,717
Yun!

35
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:36,957
Cha!

36
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:39,117
Yun!

37
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:41,067
Let me look at you.

38
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:44,627
I met her in the back mountain

39
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:45,997
and brought her back.

40
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:46,957
Yanhui?

41
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:47,997
You…

42
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,067
When did you return?

43
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,867
You don't remember anything that happened before this?

44
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,397
What happened before this?

45
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,187
After you guys left,

46
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:56,277
I took Yun with me

47
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:56,997
to stay in the cave

48
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:57,747
where the dragon bone was sealed.

49
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,187
Thanks to the Flame Orb

50
00:03:59,187 --> 00:03:59,957
and the Dragon King's

51
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:00,717
remaining dragon scent,

52
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:01,717
Yun's cold disease

53
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:02,717
is a lot better now.

54
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,277
Then how did you

55
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,557
fall under the control of the dark aura?

56
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:07,067
Dark aura?

57
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:08,837
What's that?

58
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,837
(It seems that he lost consciousness)

59
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,277
(after he was controlled by the dark aura.)

60
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:15,517
Yanhui.

61
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:17,757
Dragon King, you're here as well.

62
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:24,717
Who is he?

63
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:26,957
He does not look

64
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,587
very bright.

65
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:31,987
This is Cha.

66
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,276
He is an old acquaintance of ours

67
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:34,157
in Tongluo Village.

68
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:35,467
Dragon King.

69
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,077
Yanhui,

70
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:46,717
what's wrong with the Dragon King?

71
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,027
Why does he look

72
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:49,397
a bit slow?

73
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,587
He was harmed.

74
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:55,547
What?

75
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,317
Who dared to harm my benefactor?

76
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:00,517
Dark Phantom.

77
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:01,467
Dark…

78
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:02,717
Dark Phantom?

79
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:04,717
Never heard of that name.

80
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,197
Let's lift the Frost Blossom Technique placed upon Qiyun first.

81
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:11,027
Come on.

82
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,077
Who are you?

83
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,547
Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain.

84
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,427
Can you save Yun?

85
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:22,667
Tianyao has mastered the technique.

86
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,157
He can break the Frost Blossom Technique.

87
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:30,587
You said

88
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,427
Yun was afflicted by the Frost Blossom Technique?

89
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:33,957
Isn't that one of

90
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:34,637
Chenxing Mountain's techniques?

91
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:35,227
Wait.

92
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,107
I'm afraid

93
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:38,586
we'll only be able to clear the misunderstanding

94
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:39,427
after Tianyao awakens

95
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:40,427
Master Qiyun.

96
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:48,547
Dragon King,

97
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:50,277
can you really cure Yun?

98
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:51,667
Using fire to drive away the cold

99
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,107
is the most effective form of treatment.

100
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,467
You should know that.

101
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:55,987
Then…

102
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:58,787
Will it hurt her?

103
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:01,987
I don't know.

104
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:05,077
I think

105
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:07,027
Master Qiyun would rather endure the pain

106
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:09,027
than stay mentally challenged for the rest of her life.

107
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:13,757
Fine.

108
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,957
You said

109
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,987
there was a remaining dragon scent in the dragon bone cave.

110
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:18,517
Tianyao just restored his powers.

111
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:19,547
Perhaps it would be better

112
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,427
to cast the spell there.

113
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:28,637
Slowly.

114
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,587
Where have you been all this time

115
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:34,547
when you were away?

116
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,027
A while ago,

117
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:38,026
I accidentally made a small tear

118
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,077
in Qiyun's clothes.

119
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,227
So I left the village

120
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:41,667
to buy some cloth,

121
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:42,957
needles, and threads.

122
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,157
You're as meticulous as ever.

123
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,467
After leaving Tongluo Village,

124
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,757
I noticed that the air was muggy and gloomy

125
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,787
all around.

126
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:54,027
I couldn't find a place

127
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:55,107
that sold any cloth, either.

128
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:55,957
So I decided…

129
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:57,107
Qiyun!

130
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,397
So I decided to come back.

131
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,027
But as soon as I turned around,

132
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:02,987
everything faded to black,

133
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,227
and I had no idea what had happened after that.

134
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:05,906
By the time I regained consciousness,

135
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:06,987
you guys were here.

136
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:08,197
I thought

137
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:09,347
someone had kidnapped me

138
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:11,107
to sell me off as a familiar.

139
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:26,957
Here.

140
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:29,987
Be careful.

141
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:52,957
What's the matter?

142
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:58,717
There is indeed my dragon scent here.

143
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:00,467
Let us cast the spell here.

144
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:07,877
Don't be scared.

145
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,107
Don't worry. It's all right.

146
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:38,276
This is Dark Phantom's deadly curse!

147
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:38,997
The spell backfired.

148
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:40,307
You can't go any further! Stop!

149
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:41,907
It's too late!

150
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,547
Yun!

151
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:55,997
Yun!

152
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:57,067
How could this have happened?

153
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,707
Why did the spell backfire?

154
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:00,397
The Frost Blossom Technique was originally

155
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:02,307
a fatal spell used to seal Dark Phantom.

156
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,947
Lifting the Frost Blossom Technique

157
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,637
triggers Dark Phantom's deadly curse.

158
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:06,787
This means

159
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:08,757
she will die the second the curse is broken.

160
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:26,117
Lingxiao…

161
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:28,907
Master Qiyun,

162
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:30,357
you've come around.

163
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,187
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

164
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,157
You must break the Five Elements Seal

165
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,547
and save the Spirit Dragon…

166
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:40,907
Yun!

167
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,237
Yun!

168
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:43,947
Yun!

169
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,547
Yun…

170
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:50,237
Yun…

171
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:53,787
Thank you

172
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,947
for all this while…

173
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:58,947
Yun!

174
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:00,947
Yun!

175
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:03,947
Yun!

176
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:05,157
Wake up…

177
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:06,157
Yun!

178
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,186
Yun!

179
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:08,707
Wait.

180
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:10,877
Dark Phantom's deadly curse uses the dark aura as well.

181
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,477
Cha, move aside!

182
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:15,067
You move aside!

183
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:16,117
I can absorb the dark aura.

184
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:17,747
Cha,

185
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:18,917
Yanhui and Dark Phantom

186
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:19,997
can both command the dark aura now.

187
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,356
Maybe she can use her way

188
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:22,596
to lift the curse

189
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,477
and save Qiyun.

190
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:24,987
Hurry!

191
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:27,197
Come on.

192
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:51,497
-Yun! -Yanhui!

193
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:52,817
Yun!

194
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,257
Yun…

195
00:11:55,337 --> 00:11:56,537
Is Yun all right now?

196
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,697
She should be…

197
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,817
I might have absorbed too much dark aura

198
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,057
recently…

199
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:03,697
What's wrong?

200
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:04,777
I feel a little tired…

201
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:07,417
I need rest…

202
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:09,217
Yanhui.

203
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:12,457
Yun…

204
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,697
(Tongluo Village)

205
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:50,817
Why not go inside and check on her

206
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,577
if you're worried?

207
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:55,137
You're awake.

208
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:02,497
I have Miss Yanhui to thank.

209
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:04,057
But how was she

210
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:05,257
able

211
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,777
to absorb the dark aura?

212
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:08,897
She cultivated Dark Phantom's technique.

213
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:09,297
Now,

214
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,857
even the dark aura accepts her as its master.

215
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,577
To think there was such a fated coincidence.

216
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:16,097
You told me

217
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,177
to save the Spirit Dragon.

218
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,137
Why did you say that?

219
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:22,697
What exactly is the reason and cause for all of this?

220
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:26,857
15 years ago,

221
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:30,297
I followed the dark aura

222
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,016
into the Misty Forest

223
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:34,177
in search of the dark practitioners

224
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:36,897
(and accidentally entered the mind's eye of the Dark Phantom.)

225
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,056
(There, I saw Qingguang struggling in a battle)

226
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:41,537
(against Dark Phantom.)

227
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:45,457
(I joined the battle)

228
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,297
(to help Qingguang.)

229
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,136
Thank you, Master Qiyun.

230
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:56,137
It is a blessing

231
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:57,897
that you are here…

232
00:14:58,057 --> 00:14:59,017
Master Qingguang,

233
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:00,337
where are we?

234
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,497
Why are you here?

235
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,337
There is no time for me to explain.

236
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,337
Dark Phantom used my body

237
00:15:05,497 --> 00:15:07,176
and tricked Suying into slaying the Spirit Dragon.

238
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,816
Fortunately, the Spirit Dragon wounded Dark Phantom severely

239
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:10,136
with his Flaming Dragon Fang,

240
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,817
and I was able to awaken within his mind's eye.

241
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,657
Your sword formation will not hold him.

242
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:17,337
If you manage to get out of here,

243
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:19,216
assemble the Taoist clans at once.

244
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,057
Destroy Suying's seal,

245
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,416
find the Spirit Dragon,

246
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,737
and eliminate Dark Phantom!

247
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:24,537
I won't let you!

248
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:32,017
The luminous frost drives away all impurities! Seal her aura!

249
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:35,737
Go!

250
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:37,137
Find the Spirit Dragon!

251
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:45,697
You can't stop me, old man.

252
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:50,177
I'll seal you away even if it costs my life!

253
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:53,376
The Frost Blossom Technique

254
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:54,537
delayed the effects of the curse,

255
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,457
but it also handicapped me mentally.

256
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,057
I retained the last shred of my consciousness

257
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:02,817
to tell the truth to the masters of the Taoist clans

258
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,057
when I met them.

259
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:10,497
So,

260
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:14,017
Master had already passed away by then.

261
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,697
He wanted me to let Yanhui leave the mountain

262
00:16:19,017 --> 00:16:20,097
so the Spirit Dragon

263
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,217
could find the Heart Protecting Scale.

264
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,457
I made mistakes.

265
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:30,857
But fortunately,

266
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:32,697
Yanhui

267
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:35,537
did it.

268
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:46,377
Easy there.

269
00:16:47,657 --> 00:16:49,137
That despicable Dark Phantom…

270
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:49,857
Why is the dark aura

271
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:51,457
so difficult to absorb?

272
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:53,097
Quick.

273
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:54,217
Drink some water

274
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,017
to warm your stomach.

275
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:22,697
(Back then, )

276
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:23,897
(I actually…)

277
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:30,457
How are you feeling?

278
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:33,376
Master Qiyun, you've recovered!

279
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:33,897
You…

280
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,897
What's wrong with Miss Yanhui?

281
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:40,057
I'm fine. I just ate something bad.

282
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:42,537
You absorbed

283
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:43,297
too much of Dark Phantom's dark aura.

284
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:44,417
It's affecting your body.

285
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:48,817
May I enter your mind's eye to examine your condition?

286
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:52,537
I suppose it can't hurt.

287
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:23,377
To think the dark aura

288
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,737
could be so calm!

289
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:30,977
I…

290
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,217
Is it bad?

291
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:35,537
Tell me.

292
00:18:35,977 --> 00:18:36,897
How is she?

293
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,137
Nothing is wrong with you.

294
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:41,537
But

295
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:43,817
your mind's eye

296
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:45,497
is calm and still.

297
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:46,737
I was astonished

298
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:47,977
by what I saw.

299
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,217
It is something I cannot achieve.

300
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:53,457
I just have

301
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:54,617
some clouds and mist

302
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,457
flowing calmly in my mind's eye.

303
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:57,137
Is there anything

304
00:18:57,297 --> 00:18:58,857
more than that?

305
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,657
The dark aura is an accumulation

306
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,697
of the most hostile and evil thoughts of a person.

307
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:04,897
Anyone who is afflicted by it

308
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:05,897
loses their sanity.

309
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,857
It requires every ounce of my control

310
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:09,857
to rein in the strand of dark aura within me.

311
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:11,577
Yet, you…

312
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,776
You are able to render the unbridled dark aura within your mind's eye

313
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:17,217
to be as calm as whispers of clouds and smoke.

314
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,937
That is remarkable indeed.

315
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:23,777
Of course, my Yanhui is amazing.

316
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:26,057
Master Lingxiao,

317
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:28,057
you have the dark aura within your mind's eye as well.

318
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:43,577
Yanhui!

319
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:45,777
You shouldn't have done that…

320
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:46,497
I'm fine.

321
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,416
You said my mind's eye

322
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:49,497
was still calm.

323
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:50,936
I must've just absorbed

324
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:52,537
too much dark aura for a moment.

325
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,977
Taking a little more won't hurt.

326
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,377
I just need a moment to gather myself.

327
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,497
Master Qiyun,

328
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:02,416
inside the cave,

329
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,417
you told us to rescue the Spirit Dragon.

330
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,537
What does that mean?

331
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:07,497
The Spirit Dragon is Dark Phantom's natural enemy.

332
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:08,816
Back then, Dark Phantom

333
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,257
possessed Master Qingguang's body

334
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,697
and joined forces with Suying

335
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:12,897
to slay the dragon

336
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:14,737
to eliminate his only natural enemy in this world.

337
00:20:17,177 --> 00:20:18,177
So the other person

338
00:20:18,377 --> 00:20:19,737
you said that hurt you

339
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,737
was Dark Phantom.

340
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,377
It was him again.

341
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,017
Dark Phantom…

342
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:32,217
Tianyao,

343
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:33,497
did you remember something?

344
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,097
Leave me.

345
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:49,337
Qingguang,

346
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:50,496
the evil dragon has been heavily wounded.

347
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,457
Quickly! Retrieve the scale and obtain his core!

348
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:56,097
He wanted my core.

349
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,457
I merged my core and scale into one.

350
00:20:57,697 --> 00:20:58,297
Then,

351
00:20:58,737 --> 00:20:59,897
I burned him with my dragon fire.

352
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:02,057
He didn't get his way.

353
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:04,857
So that was what happened.

354
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,057
During the time Master disappeared,

355
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:10,137
he fell under Dark Phantom's control completely.

356
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:12,097
The fire of the Spirit Dragon

357
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,937
allowed him to regain his consciousness momentarily.

358
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:15,696
That was why he sealed himself

359
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,857
in Starhaven.

360
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:19,817
Ten years ago, by chance,

361
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:21,417
I brought you back to Chenxing Mountain.

362
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,097
When he saw you,

363
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:24,857
he knew that you possessed the Heart Protecting Scale.

364
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,057
He sealed the power of the scale

365
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:28,897
so that you could live

366
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:31,217
and he could make me

367
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:33,056
chase you away

368
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:35,097
the moment something abnormal occurred

369
00:21:36,297 --> 00:21:37,257
to save...

370
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,257
The world.

371
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:45,217
He wanted Tianyao to find me

372
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:46,897
and retrieve the Heart Protecting Scale

373
00:21:47,257 --> 00:21:48,377
to fight Dark Phantom.

374
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:51,857
But I've already refined

375
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,057
the Heart Protecting Scale.

376
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:54,537
You refined it?

377
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,177
What should we do now?

378
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,937
What Dark Phantom truly fears is not

379
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:02,257
the Heart Protecting Scale

380
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,417
but the Spirit Dragon.

381
00:22:04,777 --> 00:22:06,977
The Spirit Dragon is still with us. There is still hope for us.

382
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:10,737
It is imperative

383
00:22:10,937 --> 00:22:11,697
that the Spirit Dragon

384
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:12,937
recovers all his power.

385
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,137
Have you found all parts of your body?

386
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:18,937
There's still the dragon heart.

387
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:21,337
Did you remember something else?

388
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:24,497
The dragon heart…

389
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:26,936
The dragon heart is located in the ice field

390
00:22:26,937 --> 00:22:27,657
of the Guanghan Sect.

391
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,137
This trip was not in vain.

392
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,897
Chenyi's method worked.

393
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,657
You did regain your memories.

394
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:37,337
Now that we know where the dragon heart is,

395
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:39,337
we just need to retrieve it.

396
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:40,977
Will you require

397
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:42,377
my aid?

398
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,457
I have become the Lady of Dark Aura.

399
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:48,817
Tianyao has made progress with his cultivation too.

400
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:49,857
We should be fine.

401
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:53,577
Dark Phantom is still at Starhaven.

402
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:56,057
We must have someone guard the barrier at all times.

403
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:57,337
That's true.

404
00:22:58,537 --> 00:22:59,497
Master Lingxiao,

405
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:00,696
the Starhaven cannot be left

406
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:01,897
unguarded.

407
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:04,097
But I have lost

408
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,657
all my power.

409
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,177
I will return

410
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,377
to Qiyun Monastery first thing tomorrow

411
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:10,817
and use my position as the leader of the monastery

412
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:13,057
to gather allies to discuss the matter

413
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,257
of defending against the Dark Phantom.

414
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:17,217
Good idea.

415
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:18,937
Tianyao,

416
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:21,216
may I borrow the tinder of the Spirit Dragon?

417
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:21,977
The tinder?

418
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:24,537
I can use the Spirit Dragon's flame

419
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:25,577
to reinforce the seal

420
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:26,937
to contain Dark Phantom.

421
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:30,297
Is that all right?

422
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,617
He taught me.

423
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:35,377
So,

424
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,417
you've been planning all of this

425
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:38,617
since coming

426
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,537
to Tongluo Village.

427
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:42,417
I always want too many things.

428
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:28,937
Thank you.

429
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:30,537
Mas…

430
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:42,657
If it's you,

431
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:45,137
you'll have no problem guarding

432
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:46,657
the barrier at Starhaven.

433
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:49,977
I cannot

434
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,337
put an end to Dark Phantom,

435
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:53,817
but I can stall him

436
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,017
and buy more time for you guys.

437
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:57,257
I know.

438
00:24:57,817 --> 00:24:58,777
But you…

439
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:02,897
You don't have to

440
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:05,737
shoulder everything by yourself.

441
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:10,977
He isn't alone.

442
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:13,937
All those who wish to join the fight

443
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:15,617
will come together to defeat the enemy.

444
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:16,537
All right.

445
00:25:17,577 --> 00:25:18,937
When the time is right,

446
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:20,577
we will all gather at Chenxing Mountain

447
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:22,377
and take down Dark Phantom once and for all.

448
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:42,657
Come out.

449
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:55,097
Cha.

450
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:07,177
I know

451
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,577
you're

452
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:09,857
Master Qiyun now.

453
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,297
I will forget everything.

454
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:13,817
Maybe you don't even

455
00:26:13,817 --> 00:26:14,777
want to remember

456
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:17,537
anything that happened

457
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,737
in Tongluo Village anymore.

458
00:26:21,097 --> 00:26:22,057
And I…

459
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:25,777
will also keep those memories

460
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,257
in the bottom of my heart.

461
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,497
I will never bring them up

462
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,457
ever again in my life.

463
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,457
But please!

464
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:38,457
I'm begging you!

465
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,016
Can you not leave without telling me?

466
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,257
I didn't.

467
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,417
You were in a deep sleep.

468
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:44,896
I left a letter.

469
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,017
That doesn't count!

470
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,017
You don't have to forget the memories.

471
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:03,217
For me,

472
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,817
after all these years,

473
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:08,057
these memories have become invaluable.

474
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:11,217
But, Cha,

475
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:13,416
I must return

476
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,337
to Qiyun Monastery now.

477
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:18,257
I've already caused you a lot of trouble.

478
00:27:18,377 --> 00:27:19,697
The path ahead is even more dangerous.

479
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:20,417
So I can't…

480
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,057
You can.

481
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:22,737
No…

482
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:24,257
I…

483
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:25,337
I…

484
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:27,017
I…

485
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:27,537
I just…

486
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:28,577
I just want to be with you.

487
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:30,297
I…

488
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:32,617
I… I want to stay by your side.

489
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,097
I can be your familiar.

490
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:36,057
It doesn't matter even if I can't be your familiar.

491
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:38,577
I know

492
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:40,337
you might not want a spirit like me as your familiar.

493
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:42,097
Then…

494
00:27:42,737 --> 00:27:44,297
Then let me escort you back to Qiyun Monastery.

495
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:46,577
Last time,

496
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:48,217
I met you at the borders of the Obsidian River

497
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,937
and escorted you all the way to Tongluo Village.

498
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,017
It's the final part of your journey.

499
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:54,737
How could I not be with you all the way?

500
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,217
It is precisely because this is the last journey

501
00:27:56,617 --> 00:27:58,337
that the trip will be all the more perilous.

502
00:27:58,977 --> 00:27:59,737
Cha,

503
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:00,817
listen to me.

504
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:02,457
I just want you to be safe and sound.

505
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:03,896
I can only be all right

506
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,217
when I am

507
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,097
with you.

508
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:15,537
Actually,

509
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,177
I was going to come back to you

510
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:18,536
after taking care

511
00:28:18,537 --> 00:28:19,497
of Dark Phantom.

512
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:26,017
But since you feel this way,

513
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:28,177
let's go together.

514
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,057
We shall never be separated,

515
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:43,577
no matter in the past or future.

516
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:47,777
Yun!

517
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:51,697
Yun, wait for me!

518
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:52,937
Here. Give me your bag.

519
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:54,697
Are you tired?

520
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:55,497
No.

521
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:56,137
Let me carry you.

522
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:57,537
I'm fine.

523
00:28:58,217 --> 00:28:58,897
Let me tell you something.

524
00:28:59,137 --> 00:28:59,937
There's a baozi shop

525
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:00,777
that sells great baozi

526
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,297
up ahead!

527
00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:03,737
I can eat ten of them in one go.

528
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:05,577
Let's go.

529
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,577
-They sell dumplings too! -Let's go, then.

530
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:07,457
Come on!

531
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,097
Mas…

532
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:31,097
I upset my eldest senior

533
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:32,617
when I went back to Chenxing Mountain.

534
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,057
Can you send him

535
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:36,137
my apology

536
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:38,097
when you get back?

537
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,177
I will not do that for you.

538
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:43,977
He'll teach you a lesson

539
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:45,417
after you come back.

540
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:51,337
Tianyao,

541
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:52,817
you must not slack on your cultivation

542
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:54,257
after my departure.

543
00:29:54,537 --> 00:29:55,576
The constellation in your mind's eye

544
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:56,297
has been lit.

545
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:57,696
You must train and consolidate your cultivation

546
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:58,817
even more.

547
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,297
You taught me

548
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:02,617
well.

549
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:04,657
You are a good master.

550
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:26,657
Take care.

551
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,097
When I was young,

552
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:52,137
that back

553
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:53,577
was

554
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:56,297
the broadest and most dependable I ever knew.

555
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:58,617
With him around,

556
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:01,417
any danger could be resolved.

557
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,577
But now I realize

558
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:09,377
that his back

559
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:12,417
was no different than any other.

560
00:31:13,937 --> 00:31:16,057
Instead, he looks even lonelier

561
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:18,497
because of all that he carries.

562
00:31:28,297 --> 00:31:29,297
I think

563
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:32,937
he was waiting for you

564
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:34,577
to call him "master".

565
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,737
We had a huge fight.

566
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:43,017
It's too soon for me

567
00:31:43,937 --> 00:31:45,497
to reconcile with him.

568
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:49,777
I'll definitely

569
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:51,777
let him hear it

570
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,057
the next time we meet.

571
00:32:03,377 --> 00:32:04,737
We'll be leaving soon too.

572
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,217
Let's pay a visit

573
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:07,897
to Grandma before we go.

574
00:32:09,817 --> 00:32:10,777
Grandma?

575
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:17,937
(Tomb of Madam Xiao)

576
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:27,857
Grandma,

577
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,817
I brought Fu

578
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,617
to see you.

579
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,577
(Tomb of Madam Xiao)

580
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:41,017
Tianyao,

581
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:43,457
pay your respects to Grandma.

582
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:46,937
Grandma,

583
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:50,697
it's me,

584
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:53,497
Fu.

585
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:01,977
Tianyao.

586
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:34,297
(Fu.)

587
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,217
(Fu.)

588
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:42,857
You won't be alone anymore,

589
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:46,017
Fu.

590
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:54,337
This is where we drank liquor together

591
00:33:55,857 --> 00:33:57,257
for the first time.

592
00:33:58,697 --> 00:33:59,817
At that time,

593
00:34:00,697 --> 00:34:02,817
you were still mourning the death

594
00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:04,377
of Madam Xiao.

595
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,177
You were drunk,

596
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,417
and you told me

597
00:34:08,737 --> 00:34:10,617
about how Suying dismembered you.

598
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:12,417
I didn't like you

599
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,737
at that time,

600
00:34:14,657 --> 00:34:16,097
but I sympathized

601
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:17,817
with you.

602
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,737
I asked you

603
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:24,416
how you were

604
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:25,737
still alive

605
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,737
after getting cut up into so many pieces.

606
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:32,057
You said…

607
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:33,457
It was to meet you.

608
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:35,017
"It was to meet you."

609
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:40,057
You remember that too?

610
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:49,217
Do you remember

611
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:51,217
anything else?

612
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:24,697
If it were not for the fact that I could not take the Heart Protecting Scale from you,

613
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:27,897
I wouldn't need you at all.

614
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,977
Why do you look so pale?

615
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:41,657
Does it hurt somewhere?

616
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:50,057
If I find the dragon heart,

617
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,297
I'll remember

618
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:55,337
even more things.

619
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:57,857
Of course.

620
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:01,217
But…

621
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:04,737
Is it really good for me

622
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:09,817
to regain all those memories?

623
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:13,897
Do you not want

624
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:14,977
to regain them?

625
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:19,737
Why?

626
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:22,817
In the past,

627
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:25,817
I hurt you repeatedly

628
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:28,777
and deceived you.

629
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:31,977
You treated me sincerely,

630
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:33,657
but I…

631
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,097
I was driven by hatred

632
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:42,137
and only tried to use you.

633
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:44,177
I even…

634
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:47,977
I even…

635
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:49,577
I even

636
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:51,817
tried

637
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:54,497
to kill you.

638
00:37:07,337 --> 00:37:08,657
I know

639
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:09,937
all of that.

640
00:37:13,777 --> 00:37:14,657
You do?

641
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:16,217
Then,

642
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:18,257
why did you let me stay with you?

643
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,257
Because…

644
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,017
I...

645
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:27,777
like you.

646
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:48,097
Why?

647
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:52,457
Don't you blame me?

648
00:37:55,657 --> 00:37:56,897
I did.

649
00:37:58,177 --> 00:37:59,737
I hated you so much back then.

650
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:01,177
I tried to get rid of you,

651
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:02,617
but I just couldn't.

652
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,377
Then, I found out why you did those things,

653
00:38:08,257 --> 00:38:09,417
and I stopped.

654
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:10,857
What was the reason?

655
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:17,697
Your hatred for a person, I guess?

656
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:20,657
That's not right!

657
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:21,457
The old me

658
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,577
would hurt you

659
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:23,897
just because of my hatred for someone else.

660
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:25,977
I don't want to remember

661
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,297
such vile memories!

662
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:29,577
That's not what I mean…

663
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:30,337
Yanhui!

664
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:32,857
I don't want to be my old self

665
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:34,377
who was filled with hatred and resentment!

666
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:36,617
Tianyao,

667
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:38,817
that's not what I meant.

668
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:43,177
In Tongluo Village,

669
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:44,897
Madam Xiao loved you,

670
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:46,497
and you looked after her

671
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,377
(as if she was your own grandmother.)

672
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:50,937
You even promised her

673
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:52,336
(to make sure Tongluo Village remains peaceful)

674
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:53,537
(as how it used to be.)

675
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:56,657
(You did it.)

676
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:01,537
Then,

677
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:03,377
we went to Yongzhou City.

678
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:05,617
You risked your life and fought Suying

679
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,137
(with your tattered body)

680
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,896
(to free)

681
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:10,017
(the enslaved spirits.)

682
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,497
In the Dragon Valley,

683
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,137
Suying forced you to retrieve the Heart Protecting Sale

684
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:15,777
in my heart

685
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,017
with the elf.

686
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:18,857
You cast a Life-Swapping Spell

687
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:20,337
(in my mind's eye)

688
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:21,737
(and saved me with your life.)

689
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,937
You never tried to hurt anyone.

690
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:38,377
Was what you said about me

691
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,337
true?

692
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:45,897
Yes.

693
00:39:46,337 --> 00:39:47,097
Tianyao,

694
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:48,497
hatred

695
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:50,257
did not change

696
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:51,297
your true self.

697
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:57,097
You still have

698
00:39:57,337 --> 00:39:59,177
a heart of gold.

699
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:04,537
You may not remember

700
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,657
your past self,

701
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:07,857
but I do.

702
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:10,857
You've been through pain.

703
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:13,417
The only thing

704
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:15,416
that kept you going

705
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:16,617
in the midst of despair

706
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:18,177
was this hatred

707
00:40:18,577 --> 00:40:19,497
and discontent.

708
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:24,177
I have seen you emerge

709
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:25,816
from an abyss

710
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,217
where no one else has been there before,

711
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,256
and that abyss

712
00:40:29,257 --> 00:40:30,416
is what gave you resilience

713
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,257
and made you stronger than any other.

714
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,297
Tianyao,

715
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:37,457
I,

716
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:39,897
We,

717
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:42,777
need you.

718
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:11,377
Even though

719
00:41:11,577 --> 00:41:12,777
this heart harbored hatred,

720
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:15,137
if it means being able to protect you,

721
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:18,817
I will find my whole

722
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:21,377
once more.

723
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:34,937
Grandma,

724
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:37,297
thanks to your blessing,

725
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,497
Fu recalled even more things.

726
00:41:42,897 --> 00:41:43,657
Grandma,

727
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:46,977
we'll come back here and drink again

728
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:50,057
when everything settles.
