1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,866
Come and have a look.

4
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:44,226
(Wangyu Tower)
Come.

5
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:44,916
Slowly.

6
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:45,746
Exclusive prescription! Mouth ulcers!

7
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:46,356
There's no rush.

8
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,196
Never-ending coughs? Feeling irritable?

9
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:49,706
Night sweats?

10
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:50,506
As long as you have this,

11
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:51,996
you can be cured.

12
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,436
Gather around.

13
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,026
Don't push.

14
00:01:56,436 --> 00:01:56,946
All right. Next.

15
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:57,716
Please come inside.

16
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:00,386
My neighbor

17
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:01,636
couldn't be cured at many clinics.

18
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:02,996
In the end, he was cured

19
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:03,586
by Physician Fu.

20
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:04,356
Is that so?

21
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,306
I can finally cure myself of the illness
that has been troubling me for years.

22
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:11,306
Next.

23
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:14,466
(Men are charming)

24
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,116
(when they work.)

25
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,556
What's wrong?

26
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:21,396
What's wrong with me?

27
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,466
(Is it the Heart Protecting Scale again?)

28
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:30,276
(This doesn't feel right.)

29
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,116
Done.

30
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:38,066
Next.

31
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,996
What are you?

32
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,106
You have no aura on your body.

33
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:56,066
Neither do you.

34
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:56,866
Are you

35
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:58,396
a human?

36
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:03,156
I've had an inflammation recently.

37
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:03,866
Here.

38
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:06,236
Remove the pimple on my face.

39
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,156
Otherwise, you are finished.

40
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:26,786
Stupid familiar.

41
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,516
I dare you to touch him.

42
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,956
He's just a familiar.

43
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:38,906
Is this necessary?

44
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:39,746
I'm the only person

45
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,466
who can hit my familiar.

46
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,276
Do you

47
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,716
like him?

48
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:58,186
(Is that what it is?)

49
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:01,906
Do you love him deeply?

50
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:03,156
Are you willing to die

51
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,026
for him?

52
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:12,346
I suggest you have your brain examined.

53
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,186
I can't cure your illness.

54
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,396
You feel shy, don't you?

55
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,986
It's all right. I understand.

56
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,316
Do your best.

57
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:25,156
I have high hopes for both of you.

58
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,876
Don't let me down.

59
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:27,836
I will forget

60
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:28,666
about the pimple.

61
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,076
Physician Fu is great.

62
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,346
Yongzhou City is full of weird people.

63
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:52,156
You must be cautious in the future.

64
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:01,756
What's wrong?

65
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:02,636
I...

66
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:05,516
I don't know.

67
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:06,716
I'm fine.

68
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,156
Well...

69
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,346
Turn around.

70
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:13,546
Why?

71
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:14,876
Turn around!

72
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,666
Which side?

73
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,216
Whatever! Just turn around!

74
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,906
(She has been acting weird recently.)

75
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,316
Isn't it delicious?

76
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:37,226
It's so delicious.

77
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:39,395
(Couple Trial)

78
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,906
(The trial for this Taoist spirit couple)

79
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,756
(should be very interesting.)

80
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,516
What's wrong with me?

81
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,986
You are love-struck.

82
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:54,106
Love-struck?

83
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:55,156
Love-struck?

84
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:56,716
To Tianyao?

85
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,396
How is that possible?

86
00:05:58,586 --> 00:05:59,516
Impossible.

87
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,906
Why isn't it possible?

88
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:01,906
Love always

89
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,106
comes suddenly.

90
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:07,026
Well, why?

91
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:08,276
There's no reason.

92
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,276
Love is something you can't figure out.

93
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:21,156
Impossible.

94
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:21,956
Absolutely impossible.

95
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:23,106
It's not possible.

96
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:24,106
How?

97
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,516
No way.

98
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,276
No way.

99
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,636
Not at all.

100
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:28,426
No.

101
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,106
Lady.

102
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:31,716
The young master of the Feng family,
Feng Qianshuo,

103
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,316
has gotten a new concubine.

104
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,546
He has invited you to the ceremony.

105
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:40,786
Look.

106
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,276
He already had a few concubines,

107
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:44,876
but he didn't say why he got a new one.

108
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,876
Since you fell for him,

109
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,386
you need to look after your familiar.

110
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,515
Many monsters have gone missing

111
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,346
for no reason

112
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:54,466
in Yongzhou City recently.

113
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:56,466
Missing?

114
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,196
Why?

115
00:06:58,756 --> 00:06:59,956
I am still investigating.

116
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:01,756
Anyway, just be careful.

117
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:04,956
Let's go, Yuli.

118
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:06,756
Come with me to meet
the young master of the Feng family

119
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:08,156
tomorrow.

120
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:43,276
(Oh no. It's happening again.)

121
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,666
What's wrong with you

122
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,026
recently?

123
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,396
I'm fine.

124
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,226
What is this?

125
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:57,672
I plan to retrieve

126
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:58,906
the dragon horns from the tower.

127
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:00,986
I want you

128
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:05,076
to give me some Heart Blood.

129
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:09,196
Are you going to get the dragon horns tonight?

130
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:10,106
Aren't you afraid Suying

131
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:11,196
has set up a trap

132
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,716
to catch you?

133
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:14,956
I scouted the place.

134
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,906
There's indeed a Gold-eating Beast

135
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:18,226
hidden in the Dragon Horn Formation.

136
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:19,516
But I have

137
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,106
made enough gold

138
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,396
to distract the Gold-eating Beast

139
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:24,076
and buy time to break the formation.

140
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,546
(It turns out he was borrowing money...)

141
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,026
Yanhui, lend me 3,000 gold.

142
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:29,906
It's for an emergency.

143
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,636
(To reclaim the dragon horns.)

144
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,426
You were spending my luck.

145
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,426
(He worked hard to make money)

146
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,306
(to retrieve the dragon horns.)

147
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:44,906
(I didn't expect him)

148
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:46,756
(to prepare and plan)

149
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:47,706
(in secret.)

150
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,236
(Meanwhile, I have been immersing myself)

151
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:51,306
(in the weird feelings)

152
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:53,186
(and got obsessed.)

153
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:56,026
Suying is so brazen.

154
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,306
She must have something up her sleeves.

155
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,516
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

156
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:01,876
I'll go with you.

157
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:02,516
No need.

158
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:04,356
As you said,

159
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:05,826
Suying will have something up her sleeves.

160
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,356
The dragon horns are the second most important.

161
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:08,276
What she wants the most

162
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:09,426
has always been the Heart Protecting Scale.

163
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:10,306
I will not be in danger

164
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:11,546
as long as you are not around.

165
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:12,996
Right now,

166
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,826
snatching the Heart Protecting Scale
away from you

167
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:16,186
is easy for her.

168
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,396
You are right.

169
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,356
Go without me.

170
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:42,698
(Wangyu Tower)

171
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:56,666
Here you go.

172
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,066
Be careful.

173
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,026
You need to be careful, too.

174
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:54,826
Thank you.

175
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:03,906
It's so great.

176
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,156
Love comes all of a sudden.

177
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:08,866
But thankfully,

178
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:10,226
I am rational.

179
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:11,956
I didn't get overwhelmed

180
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:13,476
by love.

181
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:40,996
(Sneaking out for fun)

182
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:42,476
(without his master's consent?)

183
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:45,186
(This familiar)

184
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:49,066
(is not loyal.)

185
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,116
(Let me see)

186
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:57,826
(where you are going.)

187
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,376
(There were no guards a few days ago.)

188
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,426
(Why are there so many)

189
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,066
(disciples of the Guanghan Sect here today?)

190
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:33,636
Sect Leader.

191
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:00,476
Do you have a death wish?

192
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,186
Sect Leader.

193
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:11,786
Tianyao.

194
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:34,276
She has transported the dragon horns.

195
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:36,236
I have taken away the dragon horns.

196
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:36,786
Thank you

197
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,066
for your help during this period.

198
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:39,236
Leave with me.

199
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:40,826
Yes.

200
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,826
You are no match for her.

201
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:03,716
Why did you follow me?

202
00:14:07,286 --> 00:14:08,566
For some reason,

203
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:11,876
I fell in love with you.

204
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:33,526
I will never

205
00:14:33,646 --> 00:14:34,716
fall in love again.

206
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:13,476
Yanhui.

207
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,596
What?

208
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:21,286
Thank you.

209
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,356
What for?

210
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:27,996
Thank you

211
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:29,116
for stopping me today.

212
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:32,956
Should I see you

213
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:34,326
sacrifice yourself

214
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,836
and get me in trouble?

215
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:43,996
However,

216
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,446
I didn't expect Suying

217
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,116
not to recognize you.

218
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:52,926
If I were to

219
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,646
do something like what she did,

220
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:57,526
I would not live

221
00:15:57,646 --> 00:15:58,926
with a clear conscience,

222
00:15:59,046 --> 00:15:59,956
let alone sleep well.

223
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:00,956
If the other person

224
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,406
were planning something,

225
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:03,756
I would be worried

226
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:04,996
and frightened.

227
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:07,756
How can she be so calm?

228
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:20,206
Do you still remember

229
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,286
the appearance of the bug

230
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:23,926
you just chased away?

231
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:27,476
Wasn't it just a bug?

232
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:28,166
They all look the same.

233
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,286
Why should I remember it?

234
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,406
To Suying,

235
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:35,876
I am that bug.

236
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,206
Someone dispensable.

237
00:16:38,356 --> 00:16:39,476
She can get rid of me easily

238
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,356
if she thinks I'm an eyesore.

239
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:47,646
Tianyao.

240
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:49,926
There's a water bug

241
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:51,406
in legends.

242
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,076
Its name is Hui.

243
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:56,166
It turns into a serpent after 500 years.

244
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,286
A serpent turns into a dragon
after a thousand years.

245
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,652
The dragon becomes a Horned Dragon
after 500 years.

246
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,166
After 1,000 years, it becomes the Ying Dragon.

247
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:03,926
Mortals believe

248
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,556
dragons aren't born as dragons.

249
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,756
They become dragons

250
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,926
after enduring the passage of time,

251
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:13,166
adversity, pain, and change.

252
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:19,846
I believe

253
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,206
you will one day

254
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,556
change back into a real dragon.

255
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,476
You might become

256
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:29,686
so strong that the people who humiliated

257
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:30,796
and overlooked you

258
00:17:30,956 --> 00:17:32,516
can only acknowledge your existence.

259
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:52,606
You are so stupid.

260
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:56,206
Why did you scold me when I was comforting you?

261
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:58,886
Hui is a water snake.

262
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,476
You...

263
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,756
Shut up!

264
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:12,796
He is the Millennium Spirit Dragon?

265
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:16,476
In that case,

266
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:17,646
the dragon horns

267
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,716
belong to him.

268
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:23,556
Interesting.

269
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,606
Since the Guanghan Sect
transported the dragon horns at night,

270
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:27,716
where would

271
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:30,886
they hide them?

272
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,366
(Tianxiang Workshop)

273
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:37,756
I'm sure this one will do.

274
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:39,996
It'll be done

275
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:42,846
after refining a day with the dragon horns.

276
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,886
The person who sealed the dragon horns

277
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,476
is quite impressive.

278
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,686
(Let me see)

279
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,206
(if your love)

280
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:36,446
(can overcome this trial.)

281
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:53,366
Is he from Tianxiang Workshop?

282
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,991
(Tianxiang Workshop's young owner, Feng Qianshuo)

283
00:21:58,223 --> 00:21:59,995
Young Master Feng from Tianxiang Workshop

284
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:01,445
is marrying another concubine.

285
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,036
Seriously.

286
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,086
He is the only successor

287
00:22:05,206 --> 00:22:06,606
of the Tianxiang Workshop, after all.

288
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:11,926
Halt.

289
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:15,845
That's Miss Xiange from Wangyu Tower.

290
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:17,796
Young Master Feng, can we speak in private?

291
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:19,926
A lady is snatching a man.

292
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,276
Sure.

293
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:26,024
I invited you every time

294
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,720
whenever I married a concubine.

295
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:30,206
You were never here.

296
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:31,036
What?

297
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:32,756
You finally came this time,

298
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:35,236
but you're trying to snatch me away?

299
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:38,996
I have something

300
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:40,886
that requires your assistance.

301
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:44,646
You didn't come here

302
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,516
because you cared about me?

303
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:49,726
I do have something I care about,

304
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,036
but it's not you.

305
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:57,926
Seems like

306
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:58,996
I fell in love with the wrong person.

307
00:22:59,036 --> 00:22:59,606
Whatever.

308
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:01,276
It's rare for you to be here.

309
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:02,446
What is it?

310
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,476
I want to know something.

311
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:05,276
Ask away.

312
00:23:05,606 --> 00:23:06,796
What is inside.

313
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:07,716
Tianxiang Workshop?

314
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,646
Tianxiang Workshop
is a business of the Feng family.

315
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:17,956
Don't tell me

316
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:19,366
that you know nothing.

317
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:22,796
Why are you

318
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,166
asking me that suddenly?

319
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:25,886
That's because

320
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,276
there's an increase in missing familiars

321
00:23:27,316 --> 00:23:28,206
in Yongzhou City.

322
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,236
I want to know

323
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:30,756
where these missing familiars

324
00:23:30,796 --> 00:23:31,556
have gone.

325
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,956
That is none of your business.

326
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,206
Also, knowing

327
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:38,206
about that

328
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:39,646
does your harm.

329
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:42,756
You won't tell me?

330
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:47,236
Fine.

331
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,086
I'll ask you one question.

332
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,556
Are those missing familiars

333
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:52,846
related

334
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:54,316
to Tianxiang Workshop?

335
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:04,006
Yes.

336
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:06,206
Thank you.

337
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:08,086
You...

338
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:14,646
I never owe people any favors.

339
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:15,886
Since you gave me the information,

340
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,846
I will pay you the reward.

341
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:19,996
Is that so?

342
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,036
I don't want any gold or treasure.

343
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:25,166
Why don't you

344
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,686
give me a kiss?

345
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:49,686
You are always happy

346
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:51,206
after meeting Young Master Feng.

347
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:53,686
Nonsense.

348
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:56,756
I see that Young Master Feng

349
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:58,036
is loyal to you.

350
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:00,406
He sent you invitation letters

351
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:02,556
whenever he married a concubine.

352
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,206
It seems to me

353
00:25:05,236 --> 00:25:06,756
that he just wants to make you angry.

354
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:08,556
Since you

355
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:10,126
like Young Master Feng as well,

356
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:12,276
why don't you tell him honestly?

357
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,276
He is different

358
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:18,276
from us.

359
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:27,766
(Tianxiang Workshop)

360
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:59,066
(Wangyu Tower)

361
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:11,606
Who is it?

362
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,086
No.

363
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:24,316
No!

364
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:26,482
I can't take it early in the morning.

365
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,276
Stay away from me.

366
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:30,446
Turn around.

367
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,276
Don't let me see your face.

368
00:26:33,276 --> 00:26:34,756
I am someone who just confessed to you

369
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,126
and got rejected by you.

370
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:37,476
Can you know your place

371
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:38,756
and stop making me excited?

372
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:39,956
Oh no.

373
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,796
I can't take it anymore early in the morning!

374
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:43,716
I can't take it.

375
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,956
No. I can't take it.

376
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:53,606
Control yourself.

377
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,166
Wait.

378
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:00,606
What is this?

379
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:02,606
The golden beans I've earned recently.

380
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:05,366
You asked me to control myself,

381
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:06,446
and you're still giving me money?

382
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:07,476
Are you seducing me

383
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:08,646
or rejecting me?

384
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,276
I'm taking it away, then.

385
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:12,686
Wait.

386
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,716
Go away. Leave the money here.

387
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,476
Hello, deary.

388
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:36,646
Regarding the heart issue

389
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:37,716
you asked about previously,

390
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:38,516
Qijue Agency's answer

391
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:39,716
is to study more

392
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:41,846
if you are heartless.

393
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,715
Replenish iron if you lack blood in your heart.

394
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:44,446
- Also...
- Stop!

395
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:46,446
Is that reliable?

396
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:47,366
You're asking me to eat iron?

397
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:48,796
You should just ask me to eat dirt instead.

398
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:51,036
Do you need me to answer this question?

399
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:52,516
No need.

400
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:53,756
Just tell me.

401
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:54,995
What should I do if my heart lacks flesh?

402
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:56,166
That

403
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:57,446
is a difficult problem.

404
00:27:57,556 --> 00:27:58,556
If you only

405
00:27:58,606 --> 00:27:59,206
lack a little,

406
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:00,686
it will recover by itself.

407
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:02,606
If you lack a lot,

408
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,206
you might need external help.

409
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:07,316
External help?

410
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,646
For example, a huge power

411
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:12,926
to fill in the gap in your heart.

412
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:15,236
A huge power.

413
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:16,926
How huge?

414
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:18,086
For example,

415
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,236
the power of the Millennium Spirit Dragon.

416
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,316
(Nonsense.)

417
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:25,756
What else?

418
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:28,206
According to Qijue Agency's knowledge,

419
00:28:28,556 --> 00:28:29,476
nothing else.

420
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:33,956
That's it?

421
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:36,056
And you want me to pay you 100,000 gold?

422
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:39,686
After receiving your 100,000 gold,

423
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:41,476
we also have a gift for you.

424
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:45,886
Until now,

425
00:28:45,996 --> 00:28:47,316
your spending

426
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:48,086
at Qijue Agency

427
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,956
totals up to 120,088 gold.

428
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:51,406
Congratulations on surpassing
Young Master Wang

429
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:53,646
and topping the Richest Clients Leaderboard

430
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:56,086
of Qijue Agency.

431
00:28:57,886 --> 00:29:00,646
Do you also operate the gambling den?

432
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:06,236
Yes.

433
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:08,086
Seems like you spent your money for nothing.

434
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,166
Not really.

435
00:29:12,276 --> 00:29:13,366
At least I know

436
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:14,446
my life

437
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:15,996
can only remain

438
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:17,446
with huge power.

439
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:18,796
Huge power?

440
00:29:20,036 --> 00:29:21,276
In that case,

441
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,646
when I complete my body,

442
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:23,846
I will be able to help you recover

443
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:24,886
the missing piece of your heart.

444
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:25,716
Then,

445
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:26,926
you can still live

446
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:27,926
without the Heart Protecting Scale.

447
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:30,036
So, tell me.

448
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:31,276
How do you plan to get the dragon horns?

449
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:34,086
Are you willing to help me?

450
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,606
What else can I do?

451
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:53,556
(This fragrance pill)

452
00:29:53,716 --> 00:29:55,086
(has the aura of my dragon horns.)

453
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:57,446
Can you guess what this is?

454
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:01,556
The pimple guy.

455
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:02,646
Why are you here?

456
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:04,126
(When did he come inside?)

457
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:05,886
(I didn't notice him at all.)

458
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:07,926
Who are you?

459
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,716
Where did you find this?

460
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:10,886
What is this?

461
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:15,036
Do you want to know?

462
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:15,996
Sure.

463
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:17,316
But you have

464
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:18,406
to agree to a condition of mine.

465
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:20,406
What condition?

466
00:30:20,516 --> 00:30:21,646
I want

467
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:23,366
her.

468
00:30:23,476 --> 00:30:24,036
Impossible.

469
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,036
Why do you want me?

470
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:28,126
I want you to leave him.

471
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:29,316
Although I don't know

472
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:30,276
what you two are talking about,

473
00:30:30,406 --> 00:30:31,276
I can't leave him.

474
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:32,036
I tried.

475
00:30:32,036 --> 00:30:32,886
I couldn't do it.

476
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:37,886
Do you love

477
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:38,516
this disabled dragon

478
00:30:38,646 --> 00:30:39,996
so deeply?

479
00:30:42,796 --> 00:30:44,556
He knows your identity?

480
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,366
Where's my dagger?

481
00:30:46,956 --> 00:30:47,926
We can't let him leave!

482
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:48,956
Calm down.

483
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:50,646
Calm down.

484
00:30:50,926 --> 00:30:52,086
Don't worry.

485
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:54,236
I will never tell anyone

486
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:55,956
your true identity.

487
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:57,886
Actually, I'm here to help you.

488
00:30:58,366 --> 00:30:59,886
If she is willing to leave with me,

489
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,086
I will immediately

490
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:02,606
tell you the dragon horns' location.

491
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:07,886
What

492
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:10,406
do you want?

493
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:12,606
Give me this lady, and you will get a secret.

494
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:13,606
Will you do it?

495
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:14,406
No.

496
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:17,036
(This familiar can really endure the trial.)

497
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:17,846
Stop talking nonsense with him.

498
00:31:17,996 --> 00:31:19,166
We can't let him leave.

499
00:31:20,406 --> 00:31:21,796
What a coincidence.

500
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,276
I'm not leaving.

501
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,846
You tied me up professionally.

502
00:31:34,256 --> 00:31:36,056
Tell me. What's your name?

503
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,126
I am Bai Xiaosheng.

504
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,766
After leaving you,

505
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:44,035
I couldn't forget your pretty face.

506
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,085
It was

507
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:47,036
love at first sight.

508
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,126
Nonsense!

509
00:31:48,236 --> 00:31:49,716
The gaze of liking someone

510
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,646
should be like how I look at him.

511
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:57,206
(There she goes again.)

512
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,366
Judging from

513
00:32:00,476 --> 00:32:00,996
your empty gaze

514
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:01,846
and scheming look,

515
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,036
you must have an ulterior motive.

516
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,166
I'll give you another chance.

517
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:06,516
Fine.

518
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:07,796
Actually,

519
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:10,476
you look like my previous love.

520
00:32:11,316 --> 00:32:13,316
You are both charming, pretty,

521
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:14,516
and bold.

522
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:15,996
When I saw you,

523
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:19,646
it felt like looking at the sun.

524
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,446
Is that so? Where's the sun?

525
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,556
She's dead.

526
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:32,556
She's dead.

527
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,235
You'll be dead if you lie again.

528
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:34,846
Why won't you believe

529
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:35,956
that it was love at first sight?

530
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:36,606
You...

531
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:37,446
Enough.

532
00:32:37,716 --> 00:32:38,796
Don't talk nonsense with him.

533
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,366
Hold it.

534
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:42,796
Miss Yan.

535
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:43,996
I'm willing to tell you

536
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,206
the location of the dragon horns,

537
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:47,846
but I'm only going to tell you.

538
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:49,686
Come here.

539
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:55,476
Tell me.

540
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:57,476
Come closer.

541
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:06,515
Suying took the dragon horns.

542
00:33:06,516 --> 00:33:08,926
I saw the whole process.

543
00:33:10,716 --> 00:33:11,406
(Nonsense.)

544
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:12,446
(I was there, too.)

545
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:13,516
(Why didn't I see you?)

546
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:18,236
I have a special ability.

547
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:21,556
I can hide my trace.

548
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:23,926
(I hid in a spot)

549
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:25,126
(where I would not be discovered.)

550
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:26,316
(Anyway, )

551
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:27,606
(the disciples of the Guanghan Sect)

552
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,556
(didn't notice that I was following them.)

553
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:31,366
(I followed them)

554
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:33,716
(to a place.)

555
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:39,206
(And I saw the dragon horns there.)

556
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:46,406
The dragon horns are at Tianxiang Workshop.

557
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:49,756
He said they were at Tianxiang Workshop.

558
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:50,756
Let's go.

559
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:59,086
(She doesn't plan)

560
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,686
(to make the dragon horns hers.)

561
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:02,015
(This pair of master and familiar)

562
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
(can forget about their self-interests.)

563
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,236
(They do have a really close relationship.)

564
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:06,716
We don't know where he comes from.

565
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,356
How does he know you are a dragon?

566
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:09,308
The Seven Star Disciples

567
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,453
of the Guanghan Sect are capable.

568
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:12,436
Even if they didn't notice him,

569
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:13,206
the dragon horns

570
00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:14,526
should be heavily guarded.

571
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:15,876
How could he investigate the place

572
00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:16,916
without being seen?

573
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:18,126
Do you think

574
00:34:18,236 --> 00:34:19,166
he is sent here by Suying?

575
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:20,206
He is here to confirm our location

576
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:21,486
and capture us all.

577
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:23,526
When Suying wants to do something,

578
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,796
she will do it herself

579
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,046
without doing it in a roundabout way.

580
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:29,236
Does she know

581
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:30,526
that I possess the Heart Protecting Scale?

582
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:31,436
If another person

583
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:32,716
knew about the Heart Protecting Scale,

584
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:33,916
you would have been dead.

585
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:35,836
We have ruled out

586
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:36,876
every possibility.

587
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:38,716
There has to be a reason.

588
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:40,646
Seems like

589
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,236
it was really

590
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:44,316
love at first sight for him.

591
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:54,876
Someone used to tell me

592
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:56,316
that when every impossible result

593
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:57,571
has been eliminated,

594
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,560
the only reason remaining

595
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:00,057
will be the truth.

596
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:02,646
Sudden love is bound to have an ulterior motive

597
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,796
behind it.

598
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:05,086
Aren't you afraid?

599
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:06,526
Didn't my love for you

600
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:08,086
come suddenly as well?

601
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,796
Tell me. What is my ulterior motive?

602
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:10,756
I want you to lie to me

603
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:11,876
and stab me?

604
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,086
(This person's origin is unknown, )

605
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:21,206
(and his trail is mysterious.)

606
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:22,605
(I'm no match for him)

607
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:23,716
(with my current ability.)

608
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:28,356
Why did you take out

609
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:29,436
the Heart Blood?

610
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:32,716
Fusing blood with the formation
to trap this person.

611
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:33,876
This is for you to retrieve the dragon horns.

612
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,126
That's such a waste.

613
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:36,236
He knows too much.

614
00:35:36,356 --> 00:35:37,206
We can't let him run around.

615
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:39,086
I already tied him down.

616
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:40,086
You won't be able to tie him down.

617
00:35:59,886 --> 00:36:02,286
He said the dragon horns
were in Tianxiang Workshop.

618
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:04,046
Do you think it's believable?

619
00:36:04,316 --> 00:36:05,606
I was planning

620
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,126
to scout the place tonight, anyway.

621
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:08,966
What if it's a trap?

622
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:11,476
We'll know after scouting.

623
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:12,476
All right.

624
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:14,236
I'll go with you.

625
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:15,286
You?

626
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:17,876
Don't try to stop me.

627
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:18,966
I can't see you

628
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:20,566
getting hurt right now.

629
00:36:20,676 --> 00:36:21,606
I just don't want myself

630
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:22,996
to feel bad.

631
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:34,866
(Tianxiang Workshop)

632
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:43,756
What's that noise?

633
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:49,356
Be careful.

634
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:52,436
You are the one who should be careful.

635
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:53,916
I like you right now.

636
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,486
You must keep a distance from me.

637
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,486
Otherwise, I'll be infatuated.

638
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,046
Don't touch me.

639
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,166
This is serious.

640
00:37:05,646 --> 00:37:06,206
Let's go.

641
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:08,756
Move!

642
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:09,396
Hurry!

643
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:11,236
Move!

644
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,126
Walk faster!

645
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,646
Hurry up! Move!

646
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:17,396
Familiars.

647
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:19,396
Hurry up! Move!

648
00:37:20,276 --> 00:37:21,646
What are they doing?

649
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:24,046
I can sense the dragon horns' aura inside.

650
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:26,316
Let's have a look inside.

651
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:27,486
Let's go.

652
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:45,206
I knew you wouldn't give up.

653
00:37:45,316 --> 00:37:46,526
This place is dangerous. Come with me.

654
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:47,166
I'm not leaving.

655
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:48,356
I want to know the whereabouts

656
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:49,086
of the missing familiars.

657
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:50,566
Is it worth it

658
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:51,436
just to help a bunch of monsters?

659
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:54,206
Yes.

660
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,126
Where are they?

661
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:10,716
Where are those people?

662
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:12,086
It's heavily guarded outside,

663
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:13,646
but there's no one guarding inside.

664
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:35,236
It's a Starpoint Formation on the door!

665
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,126
Someone triggered the Starpoint Formation.

666
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:40,916
Come with me.

667
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:44,166
Come on.

668
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,606
Are we leaving already?

669
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:51,646
Young Master Feng!

670
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:53,566
Young Master Feng!

671
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:54,957
Which thief

672
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:56,396
dares to trespass on Tianfang Workshop?

673
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:04,126
They are hurt. They can't go far.

674
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:04,876
After them!

675
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:05,916
- Yes!
- Yes!

676
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:10,236
(The body)

677
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:10,966
(of the man in black)

678
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,316
(whom I hit looked like...)

679
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:14,316
The injury

680
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,566
on your left shoulder looks serious.

681
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,046
I've stopped the bleeding for you.

682
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,916
How is it? Are you feeling better?

683
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:22,356
This isn't worth it.

684
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:27,526
It is.

685
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:48,646
Xiange.

686
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:49,486
Yanhui?

687
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:52,716
Who is this?

688
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:53,566
We shouldn't stay here for long.

689
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:54,646
Help me bring him back.

690
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:55,637
Sure.

691
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:56,606
Carry him.
