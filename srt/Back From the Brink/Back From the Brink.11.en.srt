(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 11)
(Watch on www.kisskh.co)

3
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,488
Judging from the current situation,

4
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:48,978
Yongzhou is already an empty city.

5
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:49,978
(It seems that the Guanghan Sect)

6
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,208
(has already relocated the people in the city.)

7
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,768
(Suying is preparing to exterminate everyone without mercy.)

8
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,076
(Tianyao won't be able to hold on much longer.)

9
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:56,177
(We must think of another way)

10
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:56,818
(to help Tianyao.)

11
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,488
We must quickly capture the evil dragon's accomplices

12
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:00,713
to share Master Suying's burden.

13
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:01,378
Yes, Master.

14
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,128
Keep up!

15
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:03,128
Let's go.

16
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:12,528
Later,

17
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:13,528
do as I say.

18
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:15,338
I'll deal with Feng Ming.

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,520
I'll hold them off

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
so you can do what you need.

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,470
But...

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,030
You're a mortal.

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
How can you go against them?

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
This is the most powerful magical tool

25
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,150
of the Feng Clan.

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,280
It'll protect me.

27
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:34,232
Follow me!

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,080
Hurry, they're coming.

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,310
Remember,

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,640
you owe me a kiss.

31
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,960
I forbid you from dying.

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
Don't worry.

33
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,590
Qijue Agency

34
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,520
never owes anyone anything.

35
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,680
Go now.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,520
Master, Young Master Feng is over there.

37
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,120
My dear nephew,

38
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,800
you were really hard to find.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,470
There's no need

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,800
to come to this.

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,400
We're a family

42
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,120
with the same blood flowing in our bodies.

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,360
I don't want to kill you.

44
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,560
So long as you hand over

45
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,590
the evil dragon and his accomplices

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,310
to the immortals of the Guanghan Sect,

47
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,710
I can spare your life.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,750
I'm not good

49
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,280
at betraying like you, Uncle.

50
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,751
Don't you fear death at all?

51
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,061
Fear?

52
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,341
Did you know the seventh Don't

53
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,501
of Qijue Agency

54
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,191
is to never retreat?

55
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,501
You're still alive.

56
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:14,821
Great.

57
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,581
You're even more ruthless

58
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:20,261
than your father.

59
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,111
That was rare.

60
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:27,191
It's the only compliment

61
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:29,231
you ever gave me in this lifetime.

62
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:39,261
With the Heart Protecting Scale on you,

63
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,714
you indeed recovered well.

64
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:44,701
But with your current state,

65
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,231
if you think you can stop me from taking the scale,

66
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,261
you can stop dreaming about it.

67
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:04,501
(Arena, Level 18)

68
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:21,351
You...

69
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,021
I promised to help you.

70
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:23,821
So I'll keep my word.

71
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,141
Where did you come from?

72
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:27,461
I've been hiding in your shadow.

73
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:29,191
How much spiritual power have you accumulated?

74
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,311
No matter how much I have,

75
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:36,261
I have to go for it.

76
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:55,351
You weakling.

77
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,431
Don't even think about hurting the one I'm protecting.

78
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,461
Your companions

79
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,621
went to the dragon horns' barrier?

80
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:11,461
Tianyao,

81
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,501
it's been twenty years,

82
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,406
and you've learned how to lie.

83
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:16,978
We can fight

84
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,986
and destroy Yongzhou city.

85
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:20,081
It doesn't matter to me,

86
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,021
but it seems it doesn't matter to you either.

87
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,911
Very well.

88
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,581
You go ahead and do what you need.

89
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:54,751
I won't let it get in your way.

90
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:55,941
Be careful.

91
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,267
By my knowledge,

92
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,431
by my breath,

93
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,311
by the life in my body,

94
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:12,061
I invoke the presence of the divine.

95
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:21,701
Dispel!

96
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,021
Dispel!

97
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,911
Dispel! Dispel!

98
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,861
Dispel! Dispel!

99
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,981
Dispel! Dispel.

100
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:38,311
Dispel!

101
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:39,671
Dispel!

102
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,191
Why is it not broken yet?

103
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,151
Dispel!

104
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:03,701
Dispel!

105
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,061
You're such a cute little thing.

106
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:20,391
Heart Protecting Scale is not on you?

107
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,261
Where's the Heart Protecting Scale?

108
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:35,981
You couldn't obtain it 20 years ago.

109
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,861
And you still can't obtain it

110
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,941
twenty years later.

111
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:43,941
Tell me.

112
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,791
Where is the Heart Protecting Scale?

113
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:53,581
Bai Xiaosheng.

114
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:54,581
Yes, Yanhui.

115
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:57,631
Earlier, you said

116
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,581
you were willing

117
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,791
to channel spiritual power into my mind's eye.

118
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,031
Do you think it's possible to break it

119
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,191
after combining it with your spiritual power?

120
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,551
You can.

121
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,191
But my spiritual power

122
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,311
isn't good for you.

123
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,431
I'm willing to take the risk.

124
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:19,311
All right.

125
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,271
Unlock.

126
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:56,581
Bai Xiaosheng.

127
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,061
(Break the black rocks apart.)

128
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,101
By my knowledge, by my breath,

129
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:58,191
by the life in my body, I invoke the presence of the divine!

130
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,101
Break!

131
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:16,399
Tianyao,

132
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,271
I got it.

133
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,121
(Yanhui.)

134
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,031
(She made it.)

135
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,391
Hurry.

136
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,241
There's light.

137
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:42,480
-The barrier is broken. -Let's get out of here.

138
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:42,991
We can get out now.

139
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,241
-There's light! -Let's go!

140
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:44,961
Come on! Let's go!

141
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:45,841
We can finally leave this place.

142
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,511
Hurry!

143
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,841
Quickly now!

144
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,390
-That's great. -Let's leave.

145
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:50,601
This is such a blessing!

146
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:06,631
It looks like Yanhui has broken the Dragon Horn Formation.

147
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:10,321
Xian...

148
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:11,721
Xiange.

149
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:17,151
You actually killed the Gold-Eating Beast.

150
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,481
Do you think you can escape

151
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:20,671
after taking the dragon horns?

152
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:35,391
Hurry.

153
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,481
Give it to Tianyao.

154
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:37,671
He can't hold on much longer.

155
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:41,151
All right.

156
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:59,321
Suying?

157
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:03,871
Yanhui.

158
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,081
(I can't believe I run into her right after breaking the barrier.)

159
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,241
(Am I going to lose the Heart Protecting Scale?)

160
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:24,991
I've seen you before.

161
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:29,911
I didn't expect you

162
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,871
to be a disciple of Chenxing Mountain.

163
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:33,751
What is your star tier?

164
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:36,201
Why are you with the monsters?

165
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,721
Dragon King! Dragon King! Dragon King!

166
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:47,441
Tianyao.

167
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,081
Dragon King! Dragon King! Dragon King!

168
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,241
Who broke the barrier?

169
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:53,791
The longer you delay,

170
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,911
the longer he'll suffer.

171
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:00,561
Dragon King! Dragon King! Dragon King!

172
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,151
Dragon King! Dragon King! Dragon King!

173
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,031
I'll ask one last time!

174
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,391
Who broke the barrier?

175
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:05,871
We don't know.

176
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:06,561
What do we do now?

177
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,121
Please save the Dragon King!

178
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,321
How do we rescue him?

179
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,001
I'll fight you to death!

180
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:14,281
No! Don't go!

181
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:19,561
Master Suying, I know the answer you seek.

182
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:20,761
You?

183
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:22,871
I found out a secret

184
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,391
from the evil dragon.

185
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:26,801
The Heart Protecting Scale.

186
00:17:28,871 --> 00:17:30,431
You know where it is?

187
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:31,471
Yes.

188
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,951
Please allow me to whisper it to your ear.

189
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,361
Sure.

190
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,391
Yanhui!

191
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:41,281
-Yanhui! -Don't go!

192
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,231
Yanhui!

193
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:48,431
No.

194
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:19,631
I

195
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,151
never liked you.

196
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:30,321
Dragon King!

197
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,081
Are you all right, Yanhui?

198
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:33,431
You must have a death wish.

199
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:35,081
Hurry, you don't have much time.

200
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:36,151
Merge with the dragon horns now.

201
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:39,151
Traitor of the Taoist clan.

202
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:45,121
Who are you to speak of betrayal?

203
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:46,671
Spirits are evil

204
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,001
and should be eliminated.

205
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,321
This woman is too powerful.

206
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:56,561
I can't hold on for long.

207
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:06,431
I may be weak.

208
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:07,391
But I'm willing to give all I can.

209
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,081
Let's do this!

210
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,391
Do you think a bunch of spirits like you

211
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,001
can stop me?

212
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,521
You're overestimating your abilities.

213
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:52,151
I'll help you.

214
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,361
Stop it!

215
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:17,431
Let them go!

216
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:18,081
Musheng?

217
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,001
Let them go.

218
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,231
Or I'll kill him.

219
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:24,561
I heard you've been searching

220
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:26,191
for Mr. Lu for twenty years.

221
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,231
How unfortunate it would be

222
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,391
if I killed him by mistake.

223
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,801
Bound with the heavens.

224
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,601
Summoning the vast mountains and seas.

225
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:34,191
Are you going to let them go or not?

226
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,431
Let them leave Yongzhou

227
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:36,151
now!

228
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:39,521
Yes or no?

229
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,001
Yes.

230
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,121
I'll let them go.

231
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,601
Calling forth the roar of the dragons from the eight directions.

232
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,001
What's that?

233
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,161
It's a dragon! Look!

234
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:14,111
It's a dragon!

235
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,041
Where did the dragon come from?

236
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:15,911
-There's a dragon. -Why is there a dragon?

237
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,481
Look at that!

238
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,591
Senior, look.

239
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:19,631
Why is there a dragon?

240
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:20,271
This is bad.

241
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:21,401
Stop it!

242
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,311
I can't kill you.

243
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:24,881
But I can kill myself.

244
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,031
Musheng!

245
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:32,031
Musheng!

246
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:35,271
Musheng!

247
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:38,881
Ma'am,

248
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,401
do we have to go after the evil dragon?

249
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,231
In this world,

250
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:46,481
nothing is more important

251
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:47,911
than his life.

252
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:50,161
Return to Guanghan Sect.

253
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:51,951
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:01,591
Tianyao,

255
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,441
we did it.

256
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:05,311
Everyone survived.

257
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:24,521
I'll definitely help you

258
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,751
regain your complete body.

259
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,321
Yanhui. Tianyao.

260
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:58,794
Are they all right?

261
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:02,881
She's out of strength.

262
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,681
He also exhausted his strength.

263
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,991
They'll be fine after getting some rest.

264
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:12,361
We're not far from Fengya Town.

265
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:13,711
I have a villa there.

266
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:14,361
Wouldn't it

267
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:15,081
be better

268
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:15,991
to let these two rest there first?

269
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:17,881
That's a good idea.

270
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:22,951
Let's go.

271
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:29,991
Miss,

272
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:31,791
the matter has ended here.

273
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:32,921
Perhaps

274
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:34,711
this is where we bid farewell.

275
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,081
Thank you.

276
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:39,557
I'm glad that we've succeeded in the task.

277
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:45,551
I would like

278
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,081
to apologize to everyone here.

279
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:50,191
Mr. Feng,

280
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:50,998
what are you doing?

281
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:51,896
Today, I summoned

282
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:52,791
the family's guardian

283
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,161
and learned the truth.

284
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:01,031
Thank you for helping me, guardian.

285
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:02,991
I'm not the family guardian,

286
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,231
but a familiar

287
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,401
who signed a pact of servitude with your father.

288
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,551
Years ago, I was almost killed

289
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,321
by Feng Ming due to an ambush.

290
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:13,191
Your parents sealed me

291
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,791
in a gemstone to save me,

292
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:16,471
which delayed

293
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,751
their chance to escape.

294
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,711
Your father made

295
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,121
a final agreement with me

296
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:22,951
to protect you in times of danger.

297
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,401
How could this be?

298
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:25,751
It can't be.

299
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,951
Now that the vengeance is cleared

300
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,841
and you have grown into an adult,

301
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:32,447
I can finally go and see my former master

302
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,031
in the afterlife.

303
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:46,951
All these years,

304
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:48,921
I was wrong

305
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:51,991
to hate the monsters.

306
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,231
I was narrow-minded

307
00:24:58,361 --> 00:24:59,031
and offended

308
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:01,031
many of you.

309
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:02,881
Stop apologizing.

310
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:03,921
We're all comrades

311
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:05,191
who have fought together.

312
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:05,991
Don't be too uptight.

313
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,081
We're all friends here.

314
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:08,271
But

315
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,471
if you run into monsters again,

316
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,681
you should treat them better.

317
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:11,991
Not all monsters

318
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:14,191
are as reasonable as we are.

319
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,081
I will.

320
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,401
Where are you

321
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:20,121
planning to go?

322
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,161
In this vast world,

323
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,551
there will always be a place for us

324
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:24,681
beyond Yongzhou.

325
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,471
I want to go home.

326
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,441
I don't have a home anymore.

327
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:33,921
Why don't you come to my house?

328
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:36,641
You said so yourself.

329
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,921
Since you invited me,

330
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:39,231
then...

331
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:39,991
Forget I said that.

332
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:40,681
I was only teasing you.

333
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:41,841
You can't take it back.

334
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:42,601
All right, then.

335
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,921
We'll bid farewell here.

336
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,471
We'll see each other when fate brings us together.

337
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,401
Thank you for taking care of us, miss.

338
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:52,791
We'll be taking our leave now.

339
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,961
Suying! What happened to him?

340
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:45,401
The evil dragon and his accomplices

341
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:47,081
used Mr. Lu as a tool to threaten the Leader.

342
00:26:47,631 --> 00:26:48,511
What?

343
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,081
Didn't Suying already take precautions

344
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,511
and send you to protect Mr. Lu?

345
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,271
But Mr. Lu...

346
00:26:59,121 --> 00:26:59,991
Miss,

347
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,576
I was sent here by Master Suying

348
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:02,551
to wait for you.

349
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:03,271
Take her.

350
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:05,031
Stop it!

351
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:07,321
You...

352
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:09,991
Let her go.

353
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:13,791
Stop it!

354
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:15,601
I can't kill you.

355
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,161
But I can kill myself.

356
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:20,751
Musheng!

357
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,071
Musheng!

358
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:25,551
(He actually betrayed Suying.)

359
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,361
Mr. Lu is completely

360
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:28,401
different

361
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:29,591
from the past.

362
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:36,648
Suying, you must not save him!

363
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:37,441
He betrayed you.

364
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:38,641
You still want to use the Burning Blood Technique to save him?

365
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:39,271
Don't you know

366
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:40,201
you'll hurt yourself?

367
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:40,831
Get out!

368
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:41,921
Suying!

369
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,201
Suying,

370
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:50,881
you've always doted on me, but now...

371
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,031
(Lu Musheng, )

372
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,721
(you must not die.)

373
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,641
(You promised me.)

374
00:28:36,602 --> 00:28:39,331
(Young Lu Musheng)

375
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:45,921
You're awake?

376
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:17,231
You saved my life today

377
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:18,031
and also helped me

378
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:19,721
seal this evil spirit.

379
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,201
It's fate.

380
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,161
Thank you.

381
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:26,791
Miss, where are you going?

382
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,271
I'm going to exterminate other evil spirits.

383
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:31,681
I want to learn how to capture spirits.

384
00:31:31,881 --> 00:31:32,551
Miss,

385
00:31:32,815 --> 00:31:34,705
it must be a dangerous and rough journey,

386
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,440
right?

387
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,551
Why don't you let me accompany you?

388
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:43,231
That's not necessary.

389
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:45,481
Wait.

390
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:52,311
Bring this

391
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:54,161
with you.

392
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:00,361
Miss,

393
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:01,791
I really want

394
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:02,991
to learn how to capture spirits from you.

395
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:08,401
After you're more capable,

396
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:09,751
you can come and find me.

397
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,161
Suying!

398
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:57,751
You are...

399
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:12,201
It's you.

400
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:15,231
I've finally

401
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:16,961
mastered some skills now.

402
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:20,511
So you're a general now?

403
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:24,271
It was a promise I made to you.

404
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,201
What?

405
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,071
(I promised you in my heart)

406
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:54,928
(that someday)

407
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:57,321
I'll stand by your side.

408
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,088
(Feng Family's Villa) (Wuqi Hall)

409
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,401
(I'll definitely help you)

410
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:09,361
regain your complete body.

411
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:21,321
Yanhui.

412
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:24,671
Thank you.

413
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:33,631
Yanhui.

414
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,281
Yanhui?

415
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,591
(No, I'm too weak.)

416
00:35:49,991 --> 00:35:51,441
(I can't enter her mind's eye.)

417
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,031
(Chenxing Mountain Starhaven)

418
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:50,631
(Qingguang, Former Leader of Chenxing Mountain)

419
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:55,071
Yanhui.

420
00:36:59,344 --> 00:36:59,934
(Something's wrong.)

421
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:01,719
(During the process of guarding the barrier, )

422
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:02,414
(I must not be distracted.)

423
00:37:03,414 --> 00:37:04,664
(Nature of heaven and earth.)

424
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:06,264
(Disperse impurities and negative energy.)

425
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:07,054
(Stabilize!)

426
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,894
(There's a strange disturbance on the seal of Yanhui's mind's eye.)

427
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:14,104
(There seems)

428
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:15,089
(to be another power inside.)

429
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:17,054
(It looks like I need to send someone to check on her.)

430
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:33,794
(Bring Yanhui back)

431
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:37,341
Master has not

432
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:38,664
given up on Yanhui after all.

433
00:37:44,624 --> 00:37:45,624
I shall obey your order.

434
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:25,414
Who's bothering me?

435
00:38:26,624 --> 00:38:27,784
Who's that?

436
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:40,574
Yanhui, you're up.

437
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,829
So it was you!

438
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:43,627
I wonder

439
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,446
how are they doing now.

440
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:46,264
We should just worry about ourselves.

441
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:52,784
You two...

442
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:58,225
Yan... Yanhui, what are you doing?

443
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,249
Beating him.

444
00:38:59,385 --> 00:39:00,385
Beating him?

445
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:01,535
He was the one who helped us escape.

446
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:03,135
He's very weak now.

447
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:04,135
You can't hit him now

448
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,350
even if you're angry.

449
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:06,745
Who bothered you?

450
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,560
It was you.

451
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:08,753
I was channeling spiritual power to you.

452
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:09,943
It was you!

453
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:11,193
Yanhui, stop it!

454
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:12,673
Can't I beat him?

455
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:13,793
No, you can't.

456
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,273
You're right.

457
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:17,793
I can't beat him.

458
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:20,423
But I don't know

459
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:22,543
I can't seem to control myself!

460
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,103
It's irritating!

461
00:39:25,273 --> 00:39:26,023
Everything annoys me!

462
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:27,353
It's very hot!

463
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:28,873
I just can't stand it!

464
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:32,233
What's wrong with her?
