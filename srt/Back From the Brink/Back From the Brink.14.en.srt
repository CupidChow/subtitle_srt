1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,060
(Wuqi Hall)

4
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,270
In that case,

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,520
both of you were behind

6
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,910
the incident in Yongzhou.

7
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
Yes.

8
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,240
In the beginning,

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,080
I indeed wanted

10
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,520
to help Tianyao retrieve his dragon horns.

11
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,640
But after that,

12
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,189
I did it to rescue the lives

13
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,470
of the trapped monsters in Yongzhou.

14
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
The truth is, the dragon

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,829
is not as fierce and brutal

16
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,080
as rumored.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,550
And not everyone

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,190
in the Taoist clan is righteous.

19
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,829
I had no idea the Guanghan Sect

20
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,150
would do such a thing in Yongzhou.

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,710
Yanhui,

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
is the dark aura

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
still inside of you?

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,960
When Tianyao used his sword

25
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,320
to dispel the black aura in the Misty Forest,

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,639
the black aura in my mind's eye

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,760
had been destroyed as well.

28
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,550
I'm glad to hear that.

29
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,990
I didn't expect him

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,549
to have the capability to destroy the black aura.

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,360
Senior,

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,200
what exactly is this black aura?

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,710
This dark aura

34
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,520
is the evilest energy in the world.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,270
It can make people lose their minds.

36
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,319
The phantom spirit in the Misty Forest

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,429
was corrupted

38
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,270
by the dark aura.

39
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,920
Phantom spirit?

40
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,319
Have you also encountered a phantom spirit?

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,830
Yes.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,240
After I was dragged away

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,320
by the thorny tree that day...

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,100
(Phantom King)

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,200
Are you from the Taoist clan?

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,480
Yes.

47
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,710
I'm looking for someone who has a dark aura in their body.

48
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,800
It's not you.

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,710
You don't have it.

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,270
Let's play hide and seek!

51
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,390
Time to play hide and seek!

52
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,360
(That phantom spirit)

53
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,079
(mistaken me for someone else and pulled me into the forest.)

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
Let's play hide and seek!

55
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,320
(Could it be that the thorny tree at that time)

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
(actually wanted to take Bai Xiaosheng away?)

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
(Because Senior)

58
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,640
(had Bai Xiaosheng's spell on him.)

59
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,360
(Thus, he mistakenly dragged Senior away?)

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,240
Master sent me

61
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,430
to investigate the whereabouts of Taoist clan cultivators

62
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,590
who have gone off the deep end.

63
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,590
But among the cultivators I found,

64
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,479
most of them didn't go off the deep end

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,390
because of cultivation,

66
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,870
but because of the dark aura in their bodies.

67
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,200
So I suspect

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,830
someone wants to use the dark aura

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,550
to control cultivators of the Taoist clan.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,800
(Bai Xiaosheng.)

71
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,320
(Hui, )

72
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,320
(I'm here to kill you.)

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Speaking of which,

74
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,710
where did the other person go?

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
I saw him controlling the dark aura.

76
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,110
Is he a dark practitioner?

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,550
Wait for my return.

78
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,880
You guessed it correctly.

79
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,150
But he never harmed me.

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,790
Instead, he has always helped us.

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,910
I don't know

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,790
where he went.

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,639
He probably fled

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,560
after his identity was exposed.

85
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
This matter is of great importance.

86
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,959
I need to return to Chenxing Mountain

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,830
and report this to Master immediately.

88
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,590
I'm still worried

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
about leaving you alone out here.

90
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,640
Why don't you come back with me?

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm not alone.

92
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,880
I promised Tianyao that I would help him.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,590
I can't break my promise.

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,680
All right, then.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,960
I'll report your situation

96
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,560
to Master as well.

97
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,910
Senior,

98
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,680
thank you for coming to see me.

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,030
You'll always

100
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,390
be my junior.

101
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,030
You got lost.

102
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,790
How could I not come to find you?

103
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,079
I've already grown up.

104
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,149
How could I still get lost?

105
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,080
Take good care of yourself.

106
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,790
See you around!

107
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,230
-How's your injury? -How are you feeling?

108
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,710
I feel great.

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,390
I've never felt better.

110
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,640
How about your injury?

111
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:44,798
Does it still hurt?

112
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,520
It's nothing.

113
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,960
Have some congee first,

114
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,200
and then take the medicine.

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
Feng Qianshuo warned us

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,880
that the forest in the west is very dangerous.

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
Why did you go there?

118
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:15,257
Bai Xiaosheng dislikes my senior.

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,519
So he wanted to leave him

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,350
in the forest.

121
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,829
Then my senior was dragged

122
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,200
into the forest.

123
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,910
Then Bai Xiaosheng

124
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,880
was dragged into it too.

125
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,200
So I went in to save them.

126
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,590
In the end, you saw what happened.

127
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Where's Bai Xiaosheng?

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,230
He fled.

129
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,000
What about your senior?

130
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,350
He went back to Chenxing Mountain.

131
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,150
What about my sword?

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,559
Would you believe me

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,320
if I said it flew away on its own?

134
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,790
Do you know

135
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,440
who was behind the illusions in the forest?

136
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,590
We'll have to ask her.

137
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,520
Where is she?

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,910
Come out.

139
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,960
Who do you mean?

140
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,680
A phantom spirit

141
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,080
is living inside this ring.

142
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,760
Why is she quiet now?

143
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,270
Huan Xiaoyan,

144
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,350
you chatterbox.

145
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,270
She's probably scared out of her wits.

146
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,960
We'll have to wait for her to wake up to ask her.

147
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,320
We've wasted too much time here.

148
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,960
It's time to leave.

149
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,760
Where are we going?

150
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,030
Dragon Valley.

151
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Dragon Valley?

152
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,030
Isn't that your hometown?

153
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,710
Are you taking me back to your hometown?

154
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,200
My sword that flew away

155
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,830
probably went back there.

156
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,879
Your sword can fly back home by itself?

157
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,590
This time,

158
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,520
I forced it to come with me.

159
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,680
Since we have retrieved the dragon horns,

160
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,439
the Taoist clan will undoubtedly increase more guards

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
for the two remaining barriers.

162
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
I need to go back

163
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,760
and tame the Flaming Dragon Fang

164
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,320
to increase my strength.

165
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,150
(Dragon's fang?)

166
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,640
You still need to tame your fang?

167
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,080
Let's eat.

168
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,269
Let me see it.

169
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,200
Which fang is it?

170
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,150
Has it grown back?

171
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,200
Just eat your food.

172
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,680
Stop looking. It has already grown back.

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,470
-Greetings, Senior. -Welcome back, Senior.

174
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,510
Eldest Senior, you're back.

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,800
Where's Yanhui?

176
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,920
She must know she'll be severely punished

177
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,349
for doing evil with the evil dragon.

178
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,469
That's why she dares not come back, right?

179
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,400
Don't spout nonsense.

180
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,630
Where's Master?

181
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,110
I have important things

182
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,080
to report to him.

183
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,080
Master hasn't returned yet,

184
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,510
but something strange happened.

185
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,680
Senior,

186
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:13,749
the Starhaven

187
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,869
was suddenly covered in mist last night,

188
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,109
making it difficult to see the surroundings.

189
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,439
An elder sent a snow owl up

190
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,230
to inquire about the situation.

191
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,560
But we received no response.

192
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,560
We don't know

193
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,080
what's going on up there now.

194
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,960
So we can only wait and see.

195
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,920
What was that just now?

196
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,040
The spirit energy of Dragon Valley.

197
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,680
Spirit energy can fly and even laugh?

198
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,160
It's my first time seeing it.

199
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,470
The spirit energy of Dragon Valley is abundant.

200
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,960
It can even condense into elves back then.

201
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,230
Elves?

202
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
The elves lived here with me

203
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,400
for thousands of years.

204
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,870
His Majesty looks so handsome today.

205
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,920
Of course, when is His Majesty not handsome?

206
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,630
What I meant

207
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,079
was he looks even more handsome

208
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,710
and majestic than yesterday.

209
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,990
(Dragon Valley was even more beautiful back then.)

210
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,230
(It's just a pity)

211
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,630
(that later on...)

212
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,680
Forget it,

213
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,750
let's not dwell on the past.

214
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,510
Is the entrance to Dragon Valley up ahead?

215
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,630
We're here.

216
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Heartless Valley?

217
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Did you rename Dragon Valley?

218
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,350
(There was no such sign before.)

219
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,680
(Has someone else)

220
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,110
(entered Dragon Valley?)

221
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,110
I seem

222
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,800
to have seen this tree before.

223
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,040
You've seen it?

224
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,350
(When I was still a child, before I joined Chenxing Mountain, )

225
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
(I had a special affinity with monsters.)

226
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
(I always ran into)

227
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,510
(all kinds of monsters.)

228
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
(Some saved me, )

229
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,110
(while others wanted to eat me.)

230
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,040
(I remember one time)

231
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,110
(I was chased)

232
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:12,160
(by a very powerful bad monster.)

233
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
(It seemed I ran to this place.)

234
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,630
Let me go!

235
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,590
Let me go! Let me go!

236
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,040
(It was Lingxiao)

237
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,710
(who saved me that day.)

238
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,540
Zichen, watch her.

239
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,860
Speaking of which,

240
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,180
I actually

241
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,860
burned down this tree that day.

242
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,420
When I think back,

243
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,740
I feel really sorry about it now.

244
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,500
You burned down this tree?

245
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,220
My eldest senior was there that day too.

246
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,940
That monster

247
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
wouldn't give up

248
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,380
(and still wanted to kill us.)

249
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,259
(I was so anxious at the time)

250
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,100
(that I didn't know how)

251
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,900
(I ended up setting a fire)

252
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,660
(before my master could do anything.)

253
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,300
(From now on, )

254
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,620
(Chenxing Mountain will be your home, )

255
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,940
and I will be your master.

256
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,300
(Ten years have passed, )

257
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,220
and I only remember.

258
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,220
Lingxiao bringing me back to Chenxing Mountain.

259
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,500
Then,

260
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,620
I don't remember anything else

261
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,780
about the monsters.

262
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,540
If it weren't for today...

263
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,740
Come to think of it,

264
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,540
the reason I was able to set that fire back then

265
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,460
was that I have

266
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,020
your Heart Protecting Scale in my body.

267
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,500
Yanhui,

268
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,860
I should thank you.

269
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,220
For what?

270
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,580
Twenty years ago,

271
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,779
Suying sealed me

272
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,580
with the Five Elements Formation.

273
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,580
Water to trap the bones.

274
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,820
Earth to subdue the horns.

275
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,780
Fire to burn the veins.

276
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,718
Metal to wrap around the heart.

277
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:35,729
Wood to bind the soul.

278
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,260
Yanhui,

279
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:42,555
it was you who released me

280
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,275
from this Soul Binding Wood.

281
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,155
Are you saying

282
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:52,915
this is the Soul Binding Wood that Suying used

283
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,115
to seal your dragon soul?

284
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:58,475
(It turns out)

285
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,435
(we are destined)

286
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:01,835
(to meet each other)

287
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:03,115
(from a long time ago.)

288
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:05,395
(If no one mentioned it, )

289
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:06,555
(who would have known)

290
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:07,994
(that Tianyao's dragon soul)

291
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:09,155
(was sealed inside?)

292
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:10,835
(Who would have known)

293
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:12,315
(that we actually)

294
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,755
(go way back?)

295
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:19,355
It really is fate.

296
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:21,155
Your Heart Protecting Scale

297
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,435
saved my life.

298
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:23,875
And I,

299
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:24,995
in turn,

300
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,475
released your soul here.

301
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,075
If my dragon soul

302
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,395
didn't escape from here

303
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,675
ten years ago,

304
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,675
I wouldn't have been able

305
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:33,835
to find the dragon bone energy,

306
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:35,755
live in disguise as Doofus Fu

307
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,435
in Tongluo Village,

308
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:39,715
and

309
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:42,115
survive until now

310
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,915
to find dragon bones

311
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:45,355
and dragon horns.

312
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,075
Yanhui,

313
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,195
it turns out

314
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:54,835
you're the fortunate starting point,

315
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:56,475
beginning,

316
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,395
and turning point that I could not have found.

317
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,955
It's truly a blessing in disguise.

318
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,075
How can I

319
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,195
not thank you?

320
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,995
The debts and grudges between us

321
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,195
is a mess now

322
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:14,755
and cannot be distinguished anymore.

323
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,515
But I'm a generous person.

324
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,194
When you become successful in the future,

325
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,314
you must pay back the money

326
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:21,435
you owe me.

327
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:29,115
Yanhui,

328
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,595
if I can

329
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,315
have peace in my life,

330
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,595
all my wealth

331
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,515
will be yours.

332
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:39,355
The only woman

333
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,514
who can possess all your wealth

334
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,035
is your wife.

335
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:49,515
I...

336
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,755
I'll only take what I deserve.

337
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:53,195
Let's go.

338
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:08,834
Reporting to the Valley Master.

339
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,435
We have uninvited visitors outside!

340
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:13,994
Prepare for battle!

341
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:14,715
(Rui, Elf of the Dragon Valley)

342
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:21,595
Stop right there!

343
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:22,795
Who are you?

344
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:23,875
Who are you?

345
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,595
(Peng, Elf of the Dragon Valley)

346
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:28,955
(Yun, Elf of the Dragon Valley)

347
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:34,435
I'm the Valley Master of this valley.

348
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:35,874
Small fries like you

349
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,195
can't enter my valley without permission!

350
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:38,635
Leave now!

351
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:41,635
Especially you,

352
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:42,475
you hateful.

353
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:44,195
Taoist clan woman.

354
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,715
You're the hateful one.

355
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,715
He said he's the Valley Master.

356
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,395
Who are you?

357
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:53,635
When did you arrive in the Dragon Valley?

358
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:54,955
Rui,

359
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:55,595
they know

360
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:57,195
this is Luochuan Dragon Valley.

361
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,434
You really are up to no good.

362
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,954
I've sworn to defend

363
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:02,715
the pure Luochuan Dragon Valley

364
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:03,914
from evil people entering.

365
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:04,715
I'll fight you.

366
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,235
I...

367
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:10,475
Let go.

368
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,075
-Enough! -Ouch, that hurts.

369
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,194
Oh, no. She's going to kill me.

370
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:18,115
Everyone! Run for your lives!

371
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:22,835
Please don't kill my Valley Master.

372
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,474
Please don't kill them.

373
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:26,555
I wasn't going to kill him.

374
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:27,915
He was the one attacking me.

375
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:29,955
Then let us go.

376
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,315
I know

377
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,715
you're here for the divine sword.

378
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:33,675
The divine sword is at...

379
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:34,275
Peng!

380
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:35,474
We must not tell them

381
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:36,874
that the Flaming Dragon Fang of the Dragon King

382
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,315
is on Snow Peak.

383
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,354
We're the sword guardians.

384
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,155
We swore to guard the sword for the Dragon King.

385
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,155
Where did you find these sword guardians?

386
00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:50,195
They don't look too bright.

387
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:57,075
Who told you to guard the sword?

388
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:58,755
Why would you guard the sword?

389
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,555
We, the Luochuan Dragon Valley elves,

390
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,235
have lived here for generations.

391
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:03,554
Our parents' last wish

392
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:04,674
before they passed away

393
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:05,914
twenty years ago

394
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,234
was for us to guard the sword for the Dragon King

395
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:08,395
and wait for the Dragon King to return.

396
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,115
Your parents...

397
00:18:22,155 --> 00:18:22,675
So,

398
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:24,915
you're the surviving elves

399
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:27,555
from that disaster.

400
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,195
You were waiting

401
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:31,195
for the Dragon King to come back, right?

402
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:32,394
He's the Dragon King.

403
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:33,595
You don't need to guard the sword anymore.

404
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,715
Do you know

405
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:36,755
what the Dragon King looks like?

406
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,275
I don't know.

407
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:40,874
I vaguely remember

408
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,115
my mother saying

409
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:44,955
he's very tall, handsome, and majestic.

410
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:48,035
Does he look like it?

411
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,355
He doesn't look like it.

412
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:55,235
Indeed, he doesn't seem to look like it.

413
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,675
He doesn't even have horns.

414
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:58,275
Horns?

415
00:18:59,195 --> 00:19:00,155
Show them your horns.

416
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:01,315
Hurry up.

417
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:15,035
This still doesn't prove anything.

418
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,155
We've seen deer spirits before.

419
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,314
Deer spirits also have horns.

420
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,674
Yes, deer spirits also have horns.

421
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:19,835
A water buffalo has horns too.

422
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:21,675
Yanhui,

423
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:22,635
let them be.

424
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:23,715
Once I retrieve the sword,

425
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:24,875
they'll know the truth.

426
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:26,115
That's right.

427
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,114
He came back to retrieve the sword before.

428
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:29,155
Have you seen him?

429
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:30,755
Impossible.

430
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:32,195
I've been guarding the sword this month.

431
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,075
I assure you

432
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:35,155
that no one has come near Snow Peak.

433
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,475
I stay up every night

434
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,035
with my eyes wide open.

435
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:39,634
(I guard the sword every day)

436
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,515
(from dusk until dawn.)

437
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,635
(No one has ever come to retrieve it.)

438
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:44,795
Besides,

439
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:46,275
the sword is still on Snow Peak.

440
00:20:03,515 --> 00:20:05,835
This mountain seems to have become shorter.

441
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:10,075
As expected of me,

442
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,835
I grew taller overnight.

443
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:15,235
In any case, I can't let you in.

444
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,675
Stop!

445
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:20,915
Wait.

446
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,554
We can't beat them.

447
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,994
We should save our strength

448
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:25,395
and think of another way.

449
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:31,835
Let's go.

450
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,155
Hurry up and go after them.

451
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:36,235
-Yes, sir. -All right.

452
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:20,115
Dragon Valley

453
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,635
is so beautiful.

454
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:23,762
It was even more beautiful back then.

455
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:27,074
But can this paper house

456
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,395
withstand the wind?

457
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:29,823
We never said you can stay.

458
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:30,848
Why are you picking?

459
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:33,035
I want to stay.

460
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,035
I'll pick if I want to.

461
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,515
I'm going to pick a big place.

462
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:37,075
I'm not listening!

463
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,555
We'll be sharing

464
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:41,834
a room.

465
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,355
It won't take up much space.

466
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,343
After we pull out the sword, we'll leave.

467
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:46,715
How about

468
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,795
this one?

469
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,154
You even have your eyes

470
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:50,675
on our Valley Master's house.

471
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:51,875
In your dreams!

472
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,595
It's not like we're staying for free.

473
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:56,235
This is

474
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:57,555
for letting us stay.

475
00:21:59,355 --> 00:21:59,635
Isn't this...

476
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:00,035
This ring

477
00:22:00,036 --> 00:22:01,194
looks pretty nice.

478
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:01,875
Valley Master,

479
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,555
why don't we let them stay?

480
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,595
Valley Master,

481
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:05,475
you're bought off

482
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:06,915
too easily.

483
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,114
I thought

484
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:10,195
about it earlier.

485
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,954
Some people tried

486
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,635
to pull out.

487
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:13,714
Dragon King's Flaming Dragon Fang before.

488
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:15,555
But did anyone succeed? No, right?

489
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,235
They'll fail anyway.

490
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,275
It's better

491
00:22:18,275 --> 00:22:18,995
to let them give up on their own...

492
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:19,355
That's true.

493
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:20,995
than to fight them and end up losing on both sides.

494
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:22,595
Yes, you're right.

495
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:24,554
Only the Dragon King

496
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:26,235
can pull out the Flaming Dragon Fang anyway.

497
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:51,115
These elves

498
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:52,275
may look silly.

499
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:53,075
But they made

500
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,555
their living space quite cozy.

501
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:57,075
Tianyao, you'll sleep on the bed tonight

502
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:58,794
and I'll lay out the bedding and sleep on the floor next to you.

503
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,835
You should rest well.

504
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:01,235
Why are you being nice?

505
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:02,315
Did you forget

506
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,675
what day it is today?

507
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:04,995
What day?

508
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:07,101
It's the full moon.

509
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:10,795
It seems like

510
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:14,155
you remember even better than me.

511
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:16,115
You got injured when you pulled out the sword last time.

512
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,675
Since we're back in Dragon Valley,

513
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:25,595
there's something.

514
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,195
I must do tonight.

515
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,395
I'll accompany you.

516
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:10,715
On the night of the full moon,

517
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,075
we pay tribute to our loved ones.

518
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,594
May our family rest peacefully

519
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,915
in heaven

520
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:18,074
and keep watch over Dragon Valley

521
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:19,835
until the return of the Dragon King.

522
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:22,635
Until the return of the Dragon King!

523
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,035
(Your Majesty, )

524
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:36,675
(we've prepared)

525
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:38,075
(a gift for you.)

526
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:47,835
Your Majesty protects the Dragon Valley

527
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:48,915
and watches over us.

528
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,234
I hope this sword

529
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,514
can protect you

530
00:24:51,515 --> 00:24:52,675
in critical times.

531
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:54,631
Your Majesty, the sword is ready.

532
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:56,031
I hope that you'll work harder

533
00:24:56,032 --> 00:24:57,712
(in your cultivation in the future.)

534
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,751
I hope Your Majesty will be

535
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:01,152
the strongest dragon in the world.

536
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:01,872
You fool!

537
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:03,911
His Majesty is the only dragon in the world.

538
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:05,192
Of course, he's the strongest.

539
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:16,512
On the night of the full moon...

540
00:25:19,432 --> 00:25:20,192
Let's hurry.

541
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,671
Fly faster.

542
00:25:22,672 --> 00:25:24,872
(We can't miss His Majesty's wedding!)

543
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:27,991
They died because of me.

544
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:28,872
Stop hurting our master!

545
00:25:28,873 --> 00:25:31,111
-Your Majesty! -Your Majesty!

546
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:31,832
Stop it now!

547
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,951
-Your Majesty! -Stop hurting him!

548
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:34,231
Stop hurting our master!

549
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,512
Stop it!

550
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:37,152
Don't hurt him!

551
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:38,432
Stop!

552
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:39,992
Your Majesty!

553
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,392
-(Your Majesty!) -(Your Majesty!)

554
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:46,632
This blood debt...

555
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:48,672
Your Majesty!

556
00:26:02,032 --> 00:26:03,952
must be repaid with blood.

557
00:26:12,512 --> 00:26:13,232
Tianyao...

558
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:31,832
Tianyao.

559
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:37,392
Tianyao.

560
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:45,472
You said being close

561
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:46,552
to the Heart Protecting Scale

562
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:47,752
would make it less painful.

563
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,272
This is...

564
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:52,992
I deserve this.

565
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:57,512
I'll stay with you.

566
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:04,472
Get out.

567
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:06,592
Stay away from me.

568
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:10,632
I don't want you to see me

569
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:14,792
in such an ugly state.

570
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,096
Tianyao,

571
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:20,952
the truly ugly one

572
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:23,272
is never you,

573
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:28,412
but the person who broke your heart.

574
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:38,672
Tianyao. Tianyao.

575
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:52,632
It pains me

576
00:27:55,112 --> 00:27:56,872
to see you like this.

577
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:19,872
Tianyao,

578
00:28:21,352 --> 00:28:22,032
it's okay.

579
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:26,552
There, there. You're fine.

580
00:28:28,992 --> 00:28:29,912
Tianyao...

581
00:28:46,512 --> 00:28:47,832
(This wedding)

582
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,752
is

583
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:51,992
your funeral.

584
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:57,992
(What...)

585
00:28:58,632 --> 00:28:59,672
(What's wrong with me?)

586
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:02,952
Tianyao,

587
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:04,831
you're awake.

588
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:05,912
Does it still hurt?

589
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:08,992
No.

590
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:11,592
I'm glad to hear that.

591
00:29:11,712 --> 00:29:13,192
Then I'll go back to sleep.

592
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:28,552
Where are you going?

593
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,032
To pull out the sword.

594
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,152
I'll come with you.

595
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:43,352
It's all right.

596
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:44,992
You should get some rest.

597
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:46,152
I...

598
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:47,432
I'll go by myself.

599
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:49,912
Something's not right.

600
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:51,672
I should follow him.

601
00:29:54,672 --> 00:29:55,711
Report to Valley Master.

602
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:56,831
That man went towards the snow mountain.

603
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:57,832
Investigate further and give me more reports.

604
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:58,911
I haven't finished yet.

605
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,231
That woman also followed him.

606
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,992
They looked sneaky.

607
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:03,671
Sneaky?

608
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:04,632
Why?

609
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,557
What's their relationship?

610
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:08,847
I'm not worried about the sword.

611
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:11,072
But I'm afraid they might be...

612
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:12,791
Me too. So, are they...

613
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,992
Valley Master, Dragon Valley is in danger.

614
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:14,832
(Flaming Dragon Fang, )

615
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:16,952
(I need your strength)

616
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:19,432
(to avenge this blood debt as soon as possible.)

617
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:11,672
We probably shouldn't go up there.

618
00:32:12,592 --> 00:32:14,911
I went a few steps too far last time.

619
00:32:14,912 --> 00:32:15,991
My finger was injured

620
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:17,592
by the wind and snow.

621
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:20,152
We should just wait down here.

622
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:26,952
Stop right there.

623
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,312
It's that annoying.

624
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:31,232
Taoist clan woman again.

625
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,552
Who are you referring to? Come here.

626
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:33,352
Where do you think you're trying to go?

627
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,072
Let me go!

628
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:34,792
Don't think you can run away.

629
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:35,312
Let go!

630
00:32:35,312 --> 00:32:35,872
Let me go!

631
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:36,952
I can let all of you go.

632
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,072
But you have to tell me

633
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,152
where I can find

634
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:39,992
medicinal herbs

635
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:40,872
to treat burns nearby.

636
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:41,712
I knew

637
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:42,517
the one up there

638
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:43,748
couldn't hold on anymore.

639
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,472
Our Valley Master is truly ingenious.

640
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:48,472
You're really overestimating yourselves.

641
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:50,471
Only someone with a pure heart

642
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:51,711
like the Dragon King

643
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,831
can pull out the Dragon Valley's.

644
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:53,912
Flaming Dragon Fang.

645
00:32:54,232 --> 00:32:55,352
Forcing the sword out

646
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,552
will definitely burn you

647
00:32:56,552 --> 00:32:57,472
and make you seriously wounded.

648
00:32:58,592 --> 00:33:00,031
A pure heart?

649
00:33:00,032 --> 00:33:01,111
You don't understand, do you?

650
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,072
The Flaming Dragon Fang may be forged

651
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:04,031
from the fang of the Dragon King.

652
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,231
But it also carries the blessings

653
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,632
of all the elves of our Dragon Valley.

654
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,151
It's a sword of protection.

655
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,351
Those with impure thoughts,

656
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:10,272
full of hatred,

657
00:33:10,273 --> 00:33:11,431
and selfishness

658
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:12,632
are not worthy of wielding the sword.

659
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:15,192
I advise you

660
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,192
-to give up early! -Just give up!

661
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,232
-Give up!

662
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:21,992
Miss,

663
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:23,591
there's a kind of delicate blue flower

664
00:33:23,592 --> 00:33:25,791
called Linglong Grass growing on the west wall

665
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,951
of the small path you came in from,

666
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:29,232
which can treat burns.

667
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:30,352
Why are you telling her?

668
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:30,832
Hurry. Let's go.

669
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:31,632
Let's go home.

670
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:32,032
Come on.

671
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,112
Hurry up now.

672
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:33,472
Let's go.

673
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,112
Let's go quickly.

674
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:40,232
(Tianyao is carrying so much burden.)

675
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,672
(What can I do for him?)

676
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,032
This woman seems to have found the medicinal herbs

677
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:01,272
and is helping that rascal to decoct them.

678
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:02,951
She keeps scooping something up over and over again.

679
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:04,152
What is she scooping?

680
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,032
It looks very complicated and troublesome.

681
00:34:07,152 --> 00:34:08,752
She's skimming off the foam.

682
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:10,152
She has to do it carefully.

683
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:11,112
That girl seems to care a lot

684
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:13,272
about the person who's pulling out the sword.

685
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,712
Someone from a Taoist clan and a deer spirit.

686
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:20,632
Could they be a master and a familiar?

687
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,432
But who's the master, and who's the familiar?

688
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:34,432
Tianyao,

689
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,152
I brought you some medicine.

690
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:39,631
This one is for external use

691
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:40,832
and this one is for internal use.

692
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:45,632
Drink it while it's hot.

693
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:48,712
Where did you get the medicine from?

694
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:50,472
I picked it.

695
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,472
Did you go and pick herbs?

696
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:56,432
Drink it while it's hot.

697
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,192
Get some rest.

698
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:10,192
Yanhui, wait.

699
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,712
A leaf?

700
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,312
Are there any more?

701
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:40,552
Be careful.

702
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:41,632
Don't pull too hard.

703
00:35:43,072 --> 00:35:43,832
Let me comb it for you.

704
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:10,849
Tianyao,

705
00:36:12,592 --> 00:36:13,952
in the Taoist clan,

706
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,072
only a husband

707
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,592
can comb his wife's hair.

708
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,232
Do it yourself.

709
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,392
Why did I bring this up?

710
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:56,392
Never mind.

711
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:58,592
It's not like it would change anything if I talked to him.

712
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,032
Am I too concerned

713
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:04,232
about his feelings?

714
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:39,992
(I brought you some medicine.)

715
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:41,512
This one is for external use

716
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:42,672
and this one is for internal use.

717
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:43,792
Drink it while it's hot.

718
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:45,992
(Calm down.)

719
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:47,472
(I can't think about these things anymore.)

720
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:49,432
(Flaming Dragon Fang, )

721
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:51,392
(you're filled with the blessing of the elves.)

722
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:52,472
(You should understand)

723
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:53,992
(my desire for avenging them.)

724
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,112
(Why do you still resist me?)

725
00:37:58,352 --> 00:37:59,992
(What exactly is the meaning)

726
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:02,952
(of "a pure heart"?)

727
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:07,871
Just now, their action

728
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,512
was the legendary love...

729
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:10,552
We cannot speak of it.

730
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:11,672
Our Dragon Valley

731
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:12,592
absolutely forbids us

732
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:13,631
from mentioning those words.

733
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:15,712
You're right. I almost misspoke.

734
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:16,432
But...

735
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:18,712
I feel like they are...

736
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:20,672
Our Dragon Valley

737
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,911
absolutely does not allow

738
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:23,352
such things to happen.

739
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,432
It was because.

740
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,152
Dragon King fell for someone back then

741
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:28,952
that the disaster struck.

742
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,352
We must separate them.

743
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:33,792
First of all,

744
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:36,112
we cannot let them live together.

745
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:47,911
I've fallen in love with him.

746
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:48,992
I don't like him.

747
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:51,712
I've already fallen in love with him.

748
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:52,832
Yes,

749
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:56,392
I've already fallen in love with him.

750
00:38:57,552 --> 00:38:59,472
I've fallen in love with him?

751
00:39:01,752 --> 00:39:02,552
I'm done for.

752
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:08,072
What do you mean by done for?

753
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,432
Why are you scared?

754
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:10,872
If you like someone,

755
00:39:11,112 --> 00:39:12,232
go and pursue him.

756
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:13,432
That's right.

757
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:14,112
When he comes back,

758
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:15,072
I'll confess to him.

759
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:18,792
(But)

760
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:20,792
(I don't know why)

761
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:22,872
I just really like you.

762
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:26,232
I will never fall in love

763
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,272
with anyone in this lifetime.

764
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,352
No, I can't do that.

765
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:33,472
I can't be impulsive this time.

766
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,712
When I was affected by Fox Incense last time,

767
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,392
he already rejected me once.

768
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,632
This time I need to plan

769
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:40,832
and think of this

770
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,072
carefully

771
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:43,032
so that

772
00:39:43,272 --> 00:39:44,471
he will accept

773
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:45,832
my passionate love.

774
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:48,872
If you want to pursue someone,

775
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:51,792
you have to know what he likes

776
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:53,071
and understand his preferences.

777
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:53,752
Then

778
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:56,112
cater to their likes

779
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:00,152
and win them over.

780
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:41,472
Last night,

781
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:42,992
-I was being emotional... -It's all right.

782
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,432
Let bygones be bygones.

783
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:47,232
People

784
00:40:47,472 --> 00:40:49,072
should always move forward, right?

785
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:51,232
I'm glad you were not upset.

786
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:53,672
I wasn't upset.

787
00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:54,712
But

788
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,232
I have a few questions to ask you.

789
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,232
Just ask.

790
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,792
What do you like to eat?

791
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:05,472
What do you like to eat?

792
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:06,952
What do I like to eat?

793
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,072
I don't like eating.

794
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:11,792
I never knew someone who doesn't like eating actually exists.

795
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:13,392
Why are you asking this?

796
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:15,352
Never mind.

797
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:16,312
Next question.

798
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:17,712
What do you like to drink?

799
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,872
Don't tell me you don't like drinking too.

800
00:41:24,032 --> 00:41:24,712
You see.

801
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,311
For instance, tea, liquor,

802
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:28,631
the ice from the mountains,

803
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:29,671
the water from the lake,

804
00:41:29,672 --> 00:41:30,672
and dewdrops in the distance.

805
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:31,432
Choose one.

806
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:35,192
Dewdrops, I guess.

807
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,511
Dewdrops.

808
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,312
(Favorite drinks)

809
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:39,712
Wait, I'm not done yet.

810
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:41,392
What's your favorite color?

811
00:41:41,912 --> 00:41:42,432
None.

812
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:43,992
None?

813
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:46,352
Black.

814
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:47,552
It's black, isn't it?

815
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,771
You always wear black.

816
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:50,032
But you're not wearing black today.

817
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,272
Black.

818
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,112
So,

819
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:53,872
what's your favorite weather?

820
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:57,552
Any weather is fine.

821
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,312
You can't just say any weather.

822
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:02,032
Today.

823
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:03,432
Today?

824
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,912
It's sunny.

825
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:12,352
Hold it right there.

826
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:14,952
What's the matter?

827
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:18,551
Are you trying to kick us out again?

828
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:19,711
We can't fight you.

829
00:42:19,712 --> 00:42:20,432
We admit that.

830
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:21,831
But we can't allow you

831
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:23,032
to continue living together.

832
00:42:24,952 --> 00:42:26,031
Starting today,

833
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:26,992
you'll stay downstairs.

834
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:28,352
There's no need for that trouble.

835
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:29,431
We can stay together.

836
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:30,951
No, you can't. You have to move!

837
00:42:30,952 --> 00:42:32,192
Why must I move?

838
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:33,751
If I say you must, you must move!

839
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:34,312
The Dragon Valley

840
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:35,511
forbids romantic relationships.

841
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,631
If you want a romantic relationship,

842
00:42:36,632 --> 00:42:37,951
you can't do it here in Dragon Valley.

843
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:38,832
Who's having a romantic relationship here?

844
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:39,832
Stop talking nonsense.

845
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:40,792
This morning...

846
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:41,192
Jeez...

847
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:44,511
Let him go! Let him go!

848
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:45,552
Let him go.

849
00:42:45,912 --> 00:42:47,511
Fine, I'll move!

850
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:48,712
You better move out.

851
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:50,311
We are in Dragon Valley,

852
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:51,592
also known as Heartless Valley.

853
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:52,911
We don't allow

854
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:54,151
romantic gestures like combing the hair

855
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:55,032
you did last night.

856
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:55,592
Let's go.

857
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,712
I was wondering why they were talking nonsense.

858
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:12,372
It turns out they misunderstood.

859
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:14,752
This paper house

860
00:43:14,753 --> 00:43:16,312
doesn't look very sturdy anyway.

861
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,752
I'll move downstairs.

862
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:19,512
You didn't want

863
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:20,592
to stay

864
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:21,392
with me before.

865
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:23,312
Why don't I move down there?

866
00:43:24,512 --> 00:43:25,152
That's not necessary.

867
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:26,272
I'll move downstairs

868
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:27,232
since my bedding is already here.

869
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:29,472
Indeed,

870
00:43:30,112 --> 00:43:31,952
I don't really like being around you.
