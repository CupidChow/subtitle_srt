1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,260
At dawn

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,220
I open my eyes

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,780
At long last, the night is past

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,420
The story has ended

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,980
If someone ever asks the question

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,100
I'll say I never regret it

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,780
Where I touch you

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,260
Is marked with the trace of our entanglement

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,860
Goodbye is not farewell

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,460
Why always focus on results?

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,060
In an instant, my longing for you

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,620
Spilled to the horizon

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,660
The barren land is singing

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,100
The ground is remaining silent

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,780
Light penetrates the sea

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,260
Flowers bloom among the dust

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,740
The mayfly gazes upon the sky

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,100
Swearing to pursue the light

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,780
My soul is searching

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,260
For the time rift

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,540
And you

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,059
(Back From The Brink)

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,979
(Adapted from the novel of the same name
in jjwxc.net by Jiu Lu Fei Xiang)

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 24)

25
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,135
It's so beautiful.

26
00:01:58,575 --> 00:01:59,855
These are the guardian flowers of the state.

27
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,134
In order to celebrate

28
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:02,295
the marriage between Tianyao and Yanhui,

29
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:03,804
my second uncle made the guardian flowers bloom

30
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:04,495
across Qingqiu.

31
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:05,655
This is the highest form of respect

32
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:06,605
in Qingqiu.

33
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,415
Young Master,

34
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,015
Miss Yan wants to thank you

35
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,765
for the wedding gown you gave her.

36
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:15,725
I'm glad that she likes it.

37
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,165
We didn't have much time

38
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,415
to prepare a wedding gift for them.

39
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,324
We can treat this

40
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:21,605
as Qingqiu's wedding gift to them.

41
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,325
Stop right there!

42
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,815
Mr. Yan, what do you mean by this?

43
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,045
Hurry!

44
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:44,165
Take off your cloak!

45
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:45,205
Ridiculous.

46
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,725
You want me to take off my cloak in public?

47
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:48,975
You're trying to humiliate me.

48
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:53,445
Reveal your true self!

49
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:55,925
Let go!

50
00:02:56,015 --> 00:02:57,095
They are going overboard!

51
00:02:57,815 --> 00:02:58,725
Calm down!

52
00:02:59,095 --> 00:02:59,925
What's wrong?

53
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:00,855
This is...

54
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:02,605
How could this be?

55
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,135
This is impossible!

56
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,855
The Crown Prince behaved rudely
in front of everyone.

57
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:11,135
Second Young Master,

58
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:12,814
are you not going to punish him?

59
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:13,765
Second Uncle, I...

60
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:16,815
And Mr. Yan.

61
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:18,325
You acted arrogantly

62
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,324
on the Dragon King's wedding day

63
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,415
due to your seniority.

64
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:22,974
Judging from your actions,

65
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:24,725
you don't seem to be
the most respectable person around.

66
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:26,325
This is utterly ridiculous!

67
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,015
You!

68
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:29,295
You!

69
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:30,415
Zhuli!

70
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:32,605
It's the Dragon King's wedding.

71
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,764
How could you fool around here?

72
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:34,575
Second Uncle.

73
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:37,045
I...

74
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:39,015
Mr. Yan,

75
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:40,375
we must not miss the auspicious hour.

76
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,015
Hey,

77
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:44,975
don't you think Mr. Yan

78
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,255
was being too much there?

79
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:47,485
He wanted him to remove his outfit in public.

80
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,325
So, it wasn't Zhao Yu?

81
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,855
Do you even know what you're doing?

82
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:52,815
I...

83
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,135
I'm sure something's fishy

84
00:03:54,136 --> 00:03:55,294
with him!

85
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:56,445
If so, why doesn't he
have any ink stains on his body?

86
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,095
I believe Mr. Yan.

87
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,445
I'm sure something's fishy with Zhao Yu.

88
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,335
Now that friends and families
have gathered around,

89
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:08,485
the wedding will begin.

90
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,055
Let the ceremony

91
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:11,525
begin!

92
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:37,725
Congratulations, Dragon King.

93
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:42,805
Congratulations.

94
00:04:58,405 --> 00:04:59,365
Congratulations, Dragon King.

95
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,925
Dragon King, congratulations on your wedding.

96
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,605
Congratulations, Dragon King.

97
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,405
Dragon King, congratulations on your wedding.

98
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:13,845
Congratulations, Dragon King.

99
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,335
They're a perfect match!

100
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:16,895
Miss Yan looks gorgeous!

101
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:19,135
They're a match made in heaven!

102
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,135
Precisely.

103
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:22,654
Qingqiu is honored

104
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,165
to witness the Dragon King's wedding.

105
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,215
Congratulations, Dragon King.

106
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,284
Qingqiu is lucky

107
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,925
to witness the Dragon King's wedding.

108
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,404
Congratulations, Dragon King.

109
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,575
Congratulations, Miss Yan.

110
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:14,335
A vow to old age,

111
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,535
thou nuptial vow shall be announced in words.

112
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:18,975
Swear a vow

113
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:20,165
upon your nuptial agreement.

114
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,405
(Nuptial agreement?)

115
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,044
(I think it wasn't included)

116
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,285
(in the six rites.)

117
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,365
Dragon King,

118
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,045
bestow her the nuptial agreement.

119
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,455
(When did he prepare this?)

120
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,975
Consume the nuptial wine.

121
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:41,575
Rise.

122
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,095
Friends and families,

123
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:01,365
thank you for your blessings.

124
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:03,805
Newlyweds, bow to them.

125
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:15,895
Qingqiu, deliver your blessings!

126
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:20,015
Dragon King, Dragon Queen, congratulations

127
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,455
on your marriage.

128
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,655
Now that all six rites have been completed,

129
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,975
happiness will ensue!

130
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:31,015
This is a joyous occasion
for the Dragon King and Dragon Queen.

131
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,725
Their blessing extends to the entire Qingqiu.

132
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:38,055
As everyone knows,

133
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,175
Tianyao and I

134
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:40,884
had acquired the secret treasure

135
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:42,295
left behind by Her Majesty,

136
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:43,525
which was the Ghostly Eulogy.

137
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,975
Today is my wedding with Tianyao.

138
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,295
It's a joyous occasion.

139
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,724
I would like to request Mr. Yan

140
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,295
to interpret the Ghostly Eulogy for us

141
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:54,055
so that everyone can admire it together.

142
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,335
Admire it together?

143
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,055
The Dragon King and Queen

144
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,055
are trying

145
00:08:58,056 --> 00:08:59,885
to reveal the Ghostly Eulogy to the public.

146
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:06,365
The Ghostly Eulogy?

147
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:08,125
Is that the true Ghostly Eulogy?

148
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:14,485
Mr. Yan,

149
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,295
please interpret it for us.

150
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:18,814
We actually

151
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:20,695
received a gift like this
from attending the Dragon King's wedding.

152
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:21,575
This is unexpected.

153
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,365
This is truly unexpected.

154
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:28,215
All right.

155
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,095
Today,

156
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:32,005
I will translate

157
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:33,975
the Ghostly Eulogy in front of everyone.

158
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:35,414
Is he serious?

159
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:35,845
Great!

160
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:36,525
Right here?

161
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:38,725
This is an unexpected reward

162
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:40,605
from attending the Dragon King's wedding.

163
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,245
There's an assassin!

164
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:51,725
Young Master, be careful.

165
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:52,844
Seal off the exit!

166
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,414
No one is allowed to leave!

167
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,365
Seal off the main hall!

168
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,005
Stop right there!

169
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:58,125
Let us leave!

170
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,095
Let us leave!

171
00:09:59,095 --> 00:09:59,575
Nobody moves!

172
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:04,575
There it is!

173
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:05,335
The ink stain!

174
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,605
I would never recognize the wrong person.

175
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,095
You were the one

176
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:09,725
who stole the Ghostly Eulogy yesterday.

177
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:10,295
Zhao Yu!

178
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:11,975
What exactly is going on?

179
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,245
Last night,

180
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,244
someone wanted to steal the Ghostly Eulogy.

181
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:16,525
Mr. Yan sprayed some ink

182
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:17,975
on his body.

183
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:18,725
And now,

184
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:20,295
the thief has been arrested.

185
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:22,885
Mister, don't worry.

186
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:24,524
You can use our wedding tomorrow as an excuse

187
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,214
and invite everyone from the palace to attend it.

188
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,765
After that, we'll arrest him when he's trapped.

189
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:30,125
(Since he's forced)

190
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,244
(to attend our wedding tomorrow,)

191
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,455
(he'll definitely be prepared.)

192
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:39,525
Stop right there!

193
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,175
Let go!

194
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:41,725
It wasn't him!

195
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:42,575
Calm down.

196
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:46,005
I sense hints of visual spells in the hall.

197
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,365
If so, the thief

198
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,055
that Mr. Yan couldn't capture

199
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:50,815
must be the visual spell master.

200
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:52,365
That's right.

201
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:54,175
If the thief

202
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,295
passes your inspection,

203
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:57,124
we have to use another way

204
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:57,935
to force him to reveal himself.

205
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,295
Dragon King,

206
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,845
I assume you wish to lure him out, right?

207
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,294
(If he wishes to steal the Ghostly Eulogy,)

208
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,175
(that means he doesn't want other people)

209
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:05,005
(to read it.)

210
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:05,605
(We can capture him)

211
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:06,175
(when he launches an attack.)

212
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:07,095
All right.

213
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,935
Today,

214
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:10,974
I will translate the Ghostly Eulogy

215
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,815
in front of everyone.

216
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,935
(But we must protect the Brush Sprite.)

217
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:24,055
Mr. Zhao?

218
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:25,055
What...

219
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:25,815
That's right.

220
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,455
This can't be true.

221
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:28,455
Second Uncle,

222
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:29,645
Zhao Yu

223
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:30,885
is the evil visual spell master!

224
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:32,295
He harmed the Phantom Clan.

225
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,725
And now, he intends to steal the Ghostly Eulogy.

226
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:34,975
I'm sure he's up to no good.

227
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,365
You must capture him and interrogate him!

228
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,455
I'm going to avenge my clan!

229
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,245
Miss Huan!

230
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,055
You mustn't kill in the main hall.

231
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:43,724
I should've killed this brat

232
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:44,245
long ago!

233
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:44,845
Someone!

234
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,725
Lock him up for now.

235
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:47,365
Move it!

236
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:47,815
Move!

237
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,004
He's the visual spell master.

238
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:51,845
This thief remained hidden for a long time.

239
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,005
Let's go!

240
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:58,575
This is infuriating!

241
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:03,462
Kill him!

242
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:36,215
Mr. Zhao,

243
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,125
you've suffered.

244
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:49,645
Lord Changlan.

245
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,415
Such powerful visual spells.

246
00:12:58,295 --> 00:12:59,525
Master Lingxiao,

247
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,125
you must've waited for a long time.

248
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:11,524
(He cast a spell)

249
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,005
(even when he's under
the effect of my visual spell?)

250
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,524
Your eyes

251
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,694
are much cloudier

252
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,525
than when I last saw them.

253
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:17,645
You have blood and qi deficiency too.

254
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,524
Young Master, what have you been doing lately?

255
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:21,054
The Crown Prince kept saying

256
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,295
that he wanted to seek out
the visual spell master.

257
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,885
It seems the Dragon King has started to suspect

258
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,455
that there's a visual spell master in Qingqiu too.

259
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,695
Let him find one then.

260
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:31,694
If I must say,

261
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:32,455
the evil practitioner

262
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:33,365
you want to find

263
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:34,524
doesn't exist in Qingqiu.

264
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:35,935
Changlan, how have you been doing all these years?

265
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:38,365
I was just barely surviving.

266
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,365
That direction is...

267
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:44,455
My father is training there!

268
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:45,175
Great Leader?

269
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,605
Don't tell me your father
is the visual spell master?

270
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:47,765
The Great Leader, he...

271
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:49,575
He broke out of my spell

272
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,885
and escaped when I was wounded.

273
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,415
How dare you guys obstruct me?

274
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,334
His Majesty is on a retreat at the moment.

275
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:58,245
Your Highness,

276
00:13:58,246 --> 00:13:59,485
please play somewhere else.

277
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:00,934
I'm not here to play!

278
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:01,525
Get out of the way!

279
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:15,845
It's inside.

280
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,215
Do not let him come inside!

281
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:23,095
Yes, sir.

282
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:36,455
Second Uncle?

283
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,575
Old man, what are you doing here?

284
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:44,605
Zhuli.

285
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,455
Second Uncle, he...

286
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:48,415
He...

287
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:54,415
I'm going to the study.

288
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,175
Second Uncle wants to test my cultivation.

289
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:58,485
I'm going to the study room.

290
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,575
Second Uncle wants to test my cultivation.

291
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,765
I saw Bai Xiaosheng on my way out.

292
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,095
He said...

293
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,124
He was brokenhearted

294
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,455
about the wedding tomorrow.

295
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,054
He said he needed some time alone.

296
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,575
He won't attend the wedding tomorrow.

297
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,005
He's not coming?

298
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,895
He said he wouldn't attend the wedding tomorrow.

299
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:25,005
Good boy.

300
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:31,725
Mr. Zhao,

301
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:33,245
I need you

302
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,415
to do me another favor.

303
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,575
Anything for you, Young Master.

304
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:37,725
I want you

305
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,175
to put on an act for me.

306
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,245
What kind of act?

307
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,485
But you see,

308
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,725
if we want to make the act convincing,

309
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:54,725
I'm afraid I might have to put you in danger, Mr. Zhao.

310
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,935
Mr. Zhao, you put on an excellent act

311
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,415
during the wedding.

312
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,115
I already used the opportunity

313
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:06,505
to cast my visual spell

314
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,145
on the audience.

315
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:11,505
Look at the flower petals!

316
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,075
It's gorgeous!

317
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:12,665
It's so beautiful!

318
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,145
It's so pretty!

319
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:14,145
Look at the flower petals!

320
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:16,625
All these years,

321
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:18,665
Mr. Zhao,

322
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,115
you did well in every act

323
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:22,355
when you were with me.

324
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:24,385
(Ghostly Eulogy)
(Now,)

325
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:25,785
(the entire Qingqiu)

326
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:26,995
(thinks)

327
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:29,745
(that you're the visual spell master.)

328
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:32,315
Run!

329
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:36,075
Mr. Zhao,

330
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,905
you're my trusted aide.

331
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,115
I didn't want things

332
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,025
to end up this way either.

333
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:46,475
We have to blame Yanhui and Tianyao for this.

334
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,625
They came to Qingqiu all of a sudden,

335
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:50,144
and they actually managed to retrieve

336
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,145
the Ghostly Eulogy.

337
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,835
For the act in Qingqiu,

338
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:00,995
now,

339
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,715
we need to complete the last chapter.

340
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:33,635
In the future,

341
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:37,435
I won't be able to help you again.

342
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:40,435
My child,

343
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:43,785
take care.

344
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,345
(If the royalty of Qingqiu
gives birth to twin sons,)

345
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:11,995
(that makes an inauspicious sign.)

346
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,875
(they have to gouge the eyes of the second son)

347
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,435
(and imprison him for the rest of his life.)

348
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:19,065
(Only then can Qingqiu be at peace.)

349
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:58,305
Listen.

350
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,235
Guess what toys I bought for you today.

351
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,715
Mr. Zhao,

352
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,395
did you buy them at Qingqiu Market?

353
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:08,345
Second Young Master,

354
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:10,395
when you're bored,

355
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:11,105
you can try

356
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,635
to solve this nine-ring puzzle.

357
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:15,714
I'm sure

358
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:17,105
the market is a fun place.

359
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:17,915
Mr. Zhao,

360
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,235
I want to go to Qingqiu Market.

361
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:21,505
Mr. Zhao,

362
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:23,675
do I still have a chance

363
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,785
to get to know the outside world?

364
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:28,995
You do.

365
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:30,995
Of course you do.

366
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,915
(Tales of Strange Beasts)
I even brought a book here for you.

367
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,785
You can touch it.

368
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,195
Sun.

369
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:46,435
Very good.

370
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:48,745
Light.

371
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,545
Father.

372
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,305
(After that, you were finally released.)

373
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:10,305
(You got to explore the world.)

374
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,265
(I thought you would never return.)

375
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,265
(But you did.)

376
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,395
(You returned in a shabby state.)

377
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,305
(I didn't know what you had gone through.)

378
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,155
(I felt)

379
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:23,475
(that you had changed somehow.)

380
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:25,995
(However, I felt glad)

381
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,435
(to see you in Qingqiu again.)

382
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:34,305
Young Master Changlan.

383
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,715
Mr. Zhao.

384
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:43,875
It's been a while.

385
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,065
(If we want to make the act convincing,)

386
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,105
I'm afraid I might have to put you in danger, Mr. Zhao.

387
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,265
Young Master,

388
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,505
I'm willing

389
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:15,915
to sacrifice my life for you.

390
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,105
Farewell,

391
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,715
Young Master.

392
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:58,195
We finally achieved something.

393
00:21:58,345 --> 00:21:59,545
We did great.

394
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:01,825
We still have chemistry.

395
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,635
It was official business.

396
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,195
Don't get the wrong idea.

397
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:10,745
Yanhui.

398
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,435
Dragon King.

399
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:17,745
What is this?

400
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:18,675
It's my gift of thanks.

401
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:20,105
I would never be able

402
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:21,235
to catch the visual spell master this quickly

403
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:22,395
without your help.

404
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,345
You guys are my benefactors.

405
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,785
You guys are his benefactors too.

406
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:27,635
Am I right?

407
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:29,345
You guys did great.

408
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:31,065
You two have contributed to the state of Qingqiu.

409
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:33,105
You guys have contributed to the state too.

410
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:33,635
Here.

411
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,155
Eat up.

412
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:38,744
Speaking of which, where did Bai Xiaosheng go

413
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:40,395
after the wedding ceremony?

414
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,105
I'm sure he's still angry.

415
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:43,955
He's angry?

416
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:45,305
It was just an act.

417
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:46,305
Why should he be angry?

418
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,955
After my second uncle checked my homework,

419
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:50,875
I met Bai Xiaosheng on my way out.

420
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:51,585
He said he didn't want

421
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:52,825
to see you two get married.

422
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:53,955
He left out of spite.

423
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,395
What did you say?

424
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:58,745
Bai Xiaosheng.

425
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:00,435
After my second uncle checked my homework,

426
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,065
I met Bai Xiaosheng on my way out.

427
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:03,265
He left.

428
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:07,155
He...

429
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:08,675
Something's off.

430
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:09,715
He left.

431
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:13,785
He left.

432
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,585
Bai Xiaosheng is fine.

433
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:21,505
He left.

434
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:22,435
He's under a visual spell.

435
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,265
He's angry.

436
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:29,305
He's indeed under a visual spell.

437
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,675
When did this happen?

438
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,475
How could I not realize it at all?

439
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:34,545
I'm sure it happened

440
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,675
when Bai Xiaosheng went missing.

441
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:36,955
Bai Xiaosheng is in danger.

442
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:37,875
I need to look for him!

443
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,065
Dispel the visual spell

444
00:23:41,195 --> 00:23:41,875
and look after him.

445
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:43,435
I will.

446
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:49,475
Bai Xiaosheng!

447
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,475
There are no hints of any visual spells here

448
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:55,475
and no signs

449
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,345
of a struggle.

450
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:05,345
After him!

451
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:06,585
Let's go!

452
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:16,875
Isn't this the place

453
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,675
where Leader Chenyi is training in seclusion?

454
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:20,395
Let's check it out.

455
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:24,675
Stop right there!

456
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:26,344
The Leader is training in seclusion here.

457
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:27,505
No outsiders allowed!

458
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,235
Stop right there!

459
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:35,785
You became more direct with your approaches

460
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:37,305
after coming to Qingqiu, huh?

461
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:38,585
I was influenced by you.

462
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:14,475
What should I do?

463
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:15,635
What should I do?

464
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:16,635
Dragon King!

465
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:17,585
Yanhui!

466
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:19,195
When will you guys come back?

467
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:24,395
I'm running out of strength!

468
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:29,435
Phantom secrets,

469
00:25:29,435 --> 00:25:30,305
shapeless crescents,

470
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:30,915
conceal!

471
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:50,585
Bai Xiaosheng?

472
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:52,995
Be careful!

473
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:17,915
Were you burned?

474
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:21,105
Sorry about that.

475
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:22,395
I was intending

476
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:23,635
to return it to you later.

477
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:24,305
It's fine.

478
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:25,875
You don't need to return it to me.

479
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:28,915
I'm glad that you're fine.

480
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:34,995
Hey, don't forget about me.

481
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:38,155
Yanhui, I'm dying from the pain.

482
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,745
I think I'm done for.

483
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:46,635
Keep quiet.

484
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:47,785
We're trying to think of something.

485
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:50,235
There's a magical trap here.

486
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:55,955
Let me do it.

487
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:19,305
That was scary.

488
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:21,875
How are you?

489
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:22,915
Are you okay?

490
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:23,875
Here.

491
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:26,155
Why are you here? And why did you get hurt?

492
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:28,825
I discovered

493
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,675
a secret.

494
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:31,745
What secret?

495
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:35,155
The visual spell master
that annihilated the Phantom Clan,

496
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,915
it was Changlan all along.

497
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:54,955
I thought Zhao Yu

498
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:56,505
was the visual spell master?

499
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,395
I think Zhao Yu was just a pawn.

500
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,345
Changlan

501
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:06,025
is just like you and me.

502
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:09,025
The three of us serve the Lord of Dark Aura.

503
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:10,634
The Lord of Dark Aura ordered him

504
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,915
to imprison Chenyi here.

505
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:15,345
Thus, he announced to the public

506
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:16,995
that the Great Leader was on a retreat.

507
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:19,714
So, no matter if it's

508
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:21,785
the destruction of the compass

509
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,195
or the disappearance of the screen,

510
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,395
it's all because

511
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:29,995
they harmed Chenyi.

512
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:33,475
Where's Chenyi?

513
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:34,995
Chenyi

514
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,785
has escaped.

515
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:39,915
But now,

516
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:42,875
there's something more urgent...

517
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,745
Bai Xiaosheng?

518
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:47,955
Bai Xiaosheng!

519
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:48,915
(Changlan.)

520
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:50,915
-Bai Xiaosheng?
-(How did you end up like this)

521
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:52,634
(after we parted ways at the Dragon Valley?)

522
00:28:52,635 --> 00:28:53,715
Wake up!

523
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:42,345
The show

524
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:45,635
has finally begun.

525
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:26,025
His Majesty has come out of his retreat!

526
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:35,234
His Majesty has been on a retreat for many years.

527
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:36,545
Why did he suddenly come out of his retreat?

528
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,745
Don't tell me it was
because of the visual spell master?

529
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:39,635
I heard

530
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:40,824
that Zhao Yu took his own life

531
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:41,955
in prison last night.

532
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:44,065
He has been reduced to smoke.

533
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:46,305
He took his own life?

534
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:48,545
Second Young Master was unwise
with his subject selection.

535
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,304
The Crown Prince indulges himself
in worldly pleasures.

536
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:53,024
If His Majesty doesn't come out
of his retreat now,

537
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,544
Qingqiu will be in danger!

538
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:55,345
Mr. Yan!

539
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:01,675
Since His Majesty has come out of his retreat,

540
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:02,914
Second Young Master,

541
00:31:02,915 --> 00:31:04,995
you should return to where you belong.

542
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:07,395
If you keep standing here,

543
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:09,505
you'll go against the rules of Qingqiu,

544
00:31:09,675 --> 00:31:10,915
and disaster will befall Qingqiu.

545
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:14,065
I'm afraid you cannot bear the consequences.

546
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:19,265
Mr. Yan, you're right.

547
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,505
I just wish

548
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:23,195
to bid farewell to my brother.

549
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:33,305
Your Majesty, welcome back.

550
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:40,995
Let's go.

551
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:57,635
Your Majesty!

552
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:01,105
Your Majesty!

553
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:04,065
Arrest the murderer from the Taoist clan!

554
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,784
Arrest the murderer from the Taoist clan!

555
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:06,475
This...

556
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:08,955
What is going on?

557
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:13,105
Arrest the murderer from the Taoist clan!

558
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,235
If he's speaking the truth,

559
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:19,875
if Changlan is the visual spell master,

560
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:20,875
that means we're...

561
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:21,675
I don't trust his words.

562
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:23,675
I will question Changlan myself.

563
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,195
Question him yourself?

564
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,395
But what if...

565
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:27,745
Right now, no one in Qingqiu

566
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:29,065
can hurt me.

567
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:30,875
I will protect you too.

568
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:35,105
What about him?

569
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:50,545
Let's bring him away for now.

570
00:32:52,705 --> 00:32:53,835
The Taoist assassin is over there!

571
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:56,064
Stop right there!

572
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:56,675
Surround them!

573
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:57,515
What's going on?

574
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:58,985
What's with the hostility?

575
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,545
How dare you, you evil Taoist?

576
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,505
How dare you murder

577
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:05,104
the Great Leader of Qingqiu?

578
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:05,585
What?

579
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:06,395
I...

580
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:07,954
I murdered the Great Leader?

581
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,065
When?

582
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:11,234
We witnessed everything

583
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:12,505
in the main hall just now!

584
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:13,994
How dare you deny it?

585
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,784
Don't tell me we're blind?

586
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,675
That's impossible!

587
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:17,635
I wasn't even there just now!

588
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:18,585
How dare you deny it?

589
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:19,545
Arrest her!

590
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:20,235
Yes, sir!

591
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:20,745
Nobody touches her!

592
00:33:21,785 --> 00:33:23,025
Dragon King,

593
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:24,265
you're muddle-headed!

594
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:26,954
Why are you still protecting the evil Taoist?

595
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,194
I didn't murder the Great Leader!

596
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:28,955
Shut up!

597
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:33,635
Changlan!

598
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:34,955
Tianyao.

599
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:38,194
You already had your heart broken once

600
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:39,265
by a Taoist.

601
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,235
Are you going to repeat your mistake?

602
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:43,025
The visual spell master, Zhao Yu,

603
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:45,955
had taken his life last night
out of guilty conscience.

604
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,675
His body has vanished.

605
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:49,745
Miss Yan,

606
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,545
were you behind that as well?

607
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,065
It's you.

608
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:57,585
You're the visual spell master.

609
00:33:58,955 --> 00:33:59,715
Why?

610
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:00,435
What?

611
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,545
He's blind.

612
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:04,234
How could he master visual spells?

613
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:05,235
You were tricked by him!

614
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:06,995
Stop trying to deny your crime!

615
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,834
You murdered His Majesty

616
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:10,104
in the main hall!

617
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:11,955
Everyone witnessed it in person!

618
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:13,225
I

619
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:14,875
didn't.

620
00:34:20,665 --> 00:34:21,915
Arrest her!

621
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:37,225
Tianyao,

622
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:39,315
if you keep protecting that woman,

623
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:42,355
that means you'll go against the entire Qingqiu.

624
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:43,704
If so,

625
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,184
Qingqiu will cease to respect

626
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:48,025
the ignorant Dragon King!

627
00:35:05,915 --> 00:35:06,665
Wake up!

628
00:35:06,955 --> 00:35:07,705
Wake up!

629
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:10,024
Come on, wake up!

630
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,274
Stop sleeping!

631
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,505
Something huge is happening out there!

632
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:14,875
Zhuli!

633
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:16,435
Zhuli!

634
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,705
Where are we?

635
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:30,185
We're inside the Phantom Ring.

636
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,025
Why did you drag me

637
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:33,225
into the ring?

638
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:34,355
Something happened.

639
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:36,705
We got the wrong person.

640
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:38,435
What did you say?

641
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:40,625
Just now,

642
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,665
Yanhui and Tianyao came to me

643
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:44,105
before they left.

644
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,025
Huan Xiaoyan and Zhuli

645
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:51,995
are missing.

646
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:53,475
Could they be in trouble?

647
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:55,505
I'm here!

648
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:57,065
-Huan Xiaoyan!
-Dragon King.

649
00:35:57,145 --> 00:35:57,875
Yanhui.

650
00:35:58,435 --> 00:35:59,704
After you guys left,

651
00:35:59,705 --> 00:36:00,954
the entire Qingqiu Palace

652
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:01,755
was filled

653
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:03,225
with hints of visual spells.

654
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,585
Seems like it happened last night.

655
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:07,435
I brought the little fox

656
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,474
and hid inside the ring.

657
00:36:08,475 --> 00:36:09,664
After that,

658
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:11,025
we rolled ourselves outside.

659
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:12,314
I hid the entire night

660
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:13,185
as I was too afraid to come out.

661
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:13,875
And...

662
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,994
The little fox hasn't woken up yet.

663
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:16,995
He's still in the ring.

664
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:18,145
We got the wrong person.

665
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,504
Zhao Yu wasn't the visual spell master.

666
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:20,355
It was Changlan.

667
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:21,315
What?

668
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:22,624
Now, the entire Qingqiu Palace

669
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:23,705
is caught under his visual spell.

670
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:24,225
They thought

671
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,225
I murdered Chenyi.

672
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:26,835
If so,

673
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,184
what should we do?

674
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,314
They'll catch up to us soon.

675
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,275
You should leave with us.

676
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:30,755
Maybe

677
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:31,954
he'll slander you after this.

678
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:32,545
No.

679
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:33,835
I cannot leave.

680
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:36,144
The visual spell master
annihilated the Phantom Clan.

681
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:36,755
I can't just leave him

682
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:38,064
run amok

683
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,624
and harm Qingqiu.

684
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,145
You'll be in danger if you stay here.

685
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,505
I have the Phantom Ring.

686
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:44,835
It's the secret treasure of the Phantom Clan.

687
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,144
When I'm inside,

688
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:47,505
visual spells won't work on me.

689
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:49,144
I can monitor Changlan's movements

690
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:51,065
if I remain in Qingqiu Palace.

691
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:51,795
In the future,

692
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:53,475
we can launch a two-pronged attack together.

693
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,105
Give me your hand.

694
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:00,665
If I'm in danger,

695
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,475
I will call for help.

696
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:04,755
Don't worry.

697
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:07,915
You must take care of yourself.

698
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:10,474
After Yanhui and Tianyao left,

699
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:11,995
I hid inside the ring again.

700
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,354
The guards that were passing by

701
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:16,105
said that Yanhui killed your father.

702
00:37:16,505 --> 00:37:17,834
But how could Yanhui

703
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,275
kill your father?

704
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:21,795
No.

705
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:22,995
No.

706
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:24,185
You...

707
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:26,354
Maybe you were caught under the visual spell.

708
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:27,995
Speak for yourself.

709
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:30,795
When we and the Brush Sprite
were keeping guard over the cave,

710
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:32,664
your second uncle told you to go to his study.

711
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:34,185
I'm sure he put you under a visual spell

712
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:35,874
and used you

713
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,545
to deceive the Dragon King and Yanhui

714
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:39,225
so that they wouldn't be able

715
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,705
to find Bai Xiaosheng immediately.

716
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:41,665
No.

717
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:42,545
That's impossible.

718
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:43,795
That's impossible.

719
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:44,835
No.

720
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:45,505
I'm going to clarify things

721
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:46,505
with my second uncle personally.

722
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,225
The palace is filled with visual spells now.

723
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:49,795
I don't believe it.

724
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:50,995
I will question him myself.

725
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:52,755
Once you go outside,
you'll be placed under his control.

726
00:37:52,995 --> 00:37:53,625
Also, Changlan

727
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:55,315
must be looking for you right now.

728
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,875
Do you have a death wish?

729
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:05,835
Let me out!

730
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:06,835
Cut it out!

731
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:08,025
You'll die if you go outside!

732
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:09,025
From now on,

733
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:10,355
you must do as I say.

734
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:21,505
Young Master,

735
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:23,624
I heard that Mr. Yan

736
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,995
had already put the dragon...

737
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:29,025
He already put them on the wanted list.

738
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:35,025
This is truly unexpected.

739
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:35,915
How could they

740
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,225
be this evil?

741
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:41,835
Yeah.

742
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:46,105
I didn't expect that either.

743
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:29,538
You are in the opposite direction,
I can't see you clearly

744
00:39:29,698 --> 00:39:36,818
My grey hair represents my longing for you

745
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,418
Each frame slipping through my fingers

746
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:42,978
Marks our history

747
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,738
The breeze blows, the pear blossom falls

748
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:49,578
The swan goose honks

749
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:52,698
I trace your silhouette

750
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,538
One portrait after another

751
00:39:57,498 --> 00:39:59,898
I caress your cheek

752
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:04,098
One memory after another

753
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:06,858
I drown my nights with this forlornness

754
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:11,218
The wind blows as I sigh

755
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,458
Everything I've been through in my life

756
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:19,458
Is so that I can find you

757
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:36,418
Who has had the taste of a true departure?

758
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:43,698
Just like the moon,
our reunion is few and far between

759
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:47,458
Among the green hills and the clear rivers

760
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,978
My love for you will never change

761
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:53,258
How easy it is to meet and part

762
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:57,538
Retelling our encounters to the endless rain

763
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:02,738
May the drifting petals scatter
throughout the world

764
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:06,978
And the spring breeze remains the same

765
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:09,778
I carry the memory of you with me

766
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,418
And move forward

767
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:17,138
I look back a few times

768
00:41:17,538 --> 00:41:20,698
Trying to look for the you I knew

769
00:41:21,258 --> 00:41:22,938
We hold hands,
reminiscing on our good memories

770
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,618
The mortal world is as bustling as always

771
00:41:27,378 --> 00:41:30,658
Sometimes, it's just hard

772
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:36,178
To convey my feelings
