00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,281
This is the pair

4
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,161
of master and familiar who blew up the Arena

5
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,591
together with my nephew, Feng Qianshuo.

6
00:01:56,886 --> 00:02:00,800
(Master: Yanhui, Familiar: Lucky Carp)

7
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:01,841
Yanhui?

8
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:04,721
Immortal, do you know her?

9
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:08,911
I've overstepped my boundaries.

10
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:09,721
Sir!

11
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,281
This is bad!

12
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,521
We're in trouble!

13
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,191
The immortal of the Guanghan Sect is here.

14
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,056
Mind your manners.

15
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:17,666
It doesn't matter.

16
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:19,786
What's the matter?

17
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:22,506
What?

18
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:32,896
Where is he?

19
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,666
Sir, please pardon me.

20
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:35,946
Useless fool!

21
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:37,296
You couldn't even keep an eye on him?

22
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,226
What's the use of keeping you around?

23
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:40,386
Sir, please pardon me!

24
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,671
I kept a close eye on him all day long.

25
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,786
I didn't even dare to blink.

26
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:43,761
I swear upon my fortunes

27
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:44,666
and life

28
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:45,346
that no one

29
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,416
entered or left the room!

30
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,266
The barrier within the room isn't damaged.

31
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,016
Could it be

32
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:54,136
that he vanished suddenly?

33
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,066
If that's the case,

34
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:57,946
most of the monsters

35
00:02:58,016 --> 00:02:59,106
that escaped from the Arena

36
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:01,266
a few days ago did vanish too.

37
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:03,616
Seems like there are others

38
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:05,016
who are helping the monsters out

39
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:07,346
besides your nephew.

40
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,506
I don't care if it's spirits or humans.

41
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,296
It's impossible for them to vanish without a trace.

42
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:13,786
Since there's no one on the surface,

43
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,016
they can only be underground.

44
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,266
Even if you have to dig a pit,

45
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:20,136
you must capture him!

46
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:21,266
Yes, sir!

47
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,666
Master Feng, calm down.

48
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,616
Master Suying's seal

49
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:25,986
penetrated the ground long ago.

50
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,616
The entire Yongzhou City

51
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,856
is a cage

52
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:30,346
from top to bottom.

53
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:32,546
No matter how they struggle,

54
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,736
it's futile.

55
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:37,136
Since they're digging their own graves,

56
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,296
let's put on

57
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,696
the coffin lid for them.

58
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:42,666
Yes, Immortal.

59
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:47,896
When you're living under someone else's roof,

60
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,666
you need to learn how to take something on the chin.

61
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:50,416
That's right.

62
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:51,506
This is

63
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,786
the monsters' den.

64
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,506
You need to follow our customs.

65
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:55,856
What are you trying to do?

66
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,506
What's with that smug attitude?

67
00:03:57,576 --> 00:03:58,786
What's the commotion?

68
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:00,946
Who's this?

69
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:04,736
Isn't this the Young Master of the Feng family?

70
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,266
Miss Yan, do you know him?

71
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,141
Great. I'll leave him to you.

72
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:10,786
We cannot serve a noble person

73
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,226
like the Young Master of the Feng family.

74
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,016
Ninth, let's go.

75
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:13,696
That's right.

76
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:14,826
See you, Miss Yan.

77
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:18,816
What are you doing here?

78
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:22,416
I'm here to look for you.

79
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:23,986
Why is that so?

80
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:24,906
Thanks to you,

81
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,616
my identity, which I had hidden for ten years,

82
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:27,706
was exposed.

83
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:29,226
Now, Guanghan Sect has labeled me as a criminal

84
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,736
who blew up the Arena.

85
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:31,786
That's why I'm here

86
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,256
to mingle with these stupid monsters.

87
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:34,856
I can tell that you aren't doing great.

88
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,346
Let me ask you something.

89
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:37,921
Did you think I gave you the golden phoenix feather

90
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,026
so that you could join the beast gladiatorial game?

91
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:40,386
You still dare to say that?

92
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,896
What kind of stupid arena was that?

93
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:42,896
There's no VIP tunnel.

94
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,056
It leads people to the registration counter.

95
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,296
You were sending us to our deaths!

96
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:46,386
No one else died.

97
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,346
Why did you think you would die?

98
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:48,466
Why are you blaming me when you took the wrong path?

99
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,106
Yes.

100
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:50,866
I know the Arena has been committing atrocities for a long time.

101
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,506
However, it's not like we don't have other ways to deal with it.

102
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,096
Acquiring it, purchasing it, and reforming it.

103
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:55,186
All of these could work.

104
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:55,866
But you?

105
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:56,706
You just had to blow it up!

106
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,056
You're so annoying!

107
00:04:58,186 --> 00:04:59,506
Stop nagging me!

108
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,256
I don't know why Xiange

109
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:00,986
fell for a person like you!

110
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:01,616
What did you say?

111
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,256
Stop nagging me!

112
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,256
The next line!

113
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:04,866
I don't know why Xiange

114
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:05,776
fell for a person like you!

115
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,306
Is that true?

116
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:18,866
Xiange,

117
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:20,456
I made you some soup.

118
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:22,696
Thank you. Do you feel better?

119
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:26,552
Why do you have

120
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,946
the Flower Medallion?

121
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:29,896
The waiter you employed

122
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,456
said it was the last item

123
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,456
you left behind.

124
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,896
He told me to take it.

125
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,746
The situation was unpredictable before this.

126
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,746
I did prepare this beforehand.

127
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,626
But now, I'm still alive.

128
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,336
Xiange, are you willing

129
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:44,746
to return it to me?

130
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,106
Mr. Feng, how could you take something back

131
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,696
when you had given it to someone?

132
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,816
I require it

133
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:55,426
for what I'm about to do later.

134
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:00,946
What exactly is this?

135
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:01,896
Is it that important?

136
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:05,546
This is

137
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,186
a treasure of communication

138
00:06:07,376 --> 00:06:08,626
my father found when he was traveling around.

139
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,066
Initially, it was called Loving Phoenix.

140
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,696
However, my mother detested the name.

141
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:12,816
So she changed it to Flower Medallion.

142
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:13,866
I used it

143
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,506
to create Qijue Agency's intelligence network.

144
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:16,666
So,

145
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,186
it's used to relay information?

146
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,376
Not just that,

147
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,336
all of the secret information

148
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,136
that Qijue Agency had gathered

149
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,576
could be found with it.

150
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,306
Without any limits?

151
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:27,256
Without any limits.

152
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:28,106
Great.

153
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:28,946
Mr. Feng,

154
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:29,946
please pass a message

155
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,136
to Qingqiu that Princess Yunxi

156
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,016
was captured by Suying.

157
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:35,506
So, did you save me

158
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,426
just so you could relay information to Qingqiu?

159
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,216
I cannot help you out.

160
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:48,426
But why?

161
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:50,468
The Nine-Tailed Fox Clan of Qingqiu

162
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,323
values their bloodline.

163
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,301
Everyone knows that.

164
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:53,858
If they hear about

165
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:54,743
what Suying had done,

166
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,848
war will erupt between Taoists and spirits.

167
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,271
Mr. Feng, are you going to stand idly by then?

168
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:03,588
I remember

169
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:04,745
that the Qijue Agency

170
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,155
never owes people any favors.

171
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:07,425
You can take my life.

172
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,675
However, I cannot do this.

173
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:09,065
You...

174
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:09,915
By saving this person,

175
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,625
you'll drag the people of Yongzhou

176
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,060
into a war between Taoists and spirits.

177
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,275
If you don't do it,

178
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:19,235
I'll send you back

179
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:20,985
to Feng Ming.

180
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:22,795
You won't do that.

181
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:23,625
I...

182
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:25,155
Fine.

183
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:27,185
You have your faith

184
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,545
while I have my own favors to repay.

185
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,035
Mr. Feng, I won't put you on the spot.

186
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,065
I will relay this information

187
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,065
myself.

188
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:33,235
No!

189
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:33,945
I have to go!

190
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:36,275
(Hello, Master.)

191
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,425
(I'm glad to be of your service.)

192
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:38,305
Relay Princess Yunxi...

193
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,065
(Yes, Master.)

194
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:40,475
(Latest news)

195
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:41,715
(regarding Princess Yunxi.)

196
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,545
(She has already been killed by Suying.)

197
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,475
Be careful.

198
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:54,385
Here.

199
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,505
How far away are we from Yongzhou City?

200
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,305
Only half a li left!

201
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,155
We need to speed up.

202
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,275
Yes, sir!

203
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:09,425
Buddy, let's go!

204
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:11,595
Are you okay?

205
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:12,795
Are you okay?

206
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:13,865
What's the matter?

207
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:16,545
We're in trouble.

208
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:18,275
Your Majesty.

209
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:19,304
The Dragon King is here to get food

210
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:20,155
for that lady again.

211
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,035
Seems like the Dragon King

212
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:21,985
does care about the lady.

213
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:22,945
He didn't even want her

214
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:24,065
to walk.

215
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:24,915
Precisely.

216
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,065
Yuli, what's with the flustered look?

217
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,035
Suying's barrier

218
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,940
has penetrated the underground.

219
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:32,883
There's no escape.

220
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:37,985
Everyone,

221
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,315
using the Dragon Horn Formation,

222
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,385
Suying has sealed off

223
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:42,555
the entire Yongzhou City

224
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:43,555
from top to bottom.

225
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,872
We're like birds trapped in a cage now.

226
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:48,025
We're done for.

227
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:48,905
I haven't brought you guys out

228
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:49,865
to complete my task yet.

229
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,115
If we don't have a solution to this,

230
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:53,195
they'll discover us

231
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:54,435
sooner or later.

232
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,410
If you can relay

233
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,235
Princess Yunxi's death

234
00:08:58,293 --> 00:08:59,203
to Qingqiu,

235
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,115
with the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan's interference,

236
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:02,235
we still might be able

237
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,745
to escape.

238
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:07,625
I cannot do so.

239
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,235
If news of this gets out,

240
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:10,665
war will erupt between Taoists and spirits,

241
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:11,595
and Yongzhou will be implicated.

242
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:20,905
It's my turn to speak.

243
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:23,355
The Arena was blown to bits.

244
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:24,785
It's a huge deal.

245
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,138
Many people have heard it.

246
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,025
Do you truly think

247
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,115
that you can hide this news from them?

248
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,625
Moreover,

249
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:31,955
Princess Yunxi

250
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,265
is the favorite daughter

251
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,625
of the ruler of Qingqiu.

252
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:36,195
Do you think

253
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:37,435
he'll let us off?

254
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,071
That's all I'm going to say.

255
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:41,264
Yongzhou City will be done for

256
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,202
eventually.

257
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:44,115
We should use this opportunity

258
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,830
to our advantage instead.

259
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:48,267
What?

260
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,147
How dare you look at me like that?

261
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,147
What's wrong, miss?

262
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,507
Did I say something wrong?

263
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:55,777
Who exactly are you?

264
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:58,482
Wait.

265
00:09:58,728 --> 00:09:59,328
Right now,

266
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:00,202
shouldn't we discuss...

267
00:10:00,227 --> 00:10:00,777
No matter what,

268
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:01,907
I won't break

269
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,777
this news to them.

270
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,107
If no one is protecting.

271
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,267
Yongzhou City,

272
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:07,424
I'll protect it.

273
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:09,747
Did you even listen to my words?

274
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,576
I said, Yongzhou City

275
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,697
will be done for eventually.

276
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,296
You have no authority to speak!

277
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,147
What are you trying to protect?

278
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,107
What are you saying?

279
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:16,627
So what

280
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:17,297
if you own this place?

281
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,107
It's just an underground cave!

282
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:19,057
Enough. Stop arguing.

283
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:19,777
So what if I'm richer than you?

284
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:20,424
Beat me up

285
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,387
if you're that capable.

286
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,107
Stop it! Shut up!

287
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:25,537
Sit down!

288
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:34,311
Why are you guys arguing?

289
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:34,981
Huh?

290
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,791
Do you think it'll be of help?

291
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:37,861
Right now,

292
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,526
no matter if we wish to relay the news to Qingqiu

293
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,031
or leave Yongzhou,

294
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,830
first, we have to lift the seal

295
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:43,918
on the dragon horns.

296
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,859
Only by lifting the seal on the dragon horns

297
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,780
will we be able

298
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:47,635
to leave Yongzhou safely

299
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,590
and stay alive.

300
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,167
You two can do whatever you want

301
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,312
after we leave Yongzhou.

302
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:52,647
You can argue with whomever you like.

303
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:53,983
Yanhui is right.

304
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,020
You!

305
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:57,601
The dragon horns are yours, right?

306
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:58,956
Tell us. How do we lift the seal?

307
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:02,802
We have to depend on you.

308
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,042
Me?

309
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,512
What do you mean?

310
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:17,402
I only possess a minuscule amount of spiritual power

311
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:18,992
in my mind's eye.

312
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,922
If you only lack spiritual power in your mind's eye,

313
00:11:26,872 --> 00:11:27,752
you can ask it.

314
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:29,282
What is that?

315
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,632
Don't tell me it can speak?

316
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:31,752
(I can.)

317
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:36,352
(Regarding the way)

318
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:37,282
(to boost one's spiritual power)

319
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,351
(in a short period, )

320
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,402
(the answer is...)

321
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:56,712
Everyone,

322
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:58,352
Suying of the Guanghan Sect

323
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,682
used the seal on the dragon horns

324
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,562
to form a magical formation

325
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,442
and sealed off Yongzhou City.

326
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:04,042
We cannot escape

327
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,632
through the underground.

328
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,322
Our only way

329
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,202
is to assist Tianyao

330
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,832
in lifting the dragon horns' seal.

331
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,832
Only then will we be able to leave.

332
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:17,632
Spirit Dragon is the leader of the spirits.

333
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,162
It's our duty to help His Majesty

334
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,592
to retrieve his dragon horns!

335
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:21,712
Yes! It's our duty!

336
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,112
It's our duty!

337
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:25,042
I need all of your help.

338
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,352
Lend your spiritual power

339
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,352
to Yanhui.

340
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:29,162
What?

341
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:29,992
Why?

342
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:31,162
Why must we lend our spiritual power

343
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,162
to a Taoist?

344
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:32,952
That's right!

345
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:34,562
Anyway, I don't believe in Taoists.

346
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:35,802
She's different.

347
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,922
She helped us before.

348
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,042
Taoists are devious and cunning.

349
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,135
I still don't believe them.

350
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:40,871
Yeah! We don't believe them!

351
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:41,562
They mustn't be trusted!

352
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,442
They killed my family!

353
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:43,682
We mustn't lend her our powers!

354
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:45,042
We mustn't!

355
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:48,232
We mustn't.

356
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,112
That's right. We mustn't.

357
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:50,922
If you wish to lift the seal,

358
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,082
you have to lend your powers to her.

359
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:58,502
Why should we lend our powers to her?

360
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,751
Why must we lend it to them?

361
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:00,042
Yeah, why?

362
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:00,712
That's right.

363
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,682
I trust you!

364
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,802
You risked your life

365
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,632
to save the Dragon King in the Arena.

366
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,954
You retrieved his spirit token for him.

367
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:10,592
That was how we were able

368
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:11,745
to escape

369
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:12,872
from that hell safely.

370
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,082
I trust you!

371
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,712
I trust the Dragon King too!

372
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:18,282
I trust them!

373
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,682
Although I'm not willing to trust a Taoist,

374
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,442
I'm willing to trust the Dragon King!

375
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:25,162
He's right.

376
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:52,382
Tianyao,

377
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,712
I'll definitely retrieve the dragon horns for you.

378
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:59,712
I'll definitely help you guys

379
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,832
escape from Yongzhou City safely.

380
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,515
All right! I trust you!

381
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,530
Trust in the Dragon King!

382
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:06,795
Trust in the Dragon King!

383
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:08,395
Trust in the Dragon King!

384
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,445
Trust in the Dragon King!

385
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:58,085
How is it?

386
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:03,395
It's not good enough.

387
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,005
I'm just worried that I might not perform like normal

388
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,325
when I have to retrieve the dragon horns.

389
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,605
Let me help you out.

390
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,605
Can you please knock on the door

391
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:12,555
before coming in next time?

392
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:13,965
How?

393
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,325
I'm just frustrated.

394
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:19,875
Your relationship with him

395
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,155
is breaking down

396
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:22,445
because of a tiny matter like this.

397
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:23,205
That's why

398
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:24,755
I've decided

399
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,205
to assist you in breaking the magical formation.

400
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,034
I'll make sure you succeed.

401
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,755
Are you that powerful?

402
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,035
Hey.

403
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,755
Just like him,

404
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,725
I'm an immortal too.

405
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:35,725
If that's the case,

406
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,755
why don't you lend her your spiritual power then?

407
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,915
She won't be able to use it.

408
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,085
But I can use it to protect her.

409
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,401
If so, why don't you let me assess

410
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:45,485
your mind's eye's spiritual power?

411
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:46,555
I'll be able to tell

412
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:47,725
if she can use your power or not.

413
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:18,085
You don't need to keep your guard up.

414
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,395
Listen.

415
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:20,875
At least for now,

416
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:21,915
you and I

417
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,155
are trying

418
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,395
to leave Yongzhou City together.

419
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:26,125
Dragon,

420
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,125
you want to launch a feint attack, right?

421
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:30,035
Tell Mr. Feng

422
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:31,125
and Miss Xiange

423
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,275
to lure Feng Ming away.

424
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:34,155
You can lure Suying away.

425
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:36,085
Give Yanhui the time and space she needs

426
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,795
to break the magical formation.

427
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,275
Once she breaks the Dragon Horn Formation,

428
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:41,085
I can

429
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:42,915
steal the dragon horns

430
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,035
and return them to you

431
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:45,325
without anyone knowing.

432
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,605
I'm the shadow.

433
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:48,875
I'm the best candidate

434
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,395
for this task.

435
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,445
He has a point.

436
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,155
No.

437
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:58,125
What's wrong again?

438
00:16:58,395 --> 00:16:59,845
This concerns the safety of everyone here.

439
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,515
We cannot trust him completely yet.

440
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,965
He must be an ingrate.

441
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,755
I've already saved you on numerous occasions.

442
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,315
But you still don't trust me?

443
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,245
You have a point.

444
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:17,115
I'll ask him to scram.

445
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:18,275
You!

446
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:18,909
Get lost!

447
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:19,725
Go away!

448
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,005
Fine!

449
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:26,965
You ingrate.

450
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,515
You're an ingrate too.

451
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:29,795
Only I'm not an ingrate.

452
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,515
They're just ungrateful people.

453
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:35,355
I don't trust people

454
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,245
that easily.

455
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,445
Don't worry.

456
00:17:37,595 --> 00:17:38,445
I'll follow your instructions.

457
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:45,075
Bai Xiaosheng?

458
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:46,755
Are you asleep?

459
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,115
Miss Yan.

460
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,035
You scared me.

461
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:02,485
I don't think it's appropriate for you

462
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,315
to see me in the middle of the night.

463
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,595
I came here

464
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:07,595
because I thought

465
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,205
the idea you mentioned this morning could work.

466
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,594
I wish to discuss with you

467
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,595
what to do by then.

468
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,355
I'm not an ingrate.

469
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,205
Also,

470
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,835
you've helped us out so many times.

471
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,620
At least,

472
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,405
you don't have a reason to sabotage us

473
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:24,515
when it comes to leaving Yongzhou City.

474
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,620
You finally

475
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,005
said something decent for once.

476
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:32,205
It's hard to win Tianyao's trust.

477
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,445
Try to understand his feelings.

478
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:34,555
After all,

479
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,355
he was harmed by humans in the past.

480
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,485
So he had a tragic past.

481
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:42,725
You understood his past

482
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,515
and felt sorry for him.

483
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:46,885
That's right.

484
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,145
Since this is beneficial

485
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,485
to your relationship,

486
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:51,795
I won't hold it against

487
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:52,595
that ingrate.

488
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,275
I already came up with a plan.

489
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:57,207
So,

490
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:58,725
on the day we retrieve the dragon horns,

491
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,925
you will hide in my shadow first.

492
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:03,165
After that, I'll bring you outside.

493
00:19:03,503 --> 00:19:04,583
Once we're outside,

494
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:05,715
after Tianyao leaves,

495
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,388
you and I will retrieve the dragon horns.

496
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,983
Once we retrieve the dragon horns,

497
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,103
go to Tianyao

498
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:11,063
and stick the dragon horns

499
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,823
to his head.

500
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:18,213
Sure.

501
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,173
You agreed to it that easily?

502
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,783
You underestimated me.

503
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,829
To me,

504
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:27,543
this is a piece of cake.

505
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:31,343
Pinky promise.

506
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:36,103
Do you think child's play like this

507
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:37,853
can restrain me?

508
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:41,173
If you dare trick me,

509
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,693
you'll be worse than a child.

510
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,413
Do not betray my trust.

511
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:10,743
You've gathered a huge amount of spiritual power.

512
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:11,853
How do you feel?

513
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:15,613
I feel much more energetic.

514
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:17,503
However,

515
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:19,653
I'm still not confident that I can lift

516
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,503
the seal on the dragon horns.

517
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,893
Take your time. Don't rush it.

518
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:24,743
You're behaving normally

519
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:25,933
even though you've absorbed

520
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:27,543
all the spiritual power from those monsters?

521
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:33,743
The spirit of heaven and earth

522
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,453
came from the same source.

523
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,413
There's no difference

524
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:37,743
between a Taoist's power and a spirit's.

525
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:39,693
To put it simply,

526
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,543
they're the same thing.

527
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:42,743
Of course there's no difference.

528
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,380
(Warning!)

529
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,023
(According to our informant, )

530
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,263
(the disciples of the Guanghan Sect)

531
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,303
(have started to search underground.)

532
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:57,213
(Warning!)

533
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:58,783
(According to our informant, )

534
00:20:58,893 --> 00:20:59,823
(the disciples of the Guanghan Sect)

535
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:01,983
(have started to search underground.)

536
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,213
Can we believe this thing?

537
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:09,358
I'm sure they found out

538
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:10,173
that I was missing.

539
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,583
That's why they're searching underground.

540
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:13,933
If that's the case,

541
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,543
we can't remain here for long.

542
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,063
I need to head to the surface

543
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,173
and distract them.

544
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,413
No.

545
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:21,493
The surface is crawling with their men.

546
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,063
Don't worry. I know what to do.

547
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,063
I've learned something

548
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:26,493
from living in Yongzhou City

549
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,543
all these years.

550
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,023
I'll tag along.

551
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:30,253
No need for that.

552
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:31,693
This happened because of me.

553
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,383
How could I stand idly by

554
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:34,733
while you risk your life?

555
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:36,893
All right then.

556
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:40,303
Xiange,

557
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:42,303
please be careful.

558
00:21:44,343 --> 00:21:45,173
See you

559
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:46,973
under the sun.

560
00:21:59,383 --> 00:21:59,893
(It's my first time)

561
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:00,823
(shouldering the lives)

562
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:01,653
(of this many people.)

563
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,863
(This time, I cannot afford to lose.)

564
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:06,303
Miss!

565
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,543
Miss!

566
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:09,023
Ninth and I...

567
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:09,493
Miss!

568
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:10,583
We finished the tunnel.

569
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,933
The tunnel leads to a remote corner

570
00:22:13,023 --> 00:22:14,143
in Yongzhou City.

571
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:15,253
No one will discover you two

572
00:22:15,383 --> 00:22:16,253
if you use this tunnel.

573
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:18,023
All right. It must've been tough.

574
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:19,063
Not at all.

575
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,493
I was a pangolin.

576
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:21,823
And Ninth was a gopher.

577
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:23,543
Digging holes is our expertise.

578
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:26,693
Don't bring that up.

579
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,453
What's wrong with being a gopher?

580
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:29,493
Everyone has been praising you

581
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:30,823
for your efficiency.

582
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:32,143
I told you to stop it.

583
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:33,343
How dare you push me?

584
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:34,413
So what if I push you?

585
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:34,893
You're noisy.

586
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:35,543
Touch me if you dare.

587
00:22:36,462 --> 00:22:37,222
Xiange,

588
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:38,653
we have to go.

589
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:41,499
Yuli,

590
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:42,583
remember to hide the entrance

591
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,973
after we reach the surface.

592
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:44,653
Miss,

593
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:46,453
it's dangerous up there.

594
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,420
It's too risky for you to leave now.

595
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:50,493
However, we cannot just

596
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:51,518
stay here forever.

597
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:53,708
We'll be cornered eventually.

598
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:54,733
It's better to leave now.

599
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:56,253
At least we can be on the offensive.

600
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:57,303
Don't worry.

601
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:58,303
Mr. Feng and I know Yongzhou

602
00:22:58,413 --> 00:22:59,693
like the back of our hands.

603
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:01,388
We can lure Feng Ming

604
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,253
and the disciples of the Guanghan Sect away

605
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:03,933
while we're up there.

606
00:23:04,103 --> 00:23:05,343
We'll buy time for Yanhui to recover her spiritual power

607
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:05,973
so that she can

608
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:06,893
retrieve the dragon horns.

609
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:08,343
Why don't you send me there?

610
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:10,653
You have more important affairs to attend to.

611
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:24,383
Come.

612
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:31,798
Miss, why have you

613
00:23:31,823 --> 00:23:32,933
summoned us?

614
00:23:35,253 --> 00:23:36,543
Twelve Young Misters, follow my order.

615
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:40,653
After my departure,

616
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,118
you all must protect

617
00:23:42,143 --> 00:23:43,143
the weaker monsters.

618
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,599
Once the seal on Yongzhou has been lifted,

619
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,699
you all will escort the monsters

620
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:48,809
out of Yongzhou.

621
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:50,979
And

622
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,499
never come back.

623
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:57,939
But...

624
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,369
Survive.

625
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:01,852
That's my last order

626
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,009
to you all.

627
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:43,179
You guys will be free

628
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,289
once you leave Yongzhou.

629
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:55,139
Miss, thank you for taking care of us all these years.

630
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:57,139
I should thank you guys instead.

631
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:55,089
Here.

632
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,499
We'll follow our previous plan.

633
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:07,369
Let's distract.

634
00:26:07,394 --> 00:26:08,314
Feng Ming and the rest

635
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,289
so that they won't

636
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,224
search underground.

637
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,289
I know what he cares about.

638
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,459
We'll cause a ruckus

639
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:17,329
in his territory.

640
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:20,289
A huge ruckus.

641
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:23,054
(Wangyu Tower)

642
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,088
How is it? Did you find anything?

643
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,089
No.

644
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:30,739
It seems like this place has been closed for some days.

645
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:32,139
There's not a single soul here.

646
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,459
Let's search somewhere else.

647
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,499
You guys may not know,

648
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:38,219
but the owner of Wangyu Tower

649
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,739
had over ten familiars with her.

650
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,049
Now that she isn't here,

651
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:44,732
I'm sure there's something more to it.

652
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:46,219
Something more to it?

653
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:46,739
Something more to it?

654
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:48,849
Besides, the owner of Wangyu Tower

655
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,264
was close to my nephew.

656
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:53,609
This place might be...

657
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:55,827
Sir!

658
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:56,444
What?

659
00:26:57,156 --> 00:26:59,196
I think someone blew up our building again.

660
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:03,979
Another one?

661
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:07,739
That's a warehouse nearby Tianxiang Workshop.

662
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,529
I'm sure that villain is destroying my workshop.

663
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:12,569
Immortal,

664
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,089
the villain is offering herself to us.

665
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:15,939
Let's go!

666
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:16,609
Let's go!

667
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:17,219
Follow me!

668
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:17,849
Let's go!

669
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,329
They're here.

670
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,569
Aren't you afraid?

671
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:32,459
I said this before.

672
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,089
I've been living in Yongzhou City for many years.

673
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:34,849
The underground city

674
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:35,939
isn't the only thing I've built.

675
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:42,419
Let's go.

676
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:44,139
What a coincidence.

677
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:45,529
The Qijue Agency has done more

678
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:46,529
than just gather intelligence

679
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:47,939
in Yongzhou City all these years.

680
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:55,739
So,

681
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:57,179
which place are we heading to?

682
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,369
We're blowing up your properties.

683
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:00,219
You make the call here.

684
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:01,089
All right.

685
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:02,699
Bring me to your properties then.

686
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:03,529
Let's go.

687
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:18,849
Put out the fire! Hurry!

688
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:19,419
Now!

689
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,979
Come! Quick!

690
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:21,849
Let's go!

691
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:22,459
Let's go!

692
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:02,739
After retrieving the dragon bone,

693
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,569
I can gather spiritual power

694
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:07,529
much faster.

695
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:11,699
I might be able

696
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:14,375
to stall Suying for a longer time

697
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:16,179
during crucial moments.

698
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:34,139
What's the matter?

699
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:35,089
It's not going well?

700
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,289
I've absorbed the spiritual power

701
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:42,979
of all the monsters here.

702
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,769
However, in my mind's eye,

703
00:29:44,794 --> 00:29:46,034
my spiritual power remains weak.

704
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:48,849
That's all the spiritual power I have

705
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,809
after ten years of Taoist training.

706
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,157
Can I really do this?

707
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:57,848
You should stop pulling a long face.

708
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,498
If it doesn't work out,

709
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,899
I can share some of my spiritual power

710
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:02,939
with you.

711
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:05,419
That's right.

712
00:30:05,588 --> 00:30:06,388
Since you're so powerful,

713
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:07,523
you must possess a huge amount of spiritual power.

714
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,208
How vast is your mind's eye?

715
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:11,899
You see,

716
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:13,808
I can't reveal

717
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:14,939
too many details.

718
00:30:15,092 --> 00:30:16,172
I can only transfer

719
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:17,046
some of my spiritual power

720
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:17,916
to you in secret.

721
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:19,476
However, you must keep it a secret.

722
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,046
Treat it as a secret

723
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,756
between us adults,

724
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:23,756
okay?

725
00:30:24,086 --> 00:30:25,366
(I need all the spiritual power I can get.)

726
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,505
(I mustn't let Xiange)

727
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:27,716
(and the rest down.)

728
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:29,606
Sure.

729
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:30,236
Okay.

730
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,126
That hurts!

731
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,141
Do you even

732
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,126
take my words seriously?

733
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,886
I do...

734
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:52,566
I'm just trying

735
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:54,389
to gather our strength here.

736
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:55,326
Besides,

737
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,196
I need all the spiritual power I can get.

738
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,366
You didn't need to treat me like that.

739
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,236
Are you angry?

740
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:07,716
Listen.

741
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:08,996
You're being jealous here.

742
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,566
I was the one who took the initiative.

743
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:11,676
It wasn't her.

744
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:12,326
Don't blame her.

745
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:13,846
I'm sorry!

746
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:15,436
I'll apologize to you.

747
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:16,846
Why don't I leave then?

748
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,496
I'll scram.

749
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,046
Don't argue because of me, okay?

750
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:25,406
It's not worth it.

751
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:31,366
There's nothing important on his mind.

752
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,606
He only cares about our relationship.

753
00:31:40,756 --> 00:31:42,166
How many times have I told you before?

754
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,566
That man cannot be trusted.

755
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:45,606
How could you let him enter your mind's eye?

756
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:48,046
Well, he didn't manage to enter it.

757
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:52,036
(Wangshu Manor)

758
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:07,606
Ma'am,

759
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:08,806
Mr. Lu

760
00:32:08,956 --> 00:32:10,166
can no longer take any medicine.

761
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,885
The dragon-scale armor isn't strong enough

762
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:14,196
without the Heart Protecting Scale.

763
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:40,236
Ma'am,

764
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,451
transferring spiritual power

765
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:42,606
to Mr. Lu to extend his life

766
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:43,676
isn't viable.

767
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:57,276
Is there still no news

768
00:32:58,046 --> 00:32:59,196
of the Heart Protecting Scale?

769
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,646
Ma'am, please be patient.

770
00:33:00,756 --> 00:33:01,956
The evil dragon is trapped underground.

771
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:03,196
He won't last for long.

772
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:06,406
But Musheng

773
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:09,126
won't be able to survive for long either.

774
00:33:20,886 --> 00:33:21,756
Ma'am,

775
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:22,606
if you cast the forbidden spell,

776
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:23,996
you'll suffer the consequences!

777
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:27,676
Water as a vow,

778
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:29,086
frost as shape.

779
00:33:29,196 --> 00:33:30,406
Erase all obstacles,

780
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,566
and follow my will!

781
00:33:38,646 --> 00:33:39,196
Kill.

782
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:08,166
Yao?

783
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:10,166
Yao?

784
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:11,396
Yao.

785
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,119
Are you still angry?

786
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:17,084
I know

787
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,509
you don't like it when people lie to you.

788
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:19,621
But I did it

789
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:20,796
for a reason.

790
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:21,901
I was just

791
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,126
after his spiritual power.

792
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:24,526
I did it for everyone's sake.

793
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:26,006
Besides,

794
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,756
it didn't work out anyway.

795
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:30,236
You trust others

796
00:34:30,263 --> 00:34:31,033
too easily.

797
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:32,329
One day,

798
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:34,086
you'll suffer the consequences.

799
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,046
Why?

800
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,926
You didn't say that when you told me

801
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:37,879
to trust you.

802
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,048
That's different.

803
00:34:39,073 --> 00:34:39,821
How was it different?

804
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:40,689
What? Can I only trust you

805
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,444
without trusting others?

806
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:41,829
I...

807
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:42,901
So, you can lie to me

808
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:43,756
while the others cannot?

809
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,446
I might be unlucky when it comes to gambling,

810
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:48,526
but I'm pretty good

811
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:49,511
at judging characters.

812
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:50,756
And

813
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,126
you're one of them.

814
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:53,006
You should feel honored.

815
00:34:58,046 --> 00:34:59,356
Why does it feel cold all of a sudden?

816
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:06,236
Watch out!

817
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:13,486
Someone's in trouble!

818
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:14,526
Go and check it out!

819
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:17,008
Be careful!

820
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:22,316
What is this?

821
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:23,316
This is Guanghan Sect's forbidden spell.

822
00:35:23,446 --> 00:35:24,086
Suying

823
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:25,166
is trying to chase us out.

824
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,196
Take them somewhere safe.

825
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:55,876
Yes, sir.

826
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:02,926
Yuli, why did you stop?

827
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:04,526
That's the barrier Suying had cast.

828
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:05,396
There's no escape.

829
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:06,875
Are we going to die here?

830
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:07,589
What should we do then?

831
00:36:08,356 --> 00:36:09,126
What do we do?

832
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,606
-Dragon King. -Dragon King.

833
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,396
Suying is trying to chase us out with her forbidden spell.

834
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,756
We need to bring our plan forward.

835
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,356
Dragon King, what's your plan?

836
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:27,486
I'll distract Suying.

837
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:29,006
You'll break the Dragon Horn Formation.

838
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:30,966
Yuli, stay here.

839
00:36:31,126 --> 00:36:32,006
Once the barrier is removed,

840
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:33,796
take them and leave Yongzhou.

841
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:34,526
Yes.

842
00:36:34,646 --> 00:36:35,316
But now,

843
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,237
the tunnel,

844
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:36,866
which leads to the surface

845
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:37,646
has been blocked off.

846
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,086
Let me do it.

847
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:40,729
I can

848
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:41,544
dig another tunnel to the surface.

849
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:42,716
But now,

850
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:43,356
the surface

851
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:44,344
is no longer the same.

852
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:46,006
Suying's spell has covered the ground with frost.

853
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,446
(You'll die from it.)

854
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:51,836
It's fine.

855
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,316
We can head to the surface ourselves.

856
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,421
I've recovered my spiritual power.

857
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:54,961
As for Tianyao...

858
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:55,862
Fifth and I will do it together.

859
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,606
Dragon King needs to battle Suying later.

860
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:58,926
And Miss Yao, you need to break the Dragon Horn Formation.

861
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,526
The two of you must reserve your strength.

862
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,676
We'll protect ourselves with a spell

863
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:02,966
when we dig the tunnel later.

864
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:04,269
Don't worry about us.

865
00:37:05,944 --> 00:37:06,594
Okay.

866
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:07,926
If that's the case,

867
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:08,987
the two of you

868
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:09,646
must escort Dragon King

869
00:37:09,796 --> 00:37:10,796
and Miss Yan to the surface safely.

870
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:11,651
Yes, sir.

871
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:12,046
Yes, sir.

872
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,275
Dragon King, Miss Yan,

873
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,526
please don't fall behind.

874
00:37:14,676 --> 00:37:15,486
Thank you.

875
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:08,756
Yanhui.

876
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,166
Are you guys okay?

877
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:16,126
We've fulfilled our duty.

878
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:17,716
You guys should hide.

879
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:18,796
Leave the rest to us.

880
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:20,486
Please take care.

881
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,316
Farewell. Let's go.

882
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:31,276
We must

883
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:32,526
break this barrier

884
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,126
and help them to regain freedom.

885
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:38,396
Yanhui?

886
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:53,876
Take care.

887
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,716
You too.

888
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:04,403
(If all encounters)

889
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:05,658
(are reunions long overdue, )

890
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:08,126
(I actually waited 1,000 years...)

891
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:11,036
(just to reunite with you.)

892
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:18,726
(You do look like a real dragon)

893
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:20,446
(when you speak seriously.)

894
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:21,676
Now that I'm around,

895
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:24,836
I'll definitely uphold justice for you.

896
00:39:25,476 --> 00:39:26,566
As for your body parts,

897
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:27,926
I'll help you

898
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:29,836
retrieve them.

899
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,406
(This family)

900
00:39:32,556 --> 00:39:33,766
is under my protection now.

901
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,366
If anyone dares bully the old lady

902
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:37,516
or that fool,

903
00:39:37,966 --> 00:39:39,348
I'll show you guys

904
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:42,693
(what it means to be a bully.)

905
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,196
(I will win this battle)

906
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:50,796
(for you)

907
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:53,406
(even if it means I have to risk my life.)

908
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:38,676
Who's there?

909
00:40:42,486 --> 00:40:43,642
That's Tianyao, the Spirit Dragon.

910
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:45,276
Attack!

911
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:20,046
Tianyao brought the plan forward.

912
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:20,966
I'm sure the underground city

913
00:41:21,126 --> 00:41:21,926
is no longer safe.

914
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:23,756
That's why they're risking it all.

915
00:41:24,006 --> 00:41:25,196
Let's head back and help them out.

916
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:26,836
We have to help them out,

917
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,316
but not by returning to the underground city.

918
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,276
Ma'am, that's...

919
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:37,993
He has finally appeared.

920
00:43:03,486 --> 00:43:05,006
(He's actually able to fend it off?)
