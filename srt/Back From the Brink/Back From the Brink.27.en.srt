3
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,110
The long river falls as trouble arises.

4
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,150
The long river falls as trouble arises.

5
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,080
The long river falls as trouble arises.

6
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,270
(Calm your heart and stop worrying. Understand the underlying meaning.)

7
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,590
(Ponder upon its logic.)

8
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,830
(Move your brain, and you feel dizzy.)

9
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,590
(Only then, you shall see two.)

10
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,269
The long river falls as trouble arises.

11
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,150
Five hearts facing the sky, lying underneath the lake.

12
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,080
Calm your heart and stop worrying. Understand the underlying meaning.

13
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,670
Do you think Chenyi can save you?

14
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,040
Entering one's mind with one's eye.

15
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,200
Do you think you can replace me

16
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,390
just by practicing my techniques?

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,240
Only then, you shall see two.

18
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,430
Ponder upon its logic.

19
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,550
Move your brain, and you feel dizzy.

20
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,670
Do you think you can master my techniques

21
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,390
after acquiring the Ghostly Eulogy?

22
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,990
Stop dreaming.

23
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,390
You will only obtain immortality if you submit to me.

24
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,830
Yanhui, my pawn, heed my command!

25
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,270
Tianyao, just go!

26
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,040
Yanhui!

27
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,440
Just go!

28
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,520
You...

29
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
Go!

30
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,150
(Rip out his Heart Protecting Scale.)

31
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,120
Tianyao, go!

32
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,590
Just go!

33
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,470
Yanhui?

34
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,760
(Rip out his Heart Protecting Scale.)

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,120
(Rip out his Heart Protecting Scale!)

36
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
(Heart Protecting Scale!)

37
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,150
Just go!

38
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,760
(Heart Protecting Scale!)

39
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,270
Destroy the dark flower!

40
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,560
Destroy the dark flower!

41
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,910
Destroy the dark flower!

42
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,470
(You'll die if he destroys the dark flower.)

43
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,080
(I won't let you die.)

44
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,120
Destroy it!

45
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,260
Yanhui?

46
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,860
Tianyao,

47
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,780
you did great just now.

48
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,380
You should've been that decisive from the start.

49
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,140
Now that the dark flower is gone,

50
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,540
I won't be able to survive for long.

51
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,140
However,

52
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,540
I don't fear death.

53
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,500
Compared to the days when I had to wait for my demise,

54
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,340
I don't feel sad at all.

55
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,940
Tianyao,

56
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,700
why do you look sadder

57
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,180
than me?

58
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,660
Yanhui,

59
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,980
you will live on.

60
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,820
Tianyao!

61
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,100
What's wrong?

62
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
Yanhui,

63
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,980
don't be afraid.

64
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,100
You'll be fine.

65
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
You'll live on.

66
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
You saved me many times

67
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,340
ever since our first encounter.

68
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,260
If I can exchange my life

69
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,340
for yours,

70
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,940
it'll be a dream come true for me.

71
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,180
Is this the Life-Swapping Spell?

72
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,700
The nine stars.

73
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,020
Yinghuo said

74
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,620
someone was willing to sacrifice their lives

75
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,060
to preserve mine.

76
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,980
So, she was referring to you!

77
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,580
(Yanhui, )

78
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,580
(I'll return the Nine Stars of mind's eye to you.)

79
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,500
(They'll preserve your life for me.)

80
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,300
Yanhui,

81
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,220
I hope that you can lead

82
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,180
a peaceful life

83
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,580
after I retrieve my body.

84
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,580
So, back then,

85
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,100
you knew I wouldn't die!

86
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,380
You risked your own life

87
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,620
to fight Suying!

88
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,980
Why didn't you tell me?

89
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,900
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

90
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,180
I was afraid that you might not be willing to accept it.

91
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,820
Tianyao?

92
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,260
Tianyao!

93
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,260
Yanhui.

94
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Yanhui.

95
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,380
There's nothing to fear about death.

96
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,860
There's truly nothing to fear about death.

97
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,780
I'm not upset at all.

98
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,060
How could you not be upset about it?

99
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,020
I don't want this!

100
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
In the future,

101
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,340
you can lead

102
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
the life you want to lead.

103
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,020
You can have all the buns you like.

104
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,780
You can go wherever you like.

105
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,900
Tianyao!

106
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,020
Why did you do it so quickly?

107
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,020
Tianyao, why did you do it

108
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,020
without any hesitations?

109
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,420
Only by destroying the flower

110
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,900
was I able

111
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,260
to receive

112
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,060
your current embrace.

113
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,060
You...

114
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,860
Stop blaming me.

115
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,220
Stop blaming me, okay?

116
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,420
Tianyao, I won't blame you at all.

117
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,940
I won't blame you.

118
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,020
Don't leave me!

119
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,660
I still wish to have delicious buns

120
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,940
together with you!

121
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,060
I still wish to go...

122
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,020
Tianyao! I know my fault now! Don't leave me behind!

123
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,940
Tianyao!

124
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,260
(Ghostly Eulogy)

125
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,740
(Tianyao, you mustn't destroy the dark flower!)

126
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,860
(Tianyao, you mustn't destroy the dark flower!)

127
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,620
(You mustn't destroy the dark flower!)

128
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,300
(Yanhui.)

129
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,900
(I'm waiting for you.)

130
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,460
Tianyao!

131
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,460
The flower...

132
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,380
The flower...

133
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,420
The flower is gone.

134
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,780
Tianyao!

135
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,140
Tianyao is gone too.

136
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,020
Yanhui.

137
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:33,860
Tianyao?

138
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,940
Tianyao!

139
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,420
I...

140
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,420
I truly fancy you!

141
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,980
I...

142
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,820
I fancy you a lot!

143
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,020
I truly fancy you!

144
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,580
I fell for you before you ripped out

145
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,820
the Heart Protecting Scale from my heart.

146
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,140
After you ripped it out,

147
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,980
although I was afraid of you,

148
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,020
I still fancied you a lot!

149
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:21,702
Ever since you brought me

150
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,740
out of the Royal Palace of Qingqiu, I knew

151
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,620
that I'd helplessly

152
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,820
fallen in love with you!

153
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,980
However,

154
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,620
I can never tell you that in person anymore.

155
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
What should I do?

156
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,660
This is just a dream.

157
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
You can never hear

158
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,220
my confession again.

159
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,420
Will you disappear

160
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,700
once I wake up?

161
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,620
I don't want to wake up!

162
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,020
This isn't a dream.

163
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,700
We're in a dream.

164
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,260
Why are you still lying to me?

165
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,580
I'm truly fine.

166
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
Are you done crying?

167
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,340
If so, it's time to apply the ointment to your wound.

168
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,100
Why are you in my dream as well?

169
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,060
You don't recognize me?

170
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,180
It's only been a few days since we last met each other.

171
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,420
My goodness.

172
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
What are you doing?

173
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,620
Isn't it cold?

174
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,780
Wait, this isn't a dream?

175
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
It really isn't.

176
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,820
Yanhui!

177
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,380
That hurts.

178
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,460
This is great.

179
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,860
This is great!

180
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,140
This is great! You're still alive!

181
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,580
I've made you worry.

183
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,620
He is alive,

184
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,580
but if you don't apply

185
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
the ointment right now,

186
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,540
your hair

187
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,700
might not be able to live.

188
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,300
My hair?

189
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,580
Where did my hair go?

190
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,380
Maybe my Dragon Flame

191
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,060
burnt a part of your hair

192
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,180
when I destroyed the dark aura.

193
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,660
Will love disappear?

194
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,380
It won't.

195
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
It definitely will.

196
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,100
Is this ointment even useful?

197
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,140
Chenyi made this himself.

198
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,340
Let's give it a try first.

199
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,620
Apply a bit more on my head.

200
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,340
Of course.

201
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,100
After all, I think

202
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,380
none of us

203
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,100
has any experience going bald, right?

204
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,300
When did you get here?

205
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,500
Oh, come on.

206
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,859
If I wasn't here to save the day,

207
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,820
the Heart Protecting Scale couldn't even return to your body.

208
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,340
The Heart Protecting Scale?

209
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,900
Did it return to my body again?

210
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,420
The dark flower on your head was already destroyed.

211
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,140
That's how the Heart Protecting Scale could return to you.

212
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,740
You made it as if it was a life-and-death struggle.

213
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,140
Indeed.

214
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,900
I'm still better

215
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,060
at doing such things.

216
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,620
Oh yeah, that works too.

217
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,780
Who else in this world

218
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,900
do you think can possess

219
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,500
both beauty

220
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,380
and brain?

221
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,420
The Heart Protecting Scale is inside your body.

222
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,980
If other people find out,

223
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm afraid

224
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,540
it'll spell trouble for you.

225
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,620
Before this, I didn't know about

226
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,140
your feelings for me.

227
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,620
That's so mushy.

228
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,340
It's best

229
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,660
if I could exchange my life

230
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
for your life in peace.

231
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,500
You...

232
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,380
Shouldn't I be the person

233
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,180
you two should be thankful for?

234
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,300
I flew across the vast sea

235
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,220
and rushed back

236
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,660
in order to save you guys.

237
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,220
All right then. Thank you.

238
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,460
Thank you.

239
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,660
In the end, I still have

240
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,740
to become your matchmaker.

241
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,220
What did you discover when you gave him

242
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,260
the Ghostly Eulogy?

243
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,980
I discovered

244
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,740
the truth.

245
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,700
(He locked me in a water prison.)

246
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,140
(I discovered remnants of his memories)

247
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,580
(when I was trapped underwater in the Dark Phantom Palace.)

248
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,180
(I could see my past)

249
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,340
(from his memories.)

250
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,860
-You crossbreed! -You crossbreed!

251
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,740
What are you doing?

252
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,140
-Get up, crossbreed. -You crossbreed.

253
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,300
You're a crossbreed!

254
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Get up!

255
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,260
You crossbreed!

256
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,260
That hurts!

257
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,860
Let me go!

258
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,020
You crossbreed!

259
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,260
This child is gifted.

260
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,060
He can control his shadow at such a young age.

261
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,540
In time,

262
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,920
he can defeat you without any problem, Elder.

263
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,140
Only the strongest person in our clan can be the clan leader.

264
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,460
It's the survival of the fittest.

265
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,580
Now that the Shadow Clan has given birth to a gifted child like him,

266
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,140
Elder Yingcheng, I don't know

267
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,260
if I should be happy

268
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,700
or sad for you.

269
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,300
Bai Xiaosheng

270
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,900
is the evil child stated in the prophecy.

271
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,019
If he can bully his playmates today,

272
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,060
he can definitely slaughter our village in the future.

273
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,020
If so...

274
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,940
If so, I'll send him somewhere far away.

275
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,020
That won't do.

276
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,140
The Shadow Clan can only avoid calamity

277
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,460
if we offer him to our lord as a sacrifice.

278
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,900
Mother.

279
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,900
Mother?

280
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,660
Sheng.

281
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,700
Mother.

282
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,820
Mother, what's the matter?

283
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,140
Let me go!

284
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,340
Let me go!

285
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,340
A shadow spirit can isolate their body

286
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
from all things in the world.

287
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,940
In order to prevent himself from getting injured by foreign objects,

288
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,740
(he used my true effigy)

289
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
(to create a shadow robe.)

290
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,700
He was jealous of my talent.

291
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
With this shadow robe,

292
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,580
I can restore my body.

293
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,340
And I won't need to worry about

294
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,580
any external injuries again.

295
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,820
(It seems that Dark Phantom was hurt)

296
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,860
(by a master before.)

297
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,660
(He was afraid of his reappearance.)

298
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,100
(That's why he needed)

299
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
(the shadow robe)

300
00:22:13,221 --> 00:22:14,340
(to protect himself.)

301
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,780
(It's a shame that I couldn't see that part of his memory.)

302
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,660
(I didn't know)

303
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,980
(who injured him in the past.)

304
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,940
I did disperse a cloud of dark aura

305
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,380
in the Dragon Valley 20 years ago.

306
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,060
But I didn't know who it was.

307
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,820
I don't know if he was the one I'd injured.

308
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,780
Right now, Dark Phantom

309
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,220
still has your true effigy.

310
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,220
If you come here to see us,

311
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,380
that means he can harm you easily.

312
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,740
He has other plans for me.

313
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,780
If my true effigy perishes,

314
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,180
he will be in trouble too.

315
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,460
However, I can actually

316
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,300
do something to him.

317
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,220
Do what?

318
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,860
I'll seek revenge.

319
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,860
What else do you think I'm going to do?

320
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,900
(It's all thanks to the shadow robe.)

321
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,300
(If not, what happened 20 years ago)

322
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,260
(will happen again.)

323
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,540
(A Millennium Spirit Dragon?)

324
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,460
(If I can extract its inner core and use it to boost my strength, )

325
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,180
(in the future, )

326
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,140
(no Taoist spirit can harm me again.)

327
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,340
(That dark aura seemed strange.)

328
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
(What exactly was it?)

329
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,860
The flame of the Spirit Dragon.

330
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,860
Changlan.

331
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
My Lord.

332
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,700
When can you initiate a war between the Taoists and spirits

333
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,300
for Sanchong Mountain?

334
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,460
The beings of Qingqiu

335
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,780
are all under my spell.

336
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,700
As for Chenxing Mountain's Lingfei,

337
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,300
initially, I wanted to kill her in Qingqiu

338
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,180
to initiate a conflict between the two realms.

339
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,580
But now that I think about it,

340
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,780
I think it's more useful

341
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,180
to keep her alive.

342
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,060
When she returns to her clan,

343
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,460
it'll be the beginning

344
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,140
of the war.

345
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,500
Very good.

346
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,900
You're far superior to Bai Xiaosheng.

347
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,300
My Lord,

348
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,220
regarding Bai Xiaosheng,

349
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,940
I'm afraid he has turned on you.

350
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,500
It doesn't matter.

351
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,140
Just leave him be.

352
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,100
You do look

353
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,900
exactly like Changlan.

354
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,660
You look different

355
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,060
from what Changlan

356
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
had described to me.

357
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,180
Let me do it.

358
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,980
He imprisoned you for many years,

359
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
yet he mentioned me in front of you?

360
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,380
Sometimes, when he holds a discussion with Zhao Yu,

361
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,580
he'll bring up your name.

362
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,100
When my mind's eye was still clear,

363
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,060
I heard of you.

364
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
I guess he said nothing good about me.

365
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,100
Your Majesty,

366
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,900
I came here

367
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,300
because I want to ask you something.

368
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,180
What is it?

369
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,780
I saw you

370
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,940
inside Dark Phantom's mind's eye.

371
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,500
Your Majesty, I wish to know

372
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,500
how exactly

373
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,540
you sealed him away.

374
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,700
Actually,

375
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,700
I didn't seal him away

376
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,700
with my powers alone.

377
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,740
And

378
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,780
he wasn't sealed away

379
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,340
in his mind's eye.

380
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,340
He was sealed within the body

381
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,220
of Master Qingguang of Chenxing Mountain.

382
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,860
Master Qingguang?

383
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,700
He's the founder of my sect.

384
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,180
I thought he was on retreat

385
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,180
in Starhaven?

386
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,580
Back then, in order to stop Dark Phantom

387
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,100
who was causing chaos everywhere,

388
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,780
Xuelin practiced Ghostly Eulogy by herself.

389
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,060
She intended to make herself

390
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,380
the Lord of Dark Aura

391
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,300
and swallow Dark Phantom.

392
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,540
(She intended to end her life)

393
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,420
(at the Obsidian Riverhead after swallowing Dark Phantom.)

394
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,460
(However, Xuelin wasn't able)

395
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,940
(to master the Ghostly Eulogy.)

396
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
(Her body was ruined instead.)

397
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,940
What's wrong?

398
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,140
Are you okay?

399
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,860
Take a sip of this.

400
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,820
(But Dark Phantom kept committing atrocious deeds.)

401
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,620
(We couldn't just allow him to get his way.)

402
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,100
(To Qingguang) (She wrote a letter to Qingguang)

403
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,300
(requesting his help.)

404
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,020
(She intended to seal Dark Phantom away)

405
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,500
(with our combined powers.)

406
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,500
(I prepared a trap in the vast desert.)

407
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,420
(Xuelin built the geomantic compass to absorb the dark aura)

408
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,620
(while Qingguang reinforced my trap.)

409
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,420
Xuelin.

410
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,500
It's been a century since we last met.

411
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,020
You've summoned me again.

412
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,780
Is it because you're willing to return to my side?

413
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,180
Dark Phantom, your dark aura is running rampant.

414
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,260
Innocent people have been hurt.

415
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,860
I can't just let you

416
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,900
keep this up.

417
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,940
I haven't found a way

418
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,500
to disperse the dark aura.

419
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,420
Now,

420
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,020
I can only seal you away temporarily.

421
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,580
Xuelin,

422
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,140
you lied to me!

423
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,740
Xuelin.

424
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,300
I didn't expect you to call me here

425
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,940
just to seal me away!

426
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,580
You lied to me!

427
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,100
You lied to me!

428
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,900
Xuelin!

429
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,980
Polars of Qiankun!

430
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,820
So, the vision I saw

431
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,140
when I was inside the geomantic compass was...

432
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,300
Qingguang

433
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,940
used his body as a vessel

434
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,100
to seal Dark Phantom away.

435
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,140
And the injuries

436
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,260
Xuelin had sustained back then

437
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,580
exhausted her life force entirely.

438
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,220
After she passed away,

439
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,300
I followed her wish

440
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,300
and sealed the Ghostly Eulogy

441
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,780
within the screen.

442
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
However, even when she was on her last breath,

443
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,220
she still couldn't figure out

444
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,980
how to get rid of the dark aura.

445
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,140
She only knew

446
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,100
that one could manipulate the dark aura and cause it to implode

447
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,580
if one mastered the Ghostly Eulogy.

448
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,220
As for Qingguang,

449
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,540
once he returned to Chenxing Mountain,

450
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,700
he focused all of his efforts

451
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,300
to suppress Dark Phantom, which was in his body.

452
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,020
Twenty years later,

453
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,259
I found out

454
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,540
that he had sealed himself away completely.

455
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,140
He sealed himself within Starhaven.

456
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,740
I assume this has something to do

457
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,980
with Dark Phantom.

458
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,180
So Lingxiao

459
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,220
visited Starhaven every year

460
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,220
in order to help Master Qingguang reinforce his seal.

461
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,300
All these years,

462
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,900
I've been trying to find a way

463
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,620
to get rid of the dark aura.

464
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,460
After fifteen years,

465
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,860
I finally invented

466
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,860
a spell

467
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,460
that could curb the dark aura.

468
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,740
However, I never expected Changlan

469
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,020
to become Dark Phantom's follower.

470
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,660
He even mastered visual spells.

471
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,540
Fifteen years ago?

472
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,060
Wasn't that the year

473
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,860
Changlan offered the Phantom Clan to Dark Phantom as a sacrifice

474
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
and opened a portal

475
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,940
to Dark Phantom's mind's eye?

476
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,340
Fifteen years ago.

477
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,100
When Dark Phantom was trapped

478
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,660
within Starhaven,

479
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,020
I regained freedom

480
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,940
temporarily.

481
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,140
Back then,

482
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,220
I tried to search for him in his mind's eye.

483
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,860
However, I never found him.

484
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,180
Until fifteen years ago,

485
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,740
he suddenly returned

486
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,300
and told me to meet our new ally.

487
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,900
His name was Changlan.

488
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,540
This useless twin son

489
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,820
was actually his hope

490
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,300
of turning the tides.

491
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,580
Your Majesty,

492
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,700
didn't the brush sprite say

493
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,060
that the second twin son of the royalty of Qingqiu

494
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,580
should be

495
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,860
imprisoned?

496
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,100
So, how did he manage to escape?

497
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,460
Also, how did he

498
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,220
end up being

499
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,500
Dark Phantom's trusted aide?

500
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,100
Regarding that, we need to talk about

501
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,460
what happened long ago.

502
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,460
Although we were twins,

503
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
I never knew about

504
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,540
his existence

505
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,540
for many years.

506
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,420
After that, when the late king passed away,

507
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,780
Zhao Yu told me

508
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,740
that he couldn't bear to see Changlan suffer any longer.

509
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,220
Only then did I find out

510
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,020
that I had a younger brother.

511
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,260
Back then,

512
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,140
Xuelin and I just got married.

513
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,180
After our discussion,

514
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,500
we decided

515
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,300
to release Changlan

516
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,420
from the dungeon forever.

517
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,980
But he told me

518
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,500
that he didn't want to stay in Qingqiu.

519
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,660
I could understand why.

520
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Thus, I allowed him to leave.

521
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,780
After that, I found out

522
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,060
that he had gone to Luochuan Dragon Valley

523
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,700
and had been living there.

524
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,820
I heard that he had a good life when he was living in the valley.

525
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,660
If so, how did he

526
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,020
end up like this?

527
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,540
Speaking of which, he could be considered an old friend of yours.

528
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
Why did he attack you too?

529
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,020
Changlan,

530
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,300
when he first came to Luochuan Dragon Valley,

531
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,060
he wasn't someone who would do something terrible like this.

532
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,220
My Flaming Dragon Fang

533
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,820
contained his blessings too.

534
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,940
Could it be

535
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
that you met Suying at the time?

536
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,660
Back then,

537
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,860
he did tell me

538
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,940
not to trust Suying easily.

539
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,780
But I didn't listen to him.

540
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,020
He might have left the valley

541
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,740
out of disappointment.

542
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,980
After that,

543
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,420
we never met each other again.

544
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,540
No matter

545
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,740
what he became after that,

546
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,900
right now, he's trying

547
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,700
to collect

548
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
violent and evil aura in the world

549
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,260
to make him stronger.

550
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,060
Violent and evil aura?

551
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,260
What is that? How does one collect it?

552
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,300
By leading people to commit evil deeds and initiate wars.

553
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,660
If we wish to stop Dark Phantom

554
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,260
from returning to this world,

555
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
our first step

556
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,740
is to stop Changlan.

557
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,340
If so, we need to return to

558
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,580
the Royal Palace of Qingqiu immediately.

559
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,900
Now that I think about it,

560
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,540
everything Changlan did

561
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,940
was aimed at initiating the war

562
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,700
between the Taoists and spirits

563
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,700
so that he could set the Lord of Dark Aura free.

564
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
We have to bring His Majesty

565
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
back to Qingqiu

566
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,860
to expose his evil plots.

567
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,380
Lingfei said Changlan wanted to assassinate her.

568
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,260
Once she returns to her base,

569
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,100
she'll definitely gather her troops and prepare for battle.

570
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,580
A disaster is coming.

571
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,220
And the Heart Protecting Scale

572
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,180
just returned to your body.

573
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,900
You still need to rest and recuperate.

574
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,140
You need to rest and recuperate too.

575
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,220
Elder Lingfei!

576
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,860
What are you laughing at?

577
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,820
You look pretty funny

578
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,860
in that getup.

579
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,100
Actually, it hasn't been too long

580
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,140
since I left.

581
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,260
However, I was thinking about you

582
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,900
all the time.

583
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,180
I've truly

584
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,660
fallen for you.

585
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,020
What about you?

586
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,460
Did you miss me?

587
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,660
I wouldn't have fallen for you

588
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,260
had I known you were this heartless back then.

589
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,860
Bai Xiaosheng...

590
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,820
Are you sure you don't want to consider me at all?

591
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,620
No.

592
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,060
Fine. I admit.

593
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,060
Tianyao

594
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,660
is pretty good.

595
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,380
You can come to me anytime

596
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,580
once you guys have broken up.

597
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,020
I'll definitely reserve a spot

598
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,940
for you.

599
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,420
It's getting late.

600
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,460
You should head back and rest.

601
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,380
No thanks.

602
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,500
I'm here to bid farewell.

603
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Bid farewell? Won't you come with us

604
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,500
to the Royal Palace of Qingqiu?

605
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,460
I'm going

606
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,620
to seal away the entrance

607
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,580
to Dark Phantom's mind's eye

608
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,900
and stop him from contacting Changlan.

609
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,180
By then, it'll be easier

610
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,340
for you guys to deal with Changlan

611
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,500
in Qingqiu.

612
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,260
Are you heading there alone?

613
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,980
Nope, there are two of us.

614
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,020
Two?

615
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,060
It's me

616
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,420
and you, which I keep in my heart.

617
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,780
It's getting late.

618
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,100
I won't waste your time.

619
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,260
See you.

620
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,140
That was quick.

621
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,500
Yanhui.

622
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,860
Tianyao!

623
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,220
I made you a tiara.

624
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,220
I wonder if you like it.

625
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,460
It's so nice.

626
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,620
This tiara

627
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,660
can cover the bald spot on my head.

628
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,500
I like it!

629
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,140
Let me help you put it on then.

630
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,500
These eyes of mine,

631
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,060
which have seen through countless relationships,

632
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,140
have never failed me indeed.

633
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,780
Tianyao,

634
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,620
within the Taoist clan...

635
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,540
Only husbands

636
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,300
can comb the hair of their wives, right?

637
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
If so, you...

638
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,980
We are married, aren't we?

639
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,660
We notified our kin

640
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,340
when we were in Tongluo Village.

641
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,420
We announced our marriage to the world

642
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,380
in the main hall of Qingqiu.

643
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,460
Yanhui,

644
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,900
do you know something?

645
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,140
You were already my wife

646
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,340
when I gave you the nuptial agreement.

647
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,740
If so, you better keep your word.

648
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,340
I will.

649
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,500
I put my seal on it.

650
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,300
It's decided for life then.

651
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,340
See you.
