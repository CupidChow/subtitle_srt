00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,660
for the one you loved in the past.

193
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,090
Such obsession

194
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,540
is the one not worthy.

195
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,850
(I use this arrow to cast a spell.)

196
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,570
(Suying can never)

197
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,020
(take our child's life again.)

198
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,570
(I'm coming to you.)

199
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,300
(You won't blame me, right?)

200
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,940
Father.

201
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:57,660
Father!

202
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,260
Zhuli!

203
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,330
Why are you the one who lives?

204
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,140
Why?

205
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,570
I know I owe the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan of Qingqiu

206
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,140
too much.

207
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,090
Even if I die, I won't be able to repay your kindness.

208
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,810
As His Majesty had said,

209
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,810
I may be able to restrain Suying.

210
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,730
I'm willing to use my life

211
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,090
to fight against Suying.

212
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,780
Now is not the time

213
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
to say these things.

214
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,180
She almost caught up with us.

215
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,210
Enter my ring...

216
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,570
Phantom spirit?

217
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,300
I thought phantom spirits

218
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,780
had long gone.

219
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,380
Running into you shows heaven is on my side.

220
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,660
Suying!

221
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,060
Zhuli!

222
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,540
If you want to kill him,

223
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,970
you must kill me first.

224
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,570
Are you going to kill yourself again?

225
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,900
Don't hurt me

226
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,060
by hurting yourself.

227
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,180
Both of you

228
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,780
must return to Guanghan Sect with me.

229
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,940
The Great Leader of Qingqiu has passed away,

230
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:16,090
and there will never be
another full moon in Qingqiu!

231
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,370
[Suying Declared War On Qingqiu.]
Chenyi died.

232
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,220
[The Great Leader has fallen.]
Chenyi died.

233
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,980
Lu Musheng,

234
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,300
Zhuli,

235
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,060
and Huan Xiaoyan's

236
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,580
whereabouts are unknown.

237
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,250
Lu Musheng is weak.

238
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,610
Suying must have taken him

239
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,610
back to Guanghan Sect.

240
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,730
But

241
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,850
why did she capture Huan Xiaoyan?

242
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,010
We can only

243
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,940
ask her.

244
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,100
We can settle

245
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,490
old and new scores

246
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,770
with her all together.

247
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,090
What are you doing?

248
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,700
Lu Musheng,

249
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,490
your life force

250
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,900
is getting weaker and weaker.

251
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,040
I must save you.

252
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,810
The Phantom Clan

253
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,420
has the ability to absorb human memories.

254
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,050
I'll use her

255
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,180
to refine your memories

256
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,570
into a spiritual bead

257
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,810
and bury it in the mythical land.

258
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,140
This way,

259
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,610
we can reconstruct your body,

260
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,570
and you can

261
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,420
live forever.

262
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,330
Even death

263
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,900
can't take you away

264
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,770
from me.

265
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,250
You're mad.

266
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,330
I don't want to live.

267
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,010
And I don't need you to save me.

268
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,380
You were not that heartless

269
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,050
to me.

270
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,180
If you didn't leave behind

271
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,730
the life extension bangle I gave you,

272
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,530
I wouldn't have woken up.

273
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,220
It was you who saved me.

274
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,050
Dragon King.

275
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,700
Yanhui.

276
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,250
Suying killed my father

277
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,900
and abducted Huan Xiaoyan.

278
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,860
I'm going to fight her to death!

279
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,460
Don't stop me!

280
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,700
I know you hate her very much.

281
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,530
But it's not the time

282
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,620
to be reckless with your life.

283
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,980
Rescuing Xiaoyan is the priority.

284
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,860
What about Suying?

285
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,090
We'll split up.

286
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,700
We'll deal

287
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,460
with Suying.

288
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,770
(Yanhui and I will launch
a fake attack on Guanghan Sect)

289
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,050
(to attract Suying's attention)

290
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,010
(and lure her to us.)

291
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,420
(If we can hold on)

292
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,530
(for one hour,)

293
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,490
(you'll have a chance to save Huan Xiaoyan.)

294
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,700
(Yanhui.)

295
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,530
(Dragon King.)

296
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,180
(You must be careful.)

297
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,860
(Suying)

298
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,250
(is a complete lunatic now.)

299
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,250
It's the evil dragon!

300
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,810
The evil dragon is here!

301
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,530
He actually takes advantage and attacks us

302
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,620
when the Sect Leader is concocting
pills of immortality.

303
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,900
I may not have any more loved ones in this world.

304
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,420
But as long as I have these memories,

305
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,730
I can always have you.

306
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,620
Perfect timing.

307
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,460
Is the commotion not big enough?

308
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,490
Then let's make it even bigger
until she has no choice but to come.

309
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,180
We'll do as you say.

310
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,660
Blood as a sacrifice,

311
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,770
gods as guides,

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,380
malevolent spirits,

313
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,980
hear my call!

314
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,620
By my dragon consciousness

315
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,050
I summon the flames of the Eight Directions!

316
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,810
Tianyao,

317
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,420
what's wrong?

318
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,050
Dragon heart.

319
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,620
It's the dragon heart's aura.

320
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,860
Ignorant fools.

321
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,050
It's been 20 years.

322
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,530
I'm seeing this formation again.

323
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,660
This is

324
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,050
the formation that Suying used to seal you.

325
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,570
Yanhui,

326
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,220
this formation

327
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,660
has a suppressing effect on me.

328
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,250
Are you afraid?

329
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,810
Never.

330
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,010
Your Highness.

331
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,050
Is Miss Huan Xiaoyan all right?

332
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,620
She lost her spiritual power

333
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,620
and is still unconscious.

334
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,980
Since you have woken up,

335
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,330
come with us...

336
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,700
Where are you going?

337
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,010
My dragon heart is under her feet.

338
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,140
I'm going to the eye of the formation
to pull out the sword.

339
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,810
You take this opportunity
to summon Flaming Dragon Fang.

340
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,530
Then...

341
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,330
Level the Guanghan Sect

342
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,730
and retrieve the dragon heart.

343
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,810
You resurrected the evil dragon.

344
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,770
You led Su'e astray.

345
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,220
You even cultivate Dark Phantom techniques

346
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,420
and betray the Taoist clan.

347
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,900
These crimes are enough

348
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,770
for you to die ten thousand times over.

349
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,660
Whether I live or die,

350
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,250
it's not for you to decide.

351
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,220
You can't wait to kill me, huh?

352
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,900
Twenty years ago, you couldn't do it.

353
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,900
And now, it's still the same.

354
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,860
Do you hate me that much?

355
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,570
If I crush this spiritual bead,

356
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,140
you'll never be able

357
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,570
to control me again.

358
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,700

00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,170
so...

476
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,010
You've recovered?

477
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,010
So you remember everything?

478
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,380
With the dragon heart back in its place,

479
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,260
you have finally

480
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,210
got your whole body back.

481
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,780
The dragon heart

482
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,170
was infused into my body by Suying.

483
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,340
Then,

484
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,940
Yanhui disappeared
after she turned into the dark aura.

485
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,740
Tianyao!

486
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,740
Move aside!

487
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,260
Why

488
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,170
did she turn

489
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,340
into the dark aura and dissipate?

490
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,650
Because dragons and the dark aura
are incompatible.

491
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,090
I regained my whole body,

492
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,780
and my strength enhanced

493
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,010

494
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,820
Perhaps

495
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,050
it has injured Yanhui.

496
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,260
Then she...

497
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,130
The dark aura seeks benefits and avoids harm.

498
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,740
It'll definitely send her
