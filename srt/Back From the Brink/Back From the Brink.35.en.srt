00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 35)

3
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,300
(Tongluo Village)

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,440
Tongluo Village

5
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
is the place

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,910
where we first met each other.

7
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,190
Back then, you lived here.

8
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,670
You were Madam Xiao's grandson.

9
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,270
Madam Xiao?

10
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,470
We'll reach

11
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,910
Xiao's Residence soon.

12
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go.

13
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,830
(Why are the crops here)

14
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,240
(doing much worse than before?)

15
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,150
(Were they affected by something?)

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,800
It's nothing.

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,710
Who are you guys?

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,919
What are you guys doing in our village?

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,240
Who are you guys?

20
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,920
What are you guys doing here?

21
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,710
Who's there?

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,590
Who is it?

23
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,319
So, it's Fu

24
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
and his wife.

25
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,110
What are you guys doing?

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,320
What's wrong with you guys?

27
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,549
This is Fu and his wife.

28
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,390
Put down your tools.

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,920
Put them down.

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,590
So,

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,480
Fu.

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Fu's wife?

33
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,760
Fu.

34
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,320
Do you remember me?

35
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,390
It's me, your aunt!

36
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,080
Don't be scared.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Do you remember him?

38
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:02,703
Do you?

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,360
It's me!

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Aunt?

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,830
This is bad.

42
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,760
He...

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,870
Did he become an idiot again?

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,670
Aunt,

45
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,800
you're still around?

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,240
Hey!

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,989
Lass,

48
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,110
mind your words!

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,710
I...

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm not dead.

51
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,759
Look at Fu.

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,429
He was fine before this.

53
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,479
He became an idiot again after the trip.

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,640
This shouldn't be.

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,590
Aunt,

56
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,640
you...

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,710
Come on!

58
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,670
Make way!

59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,100
(For Lease)

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,960
Come on.

61
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,960
It's Fu indeed.

62
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,760
Hurry and check out your house!

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,520
I thought he left the village?

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,390
What is he doing here again?

65
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,200
Come on!

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
After the old madam passed away,

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
and after you guys left,

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,240
I came here

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,079
to clean up the house often.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,149
I was thinking

71
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,549
that you guys could live here

72
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,079
if you guys came back one day.

73
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,320
I also

74
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,830
reared the chickens for you guys.

75
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,990
I didn't take them!

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,520
But,

77
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,430
the eggs, I was afraid

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,640
that they might go bad.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,390
That's why I took some.

80
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,520
That's right.

81
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,550
You see,

82
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,639
these vegetables are freshly harvested.

83
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,240
I'll prepare

84
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
a welcoming dinner

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,960
for you two tonight.

86
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,120
-Thank you. -That's right.

87
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,150
By the way,

88
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,229
since you guys have returned,

89
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,390
you guys shouldn't simply wander around.

90
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,759
For some reason,

91
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,789
our neighboring village

92
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,790
became hostile toward us.

93
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,439
They often assault

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,390
our villagers.

95
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,200
That's why

96
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
we were hostile to you guys.

97
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,000
Became hostile?

98
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,150
(It sounded like)

99
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,120
(the symptoms I exhibited)

100
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,199
(when the dark aura)

101
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
(first infiltrated my mind's eye.)

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,350
(It seems like)

103
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
(I need to conduct an investigation.)

104
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,150
Yanhui,

105
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,079
we'll go and prepare dinner.

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,150
You guys should join us for dinner.

107
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,230
No need for that.

108
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,350
Huh?

109
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,230
You don't want to join us?

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,960
If so, you guys can...

111
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,440
They don't want to join us?

112
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,350
You guys can help yourselves then.

113
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,960
We'll make a move first.

114
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:51,910
Let's leave.

115
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,960
Let's leave.

116
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,910
Go now.

117
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,230
Let's go.

118
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,640
What are you staring at?

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,640
What are you doing? Let's get back to work.

120
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,120
What's wrong?

121
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,960
Did you recall something?

122
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,910
But I made a discovery.

123
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,520
There are no chickens here.

124
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,829
I'll go and catch one for you.

125
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,960
I'll roast it for you tonight.

126
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,960
I won't let you scald your hands again.

127
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,960
Okay.

128
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,560
Get up.

129
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,520
Look.

130
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,120
This is the woodshed.

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,830
Why did you wipe your blood on me?

132
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
You were the one who bit me first.

133
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,390
You!

134
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,120
In the past,

135
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,520
I slept on the bed.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,790
You slept on the floor.

137
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,680
This is where we slept.

138
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,590
Do you remember anything?

139
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,120
It's fine.

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,560
That's right.

141
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,760
There's also this bed.

142
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,030
When we got married,

143
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,000
we did this.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,230
I thought you were a snake spirit.

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,559
I engaged you in a battle of wits.

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,710
I tried to subdue you.

147
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,710
What are you laughing at?

148
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,200
You...

149
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,829
Why would you think

150
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,790
that I was a snake spirit?

151
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,440
Also,

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,150
why aren't you using any strength

153
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,230
if you were planning

154
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,830
to subdue me?

155
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,960
This is just an act.

156
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,030
And

157
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,150
that was the first time

158
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,080
we reached a consensus.

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,269
We even worked together

160
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,230
and achieved something huge.

161
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,000
How is it?

162
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,150
Did you recall anything?

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,910
It's fine.

164
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,680
There's no rush.

165
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,520
Take your time.

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,680
You can stay here

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
for now.

168
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,470
I need to head outside.

169
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,470
Let me tag along.

170
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,470
You'll be fine.

171
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,350
I'll be around Tongluo Village.

172
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,150
You can

173
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,469
stay home and try to recall the past.

174
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,120
Maybe you'll recall something by then.

175
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,080
Come back early.

176
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,880
Okay.

177
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,080
I'll be back soon.

178
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,030
I thought I tied you up?

179
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,760
You think you can tie me up

180
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,910
with those ropes?

181
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:41,990
I...

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,280
I was so fierce.

183
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,710
It was the dark aura indeed.

184
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,680
Pearl.

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Pearly.

186
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,110
Pearl.

187
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,710
Swine? (♪homophone)

188
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
What swine?

189
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Pearl.

190
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,470
Pearly.

191
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,630
Master Qiyun of Qiyun Monastery?

192
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
This...

193
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,510
This must be fake.

194
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,280
Pearl.

195
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,590
Excuse me...

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,800
Excuse me.

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,350
You scoundrel!

198
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,040
You're shameless!

199
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,110
You're an idiot!

200
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Ma'am,

201
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,560
I never offended you before.

202
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,510
You're shameless!

203
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,870
You're shameless!

204
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,440
You're shameless!

205
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,510
Pearl.

206
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,830
Cha!

207
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,920
Cha!

208
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,470
A few decades ago,

209
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,160
several of my clansmen and I

210
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,920
departed for the Central Plains from Sanchong Mountain for cultivation purposes.

211
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,750
But we encountered

212
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,400
several Taoists on our way.

213
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,680
She saved me.

214
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,159
Initially, she was someone

215
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,320
who lived above the clouds.

216
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,439
Don't tell me

217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,630
you're Miss Yun?

218
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,750
What are you doing here alone?

219
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,630
Where's Cha?

220
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,350
Cha?

221
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,040
Forget it.

222
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,920
You should return with me first.

223
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,990
Pearly...

224
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
Your hands are so cold.

225
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,960
So, you're still affected by the cold disease?

226
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,710
Pearly...

227
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,560
Swine?

228
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,160
Swine?

229
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,990
What swine?

230
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,510
You mean a mountain boar?

231
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,160
Or a wild boar?

232
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,080
The Flame Orb.

233
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,160
The Flame Orb!

234
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,110
The Flame Orb was here just a second ago.

235
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,160
Where did it go?

236
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,830
The Flame Orb?

237
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,680
Miss Yun,

238
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,440
the Flame Orb should be nearby.

239
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,990
Let's search for it together.

240
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,590
Yanhui?

241
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,160
Where's Yanhui?

242
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't break my door.

243
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,750
Your attacks have no intention behind them.

244
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,960
You won't be able to hurt anyone with them.

245
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,750
Pearly...

246
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,440
Pearly...

247
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,280
Since I retrieved the Flame Orb for you,

248
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,510
you should stop cursing me out.

249
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
When you release your technique,

250
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,080
you must maintain your breath.

251
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,280
Stabilize your lower body.

252
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,350
The formed

253
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,590
is born formless.

254
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,470
It's born from nothing,

255
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:08,560
and it belongs to nothing.

256
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,440
He's a better teacher than me.

257
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,230
He's a better teacher than me.

258
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,439
One's breathing

259
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,870
is fundamental for a technique.

260
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,960
To you,

261
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,470
you can learn faster if you practice it.

262
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,350
I don't need you to teach me.

263
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,320
Yanhui will teach me

264
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,680
those things when she comes back.

265
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,590
So,

266
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,080
I brought someone back.

267
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Who is she?

268
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,990
Pearly...

269
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,960
Pearly...

270
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,830
Master Qiyun?

271
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,350
She's so laid-back.

272
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,040
She fell asleep right after laying on the bed.

273
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,680
Did you find anything?

274
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,589
She was struck by the Frost Blossom Technique.

275
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,680
Frost Blossom Technique?

276
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,750
Only the sect leader of Chenxing Mountain can use that technique.

277
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,589
Master Qiyun went missing

278
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,800
20 years ago.

279
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,990
Back then,

280
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,800
I haven't learned the Frost Blossom Technique yet.

281
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,920
20 years ago?

282
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Cha said

283
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,280
he encountered Qiyun

284
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,400
20 years ago too.

285
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,510
The time frame does seem reasonable.

286
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,590
I think my master

287
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:41,830
cast that technique.

288
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,510
You mean Master Qingguang?

289
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,400
What exactly happened

290
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:45,590
20 years ago?

291
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,230
Maybe

292
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:49,959
we'll only learn the truth

293
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,800
after Master Qiyun

294
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,350
is back in her right mind.

295
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,230
It's a shame

296
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,230
that I can't dispel

297
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,800
my master's technique.

298
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,350
Was she struck

299
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
by

300
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,110
Water magic?

301
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,830
Yes.

302
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,680
I can get rid of the water spell

303
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,109
with my fire.

304
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,160
I'll save her.

305
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,079
Master Qingguang is a Taoist grandmaster.

306
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,279
You were just reborn not long ago.

307
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,560
It's normal for you to be lacking in spiritual power.

308
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,750
Do not be discouraged.

309
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,040
How can I recover my spiritual power quickly?

310
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,080
About that,

311
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,040
I might be...

312
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,830
Please teach me.

313
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,750
All right.

314
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,620
I...

315
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,100
He's the Millennium Spirit Dragon indeed.

316
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,620
He's exceptionally gifted.

317
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,660
Tianyao is regaining his spiritual power very fast.

318
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
He tried to attack you without knowing what was going on.

319
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,300
I'll apologize to you on his behalf.

320
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,500
Yanhui.

321
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
There's one thing.

322
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,180
There's one thing

323
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,700
I shouldn't have hidden from you.

324
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,820
What is it?

325
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,580
Ten years ago,

326
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,260
I brought you back to Chenxing Mountain

327
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,980
outside Luochuan Dragon Valley.

328
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,460
Master,

329
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,700
this girl

330
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,060
possesses the spirit dragon's Heart Protecting Scale.

331
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:52,980
You sealed away

332
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,220
the power of the Heart Protecting Scale?

333
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
Lingxiao,

334
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,380
if, one day,

335
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,940
the seal on the Heart Protecting Scale behaves erratically,

336
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,300
chase this girl

337
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,500
out of the mountain immediately.

338
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,700
(That was)

339
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,260
(Master's last order.)

340
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,100
After that,

341
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,620
Master never opened his eyes

342
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,820
for the next ten years.

343
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,940
So, Master Qingguang

344
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,060
sealed away the power of my Heart Protecting Scale.

345
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,540
And it was his order

346
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,340
to chase me out of the mountain too.

347
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,140
But...

348
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,940
But why did he do so?

349
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,740
Maybe

350
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
it was because

351
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:32,500
Dark Phantom wanted to destroy the Heart Protecting Scale.

352
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,340
The spirit dragon and Dark Phantom counter each other.

353
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,339
Tianyao's Millennium Inner Core

354
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,540
is inside the Heart Protecting Scale too.

355
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,020
I'm sure he wants to destroy it.

356
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,700
Back then,

357
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,540
Tianyao retrieved his Heart Protecting Scale.

358
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,260
The seal in your heart was broken.

359
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,500
I went after you,

360
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,860
and I went into the Misty Forest.

361
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,860
I entered Dark Phantom Palace

362
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,700
by accident.

363
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,340
Lingxiao.

364
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,420
Master?

365
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,500
Destroy the Heart Protecting Scale.

366
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,900
The Heart Protecting Scale?

367
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,859
Dark Phantom intends to use the power of the Heart Protecting Scale

368
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,340
to break his seal.

369
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,860
If you destroy it,

370
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,380
nothing can boost Dark Phantom's power anymore.

371
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,020
Promise me.

372
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,180
Promise me!

373
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,460
I only found out

374
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,820
that it was Dark Phantom's plot after that.

375
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,340
Master

376
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:30,860
was long gone.

377
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,940
(Right now, only Dark Phantom)

378
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,260
(remains in Starhaven.)

379
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,140
I was used by him.

380
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,020
I almost committed an unforgivable mistake.

381
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,260
I used the Soul-Annihilating Whip on you

382
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,900
at the Fallen Star Platform.

383
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,620
It was my fault.

384
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,140
I understand

385
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,060
what's going on now.

386
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,620
But I'm afraid

387
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,540
I still can't forgive you.

388
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,540
I don't expect you to forgive me.

389
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,420
Apply the ointment

390
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,380
twice per day.

391
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,980
Tianyao?

392
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,460
Tianyao,

393
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,020
what's wrong?

394
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,180
I'm upset.

395
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
But why?

396
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,220
I don't know.

397
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,460
I'm upset

398
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
that you gave him the ointment.

399
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,099
So, our baby spirit dragon

400
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,380
is jealous.

401
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,540
I want it too.

402
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,500
What do you want?

403
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,420
The ointment.

404
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,460
Are you hurt?

405
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,100
I...

406
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,780
Fine.

407
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,820
Next time,

408
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:15,860
we'll deliver it to him together,

409
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,500
-okay? -No.

410
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,940
I'll deliver it to him alone.

411
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,860
All right.

412
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,740
Tianyao is the best.

413
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,060
Don't be angry, okay?

414
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,580
Enough already.

415
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,700
Tianyao,

416
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
don't be angry,

417
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,500
okay?

418
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,740
Tianyao.

419
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,340
Stop being angry,

420
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,700
okay?

421
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,620
What's going on out there?

422
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
What's going on?

423
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,540
I don't know.

424
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
Goodness. What's going on?

425
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,380
Why is this...

426
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,740
Let's check out the village.

427
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,739
What's wrong

428
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,860
with all these monsters?

429
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,860
Run for your life!

430
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,460
Help!

431
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,180
What's wrong with them?

432
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,460
Cha?

433
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,860
We can talk about it later.

434
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,700
We have to save them first.

435
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,060
They've lost their minds!

436
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,220
What exactly is going on?

437
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,140
They were fine yesterday!

438
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,860
Why are they

439
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,100
attacking us now?

440
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,460
That was terrifying!

441
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,620
It must be

442
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,700
because of

443
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,540
the dark aura.

444
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,540
They were infected by the dark aura.

445
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,780
Cha is infected too.

446
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,660
We have to save them.

447
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,060
(My dark aura)

448
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,420
(is being absorbed?)

449
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,220
Yanhui, watch out!

450
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,580
Tianyao,

451
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,180
your dragon fire counters the dark aura.

452
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,820
Disperse the dark aura source first.

453
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,659
(I never expected this spirit dragon)

454
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,980
(to recover this quickly.)

455
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,140
(They're still surrounded by the dark aura.)

456
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,780
I will absorb it with the geomantic compass.

457
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,020
It can't absorb

458
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,220
all of their dark aurae!

459
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,820
No!

460
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,380
They're normal civilians.

461
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:00,620
They cannot withstand dragon fire.

462
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,739
We need to get rid of the dark aura

463
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,540
without hurting them!

464
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,819
I can absorb

465
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,940
Dark Phantom's dark aura indeed.

466
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,380
Yanhui,

467
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,300
are you okay?

468
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
I feel

469
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,940
great.

470
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,060
You can absorb Dark Phantom's dark aura

471
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,660
and control them?

472
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,100
I can control it

473
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,940
at ease.

474
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,140
Master...

475
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,140
Master!

476
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,020
Master,

477
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,659
this Yanhui is a freak too!

478
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,220
Get rid of her!

479
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,140
Yeah, Master!

480
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,779
She knows dark magic!

481
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,940
She's terrifying!

482
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,540
That's right!

483
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:01,859
I'm begging you guys!

484
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,460
Please let us off!

485
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,299
Just let us leave!

486
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,379
Get rid of the demoness!

487
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
She's too terrifying!

488
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:09,980
We don't wish

489
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,380
to stay here with her!

490
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,460
She just saved you guys!

491
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,860
We don't need a monster to save us!

492
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,100
Chase her out!

493
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,900
There's no need to explain ourselves.

494
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,900
Chase the monster out!

495
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,700
Tell the monster to leave!

496
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,139
We don't need her to save us!

497
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,740
Chase her out!

498
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,940
If she's a monster,

499
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,740
I will be a monster's master.

500
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,019
If so, the entire Chenxing Mountain

501
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,380
will be a monster's sect.

502
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,660
If you don't want her to protect you all,

503
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,100
from now on,

504
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,500
Chenxing Mountain will stop protecting you all.

505
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,660
What...

506
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,100
How can he say this?

507
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,700
Let's go.

508
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,860
Master!

509
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,260
How did it end up like this?

510
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,740
Don't leave!

511
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,980
Don't leave us!

512
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,380
Master!

513
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,420
Don't leave us!

514
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,340
You mustn't abandon us!

515
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,660
Cha.

516
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,380
Yanhui.

517
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:06,980
Here.

518
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,820
Get up.

519
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,500
These are people

520
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:16,660
from the neighboring village.

521
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,420
They're already cured of their illness.

522
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,420
Find a place

523
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,579
and help them to settle down.

524
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,780
Wait for their family members to fetch them.

525
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,220
Okay.

526
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,300
(Tongluo Village)

527
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,140
How's Tianyao?

528
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,660
He over-exhausted himself.

529
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,580
He's asleep now.

530
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,180
He did a lot today.

531
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,220
I assume he must've exhausted

532
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,980
the spiritual power he gathered.

533
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,980
Great timing.

534
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,500
I have something to ask you.

535
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,540
Why did you

536
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,500
defend me just now?

537
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,060
You were my student for ten years.

538
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,260
I couldn't bear

539
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,060
to see you suffer.

540
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,420
When you whipped me

541
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,420
at the Fallen Star Platform,

542
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,019
I thought you forsook me

543
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,300
when you had to choose

544
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,700
between the great path of the Taoism

545
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,220
and your disciple.

546
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,060
I didn't forsake you.

547
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,380
I divided 81 strokes

548
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,620
into nine days.

549
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,900
I did so to keep you alive.

550
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,620
You wanted everything.

551
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,540
That's right.

552
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,700
The sect,

553
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,500
the beings,

554
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,740
and my relationships,

555
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,260
which one do you think I should forsake?

556
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,140
You have to shoulder so many burdens.

557
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,540
Aren't you exhausted?

558
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,500
Were you happy during your ten years

559
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,580
in Chenxing Mountain?

560
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,420
Yanhui,

561
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,220
do you dislike Chenxing Mountain?

562
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,500
That's not it.

563
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,500
Chenxing Mountain is great.

564
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,940
It's much better than living down the mountain.

565
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,220
The stars are bright up here.

566
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,940
The clothes are warm too.

567
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,780
And the food is great.

568
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,260
I can swallow eight baozi in one go.

569
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,060
Look closely.

570
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,740
You can try

571
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,020
to gather the surrounding spiritual power.

572
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,860
Again.

573
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,060
Yanhui.

574
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,340
Zichen?

575
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,660
You brought baozi?

576
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,260
That's right.

577
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,940
Here, have one.

578
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,140
Here, have some water.

579
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,780
Hit me if you can!

580
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,460
You can't hit me!

581
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,660
Stop it!

582
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:07,780
Don't think that I don't dare to hit you!

583
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,860
You can't do anything about it!

584
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,979
Enough! Stop gathering around!

585
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,420
How dare you kick me?

586
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:11,460
-Stop arguing! -You can't hit me!

587
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,740
What are you guys doing?

588
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Do you guys want to rebel?

589
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,420
Ziyue!

590
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,820
How could you speak to Yanhui in such a manner?

591
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,860
Yanhui,

592
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,940
must you cause trouble

593
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:21,020
when I'm not around?

594
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,579
She irritated me first.

595
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,380
What are you guys looking at?

596
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,980
Stop gathering around!

597
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,700
Master,

598
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
you wanted to see me?

599
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,380
Have you been happy lately?

600
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,500
Yeah.

601
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,900
Did you not cause any trouble?

602
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,940
I did not.

603
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,980
I'm going on a retreat.

604
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,180
If you have any doubts while I'm away,

605
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,380
go to your eldest senior.

606
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,380
You know that he dotes on you the most.

607
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,340
Okay.

608
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,619
Master, will you come out of your retreat after one month,

609
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,260
just like before?

610
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,980
That will be the case

611
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,460
if there's no accident.

612
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,460
I know what you're thinking.

613
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,179
Cultivation is the training of the heart.

614
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,980
Magic techniques are but worldly possessions.

615
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,580
Only by staying true to one's heart

616
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,380
will you be able to grasp the nature of cultivation.

617
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,020
Do not force yourself

618
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,500
to master spiritual power and magic techniques.

619
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,900
I'm not forcing myself.

620
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,220
But I'm still a one-star disciple.

621
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,179
I'm still a one-star disciple

622
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,460
even after the trial.

623
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,300
I'm always stuck at one star.

624
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,180
But I always trained harder

625
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,140
than any of them.

626
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,499
They even mocked me

627
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,780
and said that I embarrassed you.

628
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,340
All because of your star?

629
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,660
They mocked you because of that?

630
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,380
What's wrong with being a one-star disciple?

631
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,140
You didn't embarrass me.

632
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,379
You have your own strength.

633
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,740
Really? What is it?

634
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,940
You're true to yourself.

635
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,780
Master,

636
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,100
what does that mean?

637
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,180
You enjoy the sky

638
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
and embrace the moon with your heart.

639
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,860
Yanhui,

640
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
do you understand now?

641
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,220
I was pretty happy back then.

642
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,300
It's difficult enough

643
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,020
to protect a person.

644
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,060
I'm sure it's even more difficult

645
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,740
to protect a sect.

646
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,780
Although it's arduous,

647
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,460
it's worth it.
