1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 3)

3
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,980
(What's this?)

4
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,300
(It's her blood.)

5
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,500
Get up!

6
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,220
Get away from me!

7
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:20,216
So tell me.

8
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,376
Why did you bite me last night?

9
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:25,776
Previously,

10
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,656
I had not passed my tribulation.

11
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:29,296
So I've been suffering from pain until this day.

12
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:30,496
For the past ten years,

13
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,736
I've been suffering from excruciating pain

14
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:35,216
when there is a full moon.

15
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:38,096
Blood from a Taoist

16
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:40,016
can alleviate the pain a little.

17
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,415
You have no evidence to prove what you said.

18
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,296
I can't tell if you're telling the truth.

19
00:02:44,856 --> 00:02:45,696
We should find a way

20
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:46,616
to get out of here.

21
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:49,336
You're the Millennium Spirit Dragon, right?

22
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,216
Even if you have no spiritual power,

23
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,056
I'm sure you know

24
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:53,096
about some ancient formations, right?

25
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:54,096
Seriously?

26
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,855
Can this snake spirit's formation

27
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:56,816
trap you?

28
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,536
If I took you away from here,

29
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:01,296
would you do me a favor?

30
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:02,696
What is it?

31
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:05,896
There was no Flame Orb

32
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:07,056
stolen by the snake spirit

33
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,016
in the barrier we went to before.

34
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,496
But it has an object

35
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:10,616
that can help me relieve

36
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:11,856
my sufferings

37
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,176
during the full moon.

38
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
I want to take you with me.

39
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:17,736
I see.

40
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:19,855
We're not in a hurry to see Madam Xiao,

41
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:20,496
right?

42
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,495
When we left home yesterday,

43
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,056
we were supposed to catch some chickens.

44
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,056
But now,

45
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,176
we neither caught a chicken

46
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,296
nor made it home.

47
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:32,176
I'm sure Madam Xiao is worried.

48
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:33,896
Aren't you worried?

49
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:37,696
That figures.

50
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,016
You're her fake grandson.

51
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,295
Even the tenderness you showed her

52
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,536
was also fake.

53
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:43,736
Since you're not in a rush,

54
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,096
I'm not in a rush, either.

55
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,176
It's time

56
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:48,776
for you to fulfill your promise.

57
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,216
Fulfill?

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,336
Promise?

59
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:57,696
Snake spirit,

60
00:03:57,776 --> 00:03:58,976
let me give you a piece of advice.

61
00:03:59,096 --> 00:03:59,736
This man

62
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,615
has lied to me many times.

63
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,175
Before you let him fulfill his promise,

64
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,455
do you want to reconsider this matter?

65
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:05,696
I can give up my life

66
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,376
as long as I can save Yun's life.

67
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,176
You're indeed a monster obsessed with love.

68
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:10,976
I must take her to enter the barrier with me.

69
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:12,855
How dare you try to take advantage of me again!

70
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:13,696
I'm not going.

71
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:14,936
But...

72
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:20,696
Didn't you come here

73
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,176
for these?

74
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,136
It's all yours now.

75
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:23,976
So come with us.

76
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:32,976
My conscience suddenly got the better of me.

77
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:33,736
Let's go.

78
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,096
We're here.

79
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,896
This barrier sure is powerful.

80
00:04:58,576 --> 00:04:59,856
This formation relies mainly on water.

81
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,296
You can use water magic

82
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,256
to break the barrier.

83
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:18,536
There's a spell on the barrier.

84
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:19,976
Watch out!

85
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,415
This formation is protected by the Five Elements Seal.

86
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,775
But such a formation is used

87
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:30,856
to seal something evil.

88
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,816
What exactly is in the barrier?

89
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:35,856
Something that can save me,

90
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:36,936
that's all.

91
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,376
(He said he's a dragon.)

92
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:40,816
(Could it be a lie?)

93
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:46,976
Go inside now.

94
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:48,096
I can't hold on for too long

95
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,296
with my spiritual power.

96
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:50,696
Let's go.

97
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,296
Follow my steps.

98
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,016
Have you been here?

99
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:07,616
I dreamed about it.

100
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,136
The thing you want to obtain

101
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,376
is under this formation.

102
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,536
This formation is so powerful.

103
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:06,336
The person who set this formation

104
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:07,336
should be one of the best

105
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:08,536
among the Taoist clans.

106
00:07:13,936 --> 00:07:16,056
I heard the dragon was killed

107
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,976
by Master Suying 20 years ago.

108
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,136
It has nothing to do with you.

109
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:24,456
Looks like it's true.

110
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,135
What kind of love-hate relationship

111
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:27,736
between you and Master Suying have

112
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,456
that she had to use such cruel means on you?

113
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,576
Do you really want to know?

114
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,816
Twenty years ago,

115
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,256
I fell in love with Suying.

116
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,455
I was willing to sacrifice

117
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:42,736
everything I had as a spirit for her,

118
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,176
including my longevity,

119
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,056
cultivation,

120
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:46,376
and responsibilities.

121
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,376
But it was a shame

122
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:51,216
that what I wanted to give

123
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,376
was not what she wanted.

124
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:54,976
She deceived

125
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,096
and hurt me

126
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,256
just to make dragon-scale armor

127
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:00,096
for the one she loves.

128
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,856
So she could save the one she gave her heart to.

129
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,696
You're not lying to me again, are you?

130
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,936
Dragon-scale armor can save lives?

131
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:10,296
A dragon

132
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,536
is invincible to all things.

133
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,336
Armor made

134
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,696
from dragon scales

135
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,416
gives people longevity.

136
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:20,416
I didn't know that.

137
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,136
She decided to take

138
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,256
what she wanted from me herself.

139
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,616
At Snow Peak

140
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:44,456
on the night of the full moon,

141
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:47,256
she held her long sword

142
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,136
and killed me.

143
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:09,376
Like what I'm doing right now.

144
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:32,496
You

145
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:36,656
did everything to trick me into the formation

146
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:38,376
just

147
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,136
to kill me.

148
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,456
I don't have the intention of killing you.

149
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,216
How can you deny it

150
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,696
when you already tried to kill me?

151
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,416
I need to use your Heart Blood

152
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,816
to break this formation.

153
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,616
You're trying to use

154
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:33,336
the blood of a Taoist

155
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:35,416
as a sacrifice for the formation.

156
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:39,616
I won't do it

157
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:41,536
for other reasons today.

158
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,536
But I'll kill you

159
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:45,616
for stabbing me with this sword!

160
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,296
Can you stop causing trouble?

161
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:17,416
You'll be safe with the Heart Protecting Scale.

162
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:24,456
Again?

163
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:28,616
You stabbed me once.

164
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:30,615
Now, you're doing it the second time.

165
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:31,576
We're running out of time!

166
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:33,055
Only your Heart Blood

167
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:34,056
can break the barrier.

168
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:17,216
The dragon bone!

169
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,536
Luckily, I have a healthy body

170
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:52,176
from eating and sleeping well.

171
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,936
That's how I managed to take two strikes.

172
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,816
That hateful Millennium Evil Dragon.

173
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,416
How dare he plots against me.

174
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:06,656
Stop right there.

175
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,016
What's your problem?

176
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,375
Since you managed to leave the formation,

177
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:10,696
why are you...

178
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:11,376
I want to kill him!

179
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:11,896
Hey!

180
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:12,736
Get away!

181
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:13,656
Stop it!

182
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:14,496
What are you doing?

183
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,136
Don't get in my way!

184
00:14:15,136 --> 00:14:15,696
Move aside!

185
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:16,216
He tried to kill me.

186
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,016
Shouldn't I kill him for that?

187
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:17,896
You can't kill him!

188
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,336
Listen.

189
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:21,536
He retrieved what he wanted.

190
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:22,656
I can finally recognize

191
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,536
his scent.

192
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,935
He was the Spirit Dragon, Tianyao,

193
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:25,696
who protected the creatures

194
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:26,656
in Luochuan Dragon Valley

195
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:27,536
twenty years ago.

196
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,136
He's the Dragon King of the Spirit Clan.

197
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:30,736
If he's the Dragon King,

198
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,696
he can definitely

199
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:32,656
repair the Flame Orb.

200
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:33,776
Yun is waiting for me

201
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:34,736
to save her.

202
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:36,656
I have to go now.

203
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,216
I don't care if he's a dragon.

204
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:45,736
After we save her,

205
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:47,696
I'll cut him into pieces.

206
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:01,336
His injury came into contact with water.

207
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,016
His wound seemed to have opened up.

208
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,936
Could something bad happen to him?

209
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:07,256
He'll live.

210
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:08,496
He's the Millennium Evil Dragon.

211
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,736
He looks like

212
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:10,736
he's still harboring a lot of resentment.

213
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:12,296
Just ignore him.

214
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,775
Do you have dry clothes?

215
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:14,856
It doesn't matter if they are men's clothes.

216
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:16,255
My clothes are sticky and wet.

217
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:17,216
I can't stand it anymore.

218
00:15:18,176 --> 00:15:19,335
Yes, I'll get them for you.

219
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:19,816
Wait here.

220
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:24,856
You better don't hurt him!

221
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:26,216
I need him to save someone's life!

222
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,776
(You'll be safe with the Heart Protecting Scale.)

223
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,696
(What did he mean?)

224
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:34,295
(Guanghan Sect)

225
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,056
Leader,

226
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,216
the formation that sealed the dragon bone

227
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:37,136
has been broken.

228
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:42,776
I've ordered

229
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:43,936
the Guanghan Sect's disciples

230
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:45,856
to guard the remaining formations that seal the dragon's limbs.

231
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:48,616
Do you have news on the Heart Protecting Scale's whereabouts?

232
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:49,976
(Immortal Yunmeng of Guanghan Sect)

233
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:50,976
Forgive me for my incompetence.

234
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:52,496
We still have no clue.

235
00:15:53,136 --> 00:15:53,896
However,

236
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,095
Elder Lingfei of Chenxing Mountain

237
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:56,496
has caught the nine-tailed fox.

238
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:00,656
There was someone with the fox spirit.

239
00:16:01,096 --> 00:16:02,656
It was Demon-suppressing General Lu.

240
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,776
Lu Musheng.

241
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:09,376
Bring him here.

242
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:10,576
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:38,296
Your needlework is pretty exquisite.

244
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,336
Well, practice makes perfect.

245
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:40,416
All these years,

246
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,416
Yun had been unconscious after she was severely wounded.

247
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,496
I've been taking care of her.

248
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,096
You treat her really well.

249
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,416
She saved me once.

250
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:47,456
How did you two meet?

251
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:52,616
Well, it wasn't anything special.

252
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:54,536
Several decades ago,

253
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:55,936
a few clansmen of mine and I

254
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,616
traveled from Sanchong Mountain to the Central Plain for our cultivation.

255
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:00,096
Unfortunately,

256
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:01,736
we ran into several Taoist disciples.

257
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,896
To avoid their pursuit,

258
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,456
I got separated from my clansmen

259
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:06,936
and got lost in the barren mountain.

260
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:09,936
According to the age of the Spirit Clan,

261
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,656
I was eight

262
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,016
that year.

263
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:16,135
That snake spirit has low cultivation.

264
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,016
He can't run far.

265
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:21,615
Leader Qiyun,

266
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:22,376
we were going after a snake spirit

267
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,096
who snuck into the Central Plain.

268
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:24,096
Have you seen him?

269
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,256
He went that way.

270
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,496
Thank you, Leader Qiyun.

271
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:31,056
Let's head out.

272
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:34,616
You can come out now.

273
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:37,576
Next time,

274
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,096
find a bigger branch.

275
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:41,656
Immortal.

276
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,096
(Master Qiyun, Leader of Qiyun Monastery)

277
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:48,816
You're pretty brave

278
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:50,736
as a spirit with low cultivation.

279
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,336
Immortal, can you be kind enough

280
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:54,136
and save my life?

281
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,456
Please send me home, Immortal.

282
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,255
I'll definitely repay you

283
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:00,456
your kindness.

284
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:04,816
Do you know.

285
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,096
I'm from a Taoist clan?

286
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:14,056
All right.

287
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:15,816
Come with me.

288
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:22,175
(Not only did she not mind)

289
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,296
(that I'm from the Spirit Clan, )

290
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,736
(but she also saved me.)

291
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:28,016
After that,

292
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,016
she sent me

293
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:30,376
somewhere nearby Spirit City

294
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:32,376
and let me return to the southwest alone.

295
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,016
Until this day,

296
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:35,376
I still remember

297
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,896
the flowers in the air and the warm breeze along the way.

298
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,296
So, was that

299
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,496
how you fell in love with her?

300
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,816
Oh, no! Not at all.

301
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,976
I didn't... I was...

302
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:49,816
I dare not.

303
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,176
But

304
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,576
she saved my life back then.

305
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:54,776
Now, I'm willing to repay her with my life.

306
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:58,456
The Taoist and Spirit Clans are at odds now.

307
00:18:58,616 --> 00:18:59,896
After helping her for so many years,

308
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:00,936
I'm sure you won't be able

309
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:01,576
to return to your clansmen.

310
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:02,376
It doesn't matter.

311
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:04,176
I only want to save her.

312
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:08,096
Then...

313
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,376
What if she doesn't want to be with you

314
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,016
after she regains consciousness?

315
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:16,496
She was someone

316
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:18,096
who originally stood on the misty mountain.

317
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:19,816
As for me,

318
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,776
I'll be satisfied as long as I can give her

319
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,816
what she wants.

320
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:28,656
You sure are one of a kind spirit

321
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:30,616
who's obsessed with love.

322
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,415
Then I wish

323
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,256
both of you well.

324
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:34,896
You...

325
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,776
You even gave me your blessing.

326
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,456
You're also

327
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,456
one of a kind Taoist.

328
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:47,416
It won't end well.

329
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:53,256
You can repay her kindness.

330
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:54,096
Don't think

331
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,616
about anything else.

332
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:56,456
Are you...

333
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:57,976
Are you feeling better now?

334
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,495
Since you're awake,

335
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,856
don't waste time and do what you need.

336
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,176
One with the dragon soul.

337
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:14,776
Hearken to me, the scorching flame.

338
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:18,496
Fuse!

339
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,216
Go and save her. Travel by water.

340
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,016
There are fewer Taoists, so it'll be safer.

341
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:37,136
Thank you, Your Majesty.

342
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,136
Yun is saved.

343
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,296
I'll be on my way.

344
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:43,736
Now,

345
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:45,376
it's time to settle scores.

346
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:46,376
Tell me.

347
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:47,856
Why did you try to kill me?

348
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:53,456
I never had the intention to take your life.

349
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:54,816
To retrieve the dragon bone,

350
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:56,656
I must use your Heart Blood

351
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:57,736
to break the seal.

352
00:20:58,496 --> 00:20:59,616
That's something new.

353
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:00,936
You need my Heart Blood

354
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:02,096
to retrieve the dragon bone?

355
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:03,256
It's true.

356
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:04,856
Your body

357
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:07,456
possesses my Heart Protecting Scale.

358
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:11,256
Heart Protecting Scale?

359
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:12,776
What's that?

360
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:15,616
Twenty years ago,

361
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:18,776
Suying failed to make the dragon-scale armor.

362
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:20,896
Do you know why?

363
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,056
How am I supposed to know?

364
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:23,816
Because

365
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,736
to make dragon-scale armor,

366
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:28,256
the most important thing

367
00:21:28,257 --> 00:21:29,456
is the Heart Protecting Scale,

368
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:30,856
which I hurled into the sky.

369
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:32,416
What?

370
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,216
(When Suying ripped out my dragon scales, )

371
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,256
(I used all that was left of my cultivation)

372
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:41,656
(to draw out the Heart Protecting Scale)

373
00:21:41,657 --> 00:21:43,136
(from the barrier of the formation.)

374
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:47,456
Your plot

375
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:50,136
is a wasted effort!

376
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:56,216
Without the Heart Protecting Scale,

377
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,376
that dragon-scale armor

378
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:00,496
is useless.

379
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:04,256
So 20 years ago,

380
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,896
none of you

381
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:07,176
got anything

382
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:08,016
after fighting all day.

383
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,976
But it saved your life.

384
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:15,136
I found out after checking your pulse.

385
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,735
(You were born with a weak heart.)

386
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:17,176
What are you doing?

387
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:17,616
Did you try to enter my mind's eye?

388
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:18,616
(You weren't supposed to live this long.)

389
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:19,696
You have yet to unlock your mind's eye.

390
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:21,975
But you've skipped and jumped about

391
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,096
until now.

392
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:24,576
That's because

393
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:25,976
my Heart Protecting Scale

394
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:27,616
has been protecting you.

395
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,016
(Come to think of it, )

396
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:33,735
(the blast I set off)

397
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:34,736
(in Chenxing Mountain)

398
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:36,856
(was because of his Heart Protecting Scale.)

399
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,816
If that's true,

400
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,136
why didn't you tell me earlier?

401
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,416
Someone who fears death like you,

402
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:47,456
you would have run off

403
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,616
if I told you.

404
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,336
Then why are you willing to tell me now?

405
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:56,736
Don't...

406
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,896
Don't tell me you want to take it back.

407
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:02,416
The Heart Protecting Scale

408
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:03,656
is only a scale to me.

409
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:05,896
It doesn't matter if I don't take it back.

410
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:08,136
But...

411
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,215
You're planning to blackmail me,

412
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:10,495
so I'll accompany you to retrieve

413
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,336
your limbs that were sealed in four directions.

414
00:23:12,696 --> 00:23:13,336
Can't you?

415
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:14,376
No.

416
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:15,656
By favor,

417
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:16,696
I may owe you for acquiring

418
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:17,735
this Heart Protecting Scale by accident.

419
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:18,416
But

420
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:19,176
you've used me

421
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:20,456
to retrieve the dragon bone

422
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,775
by stabbing me twice in the chest.

423
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:22,416
So

424
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,896
I've already paid this favor, anyway.

425
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:25,296
By reason,

426
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:26,735
you're someone who explains after you act.

427
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,055
If you could take your Heart Protecting Scale back,

428
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:29,136
you would have taken it back.

429
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:30,096
You didn't take it back

430
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:31,416
because you can't take it back.

431
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,616
Since you can't take it back,

432
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:34,376
I won't be able to give it back to you, anyway.

433
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:35,935
After I settle one last thing

434
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,816
in Tongluo Village,

435
00:23:36,817 --> 00:23:38,536
it would be best if we have nothing to do with each other.

436
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,576
Where are you going?

437
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:42,296
Catch some chickens!

438
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:54,496
Grandma!

439
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,376
Grandma!

440
00:23:58,256 --> 00:23:59,096
Grandma.

441
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:00,816
Grandma.

442
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:02,616
Grandma, we're home.

443
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:04,456
Grandma?

444
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:06,536
Grandma.

445
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,376
What's wrong?

446
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,096
You're back.

447
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:09,856
You're...

448
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:10,856
You're home.

449
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,176
Grandma, I'm here.

450
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:15,456
I'm glad you're back.

451
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:17,776
I'm glad you're back.

452
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:18,736
Grandma,

453
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,455
we caught many chickens

454
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:21,736
and got many eggs, too.

455
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,056
Next time,

456
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,576
you can eat them without worries anymore.

457
00:24:24,736 --> 00:24:25,776
Grandma, look.

458
00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:27,256
Granddaughter-in-law,

459
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:30,056
let's eat first.

460
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,576
A table is full of dishes.

461
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,576
Full of dishes.

462
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:41,576
Here come the eggs.

463
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:43,455
After staying in Tongluo Village for so long,

464
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:44,616
I finally got to eat some meat.

465
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:45,856
Grandma, look at these dishes.

466
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:47,736
We have eggs and chicken.

467
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,015
I'll peel the egg for you.

468
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:49,696
Would you like that?

469
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,016
Grandma, here.

470
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:15,136
Such a blessing.

471
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:17,975
How fortunate.

472
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,456
Grandma, have some meat.

473
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:20,736
Fu,

474
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,496
you're lucky.

475
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:30,216
When you're together,

476
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,776
don't fight.

477
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:34,816
When you're together,

478
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:37,416
don't fight.

479
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:40,976
All right.

480
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:42,096
Grandma,

481
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:44,176
we won't fight.

482
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:52,696
Grandma?

483
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:00,776
Grandma,

484
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:02,736
how can you sleep while sitting?

485
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:20,736
Grandma,

486
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:22,376
lie down and sleep.

487
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:24,816
Grandma?

488
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:28,336
Come.

489
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:30,136
Lie down and sleep.

490
00:26:53,096 --> 00:26:53,776
Grandma.

491
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,496
What's wrong with Grandma?

492
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:05,096
Grandma...

493
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:10,656
She's gone.

494
00:27:24,816 --> 00:27:25,976
It turned out.

495
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:31,856
Grandma had been waiting for us

496
00:27:33,456 --> 00:27:35,136
to have a last meal with her.

497
00:27:45,656 --> 00:27:48,936
(The Virtuous Madam Xiao's Soul-guiding Flag)

498
00:27:54,616 --> 00:28:06,936
(Tomb of Old Madam Xiao)

499
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:20,976
(One Hundred Thousand Taels)

500
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:24,096
What's this?

501
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,576
Shouldn't we burn joss paper

502
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,256
at this time?

503
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:28,736
I made you some.

504
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:30,056
Why don't you offer them for Grandma?

505
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:32,656
Will Yama accept this?

506
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:33,976
Yes.

507
00:28:42,016 --> 00:28:43,376
I'll burn it, then.

508
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:16,376
On the day of the full moon,

509
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:19,896
Grandma wanted me to go home early.

510
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,736
She knew I would be in pain.

511
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,296
She also knew.

512
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:28,416
I wasn't Fu.

513
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:35,296
She knew everything.

514
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,456
But

515
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,096
she still treated me as her grandson.

516
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:10,576
(Spirits of heaven and earth, )

517
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:14,496
(I'm Tianyao, the Spirit Dragon.)

518
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:18,736
I fell into the hands of the enemy many years ago

519
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:21,736
and left with a strand of my dragon soul.

520
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,816
When I was vulnerable and helpless,

521
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:28,576
(I was fortunate to be cared for by Old Madam Xiao until this day.)

522
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,216
I'm greatly indebted to her

523
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:34,056
and unable to repay her kindness.

524
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:48,576
After I've found my body,

525
00:30:49,696 --> 00:30:51,296
I'm willing to protect Tongluo Village

526
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:53,376
to make it peaceful for hundreds of years.

527
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:30,456
When you speak the truth,

528
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:32,416
you do look like a dragon.

529
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,416
You can say we were fated to meet.

530
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:35,536
After we bid farewell tomorrow,

531
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:36,696
let's not meet again.

532
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,376
I'll drink with you.

533
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:45,856
That was good.

534
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:47,536
Again.

535
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:50,536
I didn't know

536
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:52,376
a Millennium Evil Dragon like you

537
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,616
could be this unrestrained.

538
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,096
Let's drink!

539
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,136
When I carried you back to Tongluo Village,

540
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:10,136
you called "Master" again and again

541
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:11,776
when you were unconscious.

542
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:14,296
Who's your master?

543
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:17,616
The Leader of Chenxing Mountain,

544
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:18,976
Lingxiao.

545
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:20,736
But he's not

546
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:22,216
my master anymore.

547
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:24,016
I

548
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,976
was kicked out of the sect.

549
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:28,776
Why?

550
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,936
Because.

551
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,616
I disrespected the elders,

552
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:35,256
behaved recklessly,

553
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,256
and injured the sect's fellow disciples.

554
00:32:38,576 --> 00:32:40,256
I'm sure that the elder

555
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:42,456
must have done something unreasonable.

556
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:44,976
How did you know that?

557
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,496
You may look fierce.

558
00:32:50,496 --> 00:32:52,056
But you're not unreasonable.

559
00:32:53,936 --> 00:32:54,536
You speak

560
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:55,856
as if you know me well.

561
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:02,416
Is your master

562
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:04,216
really important to you?

563
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:05,576
Of course, he is.

564
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:08,456
I wandered in the street for ten years

565
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,496
since I was a kid.

566
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:11,736
It was my master

567
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:13,015
who brought me back to Chenxing Mountain.

568
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:14,176
He fed me.

569
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:16,656
He taught me to read

570
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,376
and be good.

571
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,896
Enough of him.

572
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:23,176
Let's not talk about me.

573
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:25,616
Take a look at yourself.

574
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:27,336
You look shabby.

575
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:29,136
If you told people

576
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:29,936
you were

577
00:33:30,096 --> 00:33:31,576
a dragon that has lived over time

578
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:33,336
for a thousand years,

579
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:35,496
who would believe you?

580
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,056
No one would believe me.

581
00:33:41,216 --> 00:33:43,135
What kind of tribulation have you experienced

582
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:45,536
that you ended up like this?

583
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,856
(The one I love)

584
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,736
ripped my dragon scales,

585
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:08,976
gouged my dragon heart,

586
00:34:09,456 --> 00:34:10,736
(chopped off my dragon horns, )

587
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:12,216
(pulled out my dragon veins, )

588
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,376
(took apart my dragon bones, )

589
00:34:15,296 --> 00:34:16,696
(shackled my soul, )

590
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,136
dismembered and scattered my limbs in all directions,

591
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:21,176
and restrained me

592
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:24,696
forever and ever.

593
00:34:26,136 --> 00:34:28,016
I want you dead!

594
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:41,336
From that day on,

595
00:34:43,136 --> 00:34:45,016
(I was no longer the carefree)

596
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:47,416
(and powerful Spirit Dragon.)

597
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:49,856
(But I've become)

598
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,336
(a useless dragon without his dragon bones)

599
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:53,976
(who lost all his cultivation.)

600
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:10,696
That's too cruel.

601
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:15,696
It was such a terrible thing that happened to you.

602
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:22,816
I'll be here.

603
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,896
I'll definitely get justice for you.

604
00:35:26,496 --> 00:35:27,576
About your body parts,

605
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:29,056
I

606
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:30,856
will help you find them all.

607
00:35:37,456 --> 00:35:38,136
(From now on, )

608
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:39,976
(your problem will be my problem.)

609
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:42,456
(I'll go wherever you go.)

610
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:44,056
(Let's drink.)

611
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:50,696
But

612
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:54,256
how are you still alive

613
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:57,936
after she dismembered you?

614
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,496
I live so I can meet you.

615
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:43,736
You're up.

616
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,536
(Lu Musheng)

617
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,256
You're at Guanghan Sect.

618
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:58,776
Do you remember this place?

619
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,536
I used dragon scales

620
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,176
to make this armor for you.

621
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:15,296
You could have had a longer life.

622
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:17,816
But it's a pity

623
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:19,496
that it still lacks Heart Protecting Scale.

624
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:21,856
But even so,

625
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:23,576
it can still spare you

626
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,336
the sufferings from illnesses.

627
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:28,656
Don't worry.

628
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:30,856
I've cast

629
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:32,616
a magic spell on it.

630
00:37:33,216 --> 00:37:34,096
No one

631
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:38,016
can undo it

632
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:40,496
unless I die.

633
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,216
Where's my wife?

634
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:51,936
I've imprisoned

635
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,176
that fox spirit.

636
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,536
Immortal, you've got it wrong.

637
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,495
She's not a fox spirit.

638
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:00,296
She's a human.

639
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,816
She's my wife.

640
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,936
Release her quickly.

641
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:09,376
It's been 20 years.

642
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,696
I've been looking for you for 20 years.

643
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:19,935
I didn't do that

644
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:20,896
to see you like this.

645
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:25,216
I don't know you.

646
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:27,576
You've mistaken me for someone else.

647
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,216
I don't recall

648
00:38:29,216 --> 00:38:30,056
having any conflicts

649
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,416
with Guanghan Sect.

650
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:34,376
Mistaken?

651
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:38,456
How could I possibly be mistaken?

652
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:44,776
Back then,

653
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:46,176
I had a hard time subduing the spirit.

654
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,656
You came to rescue me

655
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:49,096
and were injured by that evil spirit.

656
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:50,576
Look.

657
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:53,576
This scar is the proof.

658
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:57,256
Trust me.

659
00:38:58,296 --> 00:38:59,696
What... What are you talking about?

660
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:02,696
I've never met you before.

661
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:10,536
It's all that fox spirit's fault.

662
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:12,496
She's not a fox spirit.

663
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,016
She's a human.

664
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,456
She would never harm me.

665
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:19,016
You can't even tell between humans and spirits.

666
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:20,776
Lu Musheng,

667
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,696
look at yourself.

668
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,136
It's a disgrace

669
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,016
to the reputation of the Mortal Realm's Demon-suppressing General Lu!

670
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:37,096
I'm just a scholar,

671
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:39,336
not the Demon-suppressing General Lu.

672
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:41,616
Now,

673
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:43,296
I only want to take my wife home.

674
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:54,536
You see it this way

675
00:39:56,016 --> 00:39:57,776
because you've completely forgotten the past.

676
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,536
Even if we had an encounter

677
00:40:03,936 --> 00:40:05,015
twenty years ago,

678
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:06,296
as you've said,

679
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:09,816
this fate had ended.

680
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:12,776
You're an Immortal Cultivator.

681
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:15,336
You should know

682
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:16,896
no one can go against the law of heaven.

683
00:40:17,856 --> 00:40:19,216
Why don't you let it go?

684
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:21,096
So it'll be best for both of us.

685
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,336
It can also be considered to fulfill a destiny.

686
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:26,496
Destiny?

687
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:36,976
Once you remember the past,

688
00:40:37,856 --> 00:40:39,736
you wouldn't say such a thing.

689
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:13,336
(It's my chance.)

690
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:16,016
(I should leave while he's still drunk.)

691
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:23,015
With this bag of golden beans,

692
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,215
I don't have to worry

693
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:25,176
about expenses to Yongzhou.

694
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,576
I wonder if Xiange misses me.

695
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:36,616
Sword riding, fly!

696
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:37,536
Soar!

697
00:41:42,256 --> 00:41:43,656
Sword riding, fly!

698
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:44,496
Soar!

699
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:52,216
Without unlocking the mind's eye to store spiritual power,

700
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:54,656
I can't even ride a wooden stick.

701
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,976
How long will it take to reach Yongzhou on foot?

702
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:00,456
Where are you going?

703
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:11,976
Where I'm going

704
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:12,976
is none of your concern.

705
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:14,056
Yesterday, you promised me

706
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:15,216
you would go wherever

707
00:42:15,217 --> 00:42:16,256
I wanted to go.

708
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:18,176
Where did I promise

709
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,376
to accompany you yesterday?

710
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:25,936
Don't worry.

711
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:27,576
I'll be here.

712
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,136
I'll definitely get justice

713
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,736
for you.

714
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:33,656
Do you remember it now?

715
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:34,976
Yeah.

716
00:42:35,696 --> 00:42:36,496
I'm a little confused.

717
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:37,616
If you don't remember,

718
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:38,935
I don't mind repeating what you said.

719
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:39,776
No, it's all right.

720
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:42,536
I do remember it.

721
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:44,496
But I'm sorry.

722
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:45,696
I can't help you.

723
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,096
You can't blame me for being heartless.

724
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,456
I have no choice in this.

725
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,655
I may be kicked out of Chenxing Mountain.

726
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:52,015
But I'm still a Taoist.

727
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:53,375
In the future, I need to make a living

728
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:54,616
by getting rid of spirits on the Bounty List.

729
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:55,975
It would be no problem to help

730
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:56,536
other spirits.

731
00:42:56,656 --> 00:42:57,376
But

732
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,136
you're the Millennium Spirit Dragon.

733
00:42:59,256 --> 00:43:00,176
If I help you,

734
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,655
it's equal to betraying my Taoist clan's honor.

735
00:43:01,656 --> 00:43:02,456
When that happens,

736
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,176
all the Taoists will come after me.

737
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:05,736
So, what should I do if that happens?

738
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:08,216
I'm

739
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,855
just a nobody

740
00:43:09,856 --> 00:43:11,736
who has no ambition.

741
00:43:11,896 --> 00:43:13,695
I lost my parents when I was a kid.

742
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:14,856
I even lived as a beggar.

743
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:16,255
I don't want

744
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:17,695
to live a hard life anymore.

745
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:18,616
I can imagine

746
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:19,336
how difficult my life would be

747
00:43:19,337 --> 00:43:20,496
if I were to help you.

748
00:43:23,656 --> 00:43:25,135
The Taoist and Spirit Clans

749
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:26,816
are at odds.

750
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:28,136
Master Suying

751
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:29,496
was indeed vicious.

752
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:30,616
But maybe...

753
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:35,136
I just want to spend the rest of my life

754
00:43:35,496 --> 00:43:37,535
without worrying about food and drink

755
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:38,816
and live free from worries.

756
00:43:39,056 --> 00:43:40,216
It's no doubt dangerous

757
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,936
to help you.

758
00:43:43,056 --> 00:43:44,296
So this is...

759
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:47,376
She may be cruel to you.

760
00:43:47,696 --> 00:43:48,696
But from the Taoists'

761
00:43:48,697 --> 00:43:49,856
point of view,

762
00:43:49,976 --> 00:43:52,855
there must be a lot of Taoists

763
00:43:52,856 --> 00:43:54,136
who applaud her.

764
00:43:58,296 --> 00:43:59,856
Do you think this is funny?

765
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:02,055
If the Heart Protecting Scale

766
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,215
is on my body, as you said,

767
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:04,375
you'll stab me whenever you want

768
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:05,616
to break the seal.

769
00:44:05,736 --> 00:44:06,336
That

770
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:07,695
isn't anything

771
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:09,096
anyone can endure, right?

772
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:10,096
Besides,

773
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:11,256
no one knows

774
00:44:11,256 --> 00:44:12,216
how many pieces Master Suying cut off.

775
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:13,535
How long will it take to find them all?

776
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:15,215
Dragon horns, dragon heart, and dragon veins.

777
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:16,296
We only have three places to go.

778
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:19,536
I think it's better

779
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:20,776
that we bid farewell now.

780
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:21,776
Farewell.

781
00:44:25,616 --> 00:44:27,136
Aren't you afraid I might make you suffer excruciating pain

782
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:29,216
by activating the Heart Protecting Scale?

783
00:44:34,016 --> 00:44:34,736
I'm too timid and cowardly

784
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:36,256
to take on the responsibility

785
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,416
of helping you.

786
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:39,776
I will consider the pain caused

787
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:41,295
by the Heart Protecting Scale

788
00:44:41,296 --> 00:44:42,056
to be the price for living longer.

789
00:44:42,176 --> 00:44:43,136
If I die,

790
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:45,096
the Heart Protecting Scale will no longer work.

791
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,576
You won't be able to live, either.

792
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:54,696
Can you decide

793
00:44:55,216 --> 00:44:56,176
on your life and death

794
00:44:56,177 --> 00:44:57,336
at this moment?

795
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:01,456
As you said,

796
00:45:01,816 --> 00:45:03,416
Master Suying sealed you

797
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,456
instead of killing you

798
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:05,936
because she wanted you to live.

799
00:45:06,096 --> 00:45:07,816
She doesn't want the power of the dragon-scale armor to dissipate.

800
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:09,896
So the person she loves can live forever.

801
00:45:10,536 --> 00:45:11,536
I don't think

802
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:15,216
you have the right to die, right?

803
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:20,136
Take care.

804
00:45:22,016 --> 00:45:23,416
I admit I have no right to die.

805
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,496
But it's easy

806
00:45:25,816 --> 00:45:26,856
if Suying wants you dead.

807
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:28,296
Along the way,

808
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:29,376
I heard Master Suying seemed

809
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:30,536
to have found

810
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:32,016
her missing lover.

811
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:34,016
She searched for so many years

812
00:45:34,016 --> 00:45:34,896
and finally found him.

813
00:45:36,336 --> 00:45:37,216
This time,

814
00:45:37,976 --> 00:45:38,896
she would want

815
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:40,176
to seek eternal life for him even more.

816
00:45:40,856 --> 00:45:41,776
Perhaps

817
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:42,776
she has already started looking

818
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:43,896
for the missing Heart Protecting Scale.

819
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:47,896
Without the Heart Protecting Scale,

820
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:49,856
you'll die within three days.

821
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:51,256
You wouldn't dare to betray me!

822
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,496
How is that betraying?

823
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:54,336
We are both

824
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:55,376
in the same boat.

825
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:56,456
If I wanted to betray anyone,

826
00:45:57,176 --> 00:45:58,496
I could only betray myself.

827
00:46:05,216 --> 00:46:06,016
But

828
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,056
it's not bad to use you

829
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:09,416
as a cover.

830
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:13,576
How dare you threaten me.

831
00:46:15,736 --> 00:46:17,016
I'm not helping you.

832
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:19,456
You better tell Suying where I am.

833
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,336
So we can die together.

834
00:46:27,736 --> 00:46:29,176
(I must not let her wander about.)

835
00:46:30,056 --> 00:46:30,896
(It would be troublesome)

836
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:31,696
(if she ran into those from Guanghan Sect.)

837
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:39,415
The dragon horns can help the evil dragon

838
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,576
absorb the spirit power of heaven and earth.

839
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:42,175
Now that the evil dragon has retrieved the dragon bone,

840
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,936
he will next go for the dragon horns.

841
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:46,015
The Dragon Horn Formation in Yongzhou

842
00:46:46,016 --> 00:46:47,256
has been reinforced.

843
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:48,655
As long as the evil dragon goes there,

844
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:49,936
he'll be knocked down in one blow.

845
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:51,016
Leader,

846
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,615
we'll be able to retrieve

847
00:46:52,616 --> 00:46:53,616
the Heart Protecting Scale soon.

848
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:55,775
Mr. Lu has a chance

849
00:46:55,776 --> 00:46:57,656
to stay with you forever.

850
00:46:58,576 --> 00:46:59,616
I'll go

851
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,056
to Yongzhou myself.
