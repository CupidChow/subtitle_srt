1
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,980
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:46,102
Hurry up!

4
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:48,262
We're almost late to the wedding of the Dragon King.

5
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:50,232
Hurry up!

6
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:52,382
(Snow Peak, Luochuan Dragon Valley) We're late to the wedding of the Dragon King.

7
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:13,701
(Tianyao, Spirit Dragon)

8
00:02:13,702 --> 00:02:14,822
(Gods and Heaven)

9
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,822
(be my witness.)

10
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,862
(I, Tianyao, Spirit Dragon of Luochuan)

11
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,352
(will espouse Suying of Guanghan Sect.)

12
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,262
(We shall)

13
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,512
(live in bliss day after day.)

14
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:38,822
(For life and eternity, )

15
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:41,982
(we shall never part.)

16
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:48,017
(Suying, Leader of Guanghan Sect)

17
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:23,661
The evil dragon, Tianyao, has done nothing but evil deeds.

18
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,822
You deserve to die.

19
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,071
I will use your dragon scales

20
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,101
to forge an armor

21
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:29,662
to protect the one I truly love.

22
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:32,382
The one you truly love?

23
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:38,512
So,

24
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,032
this wedding is...

25
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,512
Your

26
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:45,912
funeral.

27
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:53,532
You've been using me.

28
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,372
Flaming Dragon Fang.

29
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,262
You should be happy

30
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:17,692
to die at my hands.

31
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:20,212
Give me the Heart Protecting Scale.

32
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,262
You will not have it.

33
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:31,212
Scale and soul in one?

34
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:32,312
Give it to me now!

35
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,242
Your quest

36
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,432
will be in vain!

37
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:53,602
(Without your Heart Protecting Scale, )

38
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,342
(you will be on your last legs.)

39
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:56,382
(I will)

40
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:57,902
(scatter your body parts in all corners of the world)

41
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:00,551
(and seal you)

42
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:02,267
(Obsidian River) (for an eternity.)

43
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:06,821
(Yanhui) (*a swan goose comes back)

44
00:06:06,822 --> 00:06:08,072
(Forgive your mother.)

45
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,461
(Baby Yanhui) (I cannot mend)

46
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,822
(your congenital heart defect.)

47
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,632
(They say)

48
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:17,672
(this river can bestow someone a new life.)

49
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:21,782
(May Heaven show mercy on you)

50
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,782
(so that you can turn into a swan goose)

51
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:26,672
(and fly back)

52
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:30,192
(one day.)

53
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,432
(For as long as I can remember, )

54
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:03,112
(I am a vagabond.)

55
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,072
(I have never had a full tummy or warm clothes.)

56
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,342
(I always have this dream.)

57
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:08,462
(In the dream, )

58
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:09,822
(I have a roof over my head, )

59
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:12,192
(a warm meal on the table...)

60
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:12,902
Thanks, Father.

61
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,071
(and parents who hug me.)

62
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:14,872
Fresh baozi!

63
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,312
(Young Yanhui) Freshly made!

64
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,872
(I long to live in a house)

65
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:19,512
(like everyone else.)

66
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:21,702
(I thought)

67
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:23,072
(it was all a pipe dream)

68
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:25,951
(until an immortal from Chenxing Mountain)

69
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,262
(adopted me.)

70
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,022
(He carried me on his back)

71
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,262
(and told me)

72
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,512
(that Chenxing Mountain)

73
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,952
(would now be my home.)

74
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:35,702
(Master.)

75
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:36,432
(Look.)

76
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,142
(I feel bad for this little girl.)

77
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,022
(You are alone)

78
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:44,462
(and helpless.)

79
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:49,552
(From now on, )

80
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:52,462
(Chenxing Mountain will be your home.)

81
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:58,992
(My home?)

82
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,901
(To see clearly, )

83
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:14,311
(stay true to yourself.)

84
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:16,431
(Get rid of your distracting thoughts.)

85
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:18,752
(Put no name on sentiments.)

86
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,751
To see clearly,

87
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:22,671
(Starfall Terrace, Chenxing Mountain) stay true to yourself.

88
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:24,901
Get rid of your distracting thoughts.

89
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:26,992
Put no name on sentiments.

90
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,317
20 years ago,

91
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,312
(Yanhui, Disciple of Chenxing Mountain) the leader of Guanghan Sect, Master Suying,

92
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,493
killed the evil dragon.

93
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,982
The Spirit Clan thus fell.

94
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:39,717
As Taoists,

95
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:40,918
we should cherish the current peace

96
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,038
and train

97
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,198
even harder.

98
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:44,168
Understood?

99
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,037
(Ziyue, Disciple of Chenxing Mountain) The annual trial

100
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:49,838
is about to begin.

101
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,288
Everyone is fasting,

102
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:52,368
but you

103
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:53,318
are eating.

104
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,648
Ziyue.

105
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,197
I have skipped two meals.

106
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:00,438
I'm starving.

107
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,078
Aren't you here to fast?

108
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,288
Yes.

109
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:06,677
You've been here for a decade.

110
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,037
Other than martial arts, what have you learned?

111
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,318
You haven't unlocked your mind's eye

112
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,958
and you have no spiritual power whatsoever.

113
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:13,558
Disciples from other peaks

114
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,917
in your batch

115
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,317
have attained four stars.

116
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:17,718
But you are still stuck with one.

117
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:21,678
You can't ride a sword either.

118
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:24,887
Don't chastise her, Ziyue.

119
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:25,488
Exactly.

120
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,127
She hasn't even unlocked her mind's eye.

121
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:28,287
There's no way she can ride a sword.

122
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:29,248
That's right.

123
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:30,678
Exactly.

124
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,888
She can't ride a sword at all.

125
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:33,248
Who says I can't ride a sword?

126
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,078
She can?

127
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,008
By the way,

128
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:38,408
I haven't unlocked my mind's eye,

129
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,317
but I can ride the sword by using

130
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,248
the ambient spiritual power.

131
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:44,248
That's my sword.

132
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,198
Give it back, Yanhui!

133
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:49,608
(Do good or do evil, it's a conscious decision.)

134
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:50,887
(Spirits Gaol, Chenxing Mountain)

135
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:53,837
(Your heart decides if you want to be a human or a spirit.)

136
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:54,768
Shut up!

137
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,308
(Be one with the flow.)

138
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:57,188
Stop chanting!

139
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,148
(Be one with the tide.)

140
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:00,907
(As long as you stay positive...)

141
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:02,067
Time to eat!

142
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,598
Come on, it's time to eat.

143
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,548
Put it here.

144
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,548
It's time to eat.

145
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:07,628
Hurry up.

146
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:08,428
It's time to eat.

147
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:09,028
Line up now.

148
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:12,148
Come on.

149
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,338
One for everyone.

150
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:14,948
Sorry.

151
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:18,148
Thanks.

152
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:24,148
Yanhui, why are you here?

153
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,387
Yes, yes.

154
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:30,578
That's the spot.

155
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,028
Well.

156
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,028
The disciples of Chenxing Mountain

157
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,788
fast every year

158
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:37,858
and you come here every year

159
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:40,788
to eat the baozi

160
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:43,147
with us.

161
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:43,908
I know why your parents

162
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:44,818
abandoned you now.

163
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,787
You simply eat too much.

164
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:48,308
Don't make things up.

165
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:50,388
My master said I have a heart defect.

166
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:51,707
I think my parents abandoned me

167
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,147
because of that.

168
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,218
Heart defect?

169
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,938
How come you're still alive then?

170
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,028
Her master cured her, obviously.

171
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:00,668
Does it feel good?

172
00:11:00,668 --> 00:11:01,148
Yes.

173
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:01,818
No.

174
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:03,548
What's bothering you?

175
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,428
My ears.

176
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,308
Perhaps I can clean your ears?

177
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:09,188
No, thanks.

178
00:11:09,508 --> 00:11:10,578
Yanhui.

179
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:11,788
This divine chant

180
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,027
just drones on and on.

181
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:13,788
(As long as you stay positive...)

182
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:15,148
I can't take it anymore.

183
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:16,907
Can you switch it off?

184
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:17,388
Yes, please.

185
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,307
Switch it off. It's so annoying.

186
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:19,908
No.

187
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,028
The divine chant

188
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:23,508
is inspired by Jingming Chant.

189
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,907
It can purify your soul

190
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,028
and rid your violence.

191
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:27,548
It's good for your training.

192
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,188
Nonsense.

193
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,188
It's not nonsense.

194
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,028
Look at him.

195
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:32,908
When he first came here, he looked so unfriendly

196
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:34,508
and he scared many other spirits.

197
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:35,788
But look at him now.

198
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:37,338
He's tame. Don't you think so?

199
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:39,428
See?

200
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:42,628
And you're now prettier.

201
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:44,028
I am?

202
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,268
I have had the baozi

203
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,148
and I have given you a massage.

204
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,698
I should return to my training.

205
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:51,458
Wait.

206
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:53,628
What's the hurry?

207
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:55,188
You only know martial arts.

208
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:57,028
It doesn't matter if you train or not

209
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:58,308
because

210
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:59,388
you can't go far anyway.

211
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,428
Oh, Yanhui. You said

212
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:06,097
you would right our name,

213
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,628
but it's been years

214
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,698
and we're still here.

215
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:11,218
I want to go back to Qingqiu.

216
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,148
Now!

217
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,308
The Discipline Hall captured all of you,

218
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,707
and at the moment,

219
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,548
Martial Aunt Lingfei is in charge of it.

220
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:19,788
I heard

221
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:22,228
she's been tracking a nine-tailed fox

222
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:23,627
for 20 years,

223
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:24,468
but she still hasn't found it.

224
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:26,388
It's an obsession at this point.

225
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,308
You

226
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:28,388
are here

227
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,188
because of that.

228
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:30,028
If you leave now,

229
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,188
you might lose your life.

230
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:33,028
Right.

231
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:33,708
Don't worry.

232
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,308
Once my master is out of his training,

233
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,948
he will help you.

234
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,948
No need to bring your master up.

235
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:40,267
He hasn't come out of his training

236
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:41,228
for years.

237
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:42,188
Besides,

238
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,148
ever since Suying killed the evil dragon,

239
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:45,508
all Taoist clans

240
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:47,388
listen to her.

241
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:48,908
No one even respects Chenxing Mountain anymore.

242
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:49,828
Exactly.

243
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:50,508
What did you say?

244
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:53,628
The Elder of Discipline Hall has arrived!

245
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:54,548
(Oh, no.)

246
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,628
(Lingfei, Elder of Discipline Hall)

247
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:22,643
Imbeciles.

248
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:35,228
Just where exactly did that nine-tailed fox

249
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:37,067
from Qingqiu

250
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,108
hide among us?

251
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,668
I don't know.

252
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:42,708
I don't know.

253
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,468
I have no idea.

254
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:46,348
Whip them.

255
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:51,788
I'll ask again.

256
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,388
Where is the nine-tailed fox?

257
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,468
I truly don't know.

258
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,428
These foxes

259
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:01,348
just took on their human forms.

260
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:02,708
They can't possibly know

261
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,148
where the nine-tailed fox is.

262
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,388
Continue whipping.

263
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:16,588
Stop it, madam.

264
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:19,148
The nine-tailed fox is a noble in Qingqiu.

265
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:20,308
You can kill all of us here

266
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,747
and we will still tell you

267
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:22,948
we don't know where she is.

268
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:24,188
Hush!

269
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:25,308
Bring her out.

270
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:26,908
Come.

271
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,588
Whip her as well.

272
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:35,908
Stop!

273
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:42,588
Are you all right?

274
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:45,748
Martial Aunt Lingfei.

275
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:46,868
I don't think

276
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:47,948
what you did is right.

277
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,188
You are that one-star disciple

278
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:55,708
of Lingxiao?

279
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:58,468
Yes.

280
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:01,108
You're mingling with them

281
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:03,467
and you're defending a spirit now.

282
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,348
Martial Aunt,

283
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,148
what did those spirits do

284
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:07,548
to deserve this punishment?

285
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:08,548
They are fox spirits.

286
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:10,708
I can kill them

287
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:12,948
and no one in the Chenxing Mountain

288
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,227
can criticize me for doing so,

289
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:15,948
let alone whipping them.

290
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,428
Don't mind if I say this then.

291
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:19,788
What you do

292
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,628
is inhumane.

293
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:24,988
You don't get to stop the Discipline Hall

294
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:26,068
from killing a spirit.

295
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:26,588
Move aside.

296
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:29,868
Stop!

297
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,748
You just killed an innocent!

298
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:41,868
No spirit

299
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,788
is innocent.

300
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:46,188
I can kill them whenever I want.

301
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,548
I'm telling you.

302
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,788
I will kill all of these spirits

303
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:52,467
in front of you

304
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,668
today.

305
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,108
It's the Spirit-Killing Staff.

306
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:03,188
Spirit-Killing Staff!

307
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:08,467
The flame burned the talisman.

308
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:09,548
The barrier has been broken.

309
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,548
We can go out now.

310
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:15,548
The barrier is broken.

311
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:23,508
Yanhui.

312
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:24,668
Where did you pick up

313
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,828
such a destructive spell?

314
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,308
Exactly.

315
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,148
When did I learn to do this?

316
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:30,308
Yanhui!

317
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:32,588
Martial Aunt, you're on fire.

318
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:34,988
Put out the fire!

319
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,548
Help me, quick.

320
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:36,948
Run.

321
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:37,908
Put out the fire!

322
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:39,120
Hurry.

323
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:42,868
Run!

324
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:46,588
Miss.

325
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:47,028
Run.

326
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:48,988
You are a good friend.

327
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:49,788
I hope I can see you again.

328
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:50,228
Run now!

329
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:01,028
Martial Aunt.

330
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,228
Yanhui helped those prisoners escape.

331
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:02,788
What should we do?

332
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:04,867
What do we do, Martial Aunt?

333
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:05,468
What do we do?

334
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:06,508
Back off!

335
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,148
You brat.

336
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:12,548
You'll die for it!

337
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:37,268
This is...

338
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:38,868
It frosted.

339
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:39,788
What's going on?

340
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:55,068
Master.

341
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:55,988
You're finally out.

342
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:57,148
(Lingxiao, Leader of Chenxing Mountain)

343
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,108
Sir.

344
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:21,108
Lingxiao.

345
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:22,547
Yanhui freed those spirits

346
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:23,388
and practiced spirit arts.

347
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,028
She is insubordinate

348
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:26,747
and everyone bears witness to it.

349
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,988
She cannot be forgiven.

350
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:29,144
Sir.

351
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:30,744
Master is telling the truth.

352
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,584
Yanhui crossed the line this time.

353
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:34,923
And what do you have to say about it?

354
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:35,524
I...

355
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,979
Aggressing your own martial aunt

356
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,497
shows that you're growing insolent

357
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,099
and irreverent.

358
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:51,019
I did release the spirits,

359
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,539
but I didn't learn any spirit arts.

360
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:53,339
Besides, those spirits

361
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:54,259
are innocent.

362
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,219
Talking back now?

363
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,698
The entire Chenxing Mountain knows

364
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,459
that my mind's eye is sealed and I command no innate spiritual power.

365
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,219
I can only rely on the ambient spiritual power.

366
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,418
I don't know

367
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,259
how I...

368
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,179
Yanhui.

369
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,299
You're to be grounded in Starfall Terrace.

370
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,419
We will decide on your punishment another day.

371
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,058
What was the spell

372
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,179
that came out last time?

373
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:37,899
Why can't I

374
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,979
use it again?

375
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:44,219
Yanhui.

376
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:46,339
Master.

377
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,099
Do you plead guilty?

378
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,499
It's my fault

379
00:20:58,659 --> 00:20:59,899
for destroying the Spirits Gaol

380
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:01,179
and attacking my fellow clan mates.

381
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,019
But I do not regret

382
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:04,179
releasing those spirits.

383
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,139
Master.

384
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:06,658
When you were training in seclusion,

385
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:07,858
Lingfei captured spirits

386
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,459
indiscriminately.

387
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:10,698
I wanted to tell you

388
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:11,699
after you came out of your training.

389
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,939
But today,

390
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:14,578
Lingfei killed indiscriminately too.

391
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:15,979
I couldn't just let it happen.

392
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,259
I was homeless when I was younger,

393
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:23,739
and from what I've seen,

394
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,739
humans and spirits are no different.

395
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:27,059
Your heart decides

396
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,978
if you are good or evil.

397
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,459
I thought spirits...

398
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,099
Master.

399
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,379
You think I'm at fault too?

400
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:04,299
From now on,

401
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:05,939
you're no longer

402
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,419
a disciple of Chenxing Mountain.

403
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,339
Master.

404
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:16,659
Is this what the Elders

405
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,019
of Discipline Hall wanted?

406
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,619
Expelling you

407
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,339
is my decision.

408
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,059
Master...

409
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,419
(Thank you)

410
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,539
(for the decade-long care.)

411
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,219
(From now on, )

412
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:56,779
(Chenxing Mountain will be your home.)

413
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:00,357
(You will not starve or feel cold.)

414
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:04,448
(I will teach you how to read.)

415
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:07,739
(Yanhui) (And we will start with your name.)

416
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:29,407
(Entrance of Chenxing Mountain)

417
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:34,392
(Our swords subdue all evil spirits, and our chivalry will rid the world of demons.)

418
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:58,324
Yanhui.

419
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:04,484
Ziyue.

420
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,404
I didn't expect you

421
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,244
to come to see me off.

422
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:06,604
Who...

423
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:07,764
Who would see

424
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:08,924
a one-star disciple off anyway?

425
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,163
I'm just done

426
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:11,164
with your metal scraps.

427
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,200
Take them with you.

428
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:16,764
You call them

429
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:17,604
metal scraps.

430
00:24:17,964 --> 00:24:18,884
I don't

431
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:20,724
need them then.

432
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:29,524
I don't need a sect

433
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:32,404
that doesn't agree with me.

434
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:00,204
(Bazaar by the foot of Chenxing Mountain)

435
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:02,764
I was in the mountain for a long while.

436
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,364
Not only did I fail to unlock my mind's eye,

437
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:05,644
but I can't use my power properly either.

438
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:06,644
And one

439
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:07,724
fiery spell

440
00:25:07,824 --> 00:25:08,824
is all it took to get an expulsion.

441
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,709
After a decade of peaceful life,

442
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:15,509
now

443
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:16,949
is my time to write my own adventure.

444
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,029
Sir.

445
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:39,548
Six baozi, please.

446
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:40,589
Sure.

447
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:43,829
One, two, three,

448
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:45,869
four, five, six.

449
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:47,029
30 wen, please.

450
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:54,309
(Three wen each) Isn't it three wen for one?

451
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,284
Three wen for one mantou.

452
00:25:58,309 --> 00:25:59,949
No filling.

453
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:02,629
The one with filling.

454
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:04,349
(Five wen each) is five wen each.

455
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,908
It was three wen for one back then.

456
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:07,988
How long ago was it?

457
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:08,669
You were just...

458
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:10,709
That long ago.

459
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,349
Everything

460
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:14,028
is expensive now.

461
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:14,869
The meat is expensive.

462
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,229
The ingredient is expensive.

463
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,469
But the wage remains the same.

464
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:18,589
This is daylight robbery!

465
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,370
Daylight robbery?

466
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:20,709
You have the money.

467
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,389
It's only a robbery if I don't give you my baozi.

468
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:26,309
You're a disciple

469
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,829
of Chenxing Mountain, aren't you?

470
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,389
I bet you haven't left there for many years.

471
00:26:33,949 --> 00:26:34,709
Do you want it or not?

472
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,669
How many baozi can I buy with 10 wen?

473
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,509
Including the one you're eating now,

474
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:49,389
two

475
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:50,989
in total.

476
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:57,949
What should I do? I'm penniless.

477
00:26:58,509 --> 00:26:59,269
Should I

478
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:01,069
head to Yongzhou to ask Xiange for help?

479
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:02,549
But

480
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,908
I need to fund my trip

481
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,029
to Yongzhou.

482
00:27:05,869 --> 00:27:06,869
I'm not going

483
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:07,749
to starve myself.

484
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:17,708
(Qijue Agency Branch, Under Chenxing Mountain)

485
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:19,589
Qijue Agency? (*seven nos)

486
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,748
Your guide to everything, everywhere.

487
00:27:26,749 --> 00:27:29,068
Qijue Agency, Advisor No. 0177.

488
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:30,228
Greetings, miss.

489
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:30,709
How

490
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,068
may I help?

491
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,308
I heard Qijue Agency has a huge

492
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:34,109
network.

493
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:34,709
Do you know

494
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,229
where I can earn money?

495
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:37,549
Of course, miss.

496
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:38,149
But

497
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,629
for our services, you need to pay...

498
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:42,029
One tael?

499
00:27:42,189 --> 00:27:43,189
One gold tael, dear.

500
00:27:43,189 --> 00:27:44,149
Gold tael?

501
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:46,709
It seems like

502
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:48,269
we're in the same business.

503
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:49,869
Miss,

504
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,629
may I know what your business entails?

505
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,109
Daylight robbery.

506
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,308
You're funny, miss.

507
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:57,269
Just a reminder.

508
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,228
This table is worth 30 wen,

509
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:00,709
so please be gentle.

510
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:09,029
Will this be enough?

511
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,109
Of course, dear.

512
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,148
How do I know

513
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,069
you won't lie to me?

514
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:15,229
Qijue Agency.

515
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:16,548
(We won't owe money.) A renowned franchise.

516
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:17,829
(We won't mark up prices.) We are honest people.

517
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:20,308
"We won't let you be the last person

518
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:21,629
to get any news."

519
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,669
(We won't spread misinformation.) One, two, three, four.

520
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:25,589
I only find

521
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,069
six slogans here.

522
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:27,789
(We won't make you) The last one

523
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,309
(obsolete.) is only privy to our owner.

524
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:30,443
Just a reminder.

525
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:31,983
Your payment.

526
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:33,336
(We won't make you lose anything.) only allows you to ask one last question,

527
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:33,909
dear.

528
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:38,149
I want to be rich.

529
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:50,989
Spirit bounty.

530
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,029
This is the most expensive one.

531
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:56,549
(Bounty List)

532
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,629
(A century-old snake spirit stole the Flame Orb.)

533
00:28:58,629 --> 00:28:59,069
(It is gravely wounded.)

534
00:28:59,069 --> 00:28:59,589
(Capture the snake spirit and retrieve the Flame Orb)

535
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:00,069
(to receive 88 gold taels!)

536
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,029
Darn it.

537
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:07,789
I should have

538
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,909
kept those metal scraps.

539
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:10,269
Now, I don't even

540
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,709
have the tools to catch spirits.

541
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:17,149
(Bounty List, 88 gold taels) My 88 gold taels.

542
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:19,148
I have been traveling

543
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:20,709
on this mountain for days now.

544
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:22,228
Where's the huge,

545
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,149
scary,

546
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,189
formidable snake spirit?

547
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,269
Come out now.

548
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,269
Show yourself!

549
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:34,949
Making money

550
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:36,549
sure is hard.

551
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:46,509
This place

552
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:47,869
hardly has any spiritual power.

553
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:48,949
Unless

554
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,269
the snake spirit is stupid,

555
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:51,949
otherwise, it won't train here.

556
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:53,829
Is the address on the bounty list

557
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:55,269
the wrong one?

558
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:39,949
Bite me again.

559
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:41,229
Bite me again.

560
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:42,749
I have been

561
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,389
waiting for you to show up!

562
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:54,749
You dare to run?

563
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:04,749
Run away then.

564
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,029
Run.

565
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:07,949
Run.

566
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:09,549
I ask you to run.

567
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,429
Look.

568
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,909
We aren't enemies.

569
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:15,509
I just want some money.

570
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:16,989
I accepted this bounty list from the Zhou family.

571
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:17,949
I need one thing.

572
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:19,228
Return the Flame Orb

573
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:19,789
you stole.

574
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:20,749
(Snake Spirit, Cha) and I'll spare you.

575
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:21,869
How much are they paying you?

576
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:23,269
I'll triple it.

577
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,189
Triple?

578
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:27,189
You're smart enough

579
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,309
to bribe me.

580
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:30,109
88 times 3 is...

581
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:31,909
88 plus 88

582
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:33,349
plus 88.

583
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:36,508
8 plus 88 minus 8.

584
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,549
264 gold taels!

585
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,948
264 gold taels?

586
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:44,789
How many baozi can I buy with that money?

587
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:50,549
Don't move!

588
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:53,509
One baozi is worth five wen.

589
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,148
If you have 200 gold taels,

590
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,989
you might as well open a baozi restaurant.

591
00:31:58,029 --> 00:31:59,629
Right.

592
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:07,429
Don't you run!

593
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:11,469
Where is it?

594
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:16,069
This snake spirit

595
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:17,669
is such a dishonest...

596
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:41,309
The Taoist master

597
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:43,189
placed such a powerful seal

598
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,589
on my Heart Protecting Scale.

599
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:50,589
(I have no spiritual power right now, )

600
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:51,709
(so I can't break the seal.)

601
00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:53,029
(I can only)

602
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,229
(earn her trust for the moment)

603
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:56,069
(and decide what to do next.)

604
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:58,509
Master...

605
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:13,349
Master...

606
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,788
(Tongluo Village, the Xiao family.)

607
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,868
(Tongluo Village) They gave birth to Doofus Fu.

608
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:25,349
He doesn't speak. He doesn't smile.

609
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:28,148
He is odd and has no friends.

610
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:30,349
He has no friends.

611
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,109
(Madam Zhou)

612
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:36,469
Doofus Fu is here.

613
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:37,149
Doofus Fu!

614
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:38,749
Doofus Fu!

615
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:40,868
Doofus Fu is carrying his wife!

616
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:41,509
Fu.

617
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:43,509
Why is there a woman on your back?

618
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:45,629
She's quite pretty.

619
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,709
Doofus Fu.

620
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:54,028
(Xiao's Courtyard) Don't go inside.

621
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:55,869
Stop. What are you doing?

622
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:07,868
She's the bride.

623
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,029
Doofus Fu kidnapped.

624
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,789
Hit her. Hit her.

625
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:13,469
Run!

626
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:13,949
Run!

627
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:14,789
Doofus Fu

628
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:15,429
kidnapped a bride!

629
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,309
What is wrong with you?

630
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,629
Where am I?

631
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:29,869
Doofus?

632
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:31,189
Kidnap?

633
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:33,549
But he helped me dress my wound.

634
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:34,869
Did he kidnap me

635
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:35,829
or help me?

636
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:37,429
He should have put me

637
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,789
in a more comfortable spot.

638
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,709
(These youthful eyes.)

639
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:13,989
(My heartbeat.)

640
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:15,269
(What is this?)

641
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:16,549
(Is this a hallucination?)

642
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:19,869
(Oh, no.)

643
00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:21,509
(My heartbeat is too loud.)

644
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,309
Stay right there.

645
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:27,909
You're the doofus

646
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:29,389
who kidnapped me?

647
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,229
(How can the eyes of an idiot hide so many emotions?)

648
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:42,509
Wait.

649
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,029
I'm all tied up.

650
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,348
How am I supposed to eat the food

651
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,189
you placed on the ground?

652
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,069
Do you think you're feeding a pig?

653
00:35:58,549 --> 00:35:59,669
Is it poisoned?

654
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:07,389
Another one.

655
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:16,189
I like my mantou with brined vegetables.

656
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:17,669
Hurry.

657
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:18,789
Come on!

658
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:19,469
Hurry!

659
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:30,069
Hey.

660
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:31,588
Abduction is against the law, you know?

661
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,429
You look kind,

662
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:33,429
so I can forgive you.

663
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:34,269
Just release me

664
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:34,869
and let me go.

665
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:35,749
We'll forget everything.

666
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:41,549
Wait.

667
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:44,989
I'll be frank with you.

668
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:48,309
I'm Yanhui. From a Taoist clan.

669
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,269
I tracked a century-old snake spirit to this place.

670
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,389
Don't worry now.

671
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,588
I have wounded it.

672
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:53,748
And I bet

673
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:54,829
it disguised as a human

674
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:56,508
and mingles with the villagers

675
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:58,069
to absorb your vitality.

676
00:36:58,629 --> 00:36:59,989
Release me now,

677
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:01,429
or no one can catch it.

678
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:02,509
If something bad

679
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,789
happens to your village,

680
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:05,229
don't say I didn't warn you.

681
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,509
Are you dumb or are you mute?

682
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:15,309
Wait!

683
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:20,429
I still want the other half

684
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:21,389
of the mantou.

685
00:37:36,949 --> 00:37:38,188
Let me go.

686
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,509
You hear me?

687
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:56,229
I finally found this opportunity,

688
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:58,909
so I am not going to free you.

689
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:02,589
(Without your Heart Protecting Scale, )

690
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:05,029
(you will be on your last legs.)

691
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,829
(You will not be able to wreak havoc in the Mortal Realm anymore.)

692
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,109
Your Heart Protecting Scale will be mine sooner or later.

693
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:12,628
(The world has no place)

694
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:13,829
(for your immortal body.)

695
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,629
(On behalf of the world, )

696
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:19,869
(I will sever your body, )

697
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:21,949
(peel your scales, )

698
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,149
(and scatter them all over the world.)

699
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,749
Your Majesty!

700
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:27,749
(You will be sealed by the five elements.)

701
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:28,149
Stop!

702
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:29,429
Your Majesty!

703
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:30,429
Your Majesty!

704
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:31,909
Your Majesty!

705
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:32,909
Stop!

706
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:34,909
Stop!

707
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:36,469
Don't hurt His Majesty!

708
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:37,709
Run now.

709
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:38,549
Don't hurt His Majesty!

710
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:39,589
It's dangerous!

711
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:41,429
Run!

712
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:44,869
Your Majesty!

713
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,389
Your Majesty!

714
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:47,789
(Tomorrow, )

715
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:49,549
(I'll play along)

716
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:50,469
(and use the snake spirit)

717
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,549
(as the bait)

718
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,589
(to lure her in.)
