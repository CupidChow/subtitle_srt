Let me go!

27

I'm the Elder of Chenxing Mountain's
Discipline Hall.

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,080
How dare you show such audacity?

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,520
You released a guilty disciple
without permission.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,430
How dare you complain about me

31
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,590
in front of Senior Lingxiao now?

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,760
Master,

33
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,150
I did intend to release Yanhui last night.

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,710
I admit my mistake.

35
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,360
I'll bear any punishments.

36
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,270
But Lingfei!

37
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,080
As the Elder

38
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,360
of Chenxing Mountain's Discipline Hall,

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,670
she activated
the Starfall Terrace Deadly Formation

40
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,320
and abused her power to harm her fellow junior

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,520
due to her grudge against Yanhui!

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,360
Now,

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,360
Yanhui has fallen into the Obsidian River.

44
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,360
Unfortunately, she died.

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,870
It's all because of Lingfei's selfish behavior.

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,110
Master,

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
please uphold justice

48
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,200
for Yanhui.

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,550
Yanhui is Chenxing Mountain's sinner.

50
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,360
And she was

51
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
taken away by the evil dragon.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,360
She practiced the skills of the evil dragon

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,240
and colluded with Qingqiu.

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,390
Her sin was unpardonable.

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,920
You think she deserves justice?

56
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,920
Senior,

57
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,320
that disciple of yours
colluded with the spirits.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,520
She betrayed our clan.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,240
She was no longer a part of us.

60
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,590
It was more than reasonable

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,200
for me to kill her.

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,550
She deserved to die!

63
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,640
Kneel!

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,670
Senior,

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,240
are you sure you want to punish me

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,920
for that sinful disciple of yours?

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,790
Lingfei,

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,390
do you have no remorse at all?

69
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,030
Killing her

70
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,640
was the best thing

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,320
I'd done in my life.

72
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,790
Why should I be remorseful?

73
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,030
You shattered my Chenxing Mountain jade ring?

74
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,390
As the sect leader of Chenxing Mountain,
this is my order.

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,710
From today onward,

76
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,470
Lingfei's status as the Elder of Discipline Hall

77
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,120
will be revoked.

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,710
She will receive 50 rods

79
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,710
and be imprisoned within the Spirits Gaol
for the rest of her life.

80
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,440
Who dares to touch me?

81
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm the sister of Master Suying.

82
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm the symbol of friendship

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,790
between Chenxing Mountain and Guanghan Sect.

84
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,710
Everyone in the world knows

85
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,520
that Yanhui colluded with the evil dragon.

86
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,790
You're actually

87
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,790
punishing me for a sinner like her?

88
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,680
Aren't you afraid

89
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,470
that you might offend the Guanghan Sect?

90

Lingxiao,

91
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,230
you actually humiliated me because of Yanhui?

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,680
You're biased!

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,390
Why are you always biased toward Yanhui?

94
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,120
Why?

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,150
What gives her the right for you to side with her?

96
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,680
What gives?

97
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,790
Why must she still obstruct me
even when she's dead?

98
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,680
Punish her!

99
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,590
Lingxiao!

100
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,000
You let me down first!

101
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,230
Don't blame me for this!

102
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,000
All those who humiliated me

103
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,350
must die!

104
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,000
You harnessed the dark aura in secret?

105
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,030
My mind's eye!

106
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,640
You destroyed my mind's eye!

107
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,790
There's no way for me to cultivate my powers now!

108
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,760
You're already a dark practitioner.

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,350
You deserve to be slain!

110
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
Master Lingxiao,

111
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,440
how dare you use such moves against Su'e?

112
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,880
She has fallen into darkness.

113
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,150
But her mind's eye has been destroyed.

114
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll bring her back to Guanghan Sect

115
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,470
and discipline her myself.

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,230
If you practice favoritism

117
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,830
and defend a dark practitioner like her,

118
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,440
that means you'll be going against

119
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,560
the sect's regulations
and affect our reputation.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,390
When it comes to showing favoritism,

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,080
Master Lingxiao,

122
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm no match for you.

123
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,350
Su'e,

124
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,560
return with me.

125
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,320
Master,

126
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,280
can we allow them to leave just like that?

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,280
From now on,

128
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,630
there will be no alliance

129
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,710
between Chenxing Mountain and Guanghan Sect.

130
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,560
So what if they're Taoist masters?

131
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,560
They're but pawns

132
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,470
to me.

133
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,920
(Now, the evil dragon is dead.)

134
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,320
(The Heart Protecting Scale has sunken
into the depth of the Obsidian River.)

135
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,400
(Nothing else can stop me now.)

136
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,400
(Once I break the faltering seal)

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,470
It's actually my name?

149
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,680
(Master,)

150
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,080
(am I an idiot?)

151
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,750
(I don't know how to wield a sword at all.)

152
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,960
You can do it with enough practice.

153
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,800
Master, here you go.

154
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,200
(I trained harder)

155
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,920
(than them,)

156
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
yet they mocked me

157
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,350
for embarrassing you.

158
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,560
Was it because of your star number?

159
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,440
So what if you're a one-star disciple?

160
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,040
You've never embarrassed me before.

161

162
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,680

166
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,440
(I obeyed the order I received a decade ago)

167
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,080
(and chased you off the mountain.)

168
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,510
(And now, I'm obeying my master's order)

169
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,590
(to shatter the Heart Protecting Scale you have.)

170
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,400
(I hoped you could lead a peaceful life
because of this.)

171
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,560
(It's all my fault.)

172
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,630
I was your disciple for ten years.

173
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,830
You actually

174
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,510
forced me into a dead corner.

175
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,680
Fine.

Yanhui!

178
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,320
(I wanted to protect the world)

179
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,630
(and keep you alive too.)

180
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
(But in the end,)

181
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,630
(I've still let you down.)

Lingxiao,

183
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,200
it's hard to maintain a stable heart, isn't it?

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,440
Lingxiao,

186
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,990
Dark Phantom?

190
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,750
This time,

191
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,560
you did recognize me.

192
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,230
This time?

193
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,710
Didn't we already

194
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,230
encounter each other once

195
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,200
in my mind's eye?

196
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,590
(I will open)

197
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,800
a path of escape for you.

198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,320
Use the path

199
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,990
and leave this place.

200
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,830
(You have to complete this task for me.)

201
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,040
Destroy the Heart Protecting Scale.

202
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,110
The Heart Protecting Scale?

203
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,280
Once you destroy it,

204
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,680
(nothing else will be able
to boost Dark Phantom's power.)

205
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,230
So,

206
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,440
it was you all along?

207
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,350
Yes, my beloved disciple.

208
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,400
I wanted to destroy the Heart Protecting Scale

209
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,560
for many years.

210
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,870
I wouldn't have been able to get rid of

211
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
such a strong opponent without lifting a finger

212
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,630
if it weren't for you.

213
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,080
From now on,

214
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,040
no one

215
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,560
in the world

216
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
can stop me.

217
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,870
Are you curious

218
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,990
as to how Qingguang died?

219
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,080
Ten years ago,

220
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,750
you brought Yanhui back to Chenxing Mountain.

221
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,470
Qingguang placed a seal

222
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,960
on her Heart Protecting Scale.

223
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,160
Master.

224
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,590
Did you seal away

225
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,560
the power of her Heart Protecting Scale?

226
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,680
(It was already futile)

227
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,590
(when Qingguang placed the seal)

228
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,710
(on the Heart Protecting Scale.)

229
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,750
I devoured him bit by bit

230
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,560
during the last ten years.

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,080
He was

232
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,160
but a hollow shell.

233
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,110
Excellent.

234
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,870
So, Suying's barrier is still
capable of restricting me.

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,590
However,

236
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,400
there's no more dragon in the world!

237
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,830
You,

238
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,280
Suying,

239
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,470
none of you will be able to survive!

240
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,680
(Why hasn't Master returned yet?)

241
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,320
(Could it be)

242
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,990
(that something had happened to him?)

243
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,200
Master,

244
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,960
how's Starhaven doing?

245
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,320
Master,

246
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,960
what's wrong?

247
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,960
I was wrong.

248
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,400
I was utterly wrong.

249
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,440
You were wrong?

250
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,320
Master, what do you mean?

251
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,800
I harmed her.

252
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,080
You harmed her?

253
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,870
Master!

254
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,680
I don't believe it.

255
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,400
I don't believe that you're dead.

256
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,800
Lately, members of our sect

257
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,830
have been disappearing

258
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,710
for no reason.

259
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,440
Do you think

260
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,960
it has something to do

261
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,560
with our sect leader's revival?

262
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,680
Don't spout nonsense.

263
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,790
The revival of our sect leader

264
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,070
is great news

265
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,550
to Guanghan Sect.

266
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,750
You don't need to care

267
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,600
how she revived herself.

268
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,600
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

269
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,680
Do you need anything from us?

270
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,070
Why didn't you report

271
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,640
the disappearance of my disciples

272
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,510
to me?

273
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,640
Speak!

274
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,310
Ma'am, you were asleep.

275
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,360
We reported everything

276
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,750
to Immortal Yunmeng.

277
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,360
Sometimes, we report them to Miss Su'e too.

278
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,230
Lately,

279
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,680
Immortal Yunmeng is nowhere to be found.

280
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,470
We didn't dare

281
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,640
to interrupt you during your cultivation.

282
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,880
Therefore, we reported everything

283
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,360
to Miss Su'e,

284
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
who returned with you.

285
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,920
That's why...

286
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,640
Got it.

287
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,990
You may leave.

288
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

289
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,990
I've already sacrificed so many people.

290
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,990
Why isn't my face healed yet?

291
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm sure

292
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,310
Lingxiao chased me out of the sect

293
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,600
because of

294
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,030
how I look.

295
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,510
It's you?

296
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,960
Miss Su'e,

297
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,360
since I can help you to regain your power,

298
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,510
recovering your looks

299
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,990
is a piece of cake for me.

300
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,310
I've already offered

301
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,310
so many insignificant lives

302
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,990
to you.

303
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
What else do you want?

304
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
I need more souls.

305
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,790
Once I've obtained enough power,

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,680
I can break out

307
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,160
of Starhaven.

308
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
By then,

309
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,510
I can provide you

310
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,710
with anything you want.

311
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,680
Fine.

312
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,070
There are

313
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,440
too many darned monsters

314
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
in the Taoist clans anyway.

315
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,750
Everything will be fine

316
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
once my face recovers.

317
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,030
Suying?

318
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,440
Suying,

319
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,920
what are you doing here?

320
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,920
How do you explain the dark aura

321
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,310
inside your body?

322
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,030
Dark aura?

323
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,030
What's wrong with it?

324
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,750
Will you reprimand me

325
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,710
like Lingxiao did?

326
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,310
Are you here to punish me?

327
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,510
Is that so?

328
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,960
Of course not.

329
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,990
I might not be able to kill Yanhui

330
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
without the dark aura's power.

331
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,360
Suying,

332
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,750
I'm fine if someone else reprimands me.

333
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,790
But Suying,

334
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,270
why are you reprimanding me too?

335
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,750
I saved you!

336
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,020
I'm not reprimanding you.

337
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,510
Su'e,

338
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,710
the dark aura

339
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,840
belongs to the dark force.

340
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,840
No matter what had happened,

341
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,470
I will help you out.

342
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,990
Let's expel

343
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,990
the dark aura from your body together.

344
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,710
But you need to remember something.

345
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,310
In the future,

346
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,270
you mustn't let

347
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,030
the Lord of Dark Aura bewitch you again.

348
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,310
He will land you in trouble.

349
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,960
Yes, Suying.

350
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,310
I will do as you say.

351
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm around.

352
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Everything will be fine.

353
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,600
One's soul

354
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,550
is always ruined

355
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,070
by the people closest to them.

356
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,030
Just like how Yanhui's master ruined her.

357
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,440
You still wish

358
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,400
to avenge your dead lover?

359
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,230
Just give up.

360
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,840
Your story with her

361
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,710
has ended.

362
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,440
"Today, by the Obsidian River,

363
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,840
I lost my dearest friend.

364
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,920
The ever-flowing river

365
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,550
flows without rest.

366
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,470
May our friend

367
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,440
depart in peace."

368
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,710
(The long river falls)

369
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,750
(as trouble arises.)

370
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,200
(Five hearts facing the sky,)

371
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,710
(lying underneath the lake.)

372
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,710
(Calm your heart and stop worrying.)

373
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,310
(Understand the underlying meaning.)

374
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,550
(Ponder upon its logic.)

375
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,310
(Sensing.)

376
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,750
(Emptiness isn't empty.)

377
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,360
(Empty is as empty does.)

378
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,310
(Imprinted in one's mind through sight.)

379
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,400
(Move your brain,)

380
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,030
(and you feel dizzy.)

381
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,310
(Only then shall you see two.)

382
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,920
"If the afterlife does exist,

383
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,880
we shall laugh together

384
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,990
as we gather again!

385
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,230
Do..."

386
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,960
Look!

387
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,840
(The long river falls)

388
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,200
(as trouble arises.)

389
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,750
(Five hearts facing the sky,)

390
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,750
(lying underneath the lake.)

391
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,120
(Calm your heart and stop worrying.)

392
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,200
(Understand the underlying meaning.)

393
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,310
(Ponder upon its logic.)

394
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,920
(Sensing.)

395
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,070
(Emptiness isn't empty.)

396
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,230
(Empty is as empty does.)

397
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,470
(Imprinted in one's mind through sight.)

398
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,640
(Move your brain, and you feel dizzy.)

399
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,030
(Only then shall you see two.)

400
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,960
This is a strange phenomenon!

401
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,030
This has never been seen before!

402
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,120
What are those?

403
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,960
Something's stirring under the Obsidian River.

404
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
(A sort of power)

405
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,880
(is summoning the dark aura.)

406
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,400
(Could it be)

407
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,750
(that she didn't die in the depths
of the Obsidian River,)

408
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,790
(but instead,)

409
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,550
(she had mastered the Ghostly Eulogy?)

410
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,710
Yanhui.

411
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,990
Yanhui?

412
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,440
Yanhui!

413
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,270
Look!

414
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,710
Yanhui is still alive!

415
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,790
You're right! Yanhui is still alive!

416
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
She's heading toward Sanchong Mountain!

417
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,640
What is this?

418
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,600
Look. What's that?

419
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,990
Over there!

420
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,120
Look over there!

421
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,200
Look!

422
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,160
How could such terrifying spirit power

423
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,750
be born out of nowhere?

424
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,710
That was a terrifying presence.

425
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,840
Was it a spirit?

426
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,510
Yeah.

427
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,750
She's heading toward the Dragon Vein Formation.

428
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,550
Tianyao?

429
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,640
Tianyao!

430
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,470
Tianyao!

431
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,270
Wake up.

432
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,360
I'm here to save you.

433
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,470
Tianyao!

434
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,360
He needs his dragon veins.

That's right.

456
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,360
It's not time

457
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,510
to give up yet.

458
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,470
Tianyao,

459
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,200
I'll definitely save you.

460
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,790
Someone destroyed
the Dragon Vein Formation by force

461
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,200
and rescued the evil dragon.

462
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,600
Yanhui is the only person

463
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,270
who's desperate to save him.

464
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,200
Yanhui jumped into the Obsidian River

465
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,230
in front of our eyes.

466
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
It can't be her.

467
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,680
I don't care who it is.

468
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,550
Practitioners of the dark aura

469
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,680
are our enemies.

470
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,230
Master Lingxiao,

471
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,600
I just hope

472
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,230
that you can be as decisive

473
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,990
as the time

474
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,270
you punished Su'e when you encounter

475
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,440
this entity.

476
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,600
(Feng Qianshuo and Xiange)

477
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,960
went to the Obsidian River in search of Yanhui.

478
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,120
They will be fine, right?

479
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,470
They have plenty of ways to get around.

480
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,160
Don't worry.

481
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
Let's tell my father about this first.

482
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,160
Maybe he would...

483
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,020
What's that?

484
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,680
Let's go and take a look!

485
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,750
Your Majesty,

486
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,710
I saved Tianyao from
the Heavenly Severance Formation.

487
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,030
The Life-Swapping Spell was triggered long ago.

488
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,510
Tianyao was no longer breathing.

489
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,880
When I was just about to give up,

490
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,400
he turned into this dragon egg.

491
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,030
Your Majesty,

492
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,030
your intelligence is unparalleled.

493
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,200
Please take a look.

494
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
Is Tianyao

495
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,200
still alive?

496
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,790
I can detect

497
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,160
faint breathing inside the egg.

498
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
This should be formed

499
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,200
by his last Dragon Consciousness.

500
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,920
Can he be saved then?

501
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,470
Tianyao is the Millennium Dragon.

502
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,470
Even if he perishes completely,

503
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,070
it takes seven days

504
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,510
for his Dragon Consciousness
to vanish completely.

505
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,840
If you could gather

506
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,470
all his lost Dragon Consciousness

507
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,440
within seven days,

508
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,840
he might

509
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,160
still survive.

510
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,510
How long has it been
since I fell into the Obsidian River?

511
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,640
Three days.

512
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,470
Three days?

513
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
That means I only have four days left.

514
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,270
How can I find Tianyao's Dragon Consciousness?

515
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Where was

516
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,600
your Life-Swapping Spell activated?

517
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,680
Chenxing Mountain's Starfall Terrace.

518
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,440
You shall find it there.

519
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

520
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,030
Father,

521
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,990
was that...

522
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,190
It was Yanhui.

523
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,400
I knew it.

524
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,550
It was her indeed.

525
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,360
But

526
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,630
why was she in a rush?

527
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,550
She desires to save her beloved.

528
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,550
Eldest Senior,

529
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,190
has Master returned

530
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,760
after chasing the moving dark aura yesterday?

531
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,320
How's Master doing?

532
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,240
Is he doing better now?

533
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,470
Ever since Yanhui...

534
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,030
Ever since Master came back
from the Obsidian River,

535
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,720
it felt like he grew old overnight.

536
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,400
He went to Starhaven yesterday.

537
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,510
After that, he went to Sanchong Mountain.

538
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,800
His body is getting weaker and weaker.

539
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,150
I heard that Yanhui took her own life

540
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,400
by jumping into the Obsidian River

541
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,150
right in front of Master.

542
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,510
Eldest Senior,

543
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,190
it's been some days since you caught a wink.

544
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,800
Why don't you

545
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,110
go and rest?

546
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,110
I need to stand guard over Master.

547
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,360
Eldest Senior!

548
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,960
Eldest Senior!

549
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,030
This is huge!

550
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,920
This is huge!

551
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,590
Senior Yanhui has returned!

552
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,400
Yanhui?

553
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,800
Where is she?

554
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,510
She's heading toward the Starfall Terrace!

555
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,800
The Starfall Terrace?

556
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,670
Let's go!

557
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,670
I thought she was dead?

558
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,190
Look at her.

559
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,440
Is she possessed?

560
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,070
What should we do?

561
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,510
Why is she here again?

562
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,990
Let's stop her for now.

563
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,360
Get out of my way.

564
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,760
I don't wish to hurt you guys.

565
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,920
Yanhui!

566
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
What are you guys doing?

567
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,990
Keep your swords away!

568
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,110
Junior,

569
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,440
what's going on?

570
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,590
I'm no longer a member of Chenxing Mountain.

571
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,590
Immortal, do not address me wrongly.

572
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,400
Yanhui!

573
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,630
I came here

574
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,190
to retrieve the Dragon Consciousness
that's lingering around here.

575
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,840
Once I'm done,

576
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,550
I will never set foot

577
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,880
in Chenxing Mountain again.

578
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,240
(The storm and rain rage)

579
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,630
(as the dragon shed tears of hatred.)

580
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,030
(With my soul,)

581
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
(I beseech the Dragon Consciousness.)

582
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:43,960
(Gather!)

583
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,510
I'm afraid she has mastered the dark aura.

584
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,760
(I think it became brighter.)

585
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,440
(It feels as warm as Tianyao's palm.)

586
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,180
(This will work.)

587
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,720
Master is here!

588
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,110
-Master!
-Master is here!

589
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:35,760
Master!

590
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,320
Master!

591
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,190
-Master.
-Look at Yanhui.

592
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,470
Master.

593
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,880
Master.

594
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,550
Yanhui is...

595
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,030
So, you mastered the dark aura?

596
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,070
Were you the one

597
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,240
who caused the earth to tremble

598
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,670
and destroyed the Heavenly Severance Formation?

599
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,630
Yanhui!

600
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,320
Stop!

601
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,150
Yanhui!

602
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,720
How could you attack your master?

603
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,720
My master?

604
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,030
He doesn't deserve my respect.

605
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,280
I practiced the dark aura in order to save people.

606
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,760
But him?

607
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,510
He may not practice the dark arts,

608
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,510
but he's an accomplice
who contributed to Tianyao's death.

609
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
(I wouldn't have been able to get rid of)

610
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,920
(such a strong opponent without lifting a finger)

611
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,280
(if it weren't for you.)

612
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,550
(From now on,)

613
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,400
(no one)

614
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,150
(in the world can stop me.)

615
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,070
Frost Blossom Technique?

616
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
No one

617
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,470
can stop me.

618
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,800
Yanhui!

619
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,630
Yanhui.

620
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,510
