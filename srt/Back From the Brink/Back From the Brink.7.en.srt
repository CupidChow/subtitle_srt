1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,475
(Wangyu Tower)

4
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,700
Xiange.

5
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,250
Who is he?

6
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,010
He's the young master of the Feng family,

7
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,170
Feng Qianshuo.

8
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,780
Is he that toff?

9
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,450
Why is he in your room?

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,980
Why is he here in the Tianxiang Workshop

11
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,170
at this late hour

12
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,220
while dressing like that?

13
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,250
Doesn't Tianxiang Workshop

14
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,890
belong to the Feng family?

15
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,810
What's with his attire coming to the property of his own?

16
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,410
It's a long story about the Feng family.

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm responsible for his injury.

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,620
Do you still remember

19
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,650
I told you

20
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,530
about the disappearance of familiars in Yongzhou City

21
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,530
kept rising recently?

22
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,180
I suspect that those missing familiars

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,900
are locked

24
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,690
in the Arena of Tianxiang Workshop.

25
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,740
Arena?

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,300
Rumor has it that it's a secret place

27
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,370
that entertains the rich and powerful

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,370
in the Tianxiang Workshop.

29
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,940
It's just a hearsay

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,900
without proof.

31
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,970
Hence,

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,690
I'm going to scout

33
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,180
the entrance of the Arena tonight.

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,090
To be honest,

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,900
we found the entrance

36
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,940
last night.

37
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,810
You?

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,370
Why did you go there?

39
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,300
If you can't tell me,

40
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,250
I will stop asking.

41
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,060
Though I can't tell you the reason,

42
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,340
I will save those monsters

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,090
who are locked up in there.

44
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,300
This is dangerous.

45
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,090
I don't want you

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
to get into trouble.

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,620
Xiange, rest assured.

48
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,810
It's not because of you.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,250
Both of us

50
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,500
have already been in the game.

51
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,970
Lay still.

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,780
Don't touch me.

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,620
I don't need a mere familiar

54
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,300
to save me.

55
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,180
Talk about perfect timing.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,130
He already healed you.

57
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,940
Otherwise,

58
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,250
the wound on your left shoulder wouldn't have been cured.

59
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,900
It's you.

60
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,940
Do you know me?

61
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,530
120,088 gold.

62
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,460
I know you.

63
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,620
You went to Qijue Agency before?

64
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,650
He's the owner of Qijue Agency.

65
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,250
You crooked profiteer!

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
High praise.

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:05,970
Give me back my money!

68
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,090
Refund never happens

69
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,020
in Qijue Agency.

70
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,060
Don't tell me

71
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,460
this is the seventh Don't.

72
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,060
Of course not.

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,180
Since you're from the Feng family,

74
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,500
do you know

75
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,060
how to get into the Arena?

76
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,940
Doesn't the Qijue Agency uphold.

77
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,660
"Never disappoint the clients"?

78
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,210
Are you going to repay their kindness

79
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,980
in this manner?

80
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,300
My golden phoenix feather is the access token.

81
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,300
But that place

82
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,330
is full of dangers.

83
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,210
Restrain your meddling nose

84
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,860
if anything happens.

85
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,540
I'm off, Xiange.

86
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,300
Be careful.

87
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,980
Where are you going, Young Master Feng?

88
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,570
I know you don't like me,

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,620
so I will leave you in peace.

90
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,660
Stay here tonight.

91
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,500
I can't.

92
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,660
Feng Ming might have spotted me just now.

93
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,100
If I stay here,

94
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,010
I will get you in trouble.

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,010
But if you were to leave here tonight,

96
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,890
who will prove your alibi

97
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,420
for not going to Tianxiang Workshop?

98
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,570
Feng Ming won't believe

99
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,180
your concubines' statements.

100
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,250
So, staying here tonight

101
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,740
is the safest choice.

102
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,810
Go to bed.

103
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,330
We're going to the Arena with this.

104
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,250
However, we can't retrieve

105
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,810
the horns in there.

106
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,100
Otherwise, Xiange will be in trouble.

107
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,010
You better know this well.

108
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,810
All right?

109
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,620
Yes.

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,660
Young Master Feng

111
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,890
is young

112
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,330
but with a huge prejudice.

113
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,740
I think you're not prejudiced.

114
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,570
Me?

115
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,660
You're different

116
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,810
from other Taoist immortal cultivators.

117
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,890
Before I joined Chenxing Mountain,

118
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,570
I used to live as a refugee

119
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,180
and have been racking

120
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,810
by the worldly torment.

121
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,980
If you have starved

122
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,620
like I did before,

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,620
you would understand

124
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,690
most sentient beings

125
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,740
risk their lives

126
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,300
to survive.

127
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,570
Be it a human or a spirit,

128
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,770
their lives value much.

129
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
There is no difference.

130
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,620
What's wrong?

131
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,660
To me,

132
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,300
your life is far different

133
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,540
from others.

134
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,450
Yanhui.

135
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,660
You're very special.

136
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,180
I...

137
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,300
I know you're talking about the Heart Protecting Scale.

138
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,060
But please stop that intense gaze.

139
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,940
I've fallen in love with you.

140
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,980
Can you please mind what you say and do?

141
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,180
I'm overwhelmed with you.

142
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,980
I...

143
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,180
Don't look at me.

144
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,890
Turn around.

145
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,740
Turn your face away.

146
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,940
Cover your face with this. Now.

147
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,130
Are you satisfied now?

148
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,180
Well...

149
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,370
Did you...

150
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,300
You...

151
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,890
Put that down.

152
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,540
Have you heard of

153
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,300
"hiding one's ethereal beauty partly with a pipa"?

154
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,300
This is it.

155
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,620
What do you want?

156
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,330
I'm telling you

157
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,420
to stop bewitching me.

158
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,010
Now that I've fallen deeply for you.

159
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,100
Quit playing hard to get.

160
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,620
If I were

161
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,570
to overstep the line,

162
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,370
I won't let you off the hook.

163
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Don't blame me for that, then.

164
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,300
Please

165
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
don't say things like this.

166
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,180
I said this because I'm trying to hold myself back.

167
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,860
Turn around.

168
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,060
Face aside.

169
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,010
I wanted to ask you

170
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,300
if you're poisoned.

171
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,210
Yes, I am.

172
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,250
By the poison of love.

173
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,115
(Couple Trial)

174
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,090
Loyalty.

175
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,380
Checked.

176
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,641
Trust.

177
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,780
Checked.

178
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,660
That's great.

179
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,900
As expected of the couple I chose.

180
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,431
I've finally found you.

181
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,690
Hui.

182
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,900
Hui.

183
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,660
I'm here to save you, Hui.

184
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,490
Hui?

185
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Hui.

186
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,970
You refuse to see me

187
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,140
because you've found out

188
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,450
that the Fox Incense

189
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,180
was my doing.

190
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,140
I'm to blame.

191
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,850
I shouldn't have used it on you

192
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,660
and I shouldn't have let your familiar

193
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,610
to touch you first.

194
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,780
Whenever the thought

195
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,970
of you besotted with a familiar

196
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,490
comes to me,

197
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,780
I feel heartbroken.

198
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,850
It's my fault.

199
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,900
I fail to protect you.

200
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:45,970
What?

201
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,850
I have led you to the wrong man.

202
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,970
She fell for him

203
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,179
because of the Fox Incense.

204
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,060
Poor Hui.

205
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,330
They are

206
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,330
a fake couple.

207
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm the cause of your humiliation.

208
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,570
Hui.

209
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,260
Forgive me, Hui.

210
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,330
The barrier of that dragon

211
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,900
is able to trap me here.

212
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,140
Please don't ignore me.

213
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,300
Hui, it's my fault.

214
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,970
Hui.

215
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,690
Wang Pengyuan.

216
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,219
Why are you here?

217
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,420
Hui.

218
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,580
Hui, you're back.

219
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,730
I thought you turned me down just now.

220
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,260
Hui.

221
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,100
I've finally found

222
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,100
that method

223
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,340
to have you turn over a new leaf.

224
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,300
Turn over a new leaf? What are you talking about?

225
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,770
Do you find

226
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,220
that he's extremely charming

227
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,540
and you're deeply drawn to him?

228
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,610
How do you know about this?

229
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,810
That's an illusion.

230
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,970
I'm here to rescue you.

231
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,490
Are you in your right mind? Go take the medicine.

232
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,060
You should take the medicine instead.

233
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,100
I've brought it here.

234
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,340
You will be fine

235
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,010
after drinking this soup.

236
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,490
Soup again?

237
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,460
Truth be told,

238
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,090
I added the Fox Incense

239
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,690
to the soup last time.

240
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,610
What?

241
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,210
It's Fox Incense.

242
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,260
Well...

243
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,060
After drinking it,

244
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,420
you will fall

245
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,210
for the first person

246
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,340
you touch.

247
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,850
Hui.

248
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,810
Please let me touch you.

249
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,570
What are you doing here?

250
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,810
He touched you.

251
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,010
I see.

252
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,130
That makes perfect sense.

253
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,890
I was wondering

254
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,260
why I would be into him out of a sudden.

255
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,330
Thank goodness.

256
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,570
How dare you plotted against me.

257
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,260
Hui, quit scolding me.

258
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,850
Hurry up and finish the soup.

259
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,220
You will be fine afterwards.

260
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,130
Here.

261
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,090
That's right.

262
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,020
That's right.

263
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,610
Right.

264
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,450
I'm back to normal now.

265
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,260
Supposedly,

266
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,940
you're a common one

267
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,260
in my eyes.

268
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,260
I'm finally back to normal.

269
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,260
Hui.

270
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,380
Do you still blame me?

271
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,060
Well, I get you a pass.

272
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,020
Never

273
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,300
do this again.

274
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,060
If so, will you...

275
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,780
No, I won't.

276
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:00,900
Honestly, I'm not

277
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,569
as good as you think.

278
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,140
You'd better

279
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,690
step out of your imagination.

280
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,900
I'm leaving Yongzhou City

281
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,210
soon after I accomplish my task.

282
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,810
As for you, you're well off,

283
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,139
considerate, and kind.

284
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,260
You will definitely meet a girl

285
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,780
who treats you well

286
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,490
and likes you in the future.

287
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,780
Am I as good as you said?

288
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,660
Of course you are.

289
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,330
Don't you believe in us immortal cultivators?

290
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,450
Well... Thank you so much.

291
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,810
My father wants

292
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,540
to take me along westward for business.

293
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,020
It's time to leave Yongzhou

294
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,610
and see the outside world.

295
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,610
Hui.

296
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,450
Please take care of yourself.

297
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
You too.

298
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,090
Take care of yourself.

299
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,609
Please take good care of yourself.

300
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,540
Yes, sure.

301
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,780
You too.

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
See you.

303
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,470
Watch out.

304
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,230
You seem to have a kind heart

305
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,780
concerning what you said just now.

306
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,110
Mind your mouth.

307
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,620
Now, my patience for you

308
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,860
has a limit.

309
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,780
Previously,

310
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,350
I said you were manipulating him.

311
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,380
I was wrong.

312
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,990
Are you apologizing to me?

313
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,710
Do you really think

314
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,500
a mere rope

315
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,540
can trap me?

316
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,190
(He's a shadow spirit.)

317
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,500
(This is bad.)

318
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,380
Watch out!

319
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,990
Tianyao.

320
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,310
To my surprise,

321
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,350
you noticed my shadow magic.

322
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,710
What are you doing?

323
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,430
Let go of Tianyao.

324
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,140
Dear Hui.

325
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,780
I'm here to kill you.

326
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,950
You said you loved me this morning,

327
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,140
yet you're going to kill me now.

328
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,590
Men are full of lies.

329
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,590
Love scammer,

330
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,860
you took the Fox Incense.

331
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,140
You are in no place to talk about love with me.

332
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,500
Put out the light.

333
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,830
(This is weird.)

334
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,590
(Isn't the Fox Incense in me)

335
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,660
(gone?)

336
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,660
Come out.

337
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,540
Or I will find you.

338
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,380
Run now.

339
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,740
Do you really think

340
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,230
I can't catch you?

341
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,140
(With my current spiritual power, )

342
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,620
(this is all I can do now.)

343
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,860
A friend in need is a friend indeed, huh?

344
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,660
Since you want to help her,

345
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,230
I will send you to your demise first.

346
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
Are you insane?

347
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,860
Killing one on a whim?

348
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,950
Are you going to the Arena?

349
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,230
It doesn't

350
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,230
concern you.

351
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,350
(Ready to die together?)

352
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,590
(I can see sparks fly between them.)

353
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,965
(Probably Arena)

354
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,230
(can be a good test for them.)

355
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,990
Well...

356
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,020
I will give you one more chance.

357
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:09,707
Please

358
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,137
don't let me down.

359
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:21,747
The spirit keeps changing his mind.

360
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,227
What exactly is he up to?

361
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,657
I guess he has been testing

362
00:17:24,787 --> 00:17:25,787
the relationship between us.

363
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:26,857
Testing?

364
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,467
The relationship

365
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:29,857
between us?

366
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:31,872
He has misunderstood me

367
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:32,947
for falling for you

368
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,267
because of the Fox Incense.

369
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:36,377
But what's his intention?

370
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:37,857
Let's put this aside.

371
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,657
Our priority now is to seek dragon horns

372
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,708
in the Arena tomorrow.

373
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:43,377
Well...

374
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:44,947
Did you get hurt?

375
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:45,857
I'm good.

376
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:50,067
Let's go.

377
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:51,897
Where are you going?

378
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,067
To fetch my shoe.

379
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:57,002
(Tianxiang Workshop)

380
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,547
(Xunfeng Pavilion) I don't think you're familiar faces here.

381
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:00,353
I wonder you came here

382
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:01,427
under whose recommendation.

383
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,137
I didn't know

384
00:18:09,162 --> 00:18:10,612
you're of noble identities.

385
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:11,653
My apologies.

386
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:13,377
Please forgive my insolence.

387
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,150
It's fine.

388
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,817
The beast gladiatorial game starts soon.

389
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:17,947
Please follow me.

390
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,307
I'm with him.

391
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:21,547
Yes, as you said.

392
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:22,337
This way, please.

393
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,177
Please.

394
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:34,027
Open the door.

395
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:50,817
This drawing of Parental Love is huge.

396
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,547
The parents of Young Master Feng

397
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:53,987
fell prey to spirits when he was young.

398
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,657
Hence, our master, Feng Ming

399
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:57,307
raises him alone.

400
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:58,657
The bond between the uncle and nephew

401
00:18:58,787 --> 00:18:59,747
is very strong.

402
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:02,722
(No wonder)

403
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:03,987
(he has a huge prejudice against spirits.)

404
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:05,632
(The drawing of Parental Love)

405
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:06,947
(is supposed to be warm and lovely.)

406
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:08,832
(How come)

407
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,177
(I sense chill from it?)

408
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,153
As expected,

409
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:27,863
something is behind the drawing.

410
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:28,649
The tunnel inside

411
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,051
is out of my authorization.

412
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,349
Go straight down the tunnel

413
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:32,074
according

414
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,286
to the signal inside.

415
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:34,851
May you

416
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,476
have a wondrous night.

417
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:07,681
Distinguished guest.

418
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,371
Gladiatorial beast.

419
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,961
(Gladiatorial Beast, Distinguished Guest) This will be more amusing.

420
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:20,481
Please

421
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,481
don't let me down.

422
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,881
So many silver-gilt beads here.

423
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,121
Will there be a cave full of valuables

424
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,441
at the end of the tunnel?

425
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,911
A house of gold in the spirits' mound.

426
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,135
Do you know the silver-gilt bead

427
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,190
is gutted from Tong spirit (*A boar-like monster)

428
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:40,476
and plain glitters are obtained

429
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:42,671
by scraping against the feathers of Qique birds?

430
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,231
Suying has indeed sent the dragon horns

431
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:47,121
to the hand of an executioner.

432
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:50,841
Let's go.

433
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:02,161
Come on.

434
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:02,851
This way.

435
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:06,941
(Distinguished Guest)

436
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:44,471
Please.

437
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:50,961
Master Feng.

438
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:51,951
What brings

439
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:53,231
you here?

440
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:54,851
Out of the way.

441
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,231
How dare a mere familiar

442
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:57,611
stare directly at Master Feng!

443
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:59,401
Master Feng of Tianxiang Workshop.

444
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:01,711
I wonder what brings you

445
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:03,121
to my shabby place.

446
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:06,671
Miss Xiange.

447
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,881
My wayward nephew

448
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,801
came to Wangyu Tower yesterday.

449
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,841
It turns out you're here for Young Master Feng.

450
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:15,851
Young Master Feng and I

451
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,051
had a blast yesterday.

452
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:18,721
He's not up yet.

453
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,771
Really?

454
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:21,611
I wonder which room he stays...

455
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,191
Over here. I'm here.

456
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,401
Young Master Feng.

457
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,681
Uncle,

458
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:28,321
why are you here?

459
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,291
Can we

460
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,611
talk about it at home?

461
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:33,611
Master Feng.

462
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,561
Young Master Feng is a fully grown-up

463
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,401
who came here to listen to songs and drink.

464
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:39,811
Are you

465
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,711
going to tell him off now?

466
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:51,191
(I cast an attack spell at the left shoulder)

467
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,321
(of the man in black last night.)

468
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,511
Let's go to the inner chamber

469
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,851
of the Tianxiang Workshop.

470
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,401
Uncle.

471
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,401
Why take me there?

472
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:03,751
You're well aware

473
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:04,881
that I'm simply not cut out for that business.

474
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:06,641
I will obey you

475
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,641
regarding all arrangements for the workshop.

476
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,431
You're the only descendant in the Feng family.

477
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,091
You should learn

478
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:12,401
to deal with the home business sooner or later.

479
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,431
Stop fooling around.

480
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,401
Uncle.

481
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:15,011
Let's go.

482
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:19,641
Master Feng.

483
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,681
My client once told me

484
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:23,321
that the inner chamber of the Tianxiang Workshop

485
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:24,851
is an amusing place.

486
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,231
I would like to take a look.

487
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,201
-I wonder... -No.

488
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,231
That's not a place

489
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:30,221
for ladies

490
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:31,081
like you.

491
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:32,921
Just wait for me here.

492
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,121
Tonight,

493
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:35,371
I will come and appreciate your songs.

494
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:36,241
Uncle.

495
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,271
Let's go.

496
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:42,881
That was scary.

497
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:43,851
It was terrifying.

498
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:47,081
Miss Xiange.

499
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:50,161
Seems like Young Master Feng wants

500
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,951
to keep you out of the danger.

501
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,081
I suppose Feng Ming came here

502
00:23:54,161 --> 00:23:55,241
because he found out something

503
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,431
about our visit to Tianxiang Workshop

504
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,401
last night.

505
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:58,371
Get prepared.

506
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,571
I've been waiting for you for long.

507
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:10,561
What took you so long?

508
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:11,961
The game is going to start.

509
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:13,161
Jeez, you people indeed

510
00:24:13,241 --> 00:24:14,201
dawdle much.

511
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:16,771
The men inside here

512
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:17,721
are way ruder

513
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:18,881
than the men outside.

514
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:20,511
Take him down.

515
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:22,081
Yes.

516
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:22,751
Hold on.

517
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:23,641
We're supposed to go together.

518
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:24,571
Take him down.

519
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:26,241
Go.

520
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:29,161
See you later.

521
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,091
Be quick.

522
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,681
Stop looking at him.

523
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,671
After you sign the statement,

524
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,011
you will see him soon.

525
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,601
Sign a statement?

526
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:39,771
Cut it out.

527
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,201
Give me the token of your familiar.

528
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:45,801
Now.

529
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,401
Come with me.

530
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,331
When will you return it to me?

531
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,921
When you win the game.

532
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:39,611
Sign this.

533
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,241
Nothing is written on this.

534
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,131
What do I sign it for?

535
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,131
Do you want to go in?

536
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:47,371
Sign it if you want.

537
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,291
Gosh.

538
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,480
So many rules here.

539
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:58,416
(Yanhui)

540
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,416
(First Level, Dungeon Arena)

541
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:02,851
Follow me.

542
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,371
(As expected, )

543
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,811
(the sense of dragon horns is clearer here.)

544
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:11,920
(They must be somewhere here.)

545
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:12,401
Faster.

546
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:15,011
Let me out.

547
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:16,928
Get me out of here.

548
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:18,330
Get me out of here.

549
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:19,641
Let me out.

550
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,291
Let me out!

551
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:24,371
Let me out!

552
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,091
Let me out!

553
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:26,641
Let me out.

554
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:27,771
Behave yourself. Do not fight.

555
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,681
Let us out.

556
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,131
Let me out!

557
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,091
Let me out!

558
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,881
Let me out.

559
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:35,011
Let us out.

560
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,611
(It seems the missing familiars in Yongzhou City)

561
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:37,961
(are confined here.)

562
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:39,811
The newcomer is going to confront Tianyuan Tapir.

563
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:40,961
How poor.

564
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:42,131
I guess

565
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:44,531
he won't be able to survive after a few rounds.

566
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:45,881
He's dead meat.

567
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:47,291
Who knows?

568
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:50,681
Go in.

569
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,161
Are you the poor spirit

570
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:02,091
who's going to challenge Tianyuan Tapir?

571
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:05,571
(Kui Bull)

572
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:06,611
You're injured severely.

573
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:07,811
You need treatment.

574
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,161
Treatment?

575
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:12,771
It's good enough to stay alive here.

576
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:21,091
Don't waste your energy.

577
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:22,921
The monsters throughout the eighteen levels

578
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,331
in this Dungeon Arena

579
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:25,441
are deprived of magic spells

580
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:27,051
once they get in here.

581
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:28,091
Eighteen levels?

582
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:29,811
Which level is this?

583
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,371
The first.

584
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:33,771
What about the levels below?

585
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:36,011
A more ferocious battleground.

586
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:38,051
How do I get down there?

587
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:40,241
Only if you had won the game.

588
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,881
Unfortunately,

589
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,531
you won't luck out and go down there.

590
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,531
Lucky Carp.

591
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,331
Put this on and come with me.

592
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:15,966
(Second Level, The Arena)

593
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:36,141
(Tianyuan Tapir, Lucky Carp)

594
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:40,141
(Tianyuan Tapir)

595
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,116
(Lucky Carp)

596
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:43,771
Master Feng.

597
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,371
The view is great here,

598
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:48,611
Uncle.

599
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,370
Welcome to the Arena.

600
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:52,201
Come here often if you like this place.

601
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:53,771
Men

602
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:54,721
should engage

603
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:55,851
with fiery things and blood.

604
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,770
It's way better than

605
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:58,771
lazing around with women

606
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:00,401
that will dampen your motivation.

607
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,481
You're right, Uncle.

608
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:02,571
Forget it.

609
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:03,481
I won't bring this up again.

610
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:05,681
Take a sip of the newly arrived Longjing tea.

611
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:06,611
Serve the tea.

612
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:18,881
You slave, are you blind?

613
00:29:19,011 --> 00:29:19,611
Please forgive me.

614
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,961
Let me wipe it for you.

615
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:27,771
How dare you

616
00:29:27,881 --> 00:29:28,961
pull my clothes!

617
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:29,681
Please forgive me.

618
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,641
It's my fault.

619
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,721
Enough.

620
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:33,401
No need to be mad

621
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,291
at such a stupid slave.

622
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:35,291
You may go.

623
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:35,881
Yes.

624
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:40,401
Distinguished guests,

625
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:43,401
you're going to watch the wildest and most real combat that pulls no punches.

626
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,201
-Bravo! -Bravo!

627
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:46,441
The game is going to start.

628
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:47,531
Hold on.

629
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:47,881
Please.

630
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,531
Did you make a mistake?

631
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:50,961
No.

632
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,201
Hurry up and sit down.

633
00:29:58,571 --> 00:29:59,961
During the beast gladiatorial game,

634
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,531
the owner is only allowed to command the familiar

635
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,291
via the conch-shell mic here.

636
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:04,441
If the familiar gets hurt,

637
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,611
the owner suffers the same pain too.

638
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,011
The owner can call a halt

639
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:08,201
whenever you can't hold on

640
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,371
and quit the game.

641
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:10,371
Besides...

642
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:11,011
Wait.

643
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:12,811
Is there a misunderstanding here?

644
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:13,681
I'm not here for the game.

645
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,371
You have signed the contract.

646
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,851
When did I?

647
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,851
At the entrance when you turned in your familiar token.

648
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:28,961
(Yanhui) (Gosh, I signed that...)

649
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:31,721
(Did they take Tianyao...)

650
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,291
But I'm not here for...

651
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:36,011
The breach of contract is regarded as a renunciation of the game.

652
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:36,531
You...

653
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,401
And your familiar

654
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,851
will be owned by the Arena.

655
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,481
(Gosh, did Feng Qianshuo)

656
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,131
(set me up?)

657
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:49,291
Have you made up your mind?

658
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:50,331
Are you going to give up?

659
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:53,331
(This place seems perilous.)

660
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:55,401
(If I leave Tianyao alone)

661
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:56,241
(at this place...)

662
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,331
Are you going to give up? Answer me.

663
00:30:58,611 --> 00:30:59,851
No, I won't.

664
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,481
Stop talking

665
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:02,611
and let's get started.

666
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,961
All right. Commence.

667
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:11,011
(I can only command him through this.)

668
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,881
The owners and spirits are in place.

669
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,441
Coming next, the champion, Jin Wutuan,

670
00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:23,771
with his familiar, Tianyuan Tapir,

671
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:25,881
is against Yanhu

672
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:29,161
and her familiar, Lucky Carp.

673
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:31,961
Let's welcome the challenger,

674
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:35,531
the Lucky Carp.

675
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:43,771
Why?

676
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:45,201
Is the tea too hot?

677
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:48,161
No, I...

678
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:49,441
I have never seen

679
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:50,811
such an adorable beast like the Lucky Carp

680
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,401
in here before.

681
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:53,961
I spat the water out of surprise.

682
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:56,331
I will clean the table.

683
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,021
(Why are they in the game?)

684
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:06,051
Tianyao.

685
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:11,161
Show me your blazing enthusiasm.

686
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:12,961
Cheer, people!

687
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:14,771
Cheer!

688
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:21,011
Cheer as much as you can.

689
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,011
Tianyao.

690
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:23,771
Feed me with your enthusiasm.

691
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:26,011
Tianyao!

692
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:28,330
Come on, cheer.

693
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:29,401
Keep your voice down.

694
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,881
Listen.

695
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:32,161
When you get hurt in the game,

696
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:34,091
I will get hurt too.

697
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,401
How can this be?

698
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:39,641
Dodge!

699
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:08,241
(Why can't I move?)

700
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:09,441
Tianyao, listen to me.

701
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:10,371
The rules here

702
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:11,291
are nonsense.

703
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:12,371
You can't move as you want.

704
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:13,161
You can only act

705
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:13,961
according to my command.

706
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:15,331
(What?)

707
00:33:15,331 --> 00:33:16,011
Commence.

708
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:18,331
Come on!

709
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:19,161
I'm not done yet.

710
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,201
Charge.

711
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,051
Watch out, Tianyao!

712
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:29,681
Tianyao.

713
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:37,051
You cheater!

714
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:38,441
I haven't told him about the rules.

715
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:40,131
Tianyao, stand up.

716
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,291
Tianyao, the seal.

717
00:33:45,611 --> 00:33:47,331
I release thee, Flame of Wrath.

718
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:48,011
Incinerate!

719
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:54,291
Incinerate!

720
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,811
Come on, breathe fire.

721
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:58,611
Incinerate?

722
00:33:58,721 --> 00:33:59,851
I can't use spiritual power here.

723
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,401
What did you say? I can't hear you.

724
00:34:02,851 --> 00:34:04,331
They want to use magic spells here?

725
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:05,681
They seem to know nothing

726
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,010
about the rules here.

727
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,681
Tianyuan Tapir, attack.

728
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:09,841
Left hook.

729
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:14,971
Right hook.

730
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,281
Superb Serial Fists!

731
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:33,321
Tianyao, kick him!

732
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:34,841
Parry kick.

733
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:36,321
Throw him away.

734
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:41,601
(If they were to die)

735
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:42,891
(in the Arena, )

736
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:45,321
(Xiange will be sad upon knowing it.)

737
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:46,880
Attack.

738
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:47,961
Tianyao, dodge.

739
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,131
Charge.

740
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:54,121
Dodge to the right.

741
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,011
Sweep his legs.

742
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:56,391
Jump.

743
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,751
Punch upwards.

744
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,641
Superb Leaping Monkey, leap!

745
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,921
Tianyao, stand up.

746
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,871
Continue.

747
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:15,571
Left hook.

748
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:18,451
Right hook.

749
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,841
Well done, Tianyuan Tapir.

750
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:26,831
Oh my, he has collapsed.

751
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,761
He's just a mere familiar.

752
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,641
Don't strain yourself. Give up.

753
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:34,120
Tianyao.

754
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,081
Stand up.

755
00:35:35,161 --> 00:35:35,891
Stand up.

756
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,091
Keep on. Beat him.

757
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:43,191
(Tianyuan Tapir seems to have predicted)

758
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,091
(all my moves.)

759
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:49,521
Come on.

760
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:52,131
Come on.

761
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,321
Hey, you cheat.

762
00:35:59,481 --> 00:36:00,961
Judge, don't you want to say something to them?

763
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,051
All of them are observing me

764
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,241
and Tianyao.

765
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:05,931
They analyze every command I make

766
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:07,001
and give it to Jin.

767
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:07,961
They're cheating.

768
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,311
Isn't this a one-on-one combat?

769
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:10,561
Aside from Jin,

770
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:12,311
did anyone of them talk?

771
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:14,831
They didn't. So, they're not cheating.

772
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:15,961
You can hire

773
00:36:16,121 --> 00:36:17,001
a group of people to help you too.

774
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,121
Unjust judge and the cheater.

775
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:20,311
Uncle.

776
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:21,641
The team

777
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,931
is kind of interesting.

778
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:24,831
Will you please pause the game

779
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:26,416
and sell this team

780
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:27,641
to me?

781
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:33,561
Sell them to you?

782
00:36:33,846 --> 00:36:34,616
Aren't you using the money

783
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:35,671
from the Feng family, after all?

784
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:36,531
Besides,

785
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:37,611
you know well

786
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:38,491
about the rules of the Arena.

787
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:39,586
Since the game started,

788
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,271
sit tight and enjoy it.

789
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:42,931
All right.

790
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:47,131
Grab his leg.

791
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:48,361
Windmill.

792
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:50,271
(He predicted my move again.)

793
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,121
(I must figure out a plan)

794
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,081
(to deal with the cheater.)

795
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,561
Tianyao, run around the ring.

796
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,751
(I will make commands after Jin does.)

797
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,391
Step on him.

798
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:19,351
Dodge.

799
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,201
That's right.

800
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,011
Tianyao, roundhouse kick.

801
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,641
Tianyao, we won!

802
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,001
No, I'm going to fall off here.

803
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:41,491
Give your command now, Yanhui.

804
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,841
Tianyao.

805
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:45,841
Get down.

806
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:51,041
That was close.

807
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:01,871
(Xiange's friends are weird.)

808
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:05,201
Qianshuo.

809
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:07,681
You have shown too much attention to them.

810
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,971
Do you know them before this?

811
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:14,938
It's out of the question.

812
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,641
You know me.

813
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,131
It's just

814
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:20,321
that the beauty is to my liking.

815
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:25,721
Stand up.

816
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:41,011
Tianyao, get ready to retaliate.

817
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:44,891
Jump.

818
00:38:45,081 --> 00:38:46,441
Jump on the ring.

819
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:48,921
Come on.

820
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,791
Beat the crap out of him.

821
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:58,121
Come on.

822
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,581
Tianyao, kick.

823
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,950
(It's obvious that he doesn't have the same strength on his legs)

824
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:13,131
(when he launched the attack just now.)

825
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,391
(The weakness of Tianyuan Tapir)

826
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,451
(is at his left knee.)

827
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,121
(The traces are of different depths.)

828
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:23,391
(Probably Tianyuan Tapir's left knee is hurt.)

829
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:26,191
(I must find a chance to attack his left knee)

830
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:27,761
(to stand a chance to win.)

831
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,721
(I will lose the only chance)

832
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:31,481
(if he realizes that.)

833
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:34,391
Tianyao, stand up.

834
00:39:35,121 --> 00:39:36,351
Time to throw in the towel.

835
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:42,361
Never.

836
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:45,241
I will never admit defeat.
