(Episode 25)

3
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,420
Look, what does it say?

4
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,060
What does it say?

5
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,810
Read it to me.

6
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,169
"The notorious Yanhui of the Taoist clan

7
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,369
assassinated the Leader of Qingqiu.

8
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,139
Seeking brave warriors to capture this woman."

9
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,980
We must take a good look at what she looks like.

10
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:50,700
A reward of one thousand gold

11
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,980
(Wanted) for capturing her.

12
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,089
A reward of ten thousand gold

13
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,530
for retrieving the Ghostly Eulogy.

14
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,170
Kill Yanhui

15
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,339
and retrieve the Ghostly Eulogy

16
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,780
will be rewarded twenty thousand gold.

17
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,780
Twenty thousand gold!

18
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,420
It's twenty thousand gold!

19
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,420
I've never seen so much money.

20
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,250
I can't believe

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,180
my bounty is the cheapest one.

22
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,690
Tianyao,

23
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,220
there's someone beside us

24
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,899
who wears a roughly made head mask.

25
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,570
He's probably trying to hide his identity.

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,620
Could it be that he recognized me

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,250
and is after my bounty?

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,850
Stay close to me.

29
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,180
Don't wander off.

30
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,619
Changlan has made the people of Qingqiu think

31
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,020
you killed the Leader of Qingqiu.

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,810
But based on

33
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,020
Bai Xiaosheng's words earlier,

34
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,409
the real leader Chenyi

35
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,180
is not dead.

36
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,740
If we can find Chenyi,

37
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,530
Changlan's lies will be exposed.

38
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,940
Then you'll be proven innocent.

39
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,370
But where's Chenyi now?

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,570
What about Bai Xiaosheng?

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,620
Is he awake now?

42
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,250
Probably he knows something about this.

43
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,410
Why is he sleeping for so long?

44
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,620
We can't ask him anything.

45
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,689
There is a kind of medicinal herb in the market

46
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,940
that can cure unconsciousness.

47
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,250
It might wake him up.

48
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,020
We can only give it a try now.

49
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,249
Didn't the Dragon King

50
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,779
suffer serious injuries 20 years ago

51
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,850
because he trusted a female Taoist too easily?

52
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,499
And now, he has fallen in love

53
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,570
with another female Taoist

54
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,780
who's wicked and evil.

55
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,460
Such a Dragon King who can't distinguish right from wrong

56
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,089
is truly unfortunate for our Spirit Clans.

57
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,940
Indeed.

58
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,410
Mister,

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,250
I need Wake-up Herb.

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,220
Please wait for a moment.

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,530
I'll go and get it for you.

62
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,300
(Wanted)

63
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,340
Here you go.

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,370
Here.

65
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,780
You're...

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,220
I'm not selling it to you!

67
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,500
How could I sell

68
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,460
my healing herbs

69
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,810
to the Taoist murderer?

70
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,570
Taoist murderer?

71
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,899
That's the Taoist killer

72
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,130
who murdered our leader.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,570
That's her.

74
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,500
That's right. It's her.

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,180
Taoist killer!

76
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,210
That's right.

77
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,100
She's not a murderer!

78
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,810
She didn't do it.

79
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,130
She even deluded the Dragon King.

80
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,940
It's her!

81
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,620
She's the one!

82
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,300
She did it!

83
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,660
I may not have the ability to capture you.

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,690
But I have the right

85
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,620
not to sell you anything!

86
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,450
Of course,

87
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,770
you're not worthy as our Dragon King.

88
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:31,810
Strike her!

89
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,660
I'd rather burn it

90
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,330
than sell it to you!

91
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:33,890
Don't burn it!

92
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,610
Leave the money. Let's go.

93
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,170
All right.

94
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,250
Hit him!

95
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:38,810
Beat him!

96
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm the one you're after!

97
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,410
Why are you attacking him?

98
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:40,850
Beat him!

99
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,850
Come at me if you dare!

100
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,850
Beat him!

101
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,610
Strike him!

102
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,410
Attack her! Go!

103
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,170
Beat her to death!

104
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,140
Wait!

105
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,370
Don't

106
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,490
hit

107
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,370
the face!

108
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,780
Run, Tianyao!

109
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,220
-After them! -Don't run!

110
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,579
The female Taoist villain is over here!

111
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Everyone! After her!

112
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,100
Stop!

113
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,700
Hurry! Capture her!

114
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,100
Capture her!

115
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,929
Kill her for the money!

116
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,100
Don't let her get away!

117
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,540
Beat her to death!

118
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,290
After her!

119
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,050
Don't run!

120
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,020
Stop right there!

121
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,780
Stop running!

122
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,409
Hold it right there!

123
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,100
Stop!

124
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,580
Stop where you are!

125
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,930
Stop running!

126
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,100
We can stop running now.

127
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,250
They're just

128
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,540
some ordinary spirits

129
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,460
who were deceived.

130
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,020
Don't fight them.

131
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,610
I guess we've shaken them off our trails.

132
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,250
There's one more.

133
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,050
It's him again.

134
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,929
He's after my bounty as expected.

135
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,980
Why is he so persistent?

136
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,460
I guess I have to resort to violence.

137
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,290
No, don't hit me.

138
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,850
It's me.

139
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,140
Qianshuo.

140
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,810
It's me.

141
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,220
Feng Qianshuo?

142
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:28,930
What...

143
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,610
What happened to you?

144
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,220
To avoid attention.

145
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,730
Follow me.

146
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,540
Xiange told me to come and get you.

147
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,140
My best friend

148
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,220
is indeed light at the end of the tunnel.

149
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,899
Only the disciples of the Guanghan Sect

150
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,610
are here?

151
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,050
Yes.

152
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,050
The elders of other sects wanted

153
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,610
to wait for Master Lingxiao's decision.

154
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,250
Ever since my sister's downfall,

155
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,020
there is not a single person with courage in the Taoist clans.

156
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,490
Ma'am,

157
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,780
a letter from Qingqiu.

158
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,930
The Spirit Clan is now afraid

159
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,700
and has sent us a truce.

160
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,700
Are there any brave warriors

161
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:15,250
willing to accompany me to meet them

162
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,250
in Qingqiu?

163
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,020
We're willing to follow.

164
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,140
Go

165
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,410
And announce this truce

166
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,410
to the Taoist clans.

167
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,370
Show this to those cowards.

168
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:25,810
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,140
Are we staying here?

170
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,139
You're the mighty leader

171
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,459
of the Qijue Agency.

172
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,020
How could someone shrewd like you

173
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,489
let my friend stay

174
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,340
in such a place in Qingqiu?

175
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,340
You don't know anything.

176
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,490
Just go inside.

177
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,809
(Qingqiu Wangyu Tower)

178
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,290
This way, please.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,075
(Wangyu Tower)

180
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,610
Isn't...

181
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,810
Isn't this Wangyu Tower?

182
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,609
I was the mighty leader

183
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,770
of Qijue Agency.

184
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,419
Would I really let Xiange live

185
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,100
in a cave?

186
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,889
That entrance

187
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,130
was just a facade.

188
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,370
In just a short month,

189
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,730
while we were struggling to survive,

190
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,340
you actually

191
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,610
built another Wangyu Tower.

192
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,010
Wealthy people

193
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,460
will indeed be rich wherever they go.

194
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,530
Can you share

195
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,420
your secrets

196
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,340
on how to become rich?

197
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:54,370
And

198
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,840
do you need another business partner?

199
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,130
Stop.

200
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,820
To be honest,

201
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,980
I was very reluctant

202
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,370
to go and get you two

203
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,530
when Xiange asked me some time ago.

204
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,340
You've destroyed

205
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,579
the previous Wangyu Tower of mine before.

206
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,609
I hope you can spare

207
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,009
the businesses I have now.

208
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,820
Please don't get yourself involved in it.

209
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Yanhui!

210
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,610
Xiange!

211
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,300
I've missed you so much!

212
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,850
Me too!

213
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,489
Can you just talk instead of hugging?

214
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,580
You're all filthy.

215
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,530
You're the filthy one.

216
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,890
What are you saying?

217
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,730
I was jealous.

218
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,220
Oh, he's jealous.

219
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,219
Then do you know we once shared

220
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,769
the same bed and pillow under the moonlight?

221
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,340
Stop teasing him.

222
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,180
Xiange,

223
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,459
I have so much

224
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,010
to tell you.

225
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,580
Me too.

226
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:34,980
Come on.

227
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:35,730
Let's go.

228
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,180
Move aside.

229
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,850
Can't you keep her under control?

230
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:43,850
No.

231
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,580
Mr. Feng,

232
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,770
I have something to discuss with you too.

233
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,300
You're Chenyi's adopted daughter?

234
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,300
You were in Yongzhou under his order?

235
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,490
It was too bad I couldn't save Princess Yunxi

236
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,180
when I was in Yongzhou.

237
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,420
After I returned to Qingqiu,

238
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,220
I wanted to report this to His Majesty.

239
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,489
But they always turned me down,

240
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,370
saying he was in seclusion and not to be disturbed.

241
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,420
But this matter concerns the Princess's death

242
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,530
and the safety of the Spirit Clan.

243
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,940
So I used

244
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,220
the token His Majesty gave me,

245
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,180
the Nine Jade Strings,

246
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,890
to try to contact him.

247
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,819
Unexpectedly,

248
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,420
Second Young Master, Changlan answered instead.

249
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,490
Then what happened?

250
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,100
I suspected that Changlan was up to something.

251
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,490
So I cut the string

252
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,299
and hid in this cave

253
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,130
with Qianshuo.

254
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,370
Qianshuo used the Flower Medallion

255
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,610
to establish the Flower Bulletin

256
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,650
and help me gather information

257
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,179
about Leader Chenyi's whereabouts.

258
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,060
I knew

259
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:36,099
I recognized the secret mark

260
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,369
on the Flower Bulletin.

261
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,850
But before I could find His Majesty,

262
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,419
news came from the Royal Palace of Qingqiu

263
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,980
that you had killed the Leader.

264
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,819
I knew something must be wrong,

265
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,850
and I was worried about you.

266
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,650
So I had Feng Qianshuo secretly go and get you.

267
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,460
Xiange, you're a loyal friend.

268
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,460
Changlan was the one who set me up.

269
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,730
Why would he do that?

270
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,850
I don't know either.

271
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,010
But now,

272
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,579
he's working for the Lord of Dark Aura.

273
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,610
Lord of Dark Aura?

274
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,129
Do you mean the leader of dark practitioners,

275
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,180
the source of all evil?

276
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,459
I'm now also living

277
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,010
with the help of his power.

278
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,770
See this?

279
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,850
You...

280
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,850
How did...

281
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,460
How did this happen?

282
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,010
It's a long story.

283
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,220
Sit down first.

284
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,300
At that time, Tianyao dug out the Heart Protecting Scale

285
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,009
from my chest to save lives

286
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,010
and pinned Suying

287
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,340
on the leader's seat of the Guanghan Sect.

288
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,340
To prolong my life,

289
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,250
I...

290
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,530
What?

291
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,580
Then...

292
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,610
Then what about you and him?

293
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,980
Let bygones

294
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
be bygones.

295
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,529
I need to find Leader Chenyi,

296
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,890
whether it's for my own survival

297
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,770
or to clear my name.

298
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,890
I'll help you.

299
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,580
No,

300
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,459
you and Feng Qianshuo have just settled down here

301
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,820
for several days of peace.

302
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,179
I can't let you risk your life

303
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,100
for me again.

304
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,580
Don't be so polite to me.

305
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,769
Besides, finding the Leader was something

306
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,340
I originally wanted to do.

307
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,730
I'm just afraid I might not be capable enough to do it.

308
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,009
The only person

309
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,370
who might know Leader Chenyi's whereabouts

310
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,490
is Bai Xiaosheng.

311
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,130
Bai Xiaosheng? Is he here too?

312
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,340
Yes, but he's currently unconscious

313
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,890
in Tianyao's Qiankun Pouch.

314
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,340
What?

315
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,100
Am I hearing this right?

316
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,980
Yes, you are.

317
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,370
I want to join Flower Bulletin as a partner

318
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,370
in Yanhui's name.

319
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,100
You?

320
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,850
What makes you think you can?

321
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Do you know

322
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,980
your behavior

323
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,300
is holding a candle to the devil?

324
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,890
If she suffers any losses,

325
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,460
I'll cover them.

326
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,980
When you were in Yongzhou City,

327
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,770
you had to rely on Yuli to introduce clients

328
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,580
and earn a little money by helping monsters treat illnesses.

329
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,610
How are you going to make up for the losses?

330
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,300
With your innocence?

331
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,420
Check

332
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,610
and see if this is enough.

333
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,730
What's...

334
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,940
What's this?

335
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,820
Is this

336
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,610
even worth anything?

337
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
It is not.

338
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,180
Look deeper again.

339
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,130
Is it enough?

340
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,010
Yes, it's enough.

341
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,220
It's more than enough.

342
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,100
Thank you, then.

343
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,250
Find a suitable spot

344
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,980
to put him.

345
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:40,890
It's annoying

346
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,060
to have him lying around here.

347
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,060
As you wish.

348
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,130
All right, then. See your way out. Take care.

349
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,610
It's chaos out there,

350
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,300
and people are after our lives.

351
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,300
When is he going to wake up?

352
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,980
Will this medicine work?

353
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,060
Let me try.

354
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,580
Don't touch me.

355
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Remember this.

356
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,730
Bai Xiaosheng,

357
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,770
you're awake.

358
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,420
This medicine really works.

359
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,530
Where's the translated version of the Ghostly Eulogy?

360
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,980
Don't tell me you didn't get through the wedding ceremony.

361
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:47,490
Wait a minute.

362
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,100
You were in your wedding attire

363
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:49,420
when you came looking for me.

364
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,530
Well,

365
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,580
we did marry.

366
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,100
But...

367
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,850
That Brush Sprite

368
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,300
didn't translate it for you, right?

369
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,300
I knew

370
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,650
that old man is unreliable.

371
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,850
Where is he?

372
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,100
Let's go and settle scores with him.

373
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,370
It's not that.

374
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,979
He has been affected by Changlan's visual spell

375
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,460
and mistakenly believes that I killed Leader Chenyi

376
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,940
and is now pursuing me.

377
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,099
There is also a blind man

378
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,460
who's getting in my way.

379
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:11,890
Tell me.

380
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,180
How did you know

381
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,940
Changlan's secret?

382
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,180
On the day of your mishap,

383
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,420
why did you rush off

384
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,180
and end up

385
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
being imprisoned by Changlan?

386
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,130
It doesn't concern you.

387
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,220
Just answer his questions.

388
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,420
You better tell the truth.

389
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,220
That day,

390
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,010
the Lord of Dark Aura

391
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,770
wanted me to hand over the Ghostly Eulogy to him.

392
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,420
(He used my true effigy)

393
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,300
(to summon me in my dream.)

394
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,100
Venerable One.

395
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,580
What is taking you so long

396
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,300
to give me the Ghostly Eulogy?

397
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,340
Venerable One,

398
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,300
the Spirit Dragon has the Ghostly Eulogy

399
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,220
in his possession now.

400
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,460
He also has the Flaming Dragon Fang,

401
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,700
which can counter the dark aura.

402
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
I'm helpless against him.

403
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,180
My abilities are limited,

404
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,940
which has delayed

405
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,060
your great cause,

406
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,490
Venerable One.

407
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,180
Bai Xiaosheng,

408
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,060
do you think

409
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,580
I'm one of your puppets

410
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,250
to be played with?

411
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,340
Do you think

412
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:24,459
I'm unaware of your feelings

413
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,130
for that female Taoist?

414
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,010
You have three days.

415
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,730
If you don't hand it to me,

416
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,370
it's useless to keep you alive.

417
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,980
Yes, Venerable One.

418
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,700
(After I woke up, )

419
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,730
(I ran into the visual spell master.)

420
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,010
(When I saw him, )

421
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,530
(I realized it was Changlan.)

422
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,460
(We had a dispute.)

423
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,420
(But I managed)

424
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,060
(to release a strand of my shadow)

425
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
(back to my quarters, )

426
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,250
(hoping you'll find it)

427
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,940
(and lead you)

428
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,580
(to where I was imprisoned.)

429
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,090
Make haste.

430
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,050
Let's go.

431
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,380
You know

432
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,660
what happened after that.

433
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,530
I'm sorry.

434
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,010
It's all my fault.

435
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,810
No, it's not.

436
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,330
But this time,

437
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,939
I might really have to

438
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,770
take the Ghostly Eulogy with me.

439
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,979
If I don't hand it over

440
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,570
in three days,

441
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,220
I might not be able

442
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,940
to save myself.

443
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,250
We won't give you the Ghostly Eulogy.

444
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,090
Well, that's strange.

445
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,810
The Ghostly Eulogy

446
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,139
isn't yours.

447
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,330
It has nothing to do with you at all.

448
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,620
It has nothing to you with you even more.

449
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,010
Never mind.

450
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,090
Just give it to him.

451
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,290
We can't just watch him die.

452
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,250
Why not?

453
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,010
If he takes the Ghostly Eulogy,

454
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,860
what about you?

455
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,730
Forget about it.

456
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,620
I'll think of another way.

457
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,660
Wait.

458
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,090
Let's not rush into our own deaths.

459
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,330
Since they want

460
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:07,860
the Ghostly Eulogy so badly,

461
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,460
we'll give it to them.

462
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,660
I want to make a deal with you,

463
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,089
which is a sure profit.

464
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:17,940
At your service.

465
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
You agreed so easily.

466
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,899
Ghostly Eulogy! Ghostly Eulogy!

467
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,049
Freshly printed Ghostly Eulogy!

468
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,660
Is this for real?

469
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:25,980
Money first.

470
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,460
I want a copy.

471
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,770
Give me one copy.

472
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,730
-I want one. -Pay for it.

473
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,180
Here's the money.

474
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:29,660
We're the trusted Flower Bulletin.

475
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,860
-Give me a copy! -Pay up!

476
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,570
-I'll have one copy. -Give me one.

477
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,570
The owner of Flower Bulletin sure is capable.

478
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,180
Indeed, he is.

479
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,940
Here's your copy.

480
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,140
-I want one. -Here you go.

481
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,219
-I want one. -Give me one copy.

482
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:38,660
Let me have one copy.

483
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,620
-Here you go. -Give me one copy.

484
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm here for my reward!

485
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,810
I want my reward!

486
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,979
We brought the Ghostly Eulogy with us.

487
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,010
Give us our rewards!

488
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,730
Mr. Yan, it's them.

489
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,810
Mr. Yan!

490
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,900
What's going on here?

491
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,620
Mr. Yan,

492
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,380
I have the Ghostly Eulogy.

493
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,250
I want to claim my reward.

494
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,860
I want my reward.

495
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,730
Mr. Yan, where do we collect our reward?

496
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,860
That's right.

497
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,139
Where should we collect the money, Mr. Yan?

498
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,220
You're being ridiculous.

499
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,619
There's only one copy of Ghostly Eulogy.

500
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,380
Mr. Yan, look.

501
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,220
This is Ghostly Eulogy.

502
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,700
Look.

503
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,380
Go and get it.

504
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,010
It's real.

505
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,420
Look at it.

506
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,730
Here.

507
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:06,940
-I have one too. -Look at it.

508
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,700
That's right.

509
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:08,810
It's definitely real.

510
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,620
How can it be fake?

511
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,420
-That's right. -How could it be fake?

512
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:11,619
It can't be fake.

513
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,460
Do you not want to give us our reward?

514
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:13,489
We have the same copies.

515
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,810
It's indeed the Ghostly Eulogy.

516
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,530
Mr. Yan,

517
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,180
the Royal Palace of Qingqiu issued a bounty

518
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,379
for the recovery of the Ghostly Eulogy

519
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,290
and promised a reward to anyone who can retrieve it.

520
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,489
How can you go back on your word?

521
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,050
He's right!

522
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,620
-You can't take it back! -He's right!

523
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:21,810
You...

524
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,250
We want our reward!

525
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,420
We want our reward!

526
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,570
Give us our reward!

527
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:26,660
Mr. Yan, what now?

528
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,570
Lead them to collect their reward.

529
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,250
Yes, sir.

530
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,570
Stop making a scene!

531
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,660
Come with me!

532
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,460
All right!

533
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,810
Let's go and get our reward!

534
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:34,900
We're going to get our reward.

535
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,490
-We have a reward! -Let's go and get the reward!

536
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,940
-We have money now! -We finally have money!

537
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,570
That wicked female Taoist

538
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,330
sure is cunning.

539
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,660
She stole the secret treasure and killed the Leader.

540
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,660
Now, she uses Qingqiu's secret treasure

541
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,220
to empty our national treasury.

542
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,090
Quick!

543
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,460
Go and take down the wanted posters!

544
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,050
Yes, sir.

545
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,570
If she was working

546
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,500
for the Taoist clan,

547
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,419
why did she share

548
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,290
the Ghostly Eulogy with the world?

549
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,130
All right. The coast is clear.

550
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,460
Not a single person here.

551
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,740
I'm not surprised

552
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,700
that you could come up with this method.

553
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Birds die in pursuit of food, humans die in pursuit of wealth.

554
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,650
I know human nature.

555
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
Hui,

556
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,140
you really give it all

557
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,300
to save my life.

558
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,900
No.

559
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,930
I did it to save myself.

560
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,460
Without

561
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,010
these Qingqiu assassins around,

562
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,010
we can go and search

563
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,220
for the real leader of Qingqiu.

564
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,090
Do you know the whereabouts of Chenyi?

565
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,220
I did

566
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,449
something

567
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,410
to Changlan's shadow previously.

568
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,130
I may not know

569
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:00,609
Chenyi's exact location.

570
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,570
But I know

571
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,130
the people sent to find Chenyi

572
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,970
have all gone to Obsidian Riverhead.

573
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,980
It's located northwest of here

574
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,330
and is quite far away.

575
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,900
We know the way.

576
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,220
You should take this

577
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,330
and give it to him.

578
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,860
Lest he'll punish you again.

579
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:29,900
You're...

580
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,860
You're giving me the real thing?

581
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,700
If I give you a fake one,

582
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:33,330
the Dark Phantom will definitely notice it right away.

583
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,980
After handing over the Ghostly Eulogy to him,

584
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,490
I will regain

585
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:47,810
my freedom.

586
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,700
When the time comes...

587
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,010
You can leave now.

588
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,980
I'll definitely come and find you.

589
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,700
That Lord of Dark Aura is very powerful.

590
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,090
You must be careful.

591
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,290
I'll get going, then.

592
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,810
Make haste, then.

593
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,490
Farewell.

594
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:20,900
Let's go.

595
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,530
Where are you going?

596
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,420
Take me with you.

597
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,730
Xiange?

598
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,140
Are you coming with us?

599
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,530
What?

600
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,730
You're going with them?

601
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,089
Obsidian Riverhead is a place

602
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,050
where all things are pure.

603
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,090
Any power

604
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,420
will be weakened or dispelled there.

605
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,250
If the Leader

606
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:38,570
has been at Obsidian Riverhead for so long

607
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,140
without being caught by Changlan's people,

608
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,289
it means he has found

609
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,250
a hidden place.

610
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Even if you both go,

611
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:45,530
you may not meet him.

612
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,530
I have the token given to me by the Leader.

613
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,530
With it,

614
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,810
only then the Leader will show up to meet you.

615
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,090
Then...

616
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:54,290
Then I'm coming with you too.

617
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,620
No, you can't go.

618
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,810
You must stay here.

619
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,730
Xiange.

620
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,530
Stay here.

621
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,730
You have nothing to do with this.

622
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:01,180
I don't want you to be in danger because of me.

623
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,700
Didn't we promise

624
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,620
that I'll go anywhere

625
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,730
with you?

626
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,380
If you stay here,

627
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,179
firstly, you can pay closer attention

628
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,860
to news about the Royal Palace of Qingqiu.

629
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,330
When we come back,

630
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,290
you can receive us and help us.

631
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,250
Secondly,

632
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,860
if we're in danger,

633
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,660
we can coordinate

634
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
with each other

635
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,490
and you can help us get into safety.

636
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,380
All right.

637
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,860
Take care during the journey.

638
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,290
If I have any news,

639
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,730
I'll inform you through the Flower Bulletin.

640
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,050
All right.

641
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,859
Obsidian Riverhead is far away.

642
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,770
So we should depart now.

643
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,940
So soon?

644
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,250
Don't worry.

645
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,810
I'll take care of Xiange.

646
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,770
Don't worry.

647
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,050
What do you mean by that?

648
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,770
It's not safe to stay here for too long after we leave.

649
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,460
Too many killers have passed through here.

650
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,940
This location is no longer safe.

651
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,140
You should find another place.

652
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,700
All right.

653
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,050
I'll leave her to you.

654
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,570
Let's go, Xiange.

655
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,140
Come on.

656
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,730
I'll get going, then.

657
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,700
Be careful, Xiange.

658
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,290
This is

659
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,860
my Eternal Fame Ink.

660
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,420
Why is my handwriting on the nuptial agreement

661
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,140
scattered all over this place?

662
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:58,025
(My bride, Yan)

663
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,530
Between the hour of Chen

664
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,140
and the hour of Si,

665
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,420
it was the time

666
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,140
when Yanhui killed His Majesty.

667
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,090
If Yanhui

668
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,490
was here at that time,

669
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,730
then who killed His Majesty?

670
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:30,940
What...

671
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,140
What do you want to do?

672
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,380
Mr. Yan,

673
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,730
you know too much.

674
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,490
I didn't expect

675
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,010
a blind man like you

676
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,770
to be the visual spell master.

677
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,220
I fell for your tricks.

678
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,530
Mr. Yan,

679
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,940
do you know

680
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,460
what this place is?

681
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,379
This is just

682
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,900
where you want to imprison me.

683
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,140
I've wrongfully accused the Dragon King.

684
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,220
Now I've fallen into your hands,

685
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,620
it's my fault that this happens.

686
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,330
Be it to kill or to torture me,

687
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,010
do whatever you want.

688
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
This place

689
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,090
is where I was imprisoned

690
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,900
and grew up since I was young.

691
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,900
For hundreds of years,

692
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,290
Qingqiu has been trying to erase my existence.

693
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,570
But I think

694
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,140
I'm sure you know

695
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,900
about my existence.

696
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,860
But

697
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,730
you made the same choice as the former leader.

698
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,700
You always think

699
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,980
the law of Qingqiu

700
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,250
is far more important than life.

701
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,700
Am I right?

702
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,770
There can only be one leader in Qingqiu.

703
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,490
Twins

704
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,219
have the same appearance,

705
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,620
so it'll inevitably cause chaos.

706
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
The only way to avoid disaster

707
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,050
is to depose the second son.

708
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,289
This is Qingqiu's rule.

709
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,420
What an excellent rule!

710
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,730
Since you're very particular about rules,

711
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,940
do you know

712
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,220
the law of the jungle

713
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,730
is the world's

714
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,250
biggest rule?

715
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,660
From now on,

716
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,660
you're not to speak ever again.

717
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
This is the rule I just set.

718
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,250
I...

719
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,940
Lingfei?

720
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,010
Yanhui?

721
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,330
The evil dragon is here too.

722
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,730
You're the Taoist clan's traitor.

723
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,940
You colluded with the evil dragon

724
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,570
and sided with Changlan of Qingqiu.

725
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,290
What are you saying?

726
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,660
Are you still feigning it?

727
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,699
Changlan of Qingqiu

728
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,009
deceived me into coming to the Qingqiu border

729
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,180
and tried to assassinate me!

730
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,380
What does that have to do with me?

731
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,810
You just don't like me anyway.

732
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,490
You won't believe whatever I say.

733
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,420
What exactly do you want?

734
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,770
I want to return to the Taoist clan.

735
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,770
No one is stopping you.

736
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,050
Don't try to trick me!

737
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,700
I know I can't beat you now.

738
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,090
I won't stop you.

739
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,810
How can she not tell

740
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,050
between good and evil?

741
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,380
She even blames me

742
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,330
for Changlan's evil deeds

743
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:56,420
even when I'm far away.

744
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,380
She misunderstood you.

745
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,050
But it's true that Changlan

746
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,290
tricked her into coming for peace talks.

747
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,180
Changlan tricked her into coming for peace talks

748
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,570
and tried to assassinate her.

749
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,090
What is he after?

750
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,380
Perhaps he wants

751
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,090
to provoke a war.

752
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,980
She mustn't die in Qingqiu.

753
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,010
The Taoist clans sent someone for a peace talk.

754
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,860
But if she died from being assassinated in Qingqiu,

755
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,940
the Taoist clan will definitely be unable to suppress their anger

756
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,860
if this gets out.

757
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,420
The tension between the Taoists and spirits

758
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:20,700
is very serious now.

759
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,730
We can't let this continue.

760
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,459
Why don't we capture her

761
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
and send her back?

762
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,530
It won't root out the problem.

763
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,570
We could save Lingfei.

764
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,090
But we might not save the next one.

765
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,380
It seems Changlan

766
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,660
wants to provoke a war between the two realms.

767
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,290
The only way to solve this crisis

768
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,900
is to drive Changlan out of the palace

769
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,620
and let Chenyi come back

770
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,220
to preside over the matters.

771
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,330
We have no time to rest now.

772
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,940
We must make it to Obsidian Riverhead soon.

773
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,725
(Obsidian Riverhead)

774
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,180
Why...

775
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,010
Why is this place

776
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,050
so eerie?

777
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,250
My spiritual power

778
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,490
seems to be weakening.

779
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,620
You're affected by the Obsidian River barrier

780
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,660
because it's close to the Obsidian River.

781
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,940
The power of the Taoists and spirits will be weakened here.

782
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,140
Even a master

783
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,090
would be no different

784
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,010
from an ordinary person.

785
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,700
But my dark aura still works.

786
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,810
It seems that dark energy is not affected

787
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,140
by the river.

788
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,330
Xiange.

789
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,330
Hold your breath.

790
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,460
Xian...

791
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,090
Yanhui.

792
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,050
Yanhui!

793
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,289
Dragon King?

794
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,770
Dragon Queen?

795
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,900
They're nothing special.

796
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,570
This lady looks ordinary.

797
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,810
Yet, she made the Spirit Dragon willing

798
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,489
to give her all the Nine Stars

799
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,330
in his mind's eye.

800
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,175
(Yinghuo)

801
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,180
Yanhui.

802
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:41,860
Yanhui!

803
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,620
It would be so nice to have someone

804
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,660
who cared for me.

805
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,220
Who are you?

806
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,660
I'll be honest with you.

807
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,380
Lord Changlan ordered me

808
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,900
to capture you.

809
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,250
But now,

810
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,380
I carelessly fell for you.

811
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,530
If you're willing to divorce your wife

812
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,900
and stay with me,

813
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,700
I'll release you.

814
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,529
What do you think?

815
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,460
Never!

816
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,380
Xiange.

817
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,860
Xiange.

818
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,770
Xiange.

819
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,140
Xiange, open your eyes.

820
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,050
Xiange.

821
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,490
Get up.

822
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,530
Yanhui?

823
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,330
Where...

824
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,009
Where are we?

825
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,090
Who took us?

826
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,420
I don't know.

827
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,729
I'm guessing it's a dark practitioner

828
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,980
who can use the dark aura.

829
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,809
Take the Nine Jade String with you

830
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,730
and find Leader Chenyi.

831
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,700
You must find him before Changlan does.

832
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,250
I can't

833
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:16,980
leave you here.

834
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,700
I'll be fine.

835
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,050
I don't know where Tianyao is.

836
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,460
I still need to look for him.

837
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,660
You should go now.

838
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,010
But...

839
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,810
I'll be fine.

840
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,940
If I run into danger,

841
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,700
I can still use my dark aura

842
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,660
to fight them off.

843
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,380
Go now.

844
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,290
Hurry.

845
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,569
-Go. -Be careful.

846
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,460
-I'll get going, then. -All right.

847
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,460
Go now.

848
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,180
Be careful.

849
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,329
Where's my beautiful face?

850
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,220
Where is it?

851
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,570
Where's my beautiful face?

852
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,490
Isn't your face

853
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,980
on your face?

854
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,420
I kept her here

855
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:54,049
because of her beautiful face.

856
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,050
But you let her go.

857
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,180
Why?

858
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,419
Don't tell me you're going to compensate me

859
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,250
with your ugly face.

860
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,139
Who's ugly?

861
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,380
You're the ugly one!

862
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,460
You don't have beauty.

863
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,900
You tried to dress up but it doesn't look like you did.

864
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,050
What kind of flower you're wearing on your head?

865
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,900
You're trying to look cute,

866
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,860
but it looks vulgar.

867
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,569
It's a complete eyesore

868
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,740
to my beautiful eyes.

869
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,130
Oh heaven,

870
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,050
my unparalleled beauty.

871
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,130
And these lips,

872
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,780
if they were any thinner, I would seem indifferent.

873
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,380
If they were thicker, I would seem too seductive.

874
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,690
And this nose bridge,

875
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,380
if it's a little higher, I would seem mean.

876
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,340
If it's a little lower,

877
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,420
it would make me look down-to-earth.

878
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,090
How I love the way I look.

879
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,339
Only my exquisite beauty

880
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,610
can match

881
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,170
the unique and unparalleled Spirit Dragon in this world.

882
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,780
What do you want from me?

883
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,530
I have one reason

884
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,860
for keeping you here.

885
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,569
But if you want to live,

886
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,649
persuade the dragon

887
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,690
to divorce you.

888
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:13,740
I

889
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,210
Want to be his wife.

890
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,530
Sure.

891
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,009
Then he has to meet me

892
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,260
to divorce me, right?

893
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,090
You're willing to let him divorce you?

894
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:28,820
Well, I'm not surprised.

895
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,170
As they say, husband and wife are like birds in the same forest.

896
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,940
When a disaster strikes, they each fly their separate ways.

897
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,820
Yanhui.

898
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,490
Tianyao.

899
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,420
So you'd better persuade him to divorce you

900
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,419
and give me

901
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,050
the Nine Stars in your mind's eye.

902
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,610
Nine Stars?

903
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,380
In my mind's eye?

904
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,650
You gave them to me?

905
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:19,780
Don't even think about getting them.

906
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:20,860
Why not?

907
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,340
Am I not more beautiful than her?

908
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,900
I didn't give them to her

909
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,900
because she's beautiful.

910
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,380
Did you give them to her because she's ugly?

911
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,530
Do you pity her?

912
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,529
(Me? Ugly?)

913
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,900
My Spirit Dragon

914
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,210
sure has a kind heart.

915
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,610
But when it comes to pity,

916
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,900
I'm the most pitiful person here.

917
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,610
My name

918
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,170
is Yinghuo.

919
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Back then,

920
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,860
I used to be an ordinary little spirit.

921
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,819
My lover was unfaithful to me

922
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,820
and abandoned me

923
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,489
for another woman.

924
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,460
How hateful!

925
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,380
Later,

926
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,860
Lord Changlan bestowed upon me an elixir.

927
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,569
But every time I took it,

928
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,050
I felt something piercing through my heart.

929
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,780
The pain was unbearable.

930
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,300
But I endured it

931
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,380
for the sake

932
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:24,690
of preserving this peerless beauty

933
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,170
until I waited

934
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,010
for my most precious true love

935
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,860
to appear in this world.

936
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,530
Spirit Dragon,

937
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,740
you're my true love.

938
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,089
Take pity on me.

939
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,780
Have pity on me.

940
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,490
Miss,

941
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,780
have you been stabbed

942
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,050
by your lover in the heart?

943
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,530
Heart?

944
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,170
Have you had your body dismembered

945
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,650
by your lover?

946
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,170
Dismemberment?

947
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,340
Among the three of us here,

948
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,820
there are two people more pitiful than you.

949
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,610
In terms of misery,

950
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,690
you're no match for us.

951
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,780
I know

952
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,610
I'm unworthy

953
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,490
of those nine stars.

954
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,090
But even so,

955
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,460
I must return the stars to him.

956
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,340
It shouldn't be yours, right?

957
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,460
I don't care!

958
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,860
I want to be the Dragon King's wife.

959
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,860
Give me your stars quickly.

960
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,210
Otherwise, both of you will die!

961
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,050
Wait, wait.

962
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,820
Please wait.

963
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,690
Please sit down.

964
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,530
Don't be angry.

965
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,130
Be patient.

966
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,010
You see.

967
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,130
The Spirit Dragon is so stubborn.

968
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,460
I need to persuade him.

969
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,130
Why don't you

970
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,569
give us a moment?

971
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,690
I'll talk some sense into him.

972
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,650
You better don't try anything funny.

973
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,170
I can't undo

974
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,570
these threads.

975
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,939
Tell me about the nine stars

976
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,780
in my mind's eye.

977
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:15,610
I...

978
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,210
When we were in Yongzhou,

979
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:23,980
the spirits and I

980
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,420
once channeled our spiritual energy

981
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,130
into your mind's eye.

982
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,610
Those nine stars

983
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,420
were the remnants from that time.

984
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,609
But why haven't I seen them

985
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,090
in my mind's eye?

986
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,650
Previously, a grandmaster placed a seal

987
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,010
on your heart.

988
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,980
Now,

989
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,010
the dark aura is controlling you.

990
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,210
So naturally,

991
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:45,490
you can't see the whole of your mind's eye.

992
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,210
I see.

993
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,050
I didn't know

994
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,900
where those nine stars come from.

995
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,460
So I dared not give Yinghuo my word easily.

996
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,690
From what you said,

997
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:56,010
these are just nothing but the remnants of spiritual energy.

998
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,610
Why don't we

999
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,050
give her the stars first,

1000
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,299
and then come up with a plan to retrieve them?

1001
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,820
No, we can't do that.

1002
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,740
Why not?

1003
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,610
Yinghuo is more powerful

1004
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,380
than both of us.

1005
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,380
I'll never give them to her.

1006
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,690
Don't speak of this again.

1007
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,940
What about your Flaming Dragon Fang?

1008
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,860
Flaming Dragon Fang?

1009
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,380
Stop right there!

1010
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,380
We're here to capture you

1011
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,340
under the order

1012
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,610
of Lord Changlan.

1013
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,300
Get her!
