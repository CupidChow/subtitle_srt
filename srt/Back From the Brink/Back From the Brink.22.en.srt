1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,030
This dragon is so useless.

4
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,880
It wouldn't be like this

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,030
if I reached the third test

6
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,470
together with her.

7
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,760
Seems like the Ghostly Eulogy

8
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,919
will be buried

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,870
inside the secret realm forever.

10
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,920
Your Majesty,

11
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,590
Her Majesty,

12
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,640
I've

13
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,920
let you two down.

14
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,390
Yanhui?

15
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,830
Yanhui!

16
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,830
The Ghostly Eulogy!

17
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,710
Are you okay?

18
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,270
I'm fine.

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,960
What about you?

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,870
Why did you disappear

21
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,800
after the second test was over?

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,390
I...

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,920
What are you doing?

24
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,520
They're the true couple

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,240
acknowledged by the Ghostly Eulogy.

26
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,589
Why are you obstructing them?

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,270
You're the one who's obstructing us.

28
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,200
We met Madam Xuelin

29
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,480
inside.

30
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,520
She said

31
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,520
the first test

32
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,870
wasn't meant for a couple at all.

33
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,430
You two were too narrow-minded.

34
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,150
It wasn't?

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,549
How is that possible?

36
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,830
If so, what was the first test for?

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,870
It was to locate

38
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,430
people who care about others.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
It was to locate an open-minded and benevolent individual.

40
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,640
You're not qualified

41
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,640
to be an examiner at all.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,360
You!

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,670
Forget it.

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,920
You're but a child.

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,920
I won't argue with you.

46
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,920
Tell me.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,520
How did you two manage

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,830
to retrieve the Ghostly Eulogy?

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,550
And how did you two

50
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,670
meet Her Majesty?

51
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,920
(I've already parted ways with him.)

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,670
(If I told him)

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,040
(about the things I did)

54
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,480
(for the last test, )

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,240
(it would be embarrassing.)

56
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,520
(She already drew the line.)

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
(If I told her)

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,590
(that I kissed her at the very last second, )

59
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,480
(she would definitely be offended.)

60
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,760
It was nothing special.

61
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,240
I killed him

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,080
for the last test.

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,270
After that, I acquired it.

64
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,550
It

65
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,800
Was the same for me.

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,710
This is...

67
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,990
So, I lost on the second test.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,550
If I followed her

69
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,520
to the third test,

70
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,640
you wouldn't even be here today.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,760
Enough already.

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,080
We're already outside.

73
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,270
And we have already retrieved the Ghostly Eulogy.

74
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,110
It's meaningless to discuss

75
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,080
what happened inside.

76
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,590
Since that's the case,

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,030
the world will remain the same.

78
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,639
See you when I see you.

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,880
Why are you holding your fists together?

80
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,080
Don't tell me

81
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,830
you two are going to part ways?

82
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,470
They

83
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,560
made a pact.

84
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,470
They'll part ways after retrieving the Ghostly Eulogy.

85
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
Who will take the book then?

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,590
She will.

87
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,520
This won't do!

88
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
-Why not? -Why not?

89
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,150
The Ghostly Eulogy

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,440
is Qingqiu's sacred treasure.

91
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,080
It cannot be owned

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
by a female Taoist alone.

93
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,560
Since you two

94
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,440
acquired it together,

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
you two should share it.

96
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
We acquired

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,230
the Ghostly Eulogy ourselves.

98
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,120
He's willing

99
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,319
to give it to me.

100
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,200
What has this got to do with you?

101
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,150
Precisely.

102
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,710
I don't even want to criticize you.

103
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,390
Look at you.

104
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,440
You didn't even understand

105
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,150
the meaning behind your test.

106
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,440
You...

107
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,000
I wasted

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
so many years because of you,

109
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,350
senile old man!

110
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,830
You shameless brat!

111
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,000
Even the current leader of Qingqiu

112
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,080
needs to address me as Mister!

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,080
How dare you

114
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,760
question me?

115
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,710
And you!

116
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,710
You're selfish

117
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,790
for taking the Ghostly Eulogy!

118
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,350
Dragon King,

119
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,760
you're the ruler of the Spirit Clan.

120
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,320
You should think about the interest

121
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,960
of your clan too.

122
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,350
You mustn't let a Taoist like her

123
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,880
control what you do.

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,680
Old man,

125
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,230
you're a goody-two-shoes yourself.

126
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,440
But no matter

127
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
how unsatisfied you are,

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,080
it's none of your business.

129
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,910
Farewell.

130
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,080
Can you even understand it?

131
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,390
It's just a book.

132
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,440
Who are you belittling here?

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,350
Do you think I can't read?

134
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,030
This...

135
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,000
What is this language?

136
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,640
Only I can translate

137
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,320
what's written in the book.

138
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,390
Seems like

139
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,000
this is my business indeed.

140
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,390
Mister,

141
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,680
please teach us.

142
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,150
If I must say,

143
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,030
since you guys acquired the Ghostly Eulogy together,

144
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,120
you two should share it.

145
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,230
Fine, we'll share it.

146
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,390
Words alone are no proof.

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,710
What do you want then?

148
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,390
I want you two

149
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,590
to get married.

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,470
(Is this old man taking me for a fool?)

151
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,470
Both of you

152
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,760
must practice the Ghostly Eulogy together.

153
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,910
I won't translate it

154
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,759
unless you two get married.

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,350
You...

156
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,879
That's the first condition

157
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,680
after acquiring the Ghostly Eulogy.

158
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,560
The first condition?

159
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Is there a second condition?

160
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,080
Let's talk outside.

161
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,470
You guys don't want to head outside?

162
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,080
Do you guys

163
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,120
wish to engage me in a battle of attrition?

164
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,270
I've spent

165
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,150
several decades inside the secret realm.

166
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
I don't mind

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,470
wasting a few more years here.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm finally outside.

169
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:43,825
(Ghostly Eulogy has resurfaced. The new owners are Yanhui and Tianyao.)

170
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,760
What is that?

171
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Ghostly...

172
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,320
Look!

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,120
It's the Ghostly Eulogy!

174
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,120
What is that?

175
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,830
I thought the Ghostly Eulogy

176
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,590
vanished a long time ago?

177
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,030
Dragon King and the Taoist

178
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,960
have acquired

179
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,320
Her Majesty's secret treasure!

180
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,830
Mister.

181
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,080
What's the matter?

182
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,230
Miss Yan and Dragon King

183
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,030
have found the Ghostly Eulogy.

184
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
If so, hurry

185
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,680
and congratulate them for me.

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,230
Go now.

187
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,080
Okay.

188
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,910
What are you doing?

189
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,400
Yanhui!

190
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,230
Such audacity!

191
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,680
What are you trying to do?

192
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,709
I spent so much effort

193
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,470
to acquire this book

194
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,560
in secret.

195
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,960
But you announced it to the public right after coming out!

196
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,680
You!

197
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,200
Yanhui!

198
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,960
Announcing the names of the inheritors

199
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,470
of the Ghostly Eulogy,

200
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,280
that's the second condition.

201
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,230
But why?

202
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,590
The people of Qingqiu

203
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,590
have to protect

204
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,230
the inheritors of the Ghostly Eulogy.

205
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,110
Well, that was unheard of.

206
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
There's also a third condition.

207
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,080
The first two conditions

208
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,320
were determined

209
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,470
by Her Majesty.

210
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,320
We have to obey her order.

211
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,830
This stubborn old man

212
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,470
just had to be the only person

213
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,560
who could understand this book, huh?

214
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,630
(The Lord of Dark Aura will find out)

215
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
(that the Ghostly Eulogy has been retrieved.)

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,750
(I have no time to waste here.)

217
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,560
I have no time

218
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,160
to waste here,

219
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,440
stupid old man.

220
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,960
I will kill you today!

221
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,200
Bai Xiaosheng!

222
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,710
Calm down!

223
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,630
You don't need to go this far!

224
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,200
If so,

225
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,110
you can snap my neck

226
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,400
and translate the Ghostly Eulogy yourself!

227
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,560
If you guys don't follow the rules,

228
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,590
I'll rather die than submit to you!

229
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,350
You're not translating it

230
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,160
even when you're alive anyway.

231
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,230
What's the point of keeping you alive?

232
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,560
I can just kill you!

233
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,470
Mind your manners!

234
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,470
Mind your manners!

235
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,440
Don't do it.

236
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,630
Listen to me.

237
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,960
Although I'm angry at him too,

238
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,400
you shouldn't get carried away.

239
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,350
There's no benefit

240
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,200
in killing him.

241
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,470
All right.

242
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
You agreed to get married to him?

243
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,990
Since you want to talk about the rules,

244
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,440
I'll talk about them with you.

245
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,920
The Ghostly Eulogy doesn't belong to you

246
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,040
or me.

247
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,470
It belongs to Qingqiu.

248
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,800
Since it belongs to Qingqiu,

249
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,870
we should find an influential figure

250
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,710
in Qingqiu

251
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,830
to be our judge

252
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,870
and see if we should follow your rules

253
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,400
or my rules.

254
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,230
All right.

255
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,280
If so, we can find someone

256
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,960
who knows the rules here

257
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,800
so that I won't need to waste my breath

258
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,990
on you.

259
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,230
This is good.

260
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,350
This is good!

261
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,300
If...

262
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,130
There are no ifs.

263
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,220
Don't think

264
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,300
that you can write off

265
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,250
everything that happened

266
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:42,940
just because you acquired the Ghostly Eulogy with her.

267
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,180
Everything is written off, though.

268
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,220
You...

269
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,890
You forgave him just like that?

270
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,610
More or less.

271
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,370
Tianyao,

272
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,060
I heard

273
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,940
that you had found

274
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,340
the Ghostly Eulogy, right?

275
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,100
It was just a coincidence.

276
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,820
The secret treasure of Qingqiu has resurfaced.

277
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,420
And you are the one who found it in the end.

278
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,580
To Qingqiu,

279
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,530
both of them are worth celebrating.

280
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,370
Seems like

281
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,650
we have to hold a celebration.

282
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,180
Forget about the celebration.

283
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,820
We can't even read the book.

284
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,770
Why isn't the old man here yet?

285
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,940
That old man

286
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,370
said that he needed

287
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,130
to get changed

288
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,460
since he was going to see the Leader.

289
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,100
He's so pedantic.

290
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,220
The old man you guys mentioned,

291
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,250
is he...

292
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,340
I, Yan Buhuo,

293
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,180
am here to greet Your Majesty.

294
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,420
What are you doing here?

295
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,420
Such audacity!

296
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,820
Where's His Majesty?

297
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,250
Where's His Majesty?

298
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,420
His Majesty is currently in a retreat.

299
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,530
Right now, Young Master Changlan is in charge.

300
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,180
Young Master?

301
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,529
Since when did the younger twin son

302
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,299
get to be in charge

303
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,060
of Qingqiu?

304
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
This is ridiculous!

305
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,700
What's going on?

306
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,010
Changlan and Qingqiu's current leader, Chenyi,

307
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,530
are twins.

308
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,940
However, there's a rule in Qingqiu.

309
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,770
If the royalty of Qingqiu

310
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,770
gives birth to twin sons,

311
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,250
they have to gorge the eyes of the second son

312
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,530
and imprison him for the rest of his life.

313
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,769
What kind of boorish rule is that?

314
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,890
Boorish?

315
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,849
Since ancient times, Qingqiu has followed such regulations.

316
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,299
Twin sons are an ill omen,

317
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,890
and they will plunge the state into chaos!

318
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,580
We're already benevolent enough to keep him alive.

319
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,529
The current leader, Chenyi,

320
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,249
made an exception and released you

321
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,850
on account of your ties with him.

322
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,420
He granted you freedom.

323
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,250
However, you actually took advantage of that

324
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,340
and stole his throne from him!

325
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,180
This is utterly ridiculous!

326
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,820
Get out of the main hall immediately!

327
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,725
Scram!

328
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,530
What nonsense are you saying?

329
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,730
How dare you bully my second uncle?

330
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,060
The nine-tailed fox?

331
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,100
You must be the little son

332
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
of His Majesty Chenyi.

333
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,460
Where did this old man come from?

334
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,300
I taught your father how to read and write

335
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,460
when he was young.

336
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,850
Even your name

337
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,100
was named by me

338
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,820
under Her Majesty's request.

339
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,820
How dare you

340
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,370
be so rude to me?

341
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,180
You have no right to speak here!

342
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,420
Go away.

343
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,010
Since it has come to this,

344
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,490
please request His Majesty to come out of his retreat.

345
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,100
No.

346
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,300
It's inappropriate

347
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
to interrupt His Majesty on his retreat.

348
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,300
But we have no choice.

349
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,650
This old man

350
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,890
is stubborn

351
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,730
and has to be respected.

352
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,650
Please request His Majesty to come out of his retreat.

353
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,490
You blind

354
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,890
symbol of misfortune,

355
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,130
you'd better get out of the main hall!

356
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,175
Scram!

357
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,420
Second Uncle.

358
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,940
Even His Majesty cannot

359
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,130
say anything about your marriage.

360
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,610
Her Majesty requested me

361
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,730
to look after the Ghostly Eulogy.

362
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,420
According to Her Majesty,

363
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,370
both of you have to practice it together.

364
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,300
That means both of you have to do it

365
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,250
unless Her Majesty makes an exception.

366
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,610
If so, you can do whatever you want.

367
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,890
My mother has been dead for several decades.

368
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,300
You're just putting them on the spot here.

369
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,370
We can practice it together.

370
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,820
But why must we get married?

371
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,730
You're a Taoist.

372
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,130
Of course you need to get married.

373
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,130
Her Majesty didn't say we must get married.

374
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,130
That's right.

375
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,650
I can't rest at ease unless you two get married.

376
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,370
You!

377
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,850
Fine.

378
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
We'll get married.

379
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,460
What do you mean by that?

380
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,850
Get married?

381
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,060
I thought you were afraid of getting married?

382
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,890
It depends on the person.

383
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,060
Will you marry him?

384
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,770
Fine.

385
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,940
That's more like it.

386
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,220
Excellent!

387
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,650
(I thought Miss Yan)

388
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,250
(was an item with Mr. Bai?)

389
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,729
(Why does it seem like)

390
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,050
(she's getting married to the Dragon King?)

391
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,420
As the saying goes, as long as you take the right approach,

392
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,180
you can even steal other people's partners.

393
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,460
Who do you take the Dragon King for?

394
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,290
He's the wisest of all beings.

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,860
Once he sets his mind upon something,

396
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,530
he'll definitely get it.

397
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,730
Dragon King,

398
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,290
congratulations on your marriage to Miss Yanhui.

399
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,980
Mr. Bai, don't be too disheartened.

400
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,220
You're a guard.

401
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,860
Tend to your duties.

402
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,900
Where are you going? Come back!

403
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,140
Bai Xiaosheng, what are you doing?

404
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:34,810
Nothing.

405
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,140
Don't invite me to your wedding.

406
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,460
I won't turn up.

407
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,860
Get out of the way!

408
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,140
Huan Xiaoyan, you can come out now.

409
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,620
Why did you hide inside the ring

410
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,620
when you needed to see us urgently?

411
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,250
What's the matter?

412
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,290
Lately, I've sensed

413
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,330
something terrifying

414
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,220
within the palace.

415
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,090
I think it's better for me to be cautious.

416
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,330
Have you located

417
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,460
the visual spell master?

418
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,050
Yesterday,

419
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,700
I think the geomantic compass

420
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,730
sensed something.

421
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,219
It led Zhuli and me

422
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,770
to the place where His Majesty was on his retreat.

423
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,530
We met Zhao Yu there.

424
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,090
Screw his customs.

425
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,050
That stupid old man

426
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,980
always talks about those stupid rules.

427
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,700
My goodness.

428
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,530
What are you guys doing here?

429
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,660
How did you find us?

430
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,460
The entire land here belongs to my family.

431
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,010
What's wrong with taking a walk in my courtyard?

432
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,290
What's with

433
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,810
the spiteful remarks?

434
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,380
Don't bring it up.

435
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,810
Yesterday, after you guys left,

436
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,530
that stupid old man

437
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,380
wouldn't stop nagging me and Second Uncle.

438
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,530
I would've plucked his beard

439
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,860
if Second Uncle hadn't stopped me.

440
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,770
Look at you guys.

441
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,810
Why did you bring someone

442
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,460
as pedantic as him here?

443
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,570
He's so troublesome.

444
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,980
That's right.

445
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,330
He's such a drag.

446
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,770
By the way,

447
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,810
my mother's screen had been missing for many years.

448
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,900
Where did you guys find it?

449
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,660
Over here.

450
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,660
Over there?

451
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,140
Why have I not seen it before?

452
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,250
A magic spell was cast on the tree hole.

453
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,380
It's not what it seems.

454
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,180
So, you knew long ago?

455
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,810
Sorry about that.

456
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,250
So, you guys came to Qingqiu

457
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,330
just to acquire the Ghostly Eulogy?

458
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,180
Yes.

459
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,330
Did you save me at the Obsidian River

460
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,420
just so you could use me?

461
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,730
No.

462
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,460
If so,

463
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,940
you're still my buddy.

464
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,570
Is my mother's screen

465
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,460
still inside?

466
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,380
It vanished.

467
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,330
Vanished?

468
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,530
Yesterday,

469
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,090
the screen started flickering all of a sudden.

470
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,570
(It was as if it were disappearing.)

471
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,330
(We took a risk and entered the screen.)

472
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,570
Luckily, we managed to retrieve

473
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,940
the Ghostly Eulogy before it vanished.

474
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,900
Yesterday?

475
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,250
When?

476
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,900
When we entered the tree hole,

477
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,050
I think the sun was about to set.

478
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,860
The sun was setting?

479
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,180
When Zhao Yu destroyed your geomantic compass,

480
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,700
the sun was setting too.

481
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,530
Could these two artifacts

482
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,249
be connected somehow?

483
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,810
The screen belonged to my mother.

484
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,380
The geomantic compass belonged to my mother too.

485
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,380
The screen started to vanish

486
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,770
after Zhao Yu destroyed the geomantic compass.

487
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,050
Under the screen lies the Ghostly Eulogy.

488
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,330
Now that I think about it,

489
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,860
Zhao Yu is trying to destroy the Ghostly Eulogy!

490
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,570
That's right.

491
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,420
The Ghostly Eulogy can counter the dark aura.

492
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm sure he's scared.

493
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,770
Indeed.

494
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,620
He's the visual spell master I was looking for.

495
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,940
I'll go and seek revenge now.

496
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,860
Wait.

497
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,050
There's something more to it.

498
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,290
Right now, it's just speculation.

499
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,460
We don't have substantial evidence.

500
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,660
If we act recklessly,

501
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,980
we'll alert them to our presence.

502
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,700
If so, do you want me

503
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,530
to just stand idly by?

504
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
Zhao Yu is quite powerful.

505
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,810
Even if he's your sworn enemy,

506
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,620
with your powers, I'm afraid you can't even get close to him

507
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,770
when you see him.

508
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,660
What should I do then?

509
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,140
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

510
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,050
If you keep training hard enough,

511
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,620
one day,

512
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,090
you'll be able to strike him down with one blow.

513
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,530
He's a veteran when it comes to revenge.

514
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,380
You should listen to him.

515
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,570
Venerable One is still waiting

516
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,660
for the Ghostly Eulogy.

517
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,570
And you still have time to see me?

518
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,250
What have you done to that old fox?

519
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,810
What has that got to do with you?

520
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,420
The secret realm

521
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,330
only exists

522
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,180
because of the old fox's power.

523
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,090
By attacking him at this moment,

524
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,810
it's obvious that you're ruining my plan.

525
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,180
You've already gotten your hands on the Ghostly Eulogy.

526
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,530
Take the book and leave Qingqiu.

527
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,330
What a joke.

528
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,660
You don't get to tell me

529
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,420
when I should leave.

530
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,850
(His visual power is so strong)

531
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,090
(that he can control my shadow.)

532
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,090
Bai Xiaosheng,

533
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,700
are you sure you want to fight me?

534
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,740
I will let you off

535
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,180
for ruining my plan this time.

536
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,180
If you do it again,

537
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,850
I will never let you off,

538
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,530
no matter how powerful your visual spells are.

539
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,850
We've already agreed to get married.

540
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,370
You should hold your end of the bargain

541
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,460
and start your translation.

542
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,330
Be patient.

543
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,019
You need to go through the wedding ceremony

544
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,940
before you're considered married.

545
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,530
Let's go.

546
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,050
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

547
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,900
Bow to one's parents...

548
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,770
We have no parents.

549
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Skip to the couple's bow.

550
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:27,770
Bow!

551
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,940
Come on!

552
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,330
All right. We're done.

553
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,420
Start your translation.

554
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,330
There are procedures

555
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,090
we need to follow for a wedding.

556
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,220
There are procedures for it?

557
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,220
What stupid procedures?

558
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,050
Mister, please tell us

559
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,220
what procedures we need to go through.

560
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,090
We will follow your command.

561
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,290
There are six rites to a wedding ceremony in Qingqiu.

562
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,010
Matching, asking, preparing dowries,

563
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,810
cleaning, setting dates, and getting married.

564
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,180
Come on, have a seat.

565
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,050
Sit down.

566
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,490
The first rite

567
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,290
is matching.

568
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,010
We did that

569
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,660
when we were in the screen.

570
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,860
Why should we do this again?

571
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,570
Skip to the dowry part.

572
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,900
Give me a copper coin.

573
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,250
All right. Next part.

574
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,530
What's cleaning?

575
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,010
According to the rules of Qingqiu,

576
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,460
both parties

577
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,620
need to immerse themselves in the cold spring for seven days

578
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,770
before they can get married.

579
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,090
What?

580
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,180
The cold spring

581
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,660
gathers the essence of Qingqiu's earth energy.

582
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,700
It can wash away the impurities in your body.

583
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,809
Look at that flower on your head.

584
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,860
It's quite dirty.

585
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,090
Taking a bath is beneficial to you.

586
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,810
No.

587
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,140
Seven days are too long.

588
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,330
Seven days is the basic requirement.

589
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,570
This won't do!

590
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,730
I need the Ghostly Eulogy

591
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,570
to save my life.

592
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,050
I still need to practice it after you finish translating it.

593
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,529
And I might not master it.

594
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,250
The longer you delay it,

595
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,530
the more danger I'll be in.

596
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,860
Rules are rules.

597
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,180
We have to follow them!

598
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,330
You stubborn old man!

599
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,420
You shouldn't go overboard!

600
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,770
If we follow your stupid procedures,

601
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,490
I'll die

602
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,570
before I get married!

603
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,220
Since I'm going to die anyway,

604
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,530
I'll bring you down with me!

605
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,250
You!

606
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,250
Yanhui!

607
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,460
Mister,

608
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,010
Her Majesty wrote the Ghostly Eulogy

609
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,380
to find a successor.

610
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,220
Now that

611
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,220
you've finally found two successors,

612
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,570
you could've let the successors take up their roles as the next leaders.

613
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,290
But you're stubborn

614
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,860
about the useless rules and procedures.

615
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,660
If Her Majesty's will

616
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,900
was delayed because of this,

617
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,940
Mister,

618
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,940
how would you face

619
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,530
Her Majesty in the afterlife?

620
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,140
We've already made a concession with you.

621
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,980
You proclaimed yourself as the one who followed all rules,

622
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,460
yet you don't know when you should compromise at all.

623
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,460
On account of the Dragon King,

624
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,770
three days will do, then.

625
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,810
Fine. Three days it is then.

626
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,290
We'll go to the cold spring tomorrow.

627
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:04,860
You may start

628
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,810
translating the Ghostly Eulogy now.

629
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,620
After three days,

630
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,250
we'll get married, and you'll give us the transcript.

631
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,530
You guys mustn't slack off during the cleaning process.

632
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,460
I will keep an eye on you guys.

633
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,530
Got it.

634
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,330
Dragon King,

635
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,570
do not be happy yet.

636
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,700
Since ancient times,

637
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,530
all weddings require lavish dowries.

638
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,050
Please do not brush me off

639
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,220
by just giving her an ingot of gold.

640
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,980
Although I can't see,

641
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,180
I can smell the scent

642
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,140
of gold and jewelry

643
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,490
in the palace.

644
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,250
Tianyao.

645
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,220
How much gold did you bring?

646
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,940
Before this, I was penniless

647
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,460
when I was in the Taoist clan.

648
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,900
Now that we've crossed the Obsidian River,

649
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,570
it's easy

650
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
to find these things.

651
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,420
You're the Millennium Spirit Dragon.

652
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,860
Even if you don't love money,

653
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,700
many people still worship you

654
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,770
every day.

655
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,860
Over time,

656
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,420
much wealth has been accumulated.

657
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,490
I didn't move everything here

658
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,330
as I was afraid that your Qiankun Pouch couldn't fit everything.

659
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,250
Here's the Qiankun Pouch you asked for.

660
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,460
Thank you.

661
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,010
Judging from that sound,

662
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,700
could it be that you plan to give Miss Yanhui the entire Dragon Valley

663
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,090
as your dowry?

664
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:05,980
Sorry for interrupting your peace.

665
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,250
I'm fine with it.

666
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,180
I was just thinking

667
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,620
that wouldn't it be disrespectful

668
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,770
for you to prepare

669
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,250
these worldly objects

670
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,570
for Miss Yan as her dowries?

671
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,770
She will like them.

672
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,570
You sound happy.

673
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,980
Although Mr. Yan forced you two

674
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,620
to get married,

675
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,460
I assume

676
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,460
you're very satisfied with it.

677
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,810
I...

678
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,900
Initially, I promised her

679
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,860
that I would leave after acquiring the Ghostly Eulogy.

680
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,730
However,

681
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,010
I'm staying.

682
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,530
Although I broke my promise,

683
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,900
I

684
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,620
Still can't help but be happy.

685
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,330
You

686
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,980
just can't bear to part with her.

687
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,490
I can't bear to part with her?

688
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,620
So,

689
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,980
that's what it feels like.

690
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,980
Tianyao,

691
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
just treat this

692
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,490
as a chance

693
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,980
for you to start anew with Miss Yan.

694
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,620
Cherish your chance.

695
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:26,900
Don't matchmake her

696
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:27,860
and other men again.

697
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,530
I thought

698
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,020
we would meet each other in the cold spring.

699
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,420
According to the rules, I need to receive you.

700
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,610
You do play your part well, huh?

701
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,050
All right. Let's go.

702
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,290
Wait.

703
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,130
Mr. Yan said the dowries must be grand.

704
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,700
That's why I...

705
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,330
It's fine. It's just an act.

706
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,940
You don't need to follow all of his instructions.

707
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,090
You

708
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,220
can keep this pouch.

709
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,940
Be careful.

710
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,020
Is this the place?

711
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,130
There's only one pool.

712
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,420
You can sit there while I'll sit here.

713
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,940
Keep your distance from me.

714
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,850
It's so cold!

715
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,940
It's freezing!

716
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,530
Why is the spring water so cold?

717
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,660
It's freezing!

718
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,500
Maybe you'll feel better after some time.

719
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,330
I do feel better

720
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
after moving around.

721
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,290
Why does this place feel so warm?

722
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,330
It's so warm.

723
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,180
It's all thanks to this rock.

724
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,610
This cold spring

725
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,130
is more comfortable than I think.

726
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,810
It calmed my heart.

727
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:35,810
Let's go.

728
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,370
Why aren't you leaving?

729
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,700
My legs...

730
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,420
They grew numb from the cold.

731
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,850
They grew numb from the cold?

732
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,180
Dragons are truly strange.

733
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,020
You guys actually grow numb from the cold?

734
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,530
You should hurry up then.

735
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,940
I'll make a move first.

736
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,660
Zhao Yu destroyed Mother's geomantic compass.

737
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,370
It's obvious that he's guilty!

738
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,660
Zhuli,

739
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,530
has it been some time

740
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,130
since you last

741
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,260
practiced martial arts?

742
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,180
Second Uncle, I'm speaking the truth here!

743
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,130
Qingqiu will be in danger

744
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,770
if we don't get rid of Zhao Yu!

745
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,660
You're the Crown Prince of Qingqiu.

746
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,180
In the future, you will shoulder

747
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,660
the entire Qingqiu.

748
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,130
If you still don't want to

749
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,570
practice your martial arts,

750
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,770
Qingqiu will be in danger.

751
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,460
Second Uncle,

752
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
you should send someone

753
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,770
to investigate Zhao Yu.

754
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,180
Something's definitely wrong with him.

755
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,610
The geomantic compass only points

756
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,530
toward areas surrounded by the dark aura.

757
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,940
I think it's likely

758
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,810
that Zhao Yu

759
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,499
might be the evil visual spell master that harnesses the dark aura.

760
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,940
Enough!

761
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,180
Although Mr. Zhao is strict,

762
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,090
he has done everything he can

763
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,180
to serve Qingqiu.

764
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,900
Everyone could tell.

765
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,129
But now, you're maligning Mr. Zhao

766
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,940
by saying that he's the visual spell master.

767
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,460
You've let me down.

768
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,370
Zhuli,

769
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,850
as the future leader of Qingqiu,

770
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,530
you mustn't act based on the rumors you hear

771
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,610
and be controlled by your emotions.

772
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,420
But, Second Uncle...

773
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:05,980
Enough.

774
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,900
Stop overthinking it.

775
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,420
If you have time,

776
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,780
you should practice your martial arts.

777
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:14,860
Go now.

778
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,980
It's late.

779
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,250
What are you doing here?

780
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,250
Where did you guys go in the middle of the night?

781
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,650
It's a long story.

782
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,730
We went into the cold spring.

783
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,780
The cold spring?

784
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,250
In the same pool.

785
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,169
Why does that sound strange

786
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,250
when you put it like that?

787
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,500
In the same pool?

788
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,690
Are you guys going to ditch the act and make it true?

789
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,730
Wait, don't spout nonsense.

790
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,210
It was all because of the Brush Sprite.

791
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,380
We have to go there tomorrow too.

792
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,730
Rest early.

793
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,020
You should explain it to him.

794
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,050
I'll join you guys

795
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,690
tomorrow.

796
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,530
What's the matter?

797
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,650
There's no rule in Qingqiu

798
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,250
that forbids the three of us

799
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,020
from going into the cold spring together.

800
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,380
Why are you being a busybody here?

801
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,780
The wedding is between Yanhui and me.

802
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,210
What gives you the right to come?

803
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,130
You!

804
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,500
Because I fancy her.

805
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,980
I'm jealous of him.

806
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,300
If so, you can suck it up.

807
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,170
I can't.

808
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,210
I can't stand it

809
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,500
when you spend time alone with her.

810
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,650
If so, you can close your eyes.

811
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,940
Why are you joining him?

812
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,020
Don't forget!

813
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,380
You signed a pact with her.

814
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,170
Leave since you have retrieved the Ghostly Eulogy.

815
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,900
The pact has been destroyed.

816
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,820
I was wondering

817
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,570
why you guys

818
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,210
were getting married

819
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,570
when you said

820
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,500
"we shall never meet again

821
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,650
"in life and death" to her a few days ago.

822
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,019
I think you and the Brush Sprite

823
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,610
came up with this idea.

824
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,900
Stop arguing!

825
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,130
I burned the pact.

826
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,530
Do you wish

827
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,420
to make him stay that much?

828
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,170
That's not it.

829
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,820
I didn't know this would happen.

830
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,090
Speaking of which,

831
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,340
you said you fancy me.

832
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,050
When did it start?

833
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,250
It's so sudden.

834
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,460
Weren't my actions obvious enough?

835
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,820
Or were you blaming me

836
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,090
because I didn't complete the journey

837
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:21,940
in the secret realm together with you?

838
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,050
That's not it.

839
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:23,860
If so, was it because

840
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,900
I was abandoned by my parents?

841
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,610
I have no way

842
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,570
to change my past.

843
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,940
Stop finding excuses.

844
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:29,090
You!

845
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,210
Keep quiet, will you?

846
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,250
But your dismemberment

847
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,020
was also an entertaining act, wasn't it?

848
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,020
What a shame.

849
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,340
I didn't manage

850
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,530
to witness it myself back then.

851
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,500
Bai Xiaosheng!

852
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,500
You!

853
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,820
What's wrong? You got a problem?

854
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,860
Do you feel like punching me?

855
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,570
Bring it on then.

856
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,860
You got your weapon out, huh?

857
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,500
Come on.

858
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,130
Come at me.

859
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,420
If not, stab my heart.

860
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,980
That's what you're best at, right?

861
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,980
Bai Xiaosheng!

862
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,570
Hey, you overdid it!

863
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:09,860
I...

864
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,500
He has the Heart Protecting Scale now.

865
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,090
I'm no match for him.

866
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,420
Enough.

867
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,050
He went overboard

868
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,570
with his words tonight.

869
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,170
I'll apologize to you on his behalf.

870
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,570
Why are you apologizing to him?

871
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,900
What did I say wrong?

872
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,940
Just shut up.

873
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:30,980
He has the Flaming Dragon Fang now.

874
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,210
It counters the dark aura.

875
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,020
Both of us can only survive with the help of the dark aura.

876
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:34,860
I can't stop him

877
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,900
if he wants to kill you.

878
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,610
I knew you care about me.

879
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,900
Enough.

880
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,610
That's all for tonight.

881
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,650
I'll help you to your room.

882
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,090
That hurts.

883
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:46,980
Be careful.

884
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,650
Here.

885
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,250
You're seriously wounded.

886
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,820
You shouldn't go to the cold spring tomorrow.

887
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,530
No way.

888
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,730
That dragon is up to no good.

889
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,130
I have to go with you

890
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,210
even if it means I have to suffer.

891
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,610
It's not what you think.

892
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,610
What's the situation then?

893
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,420
It's a huge pool.

894
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,900
We sat on different sides.

895
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,170
After that, I stayed in position.

896
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,940
Listen.

897
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,690
The cold spring

898
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,780
is pretty effective.

899
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,050
After I went inside,

900
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,900
I felt a kind of peace

901
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,340
that I had never had before.

902
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,530
Look at me.

903
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,860
My black flower has closed up again.

904
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,050
Bai Xiaosheng,

905
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,820
were you listening to me?

906
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,250
I was.

907
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,940
All right. I'll head back first.

908
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:44,780
Be careful.

909
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,610
Don't touch your wound by accident.

910
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,940
Sit down for now.

911
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,780
Yanhui,

912
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,089
did you know how my mother

913
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,380
abandoned me?

914
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,380
Why are you bringing that up again?

915
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,610
The night is still young.

916
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,250
I wish to share

917
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,650
this story with you.

918
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,340
Are you willing to listen?

919
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,300
Sure.

920
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,650
I still remember

921
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,090
that it was a sunny day.

922
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,900
And she bought my favorite apples for me,

923
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,170
which was rare for her to do so.

924
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,090
She said she was going to bring me on a trip.

925
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,900
Back then,

926
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,090
I was delighted.

927
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,690
It had been a long time

928
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,130
since I went outside

929
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,210
after my clan declared me

930
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,380
the evil child.

931
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,020
She held my hands

932
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,380
and brought me to a remote forest.

933
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,980
She said she wanted to play hide-and-seek with me.

934
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,250
She said this.

935
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,980
Stand there

936
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,820
and count to 100.

937
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,210
I'll seek you out by then.

938
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,420
Thus, I started counting.

939
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,980
I counted from 1 to 99.

940
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,860
(And I counted from 99 to 1.)

941
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,730
I had no idea how many times I repeated it.

942
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,250
But in the end,

943
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,780
she never showed up.

944
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,380
So,

945
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,380
you didn't finish the second test

946
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,770
in the screen

947
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,980
because you were afraid

948
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,540
that no one was waiting for you at the end.

949
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,860
But I was wrong.

950
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,170
I should've believed in you.

951
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,170
That's not true.

952
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,500
There's no right or wrong when it comes to this.

953
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,290
I was wrong.

954
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,250
Do you remember

955
00:40:59,250 --> 00:40:59,980
the shadow maze

956
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:01,060
inside the Misty Forest?

957
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,570
The Phantom King created it

958
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,170
with my inner trauma.

959
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,820
Back then, I thought

960
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,540
it was going to be like the past,

961
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,540
where no one would show up for me.

962
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,570
But just when I was about

963
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,610
to count to 100,

964
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,420
you showed up.

965
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,090
Let's go!

966
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,860
Yanhui,

967
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,770
you found me.

968
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,730
(Since then, )

969
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,610
I have fallen for you.

970
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,210
Yanhui,

971
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,820
thank you for saving me.

972
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,250
Since I like you,

973
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,730
I should've believed in you.

974
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,090
I'm sorry.

975
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,340
I saved you

976
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,340
to survive back then.

977
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,090
Now, I'm doing this to survive too.

978
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,060
You shouldn't

979
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,130
waste your time on me.

980
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,580
It's impossible between us.

981
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,810
Didn't I tell you already?

982
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,290
I'm only willing to do this because it's you.

983
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,210
You're pretty smart usually.

984
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,860
Why are you so stubborn when it comes to this?

985
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,060
You should calm down and think about it.

986
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:03,380
You're the only ray of light

987
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,860
in my world of darkness.
