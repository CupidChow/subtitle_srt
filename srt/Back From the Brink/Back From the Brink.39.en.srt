1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 39)

3
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,949
(The Spirit Dragon should've burnt Dark Phantom.)

4
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,650
(Where is all of this dark aura coming from?)

5
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:30,403
(Why were these)

6
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:32,723
(not disintegrated by the dragon fire?)

7
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:37,248
Lingxiao.

8
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:39,403
Dark Phantom?

9
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,443
Your master used every ounce of his power

10
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:43,373
to seal me alone.

11
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,813
But now, there are hundreds and thousands of me.

12
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:49,603
What makes you think you stand a chance against me?

13
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:08,883
It's not easy to reach your level of cultivation.

14
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:09,933
Why not

15
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,843
join me

16
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:14,283
as Suying did?

17
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,856
(Self-restraint.)

18
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:24,385
(To think your heart)

19
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:27,343
(is void of all selfish desires.)

20
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,157
Human hearts are restless

21
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:49,877
and prone to err.

22
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:05,997
(Master's spirit in heaven, )

23
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,157
(to think he would enlighten me)

24
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:07,927
(to the great path of Taoism now.)

25
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,327
Many are regrets

26
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,157
when it comes to fate and destiny.

27
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:14,366
If you can see into your heart,

28
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,517
you will attain the power of a grandmaster.

29
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:20,167
You will understand when the time is right.

30
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:21,877
Concentrate.

31
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,167
Stay on the path.

32
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,607
(My heart is bright.)

33
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,802
There is nothing more for me to say.

34
00:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,723
I will sacrifice my life

35
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,174
to execute this formation.

36
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,880
You won't stop me for a moment,

37
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,928
even if you sacrifice yourself.

38
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,974
I am the leader of Chenxing Mountain.

39
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,094
I will protect this world

40
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,444
even if it costs my life!

41
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,364
Even if it would only stop you for a moment,

42
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:06,734
I have no regrets!

43
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,937
(Liquor)

44
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,890
All right.

45
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,847
All of Qingqiu's local specialties

46
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:44,698
are here.

47
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:45,578
Yanhui,

48
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,848
this trip back will be as if you're visiting your natal family.

49
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:49,578
You'll certainly impress them with this.

50
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,673
I haven't gone back in a long time.

51
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:52,847
I want to bring back some local specialties

52
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:53,968
for everyone to try.

53
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,368
Let's wrap them all up.

54
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,149
Yanhui.

55
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:03,808
What's this?

56
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:04,808
Is this yours?

57
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,368
Master.

58
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:16,658
Yanhui.

59
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:18,138
Yanhui!

60
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,458
What's wrong with her?

61
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:23,608
What's going on?

62
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,778
Something is wrong with the jade ring.

63
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,407
Master, he…

64
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,537
Why is there

65
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:31,017
such a demonic phenomenon on Starhaven?

66
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:31,928
Master must've died

67
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,097
to stop

68
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,658
the evil spirits from escaping.

69
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,172
The evil spirits must not escape Chenxing Mountain!

70
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:38,458
Everyone,

71
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:40,538
follow me to Starhaven

72
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,537
to help Master seal the evil spirits!

73
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:43,408
-Yes! -Yes!

74
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:44,368
Dragon King.

75
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:45,338
Dragon King.

76
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:46,538
What is that?

77
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:47,848
It looks scary.

78
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:49,258
Where are they going?

79
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:54,218
Don't be afraid.

80
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:57,168
(No matter)

81
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:58,338
(what we're up against, )

82
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,367
(I will not allow the Dragon Valley)

83
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:01,538
(to be harmed once more.)

84
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:38,898
Stay in the valley.

85
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,338
Do not leave this place.

86
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:41,408
Your Majesty,

87
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,218
will you not stay with us?

88
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,048
I'm going to find Yanhui.

89
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,048
(Good and evil are not determined by the self.)

90
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:13,018
(I decide what is right and wrong.)

91
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,018
(Mere ants)

92
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,698
(dare)

93
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,538
(to challenge me.)

94
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,018
(The strong always prevails.)

95
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,808
(That is the law of the world.)

96
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,168
I have finally returned

97
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:42,378
after 20 years.

98
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,168
Aura of the darkest,

99
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:46,978
gather here.

100
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,208
Heed my command!

101
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,048
Plunge this world into chaos

102
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,928
and wreak havoc!

103
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,245
(Our swords subdue all evil spirits, )

104
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,595
(and our chivalry will rid the world of demons.)

105
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,708
I knew you would come.

106
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,158
You must be wondering

107
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,757
how

108
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,548
I returned.

109
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,238
Your master

110
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,188
tried so hard to stop me.

111
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:13,117
He even sacrificed himself

112
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:14,118
just like Qingguang did,

113
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:14,828
but

114
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:16,428
I still shattered him into pieces.

115
00:10:34,998 --> 00:10:36,308
My body was destroyed

116
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:38,948
the moment the flames of the dragon

117
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:40,308
swept through my mind's eye.

118
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:42,588
I am now without a form or vessel.

119
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:43,758
But it was you

120
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,708
who awakened me.

121
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:48,067
It was your greed, ill will, and delusion

122
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:48,878
that brought me back

123
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,638
to the peak of Chenxing Mountain

124
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,358
once more.

125
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:58,588
Yanhui,

126
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:00,998
Lingxiao is dead.

127
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,518
I understand you are in pain.

128
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:06,308
You regret not being able

129
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:08,158
to protect Chenxing Mountain.

130
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:11,188
I can feel your rage,

131
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,188
pain,

132
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,158
and torment.

133
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:14,998
You must hate me.

134
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:16,668
Yanhui,

135
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:19,187
did you know what was the last thing Lingxiao said

136
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:20,828
before he died?

137
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,668
He said

138
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:26,398
he never regretted taking you as his disciple.

139
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,637
It's a pity

140
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,397
that he won't hear you

141
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,758
call him Master again.

142
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:33,308
You can't kill me,

143
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,118
and neither can you get rid of me.

144
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:36,948
You and everyone in this world

145
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,548
will all become my slaves.

146
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:41,947
All of you will serve me

147
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,478
and sustain me.

148
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:49,592
Yanhui!

149
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:50,282
Yanhui!

150
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:51,442
Don't let him get to you!

151
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:52,472
Yanhui!

152
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:45,526
(From now on, )

153
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,736
Chenxing Mountain will be your home.

154
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:53,461
(Master, )

155
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,922
what are these characters?

156
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,267
It's your name.

157
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,286
Yanhui.

158
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,246
So what if you're only a one-star disciple?

159
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,096
You didn't embarrass me.

160
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,576
You have your strengths.

161
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,126
You are true to yourself.

162
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:23,473
(I'll definitely)

163
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,305
(call him Master)

164
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,126
(the next time we meet.)

165
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,766
Master…

166
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,286
Yanhui, come with me!

167
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:56,526
Yanhui!

168
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,121
Master…

169
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,791
(She has succumbed to her inner demons.)

170
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,031
I shall take care

171
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,071
of you first, shadow spirit.

172
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:50,461
The dragon fire?

173
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,271
(She is a practitioner of dark aura.)

174
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,271
(How can she use the technique of a dragon?)

175
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:01,151
(Could it be…)

176
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:08,031
I'll kill you!

177
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:18,911
(Oh, no!)

178
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,911
(Yanhui is going to be engulfed by the dark aura!)

179
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:23,911
Excellent.

180
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,100
Very soon, you will become

181
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:27,431
a slave to the dark aura.

182
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:31,427
Even if that happens,

183
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:34,071
I will never let you go!

184
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:01,551
Yanhui!

185
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:03,806
Don't let them get to you.

186
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,261
Tianyao!

187
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:09,593
My master…

188
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,277
He's dead…

189
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,815
Chenxing Mountain…

190
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:17,101
is gone…

191
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,777
It's all because of Dark Phantom…

192
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,051
I'm going to kill him…

193
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,171
I'll kill him!

194
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,251
I'll kill him!

195
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,651
I'll kill him!

196
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,530
I'll kill him…

197
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:36,371
Yanhui!

198
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,251
Yanhui!

199
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,371
You can't let yourself turn into them.

200
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,341
You mustn't be blinded by hatred!

201
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,771
No…

202
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,821
I'm going to kill him…

203
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,291
I'll kill him!

204
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:06,851
Look at me.

205
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:08,331
Yanhui,

206
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,381
look at me.

207
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:13,771
Lingxiao's death

208
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,981
and the fall of Chenxing Mountain

209
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:18,181
are all because they refused to submit to Dark Phantom.

210
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:20,141
If you

211
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,181
fall for his scheme,

212
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:23,981
then…

213
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,291
Lingxiao's death

214
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,051
and the sacrifices

215
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,421
of all the disciples of Chenxing Mountain

216
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,981
would've been in vain.

217
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:36,091
You must

218
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,421
remain calm.

219
00:17:38,531 --> 00:17:39,611
No matter how difficult it is,

220
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,141
you must control yourself.

221
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:51,701
Yanhui...

222
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,771
they never gave in.

223
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,531
You can't let them down.

224
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:20,331
Master…

225
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,291
Yanhui.

226
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:31,875
Master…

227
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:34,835
Master…

228
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:11,117
(I've sounded the bell of death.)

229
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,795
(Where do you think you can escape to?)

230
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:03,035
Yanhui.

231
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,604
The dark aura has spilled into the world.

232
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:11,106
People will be affected.

233
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,425
The Luochuan Dragon Valley has the dragon's scent.

234
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,744
I can create a barrier with the dragon fire

235
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:21,795
in the valley

236
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,275
to shelter some of the people.

237
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:24,985
All right.

238
00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:27,395
Then, I'll absorb the dark aura

239
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:28,794
outside the barrier

240
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:29,875
to help you.

241
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,555
But the dragon scent can hurt you.

242
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:34,541
It's fine.

243
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:38,093
The world is enveloped in the dark aura.

244
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,703
I can feed on the dark aura

245
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,053
without worrying about consuming myself.

246
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:43,333
Yanhui…

247
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:46,813
Separate from each other!

248
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,613
My mind's eye is about to break.

249
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,013
I'm out of spiritual power.

250
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:51,013
I can't separate

251
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,223
the dragon fire and the dark aura.

252
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,053
Tianyao,

253
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,143
take Bai Xiaosheng back with you.

254
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:09,982
I'll inform the survivors to take refuge

255
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,053
in the Dragon Valley.

256
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:15,093
All right.

257
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:16,983
Be careful.

258
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:45,703
Let me see him.

259
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:47,093
How is he?

260
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:48,253
He's not hurt too badly.

261
00:21:48,253 --> 00:21:49,013
Come on. Carry him over there.

262
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,183
-Let's go. -Come on.

263
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:51,853
Zixia Clan.

264
00:21:52,253 --> 00:21:53,423
All right. Over there.

265
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:56,573
Zixia Clan.

266
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:58,013
You're from the Zixia Clan too?

267
00:21:58,463 --> 00:21:59,253
Yellow Crane.

268
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:06,383
Hang in there.

269
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:07,053
Here. Move a little over here.

270
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:08,253
Go there.

271
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:09,333
Go there to receive treatment.

272
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:10,503
Here's the gauze.

273
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:12,253
Here. Take this.

274
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:13,613
How did this happen?

275
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:14,903
Slowly.

276
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,430
Dragon King.

277
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:22,503
We saw the dark aura

278
00:22:22,504 --> 00:22:23,773
sweeping across everything from Qingqiu.

279
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:25,853
Mr. Yan suggested we come to the Dragon Valley.

280
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,223
We were right to do so.

281
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:33,423
Heal him.

282
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:34,183
All right.

283
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:41,503
Is Yanhui

284
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:42,663
not coming back?

285
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:46,983
Where are you going?

286
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:50,515
To do what I should.

287
00:22:58,943 --> 00:22:59,903
I fixed the Flower Medallion.

288
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,143
It's a dangerous path ahead.

289
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:02,903
At least let us know you're safe.

290
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:09,596
Thank you.

291
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:10,533
Take care.

292
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,143
It's a shooting star!

293
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:20,923
No.

294
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:23,423
That's hope.

295
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:31,503
Is anyone here?

296
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:56,293
(They haven't been)

297
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:57,663
(completely devoured by the dark aura yet.)

298
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,383
(Maybe I can try)

299
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:00,503
(to absorb the dark aura)

300
00:24:00,503 --> 00:24:01,223
(inside them.)

301
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,503
(Almost…)

302
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,533
(Almost there…)

303
00:24:47,983 --> 00:24:49,293
Give up.

304
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:51,013
It's useless.

305
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:53,613
Resistance is futile.

306
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,670
You can't get rid of the evil

307
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:58,813
in people.

308
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:30,533
(That's…)

309
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,383
(Zichen!)

310
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:36,703
(Ziyue!)

311
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:44,703
(Chenxing Mountain isn't gone!)

312
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,813
(Chenxing Mountain is still here!)

313
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:21,773
Yanhui,

314
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:22,533
are you all right?

315
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:25,903
Zichen...

316
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,223
Is Chenxing Mountain still there?

317
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:29,383
Yes.

318
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,743
-It is. -It's still there.

319
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,052
Chenxing Mountain still exists?

320
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:34,903
Yes.

321
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,143
Zichen.

322
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:47,223
Ziyue.

323
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:48,613
This is

324
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:50,183
the entrance to the Dragon Valley.

325
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:51,703
Hurry inside

326
00:26:51,813 --> 00:26:52,813
and get your injuries treated.

327
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:54,663
Aren't you coming with us?

328
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:57,943
No.

329
00:26:58,613 --> 00:26:59,773
I'm going to search

330
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:01,503
for other survivors.

331
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,253
Let's go.

332
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:09,383
Yanhui.

333
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:12,983
I didn't use to like you.

334
00:27:13,503 --> 00:27:14,093
Ziyue.

335
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:15,813
I know.

336
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:17,463
Even when you were chased

337
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:18,663
out of the Chenxing Mountain,

338
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:20,382
people who didn't like you

339
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:21,503
didn't feel any happier.

340
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,853
The day you were expelled,

341
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,253
Master came to the entrance too.

342
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:32,773
(I complained to him)

343
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:34,853
(that you were heartless.)

344
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:36,903
(You lived here for a decade.)

345
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,773
(Yet you never once turned back when you left.)

346
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:44,743
Master has always been a man of few words.

347
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,093
But that day, he told me…

348
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,853
(This is what Yanhui should be like.)

349
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:55,983
(He knew)

350
00:27:56,503 --> 00:27:58,013
(that even on your own, )

351
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:00,383
you would continue forth

352
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:02,423
just fine

353
00:28:02,663 --> 00:28:03,663
with your back straight,

354
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:06,053
strong and determined.

355
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:12,983
I will not disappoint him.

356
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:08,223
Still haven't given up?

357
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,813
I am the embodiment of the evil in the human heart,

358
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:17,532
formed by greed, ill will, and delusion

359
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:18,613
of the world.

360
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:20,743
You are the Spiritual Dragon of Heaven and Earth.

361
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:22,333
You can destroy my vessel of flesh,

362
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:25,293
but you cannot rid the demons in human hearts.

363
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:30,572
You will never be able

364
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:32,183
to defeat me completely.

365
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,423
You'll only fall

366
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:35,423
into meaningless struggles time and time again.

367
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,662
The world will only grow desperate

368
00:29:51,663 --> 00:29:53,253
and numb

369
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:56,013
in this endless tangle.

370
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,143
No one will thank you.

371
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:02,053
They might not even remember you.

372
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:05,013
Good and evil. Light and dark.

373
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:07,813
I will turn all of them upside down.

374
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:10,253
When the time comes,

375
00:30:10,503 --> 00:30:12,253
you will be the one

376
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,983
regarded as an anomaly.

377
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,903
Only one himself can decide to whether be good or evil.

378
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:20,533
It is not for you to manipulate!

379
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,573
I will kill you no matter how many times

380
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:26,383
you come back to life!

381
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:33,573
Yanhui…

382
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,503
Yanhui.

383
00:30:44,383 --> 00:30:45,533
How did I get here?

384
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,053
How long have I been asleep?

385
00:30:47,634 --> 00:30:48,744
It has been about five days.

386
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:49,813
Where's Yanhui?

387
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:51,253
Tianyao?

388
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,663
They're protecting everyone

389
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:57,821
in their own ways.

390
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:06,463
(Good and evil are only one thought away)

391
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:10,663
(from human or spirit.)

392
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:15,463
(Let fate take its course and take what may come as it is.)

393
00:31:16,183 --> 00:31:17,853
(All may ascend to immortality)

394
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,613
(with a calm mind.)

395
00:31:20,853 --> 00:31:24,253
(Good and evil are only one thought away)

396
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:27,532
(from human or spirit.)

397
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:28,703
What's going on here?

398
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:33,142
(Let fate take its course and take what may come as it is.)

399
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:34,183
This is Chenxing Mountain's divine chant.

400
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,246
It can dispel impure thoughts

401
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:36,046
from one's mind.

402
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:37,456
We don't know

403
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:38,456
how effective it is,

404
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:40,856
but this is the only thing.

405
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:42,566
I can do now.

406
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,285
(From human or spirit…)

407
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,726
So I will do my best.

408
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,805
(Let fate take its course...)

409
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:49,286
You're right.

410
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,806
(and take what may come as it is.)

411
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:51,594
You guys…

412
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,336
(All may ascend to immortality…)

413
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:55,286
Well-said.

414
00:31:55,486 --> 00:31:56,246
Right now,

415
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:57,455
we do

416
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:58,416
what we can.

417
00:31:58,766 --> 00:31:59,965
The dark aura out there comes

418
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,456
from the ill thoughts in people's minds.

419
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,375
If we can reduce those thoughts,

420
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:04,286
we will be helping.

421
00:32:04,286 --> 00:32:05,136
Tianyao and Yanhui.

422
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:06,656
(Let fate take its course)

423
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:07,206
They're…

424
00:32:07,207 --> 00:32:08,806
(and take what may come as it is.)

425
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:09,766
outside.

426
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:10,855
(All may ascend to immortality…)

427
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:11,566
It's no use worrying about them.

428
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:14,806
I think we should all voice

429
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:17,045
our thoughts and regrets

430
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:17,936
with this divine chant.

431
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,806
Let us not let them fester into resentment.

432
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:22,806
My greatest regret is not being able

433
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:24,286
to return

434
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:25,376
to Chenxing Mountain at the end.

435
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,096
But you're still here.

436
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:29,136
You being alive has already given Yanhui

437
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:30,856
a lot of hope.

438
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:34,726
What troubles me most

439
00:32:36,486 --> 00:32:37,896
is being unable to promise my wife and child

440
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:39,616
a peaceful future.

441
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,246
(Let fate take its course…)

442
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:43,766
Whatever the future holds,

443
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:44,771
I am

444
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,006
with you.

445
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:48,566
My biggest regret

446
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:50,616
is not being able

447
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:51,726
to say goodbye to my father.

448
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:54,655
I didn't get to say goodbye

449
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:55,416
to His Majesty too.

450
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:56,895
But don't be sad,

451
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:57,896
Zhuli.

452
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,566
Life's partings are always in such a hurry.

453
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:02,695
We just have to live each remaining day

454
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:03,766
to the fullest

455
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:06,136
and not leave any more regrets.

456
00:33:10,286 --> 00:33:11,966
The hardest thing for me to let go of

457
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,656
is pushing the only one I ever loved

458
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:16,455
into another's arms.

459
00:33:16,456 --> 00:33:20,176
(Let fate take its course and take what may come as it is.)

460
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,696
(All may ascend to immortality)

461
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:24,285
(with a calm mind.)

462
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:25,765
No one can top that.

463
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:29,046
(Good and evil are only one thought away)

464
00:33:29,656 --> 00:33:31,525
(from human or spirit.)

465
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:33,486
These are special circumstances.

466
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:36,231
No more holding grudges for you.

467
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:38,797
I'm over it.

468
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,092
Now, I know

469
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:43,332
that it can be a blessing to let someone

470
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:46,542
find happiness with another.

471
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:09,682
I haven't seen a survivor in a long time.

472
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:10,892
The outside world…

473
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:19,162
It's a pity that I cannot do anything

474
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:22,282
about the ones that have been turned into scorched dirt.

475
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:26,682
Yanhui.

476
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:27,972
Bai Xiaosheng!

477
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:28,932
Why did you come out here?

478
00:35:28,932 --> 00:35:29,452
I'm fine.

479
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:30,971
I heard you were saving people in the Dragon Valley,

480
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:31,682
so I came to check on you.

481
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:33,242
It's dangerous out there. Go back inside.

482
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:36,091
I haven't fully recovered yet,

483
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,322
but I can handle being out here for a while.

484
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:41,202
And I need

485
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:42,572
to give you this too.

486
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:44,932
A Flower Medallion?

487
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:47,572
Tianyao has one too.

488
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:49,162
I hope this lets you guys get in touch with each other.

489
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:50,957
Tianyao?

490
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:55,242
He's still fighting against Dark Phantom.

491
00:35:55,642 --> 00:35:56,572
Just like you,

492
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:57,972
he hasn't given up.

493
00:36:01,052 --> 00:36:02,372
Yet there's nothing I can do.

494
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:04,892
I'm really sorry.

495
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,972
People in the Dragon Valley are in low spirits too.

496
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:10,972
Tell them to hang in there.

497
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:13,532
There will be

498
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:16,612
hope.

499
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,012
(How long has it been?)

500
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:43,052
(One day?)

501
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:44,972
(Two days?)

502
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,452
(A month?)

503
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:49,722
(Two months?)

504
00:36:51,282 --> 00:36:52,242
Tianyao.

505
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:54,682
Tianyao.

506
00:36:56,452 --> 00:36:57,722
Can you hear me?

507
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:04,162
Tianyao?

508
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:11,202
Yanhui,

509
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:12,202
I'm here.

510
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:15,532
Tianyao!

511
00:37:15,642 --> 00:37:16,572
Where are you?

512
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:17,842
Are you all right?

513
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:23,012
The Misty Forest.

514
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:25,572
Dark Phantom keeps resurrecting.

515
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:27,532
I can only dispel him

516
00:37:28,322 --> 00:37:29,642
over and over again

517
00:37:31,202 --> 00:37:32,282
with the dragon fire.

518
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,322
These days,

519
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,932
I've been searching

520
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:40,372
for survivors too.

521
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,762
I brought them back to the Dragon Valley.

522
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:48,282
But there are so many more

523
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,722
that have been turned into scorched dirt

524
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:52,972
by the dark aura.

525
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,722
There is nothing I can do to help them.

526
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:03,572
Tianyao…

527
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:08,372
I'm scared.

528
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,492
Dark Phantom's power

529
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:17,932
is beyond everything we imagined.

530
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,452
Before this,

531
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:28,121
I always thought

532
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,412
we could do it.

533
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,372
There had to be a way.

534
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:35,802
But what if

535
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,372
there's really nothing we can do this time?

536
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,282
What if

537
00:38:42,932 --> 00:38:44,762
we are powerless against him?

538
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:56,285
Yanhui,

539
00:38:58,092 --> 00:38:59,892
I've been fighting against Dark Phantom up until now.

540
00:39:00,892 --> 00:39:02,452
I can no longer tell day from night.

541
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,572
It always seems that the nights are longer

542
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:09,309
than the days here.

543
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,680
I don't know

544
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:15,572
if I can defeat him either.

545
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:19,572
But at least

546
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:20,972
the moment

547
00:39:20,973 --> 00:39:22,532
I dispel the dark aura with my dragon fire,

548
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,242
all of you are safe.

549
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,314
Maybe that will let you

550
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:36,969
save just one more life.

551
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,759
That makes this

552
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,489
all worth it.

553
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:47,849
Yanhui,

554
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:51,489
I have been in many desperate situations

555
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,929
in my life.

556
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:57,239
Every step feels as if.

557
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,119
I am treading on the brink of the abyss.

558
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:06,759
The only thing I can do

559
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:10,159
is give everything I have

560
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:12,969
to defy

561
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,009
fate.

562
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:20,889
Tianyao.

563
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,409
The most fortunate thing

564
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,449
to happen to me in this life

565
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,849
is to have you with me

566
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,009
when I am at the end of my tether

567
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:37,944
and have nothing left.

568
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:42,809
Come Yama or underworld...

569
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,009
I will be by your side.

570
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,449
(We can only change destiny)

571
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:31,889
(if we spare no effort.)
