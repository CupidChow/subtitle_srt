1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,640
Come on.

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,080
Let's go.

5
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,160
This piece of junk.

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,190
Don't drink this.

7
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,150
(Kill him.)

8
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,960
(Retrieve the Heart Protecting Scale.)

9
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,990
Don't tell me you're going soft on him.

10
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,710
(Why do I hear a voice)

11
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,670
(in my head?)

12
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,760
Do you remember

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,590
what you got in return

14
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,670
when you ran back in such a hurry that day?

15
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,150
I do.

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,080
My mind has been fuzzy

17
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,990
ever since

18
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,640
this black flower grew out.

19
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,830
(As expected.)

20
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,920
(There's something wrong with Yanhui's mind's eye.)

21
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,870
Could it be the Lord of Dark Aura?

22
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,920
Let me inside your mind's eye.

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,830
I can't believe

24
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,640
how fast

25
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,080
these equinox flowers are growing.

26
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,640
It hasn't even been a month,

27
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,870
and they've almost enshrouded my mind's eye.

28
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,200
It is his doing.

29
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,800
The Lord of Dark Aura plans

30
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,199
to use the roots of the equinox flower

31
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,080
to control you.

32
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,670
When the equinox flowers

33
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,710
grow all over your mind's eye,

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,800
you'll become

35
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,110
his puppet.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,549
So that's what he meant

37
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,240
when he mentioned three months.

38
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,670
Three months?

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,479
He wants me to get him the Heart Protecting Scale

40
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,830
in three months.

41
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,869
Why didn't you tell me

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,110
about something so important?

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,870
I'm not planning on doing what he says.

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,040
Besides,

45
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,320
that dragon is strong now.

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,430
I don't stand a chance against him.

47
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,240
Listen up.

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,989
That dragon feels guilty

49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,320
for what he did to you.

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,670
You don't even need to lift a finger.

51
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,150
Do you know where that scale is?

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,479
It's right on your lips.

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,430
Just ask him,

54
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,710
and he'll give it to you.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,040
I don't want to do that.

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
Yanhui, I'm begging you.

57
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,000
Please don't be stubborn.

58
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,469
There's nothing more important

59
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,030
than your life right now.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,150
I'm not being stubborn.

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,200
I don't want anything of his,

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,909
and I don't want anything

63
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,080
to do with him any longer.

64
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,790
The Heart Protecting Scale belongs to him.

65
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,149
He'll get it back eventually.

66
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,880
Besides,

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,269
the secret treasure of Qingqiu

68
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,960
can help set us free

69
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,319
from the Lord of Dark Aura's control.

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,469
We just need to find it.

71
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,710
We don't need anyone else's help.

72
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,390
All right.

73
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,150
I'll help you.

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
Stop!

75
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,710
Stupid fox!

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,270
Wait for me! Don't run!

77
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,520
Stop laughing!

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,079
And you wanted to chase me.

79
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,320
What is this thing

80
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,590
that made me trip?

81
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
A useless piece of wood.

82
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,120
I'll throw it away.

83
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:07,269
(Lin)

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,710
I think this belongs to my mother.

85
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,830
Your mother?

86
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,590
My mother's name is Xuelin.

87
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,200
She's the Queen of Qingqiu.

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,470
The noblest lady in Qingqiu.

89
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,439
Only her belongings can be engraved with the word "Lin"

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,390
in all of Qingqiu.

91
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,520
"Lin"?

92
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,679
Why would something that belongs to your mother

93
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,320
appear

94
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,520
in such an isolated place?

95
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,030
(I'll have to ask)

96
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,440
(my father that question.)

97
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,080
You can't bring yourself to do it, can you?

98
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,030
I'll do it for you, then.

99
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,830
What does your mother's geomantic compass do?

100
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,559
It's a geomantic compass.

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,149
Of course, it tells directions.

102
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,230
That's nothing special.

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,639
My phantom spirit ring

104
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,270
is more impressive.

105
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,760
Look.

106
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,320
My geomantic compass is better.

107
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,350
My ring is better.

108
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,270
My geomantic compass is better.

109
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,760
My ring.

110
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,440
The geomantic compass is better.

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,880
My ring is better!

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,390
Geomantic compass!

113
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,030
The ring is better.

114
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,710
It's all because of what you said.

115
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:20,790
You upset it.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,590
It's just a geomantic compass.

117
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,000
What has it got to be upset about?

118
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,640
Your geomantic compass…

119
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,880
It's…

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,560
What's going on?

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
Stop talking. Don't move.

122
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,880
That… That was…

123
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,760
Bai Xiaosheng.

124
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,390
Yanhui!

125
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,080
Yanhui.

126
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,630
Yanhui! Dragon King!

127
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,560
Oh, no.

128
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,960
They got sucked into the compass.

129
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,230
Yanhui!

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,400
Where…

131
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,710
Where am I?

132
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,710
This is strange.

133
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,589
Why would it take all of them?

134
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,630
This is impossible.

135
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,500
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,830
Hurry up and save them!

137
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,990
This belongs to your mother!

138
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,020
Can't you open it?

139
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,740
(Can't you do it?)

140
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,500
Who…

141
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,860
Who's there?

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,780
This place is too bizarre.

143
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,190
I mustn't stay in here for long.

144
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,430
What's this?

145
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,020
Yanhui!

146
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,830
(Yanhui and I)

147
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,830
(were sucked)

148
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:54,190
(into a magical artifact.)

149
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,540
(We should be)

150
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,590
(inside the magical artifact right now.)

151
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,900
What is this?

152
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,740
Can I get out of here like this?

153
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,780
(Xuelin!)

154
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,310
(Xuelin!)

155
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,620
(You lied to me.)

156
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,990
(You lied to me!)

157
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,310
(Who is talking inside my head?)

158
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,430
-(You tricked me!) -(I think these people)

159
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,470
(are casting a magic spell on me.)

160
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,710
(Who is she?)

161
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,025
(Xuelin, Queen of Qingqiu)

162
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,430
(Why does she)

163
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,310
(look so sad?)

164
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,380
(Why is there)

165
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,380
(such rage and sorrow in my heart?)

166
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,620
(I know.)

167
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,779
(She's using the spell)

168
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,230
(of the Chenxing Mountain.)

169
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,780
(She is sealing me.)

170
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,590
(But why?)

171
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,540
Where are they?

172
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,430
They'll probably

173
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,190
be out soon.

174
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,019
Can you do it or not?

175
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
Of course, I can. Why can't I?

176
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,470
It's gone.

177
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,710
Yanhui!

178
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,660
Yanhui.

179
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,189
Don't come any closer.

180
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,780
Yanhui.

181
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,710
I don't know why,

182
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,860
but I have the urge

183
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,860
to rip out your Heart Protecting Scale.

184
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,260
Stay away from me.

185
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,900
You want the Heart Protecting Scale?

186
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,900
You can have it.

187
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,499
Go away! I don't want it!

188
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,110
Don't move.

189
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,260
This place is dangerous.

190
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,740
We should find a way to get out of here first.

191
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,310
You're the one who shouldn't move.

192
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,990
I told you.

193
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,470
I have the urge to rip out the Heart Protecting Scale from you,

194
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,620
but I don't want to do it.

195
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,780
I know I'm confusing,

196
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,710
but I don't want

197
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,860
to have anything

198
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:27,230
to do with you anymore.

199
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,110
It pains me

200
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:30,500
when I see you.

201
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,990
Stay away from me.

202
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,070
I'm scared.

203
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,310
You've never died.

204
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,260
You don't understand

205
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,710
how afraid I am when I see you.

206
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,780
I failed you

207
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,430
by taking Heart Protecting Scale from you.

208
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,310
Where are they?

209
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,020
Can you release them?

210
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,780
Yanhui?

211
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,190
Why is it you?

212
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,470
Where's Yanhui?

213
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,540
How dare you bring up her name?

214
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,140
I'm the one who should be asking questions.

215
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,190
You stabbed her in the heart.

216
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,109
Why pretend

217
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,540
that you care about her?

218
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,500
You even set up this barrier

219
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,659
to kill me too.

220
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,190
I never wanted to hurt her.

221
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,020
I have nothing to do with this barrier.

222
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,310
I'm trapped in here too.

223
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,110
That's odd.

224
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,140
Your fiery red sword

225
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,140
was burning with searing flames.

226
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,019
The blade was longer than my arm,

227
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,140
and you pierced right through her heart.

228
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,190
You say you didn't want to hurt her.

229
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,660
Are you telling me you did it to save her?

230
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,470
You shouldn't have let the Lord of Dark Aura save her.

231
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,949
That's drinking poison to quench one's thirst.

232
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,740
I wouldn't have needed to do it if it weren't for what you did.

233
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,660
Or do you think

234
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,469
I should've left her on the ground

235
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,780
and watched her die?

236
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,740
I mean,

237
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,990
if you really want

238
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,190
to make it up to her,

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,540
you should give her your Heart Protecting Scale.

240
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,110
I will.

241
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,949
But you already had the Lord of Dark Aura

242
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,740
save her.

243
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,260
Why do you still need my Heart Protecting Scale?

244
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,140
Since things have come this far,

245
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:58,260
it's pointless to hide it from you any longer.

246
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,830
She lives

247
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:01,620
by the power of the Lord of Dark Aura.

248
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,230
The Lord of Dark Aura has given her an order.

249
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,659
She'll die

250
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,140
if she doesn't bring back the Heart Protecting Scale.

251
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,710
So if I were you,

252
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,230
I would do what I should.

253
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,110
Stop giving me more trouble.

254
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,500
She was fine all this while.

255
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,740
It was only tonight that the dark aura enshrouded her,

256
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,110
and she wanted to take the Heart Protecting Scale.

257
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,950
You did something to her.

258
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,740
So what if I did?

259
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,110
I can give her the scale

260
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,780
to save her life.

261
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,540
Not to obey the Lord of Dark Aura.

262
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,020
Can't bear to let it go now?

263
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,069
The dark aura seeped into her body.

264
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,500
The Lord of Dark Aura wants her to retrieve the Heart Protecting Scale.

265
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,110
Are you sure that the Lord of Dark Aura

266
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,590
will let her go

267
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,380
once he has the scale?

268
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,990
You and she

269
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,230
acted in the story of Mr. Beiguo.

270
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,110
But do you know another story?

271
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,380
It's about requesting something against another's interests.

272
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,860
If you want to save Yanhui,

273
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,230
the dark aura in her must be purified first

274
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,830
before the Heart Protecting Scale is placed within her.

275
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,820
That's the only way to ensure

276
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,100
her survival and freedom.

277
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,390
Let me do it.

278
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,060
It's changing again.

279
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,190
Yanhui!

280
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,340
Don't come any closer!

281
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,260
My murderous intent is too strong right now.

282
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,630
I feel

283
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,100
much better now.

284
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,540
That's good.

285
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,470
Yanhui,

286
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,230
there's something

287
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,910
I must come clean to you.

288
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,190
I was the one who triggered

289
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,470
the dark aura inside you tonight.

290
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,780
But that evil dragon must be the one

291
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,100
that trapped us here.

292
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,540
You…

293
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,060
Why did you do that?

294
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,190
I wanted you

295
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,230
to take his Heart Protecting Scale.

296
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,740
You didn't have to do that.

297
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Didn't you say

298
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,540
we could be free

299
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,300
from the Lord of Dark Aura

300
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,470
once we find

301
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,340
the Ghostly Eulogy

302
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,429
in Qingqiu?

303
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,390
I lied.

304
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,390
I had just returned

305
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,390
to the Dragon Valley.

306
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,669
I couldn't tell you

307
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,020
my relationship with the Lord of Dark Aura.

308
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,540
I had to lie to you

309
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,870
to earn your trust.

310
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,990
After that, I didn't want to be separated from you

311
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,100
outside the Misty Forest.

312
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,230
So…

313
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,630
So,

314
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,910
even if we do find the Ghostly Eulogy,

315
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,670
we won't be able to get rid

316
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,740
of the dark aura

317
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
or escape the Lord of Dark Aura's control.

318
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,340
That's not all true.

319
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,339
I came to Qingqiu

320
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,470
to obtain this secret treasure

321
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,540
because the Lord of Dark Aura

322
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,780
prizes it.

323
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,950
I intended

324
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,340
to get the Ghostly Eulogy

325
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,869
and use it to force him

326
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,910
to return your freedom to you.

327
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,230
Otherwise,

328
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,989
I would die along

329
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,060
with the secret treasure.

330
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,300
How could you think of doing that?

331
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,020
I can't think of another way

332
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,740
to save you

333
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:35,060
besides risking my life.

334
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,470
After going through this, I've realized something.

335
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,910
Nothing is worth

336
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,190
trading your life for.

337
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,870
I'm not worth it either.

338
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,020
No.

339
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,470
You are.

340
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,710
No.

341
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
I'm not.

342
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,630
Your own life

343
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,150
is what matters the most.

344
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,430
We can find other ways.

345
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,340
You said

346
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,230
the Lord of Dark Aura was after the Heart Protecting Scale,

347
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,100
so I thought about giving him the scale

348
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,390
to trade

349
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,740
for your freedom.

350
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,390
But after thinking about it,

351
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,190
I think

352
00:20:16,191 --> 00:20:17,230
we shouldn't trust him so easily.

353
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,100
Let's talk about this

354
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,670
after we get out of here.

355
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,430
I was controlled by the dark aura just now,

356
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,260
so I haven't been able

357
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:25,580
to examine my whereabouts yet.

358
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,710
You can move to specific places

359
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:27,820
by toggling the dial.

360
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,910
Besides that,

361
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,779
the space changes on its own too.

362
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,910
You mean this dial?

363
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,260
Yes.

364
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,300
What's written on yours?

365
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,260
Mine's "Chou". (♪ugly)

366
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,580
Mine's "Niu". (♪impressive)

367
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,579
(Why does the dial criticize me)

368
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,230
(and praise him?)

369
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,950
Based on my analysis...

370
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,670
(What did I do wrong?)

371
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,100
This dial is…

372
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,430
Yanhui?

373
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,020
(How does your mother's thing)

374
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,339
(work?)

375
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,020
Yanhui!

376
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,870
Yanhui!

377
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,710
You again.

378
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,710
What are you trying to do?

379
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,739
Are you using this barrier

380
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,630
to keep us apart?

381
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:18,949
I told you

382
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,780
it's not me.

383
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,020
Who else could it be?

384
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,670
Yanhui!

385
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,260
Yanhui!

386
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,260
-Yanhui! -Yanhui!

387
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,150
Yanhui!

388
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,430
Yanhui.

389
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
What do you want?

390
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,060
Don't come near me.

391
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,630
Stay away from me.

392
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,910
Don't break it.

393
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,430
Yanhui!

394
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,340
Yanhui!

395
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,430
(A moment ago, this space was changing haphazardly, )

396
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,190
(and now everything has stopped.)

397
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,910
(Is this magical artifact)

398
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:06,060
(being controlled by someone outside?)

399
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,580
Five

400
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,540
became three.

401
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,019
I don't think

402
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,300
that did anything.

403
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,580
Yanhui.

404
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,580
It's you again.

405
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,910
Don't come any closer.

406
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,670
The dark aura in your body

407
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,190
has been suppressed.

408
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,260
The reason why your dark aura rose today

409
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,020
is that Bai Xiaosheng…

410
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:40,230
You don't have to explain.

411
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,260
You just want to tell me

412
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,540
to stay away from him.

413
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,470
I know what happened and why.

414
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,910
He did it for my sake.

415
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,390
Sorry

416
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,820
for dragging you into this.

417
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,950
I meant it

418
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,150
when I said I didn't want your Heart Protecting Scale.

419
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,670
I apologize

420
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,190
on his behalf for what happened today.

421
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,990
I'll tell you the truth.

422
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,820
I know what you're going through,

423
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,870
and I understand why you're doing it.

424
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,990
But I can't do anything about it.

425
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,950
When I see you,

426
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,190
I get scared.

427
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,950
It's my fault

428
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,430
that you need to

429
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,470
rely on the dark aura to survive.

430
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,260
I just…

431
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,060
I just want to

432
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,470
help fix your body

433
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,020
and

434
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,390
leave.

435
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,820
If you're afraid of me,

436
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,190
I won't appear

437
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,100
in front of you.

438
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,820
I won't be a burden

439
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,540
to you.

440
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,780
Do you mean it?

441
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,950
As I was when we came all the way to Qingqiu.

442
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,150
Then, make a written pact.

443
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,300
(I, Spirit Dragon, Tianyao, )

444
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,390
(was originally destined to be alone and helpless.)

445
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,990
(I was fortunate to have met Yanhui, )

446
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,390
(who pulled me back from the brink of death several times.)

447
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,030
(I am ever grateful)

448
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,510
(and cannot repay her kindness.)

449
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,270
(Now, I have learned of the existence of the Ghostly Eulogy.)

450
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,860
(I am willing to give my all to obtain it)

451
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,990
(and give it to her.)

452
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,430
(Don't worry.)

453
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,779
(I'm going to help you)

454
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,910
(get your body back for sure.)

455
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,430
(This time, )

456
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,910
(it's without any outside interference.)

457
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,710
(I sincerely, )

458
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
(purely, )

459
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,710
(genuinely, )

460
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,620
(like you.)

461
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,860
(Now, )

462
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,750
(the fate that ties us has reached its end.)

463
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,990
(We shall never meet again)

464
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,030
(in life and death.)

465
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,100
(May this pact)

466
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,510
(be our witness.)

467
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,430
We shall never meet again

468
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,230
in life and death.

469
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,140
Good.

470
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,710
And this.

471
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,230
Thank you.

472
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,140
Let's find a way

473
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,670
out of here first.

474
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,100
In here,

475
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,430
I see you one moment,

476
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,060
and the next, I see Bai Xiaosheng.

477
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,030
Do you know

478
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,030
if there's a pattern to this space?

479
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,100
Let me see your dial.

480
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,470
-Three. -Chen.

481
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,140
Mine showed "Chou" before this.

482
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,860
Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao.

483
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,910
Chen, Si, Wu, Wei.

484
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,470
Your dial represents the 12 Earthly Branches.

485
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,750
It's the 12 Hours.

486
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,270
The 12 Hours?

487
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,750
"Niu"

488
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,580
was written

489
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,910
on Bai Xiaosheng's dial.

490
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,910
Could that be referring to the 12 zodiac signs?

491
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,710
So the "three" on yours is…

492
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,670
It's the 12 Points.

493
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,060
According to the position of the stars

494
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,750
on the "handle" of the Plough constellation, Alkaid,

495
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,140
the location of its stars

496
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,060
points toward different hours

497
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,430
in different times and seasons.

498
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,710
The 12 Points.

499
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,300
So the 12 months.

500
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,670
The first month points to Yin.

501
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,750
The second points to Mao.

502
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,100
The third points to Chen.

503
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,300
The fourth points to Si.

504
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,910
So the "three" on my dial refers to the third month.

505
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,380
It corresponds to the "Chen" on yours.

506
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
That means

507
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,710
we can be in the same space and time

508
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,580
as long as the Earthly Branches

509
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,470
and months match.

510
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,059
So if we match Bai Xiaosheng's zodiac sign,

511
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,710
too,

512
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,670
the three of us

513
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,950
might be reunited.

514
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,780
We might be able

515
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:28,859
to find a way out of here, then.

516
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,380
Yes.

517
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,100
Zi corresponds to rat. Chou corresponds to ox.

518
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,950
I'll turn my dial back to "Chou".

519
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,140
Then, you…

520
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,140
The twelfth month points to Chou.

521
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,860
Right. So you move it back to the twelfth month.

522
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,379
If we don't see each other,

523
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,670
let's dial it back.

524
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,300
(12)

525
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,050
(Chen, Chou)

526
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,190
Yanhui!

527
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,470
Why are you guys together?

528
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,300
He was right.

529
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,100
What was right?

530
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,780
They're all aligned.

531
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,300
Yanhui.

532
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,270
We're finally out.

533
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,860
Yanhui! Dragon King! Bai Xiaosheng!

534
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,300
I was so worried!

535
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,780
I thought

536
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,620
you guys would be trapped in there

537
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:30,750
forever.

538
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,510
This fox is dumb.

539
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,300
He just couldn't figure it out.

540
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,710
You couldn't figure it out either.

541
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,469
I have no connection to this thing.

542
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,780
All right, all right. Stop bickering.

543
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,190
We got out already, all right?

544
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,100
It's your geomantic compass?

545
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,860
So this is the thing

546
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,470
that trapped us inside it.

547
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,950
Fox spirit,

548
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
how could you do this to us?

549
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,910
I didn't do it. Give that back to me.

550
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,339
It's not yours.

551
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,190
Why so anxious?

552
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,580
What is this geomantic compass?

553
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,430
It belongs to my mother.

554
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,779
I don't know why it was left

555
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,229
out here in the wilderness.

556
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,725
(Lin)

557
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,710
Xuelin…

558
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,190
(Xuelin!)

559
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,470
Your mother is Xuelin.

560
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,340
Insolent.

561
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:17,820
How dare you address my mother by her name!

562
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,820
Yanhui,

563
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,540
do you know

564
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,270
this stupid fox's mother?

565
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,620
I heard from the people in my sect

566
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,619
that there is a powerful master

567
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,950
in Chenxing Mountain.

568
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,300
Even Leader Qingguang

569
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,060
addresses her as martial sister.

570
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,540
Legend has it that she traveled the world

571
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,780
to attain enlightenment.

572
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,950
I never imagined that she would come to Qingqiu

573
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,430
and even become the queen.

574
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,060
Of course.

575
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,910
My mother is a Taoist,

576
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,540
but she holds no prejudice against spirits.

577
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,819
She came to Qingqiu to search for a way

578
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,620
to deal with the dark aura

579
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,780
for my father.

580
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,300
Unfortunately, she has passed away.

581
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,670
Your mother knows about dark aura too?

582
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,620
Of course.

583
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,509
Legend has it

584
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,340
that she even wrote the legendary Ghostly Eulogy

585
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,950
specifically meant to deal with the dark aura.

586
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,140
Only

587
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,710
no one can find it now.

588
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,339
Somehow, we learned

589
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,540
some real information.

590
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,230
If we can find the Ghostly Eulogy,

591
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,300
we might be able to deal with Dark Phantom.

592
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,430
We'll be free

593
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,380
from his control, then.

594
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,270
(If the Ghostly Eulogy is meant to be used against dark aura, )

595
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,509
(why did Venerable One make me)

596
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,230
(search for it)

597
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:37,540
(all these years?)

598
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,270
Does the King of Qingqiu also not know its whereabouts?

599
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,510
My father should know where it is.

600
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,340
But

601
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,669
he has been in seclusion for over a decade.

602
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,300
Even I haven't seen him for a long time.

603
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,429
Maybe this geomantic compass

604
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,909
is a magic tool my mother created

605
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,230
to remove the dark aura.

606
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,750
Could it be that you guys were sucked into it

607
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,950
because you had the dark aura?

608
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,190
That's impossible.

609
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,750
Of course not.

610
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,990
Perhaps this geomantic compass is rusty after not being in use for a long time,

611
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,710
and it sucked us in by mistake.

612
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,910
Is that possible?

613
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,229
It has been a long day.

614
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,190
It's time to get some rest.

615
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:29,380
-Come on. -I'm not tired.

616
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,950
You will be tired on our way back.

617
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,910
All right.

618
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,300
It's late.

619
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,780
Isn't it about time

620
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,139
one of us

621
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,710
disappears?

622
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,470
He is surprisingly cooperative today.

623
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,780
We made a pact.

624
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,060
"We shall never meet again

625
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,820
in life and death."

626
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,060
You should've done this a long time ago.

627
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,230
Do the Lord of Dark Aura and Xuelin

628
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,990
know each other?

629
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,860
No idea. Why do you ask?

630
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,340
I think I heard his voice

631
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,190
inside the geomantic compass.

632
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,029
(Why would Venerable One be related)

633
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,230
(to the Queen of Qingqiu?)

634
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,230
The Lord of Dark Aura.

635
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,580
Ghostly Eulogy.

636
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,620
Xuelin.

637
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,100
There are a lot of mysteries surrounding Qingqiu.

638
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,540
Indeed.

639
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,220
That's precisely why

640
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,540
you

641
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,060
should stick with me.

642
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,540
Let's go.

643
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,220
All right.

644
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,510
I gathered all the elders here today

645
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,910
(Zixiao Clan) to make an announcement.

646
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,390
That evil dragon attacked Master Suying first,

647
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,510
and then the nine-tailed fox

648
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,100
destroyed the Guanghan Sect's monasteries.

649
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,469
Such recklessness and audacity.

650
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,030
They're sure to strike again.

651
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,390
The spirits

652
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,100
have

653
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:41,700
gone too far.

654
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,580
That's right.

655
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,660
They must be behind

656
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,099
the disappearance of Immortal Zichen

657
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,830
from the Zixiao Clan too.

658
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,539
They must be punished!

659
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,910
-Yes! -They've gone too far!

660
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,950
Absolutely not!

661
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:54,660
The evil dragon crossed the Obsidian River

662
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,030
and fled to Qingqiu.

663
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,870
I've sent word to Qingqiu.

664
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,390
If they hand over the evil dragon,

665
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,790
we will not

666
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,700
wage war against them.

667
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,580
But if they don't,

668
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,309
we'll cross the Obsidian River

669
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,540
and crush Qingqiu!

670
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,179
They were the first

671
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,620
to break the decades-long peace

672
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,510
between Taoists and spirits.

673
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,220
-Yes. -Yes.

674
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,950
That's right.

675
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,540
As you command, Master Lingfei.

676
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,975
(Royal Palace of Qingqiu)

677
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:39,300
(Changlan, Regent of Qingqiu)

678
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,550
(Pufang, Physician of Qingqiu)

679
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,260
Pufang,

680
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,220
don't crush my books.

681
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,660
All you care about is your books.

682
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,579
How many times have I told you this?

683
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,829
For your health, you need to stay up less,

684
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,540
worry less…

685
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Get more sunlight

686
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,700
and fresh air.

687
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,830
I know.

688
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,790
Yet, you still work so hard.

689
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,579
Do you know about a thing called

690
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,700
death by overwork?

691
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,469
His Majesty has gone into seclusion for many years.

692
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,579
If you collapse,

693
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,830
who will lead Qingqiu?

694
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,910
Do you actually

695
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,620
expect

696
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:14,140
Zhuli to rule?

697
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:15,700
I'm fine.

698
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,830
Fine?

699
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,539
Your eyes are much cloudier

700
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,949
than the last time

701
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,910
I was here,

702
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:22,030
and your Qi and blood are lacking.

703
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,950
What have you been doing, Young Master?

704
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,660
Maybe I've been tired lately.

705
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Young Master Changlan.

706
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,220
Mr. Zhao,

707
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,029
Young Master is undergoing treatment for his eyes.

708
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,099
How can you enter

709
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,259
without being granted permission?

710
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,659
(Zhao Yu, Chief of Defense of Qingqiu)

711
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,740
We've received reports

712
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,030
that the Spirit Dragon Tianyao

713
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:42,580
appeared within Qingqiu territory recently.

714
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,390
Tianyao is here?

715
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,469
But many Taoist clans have gathered

716
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,140
around Sanchong Mountain as well.

717
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,660
Today, we received a message from them.

718
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,390
They want us to hand over the Spirit Dragon Tianyao,

719
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,470
or they will wage another war

720
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,060
between the Taoists and spirits.

721
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,740
These Taoists

722
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,030
already harmed

723
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:03,100
Princess Yunxi.

724
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,310
Now,

725
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,830
they still dare to threaten us.

726
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,310
In my opinion, if they want a war, then let's give them one.

727
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,310
Qingqiu

728
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,580
will not be threatened by them.

729
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,060
Calm down.

730
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,099
These are just

731
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,990
empty threats.

732
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,870
They won't actually

733
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:18,100
do anything.

734
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,790
As for Tianyao,

735
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,260
since he is here in Qingqiu,

736
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,950
we must protect him.

737
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,540
Of course.

738
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,140
But

739
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,060
"empty threats"?

740
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,430
Young Master Changlan,

741
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,870
you've been too lenient

742
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,950
on these Taoists

743
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:36,030
all these years.

744
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,950
That's why

745
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:38,059
they dared to spout such impudent words

746
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,870
on Sanchong Mountain.

747
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,509
Are you blaming Young Master Changlan now?

748
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,620
Well, if you want to go to war with them,

749
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,540
you're free to go by yourself.

750
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,470
You're merely a physician.

751
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,389
There is no place for you to speak.

752
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,310
Enough.

753
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,990
Stop arguing.

754
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,179
Young Master, Mr. Zhao.

755
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,060
Report.

756
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,740
The Dragon King is outside the palace.

757
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,030
I'm still being treated.

758
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,259
Please receive Tianyao in my stead

759
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,580
and take him to rest,

760
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,310
Mr. Zhao.

761
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,100
Of course,

762
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,430
I will personally receive the Dragon King.

763
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,430
That Zhao Yu

764
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,030
thinks he can disrespect you

765
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,100
just because he is the Chief of Defense.

766
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,540
Mr. Zhao is just a little blunt.

767
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,539
But everything he does

768
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,990
is for the sake of Qingqiu.

769
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,910
You

770
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,619
shouldn't say too much.

771
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,350
All right?

772
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,910
I don't agree with anything else he says.

773
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,059
The only thing I agree with him more than anyone

774
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,390
is that you are too kind.

775
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,990
Young Master,

776
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,990
you're too nice to everyone.

777
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,660
Come on.

778
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,180
I had heard

779
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,580
that the Royal Palace of Qingqiu

780
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,310
was built on a giant tree,

781
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,580
but I didn't think

782
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,029
such an enormous tree existed!

783
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,180
Never seen it before, have you?

784
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,740
Listen.

785
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,139
I will inherit

786
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,659
everything you see.

787
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,790
Aren't I amazing?

788
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
Such a pity.

789
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,180
What did you say?

790
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,029
I "foresee" the fall of a nation.

791
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,430
I…

792
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,180
Some… Someone's coming.

793
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,580
They're here for me.

794
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,830
Mr. Zhao,

795
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,099
I'm surprised that you came all this way

796
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,870
to greet me.

797
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,260
Greetings, Dragon King.

798
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,470
Dragon King?

799
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,869
The Spirit Dragon and the king of dragons?

800
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,660
The Dragon King?

801
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,260
Why didn't you guys tell me?

802
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,540
Rise.

803
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,430
Dragon King,

804
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,830
His Majesty is in seclusion.

805
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,910
Look at his eyes.

806
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,790
When Young Master Changlan learned of your arrival,

807
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:12,350
he specifically instructed me...

808
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:12,950
That temperament.

809
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:14,060
To arrange for you to rest and recuperate.

810
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,030
Be quiet.

811
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,790
Please come with me.

812
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,580
Bai Xiaosheng.

813
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,430
Let's go.

814
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,660
Wait.

815
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,179
Are you the Taoist disciple

816
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,870
that was expelled from Chenxing Mountain?

817
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,220
Yanhui, right?

818
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,219
I didn't think the people of Qingqiu

819
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,260
would know my name too.

820
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,830
The Royal Palace of Qingqiu

821
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,470
does not allow any Taoist to enter.

822
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:56,700
Mr. Zhao,

823
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,660
Yanhui and the others

824
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:58,790
helped me a lot.

825
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,950
Let them enter.

826
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,030
Taoists are prohibited from entering the Royal Palace of Qingqiu!

827
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,430
Let them in.

828
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,510
Since you know her name,

829
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:09,870
you should know

830
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,430
that she was the one

831
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,620
who destroyed Suying's barrier in Yongzhou City

832
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,390
and freed the enslaved spirits with me.

833
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,950
If it is the wish of the Dragon King, then so be it.

834
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,350
This way, please, Dragon King.

835
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,790
Let's go.

836
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,029
Didn't someone just say

837
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,470
they were going to inherit all of this?

838
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,700
Now I know

839
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,390
that even

840
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,910
that dragon is more useful than you here.

841
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,909
Mr. Zhao is in charge

842
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,390
of Qingqiu's security and defense right now.

843
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,260
Moreover,

844
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,790
that guy has diabolical ambitions.

845
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,220
My father is in seclusion.

846
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,869
He had always had a grudge against my second uncle, who is regent right now,

847
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,140
and me.

848
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,469
You must be careful around him

849
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,510
in Qingqiu.

850
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,990
It seems Qingqiu

851
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
isn't all that peaceful either.
