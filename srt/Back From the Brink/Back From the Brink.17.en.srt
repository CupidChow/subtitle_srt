1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,880
(Ouch!)

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,029
(Isn't this the woodshed)

5
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,160
(in Tongluo Village?)

6
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,640
(Why am I tied up again?)

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,110
(No.)

8
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,830
(Something's not right.)

9
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,720
(Wasn't I in Dragon Valley?)

10
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,670
-Yanhui. -Yanhui.

11
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,920
Yanhui!

12
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,590
Yanhui!

13
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,590
Yanhui!

14
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,640
-Yanhui! -Yanhui!

15
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,710
Yanhui!

16
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,080
Oh heavens! Was that dragon mad?

17
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,800
Why did he want to kill Yanhui?

18
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,239
Don't touch her.

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,830
She's only going

20
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,870
to bleed more in this state.

21
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,710
Wait here.

22
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,040
I'll go and find a physician right away.

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,080
(Yanhui, )

24
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,110
(I won't let you die.)

25
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,080
(No matter what it takes, )

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,240
(I won't let you die.)

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,590
Suying,

28
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,710
are you all right?

29
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,590
I'm all right.

30
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,270
Activate the Spirit Binding Formation of Guanghan Sect.

31
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,830
I want to ensure that the evil dragon

32
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,920
has no chance of escaping.

33
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,430
(The great evil spirit is approaching.)

34
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,200
(Activate the Myriad Thread Spirit Binding Formation.)

35
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,200
(Senior disciples, stabilize the formation's core.)

36
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,150
(Junior disciples, retreat down the mountain for safety.)

37
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,710
(The great evil spirit is approaching.)

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,480
(Activate the Myriad Thread Spirit Binding Formation.)

39
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,390
(Senior disciples, stabilize the formation's core.)

40
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,990
(Junior disciples, retreat down the mountain for safety.)

41
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,320
He's here.

42
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,319
Myriad Thread Spirit Binding Formation?

43
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,790
This formation has not been activated in the past hundreds of years.

44
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,760
What kind of evil spirit

45
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,520
could have provoked the sect leader to use such a formidable formation?

46
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,880
Suying,

47
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:48,029
why has the evil dragon's cultivation

48
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,199
suddenly become so powerful?

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,440
When we were in Yongzhou,

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,960
he was...

51
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,880
It's because he obtained

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,640
the Heart Protecting Scale.

53
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,640
The formation is about to be broken.

54
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,229
You all need to leave the mountain quickly.

55
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,559
Don't let me and the evil dragon's fight

56
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,320
affect you.

57
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,320
Let's go, Master Lingfei.

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,590
(The power of the Heart Protecting Scale is truly impressive.)

59
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,680
Stabilize the formation!

60
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,390
Don't let the evil dragon break it!

61
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,440
(This wedding...)

62
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,470
(Is the day of your funeral.)

63
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,150
(Tianyao, where's Yun?)

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,590
(The power of the Heart Protecting Scale)

65
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,270
(is unexpectedly formidable.)

66
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,750
This strike

67
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,200
is for the innocent people

68
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,550
who died in Dragon Valley.

69
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,590
(The power of the Heart Protecting Scale)

70
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,270
(is surprisingly strong.)

71
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,440
Ma'am!

72
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,959
That's our sect leader's life star!

73
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,510
That's...

74
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,630
Suying!

75
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,990
Ma'am!

76
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,160
(Your Majesty, we're here!)

77
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,109
(Your Majesty, please save us.)

78
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,629
(We're here, Your Majesty.)

79
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,320
(Your Majesty, Your Majesty!)

80
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,960
(Your Majesty, please save us.)

81
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,110
(Save us!)

82
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,400
(Your Majesty!)

83
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,590
(We're over here.)

84
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,590
(We're here!)

85
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
(We're right here, Your Majesty!)

86
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,830
(Your Majesty, we're here!)

87
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,470
I'll take you home.

88
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Let's go home.

89
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,590
Suying!

90
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,350
Suying...

91
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,680
Huan Xiaoyan.

92
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,710
Huan Xiaoyan!

93
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,750
Open your eyes.

94
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,870
Xiaoyan!

95
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,110
Where's Yanhui?

96
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,870
You're such a wicked dragon.

97
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,229
Yanhui was so good to you!

98
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,749
How could you kill her?

99
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,990
Do you have no conscience?

100
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,830
You heartless beast!

101
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,830
Tell me

102
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,800
where she is.

103
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,469
Don't hit His Majesty.

104
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,629
He did all of this

105
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,160
to save us.

106
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,509
That terrible Taoist woman

107
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,400
killed Yun

108
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,709
and took us hostage

109
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,710
to blackmail His Majesty.

110
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:39,989
That's why His Majesty...

111
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,590
What?

112
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,590
Don't hit him.

113
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,990
Hit us instead.

114
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,960
Tell me.

115
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,280
Where is Yanhui?

116
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,440
I can save her.

117
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,160
Yanhui...

118
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,110
Bai Xiaosheng took Yanhui with him.

119
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,990
Bai Xiaosheng?

120
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,160
Where did he go?

121
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,350
I don't know.

122
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,750
Evil dragon?

123
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,280
Frost Blossom Technique?

124
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
You're Master Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain.

125
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,680
Where's Yanhui?

126
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,200
You know something happened to her?

127
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,200
Could it be

128
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,960
the seal of the Heart Protecting Scale...

129
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,660
Did you take out her scales?

130
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,420
So you're here to obtain the Heart Protecting Scale?

131
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,900
I'll kill you!

132
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,300
I need to go and save Yanhui.

133
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:49,380
I have no time to fight him.

134
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,100
(For Yanhui, )

135
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,060
(I'll trust you once again.)

136
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
(Master!)

137
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,100
Illusion technique.

138
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,780
(Yanhui, )

139
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,620
(hang in there.)

140
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,900
(Yanhui, )

141
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,300
(you can't die.)

142
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,100
(Hang in there.)

143
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,420
Shadow Gate, unseal!

144
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
With my life,

145
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,740
I humbly seek your presence.

146
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,340
Please rescue this person.

147
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,380
I didn't expect you

148
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,740
to have such a compassionate heart.

149
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,900
You haven't completed the task assigned to you.

150
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,300
Yet, you have the nerve to ask me to save her?

151
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,660
Don't do anything useless.

152
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,540
Venerable One,

153
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,860
this woman and the Spirit Dragon

154
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,180
are true Taoist spirit lovers.

155
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,300
Only they

156
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,660
can help you find the Ghostly Eulogy.

157
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,980
(Yanhui's Mind's Eye)

158
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,060
(The Millennium Spirit Dragon seems)

159
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,340
(to have a strong attachment to this woman.)

160
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,900
(This situation is quite intriguing.)

161
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,180
I shall grant your request.

162
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,180
I'm indebted to you, Venerable One.

163
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,260
Yanhui,

164
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,180
I don't know if what I'm doing

165
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,620
is right.

166
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,339
But I can't just stand by

167
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,740
and watch you die.

168
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,740
I hope you won't blame me

169
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,420
for this in the future.

170
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,459
Are you sure Bai Xiaosheng will be here?

171
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,499
Bai Xiaosheng wants to use the power of dark aura

172
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,260
to save Yanhui.

173
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,820
Dark aura?

174
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,060
Do you mean the thing

175
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,180
that made my lord lose his mind?

176
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,260
But

177
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,419
why would Bai Xiaosheng take Yanhui back

178
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,060
to this Misty Forest?

179
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,660
I thought

180
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,260
you destroyed the dark aura here.

181
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,380
(Why is Phantom King confused, )

182
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,819
(but you're clear-headed?)

183
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,979
That's because my true body

184
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,220
is still being controlled by someone

185
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,140
and hasn't been completely invaded

186
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:57,660
by the dark aura.

187
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,019
(Who is the person controlling you?)

188
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,860
Lord of Dark Aura,

189
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,020
a master of visual spells from Qingqiu.

190
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,180
Unfortunately,

191
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,060
I don't even know

192
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,340
what he looks like,

193
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,060
let alone his name.

194
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,140
(That person is from Qingqiu)

195
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,500
(and is an expert in using visual spells.)

196
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
He lures those who have lost control

197
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,940
into Misty Forest.

198
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,980
He tormented them

199
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,860
until they died there.

200
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,900
(The dark aura gathers)

201
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,300
(in the tombstones deep inside the forest.)

202
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,820
Can you still find the way to the tombstones?

203
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,460
Yes.

204
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,340
I've lived here for a long time,

205
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,420
and I remember every place.

206
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,860
Take me there.

207
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,220
So this is what the underworld looks like.

208
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,460
Tianyao.

209
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,980
That ungrateful dragon.

210
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,420
You heartless thing.

211
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,580
I can't believe I trusted him!

212
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,180
You can trust

213
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,779
no one

214
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,940
in this world.

215
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,140
Don't tell me you're Yama.

216
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,780
Soul messenger?

217
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,060
Ox-Head and Horse-Face?

218
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,180
Judge of the underworld?

219
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,380
Don't panic.

220
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,780
You're not dead.

221
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,259
I saved you with magic.

222
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,340
You saved me?

223
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm still alive?

224
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,780
I'm still alive!

225
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,740
I still have a heartbeat.

226
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,060
You saved me?

227
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,860
Who are you?

228
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,139
-I am... -If you're not Yama,

229
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,380
who are you,

230
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
and where are we?

231
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,540
Why did you save me?

232
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,620
What exactly is this place?

233
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,460
Quiet!

234
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,740
That hurts!

235
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,020
Why are you doing it again?

236
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,460
Stop it!

237
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,780
I said, stop it!

238
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,460
Go away!

239
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,380
(Bringing someone back to life)

240
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,100
(sure is not easy.)

241
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,220
You're still doing it?

242
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Again?

243
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,380
Stop it!

244
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,020
How dare you!

245
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,020
If you behave insolently again,

246
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,220
I'll take your life.

247
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,300
You

248
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,420
are Lord of Dark Aura.

249
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,660
Why did you save me?

250
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,220
I didn't have to save you.

251
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,900
But do you still want

252
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,860
to live?

253
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,820
Yes.

254
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,140
Tell me

255
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,500
the reason

256
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
why you saved me.

257
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,780
I like clever people.

258
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,860
I want the Heart Protecting Scale.

259
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,340
I don't have it.

260
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,539
Then use your hatred

261
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,700
to take it back for me.

262
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,180
I can't do it.

263
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,540
If you can't do it,

264
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,220
I'll get someone else to do it.

265
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,980
I said

266
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,860
I didn't have to save you.

267
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,100
I'll give you three months to complete this task.

268
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,060
If you fail,

269
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,060
you can forget about living.

270
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,260
(I suggest you not do anything tricky.)

271
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,340
(I know everything)

272
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,300
(you're up to.)

273
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,980
That's weird.

274
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Why can't I find it?

275
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,580
It seems

276
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,820
this place is different from before.

277
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,540
We only have four hours left.

278
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,900
We must find her quickly.

279
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,540
What do you mean by four hours?

280
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Yanhui only has three days to live

281
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,780
after the Heart Protecting Scale was removed from her body.

282
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,900
We don't have much time left.

283
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,500
Then

284
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,940
what do we do now?

285
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,420
Her aura

286
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,060
still lingers in the Heart Protecting Scale.

287
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,380
Perhaps it can help me find her.

288
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,620
By my knowledge,

289
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,780
I summon the spirit of heaven and earth

290
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,740
to seek this aura.

291
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:11,980
Let's go.

292
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,700
Huh?

293
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:26,980
Could this be

294
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,859
the gathering place of the dark aura

295
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,100
that Zichen mentioned?

296
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,340
Why did the evil dragon

297
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,020
come here?

298
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,620
(Weeping bitter resentment day and night, wandering souls with endless grievances.)

299
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,939
(Immortal Zichen of the Zixiao Clan)

300
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,140
Immortal Zichen of the Zixiao Clan?

301
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,820
Taoist Zihuan of Tiandao Clan.

302
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,100
Monk Kongbei of Diyi Clan.

303
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,500
The souls of the masters of Taoist clans

304
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,500
who went missing for a long time

305
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,780
should have been laid to rest here.

306
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,420
(What's this aura?)

307
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,300
(The hidden aura of the statue)

308
00:24:19,301 --> 00:24:20,900
(behind this barrier)

309
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,019
(seems to share the same energy as the one)

310
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,940
(that suppressed the dark aura in Starhaven.)

311
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,340
(What a powerful visual spell.)

312
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,020
Dispel!

313
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,220
Master Lingxiao, your reputation precedes you.

314
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,180
I've been waiting here for a long time.

315
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,180
(This aura belongs)

316
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,940
(to a dark practitioner.)

317
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,340
Righteousness fills the universe,

318
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,780
and all evil spirits scatter!

319
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:58,900
(Master Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain)

320
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,420
(Yanhui, )

321
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,419
(this is the only way)

322
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,340
(I can save you.)

323
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,140
Ninety-four...

324
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,140
Bai Xiaosheng. Bai Xiaosheng!

325
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,939
(From the moment you found me)

326
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,540
(under the thorny tree, )

327
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,619
(you've been the only light)

328
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,500
(in my dark world.)

329
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
(Now, handing you over to the Lord of Dark Aura)

330
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,660
(is a last resort.)

331
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,820
(Whatever happens in the future, )

332
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,180
(I'll protect you with my life.)

333
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,860
(Why is it taking so long?)

334
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,220
(I wonder)

335
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:49,540
(if he can save her.)

336
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,140
Yanhui?

337
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,460
Are you all right now?

338
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,980
So you took me here.

339
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,020
I'm indebted to you, Venerable One.

340
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
What are you doing?

341
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
Don't you want to live anymore?

342
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,660
Thank you.

343
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Sorry for what happened just now.

344
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,860
Don't make me wait too long

345
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,740
for the thing I want.

346
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,540
Understood.

347
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,220
Come on.

348
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,860
Venerable One,

349
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,699
I've trapped Lingxiao

350
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,980
with your power.

351
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,580
Excellent.

352
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,940
So?

353
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,740
Have you found her?

354
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,100
But four hours

355
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,140
have already passed.

356
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,260
Do you...

357
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,779
Do you think Yanhui is...

358
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,660
She's still alive.

359
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,220
Dragon King,

360
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,300
are you in a state of denial?

361
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,340
I'm certain

362
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,620
that she's still alive.

363
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,620
Heart Protecting Scale has left her body for three days now.

364
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,580
If she still lives,

365
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,580
does that mean

366
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,900
Bai Xiaosheng has managed to save her?

367
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
But

368
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,740
since she's still alive,

369
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,260
why

370
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:45,660
can't we find her?

371
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,980
Could it be...

372
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,740
Yanhui!

373
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,100
Bai Xiaosheng!

374
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,420
Where are you guys?

375
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,980
Yanhui!

376
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,820
(Do you...)

377
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,299
Bai Xiaosheng!

378
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,460
(not want me to find you?)

379
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,660
Yanhui!

380
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,820
Finally, we're out

381
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,580
of that dark and cold place.

382
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,100
You only stayed for a while,

383
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,020
and you already couldn't stand it.

384
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,620
Have you been there for a long time?

385
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,620
Yes,

386
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,860
a very long time.

387
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,140
So long that I can't even remember

388
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,980
how many years it has been.

389
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,220
You're pretty pitiful too.

390
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,460
So this is what it feels like

391
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:30,340
to have one's life in someone else's hands.

392
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,540
What's...

393
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,420
What's that black flower on your head?

394
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
I don't know either.

395
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,059
I guess it's something

396
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,380
that Lord of Dark Aura gave me to prolong my life.

397
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,780
Yanhui,

398
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,460
will you blame me for this?

399
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,740
Blame you?

400
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,740
I saved you.

401
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,460
You may live.

402
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,100
But from now on,

403
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,900
you have to live under someone else's control.

404
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,340
How could I blame you?

405
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,899
You always showed up

406
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,940
at the critical moment to help me.

407
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,940
You're a reliable friend.

408
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,820
From now on,

409
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,420
we're now

410
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:06,580
in the same boat.

411
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Whatever it is,

412
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,300
you saved my life.

413
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,500
By the way,

414
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,500
you mentioned

415
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,499
that there's a secret treasure in Qingqiu

416
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,060
that can free someone from Lord of Dark Aura's control.

417
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,340
I'll accompany you to find it.

418
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,300
What do you think?

419
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,540
Are you going to resist him?

420
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,980
Well, not really.

421
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,860
I just don't want to live

422
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:42,300
under someone's power.

423
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,420
I'll keep feeling indebted to them.

424
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,500
It's a meaningless way to live.

425
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,500
Aren't you going to seek revenge on Tianyao?

426
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,660
No.

427
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,060
I don't want to.

428
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,660
It's not worth it.

429
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,140
I've already

430
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:55,420
died once.

431
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,380
I've seen through it.

432
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,380
I've figured it out.

433
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
I realized

434
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:00,499
that there's nothing

435
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,060
more important than living well.

436
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,660
Besides, the Heart Protecting Scale in my body

437
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,220
was originally his.

438
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,220
It's good that he took it back.

439
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
We're even now.

440
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,620
From now on,

441
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,220
I don't want

442
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,820
to have anything to do

443
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,100
with him anymore.

444
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,860
I just want to live well.

445
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,700
Then

446
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,340
have you ever thought about this?

447
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:30,660
If Lord of Dark Aura finds out

448
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,220
you're going to defy him,

449
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,260
your life might be in danger...

450
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,420
No matter how difficult it is,

451
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,420
even if there's only

452
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:40,780
a one-in-a-million chance,

453
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,820
I still want to try.

454
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,540
Let's go together.

455
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,180
But you said before

456
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,019
that obtaining this Qingqiu treasure

457
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,980
requires a pair of Taoist spirit lovers.

458
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,260
We probably need

459
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,380
to find another pair.

460
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,940
Maybe not.

461
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,219
You have other candidates?

462
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,900
I'm from Spirit Clan,

463
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,820
and you're a Taoist.

464
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,460
Maybe we can try

465
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,900
to be a pair of lovers.

466
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,340
You must be joking.

467
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,099
But don't be discouraged.

468
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,540
We'll look for suitable candidates

469
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,179
while we're on our way to Qingqiu.

470
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,740
I'm sure we'll find suitable candidates.

471
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,020
All right, then.

472
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,500
That's the direction of the Guanghan Sect.

473
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,379
What is the Guanghan Sect celebrating?

474
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,660
Why are there so many fireworks

475
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,179
that they blow up

476
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,940
their monastery?

477
00:32:45,941 --> 00:32:47,339
That's really reckless

478
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,580
of your clan.

479
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,620
That's the Nine-Tailed Fox emblem.

480
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,979
So it was Nine-Tailed Fox of Qingqiu

481
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,580
that blew up Guanghan Sect's mountain.

482
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,140
I can't believe we get to witness it.

483
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,620
Nine-Tailed Fox?

484
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,579
The fireworks just now

485
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,140
were the emblem of the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan.

486
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,700
Nine-Tailed Fox Clan of Qingqiu is so bold

487
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
that they dare to blow up Guanghan Sect's mountain.

488
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
Come on.

489
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,340
Suying killed

490
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:18,579
the Princess of Qingqiu.

491
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,700
This is revenge.

492
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,100
This is bad.

493
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,100
What's wrong?

494
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,780
The conflicts between the Spirit Clan and Taoist clans

495
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:28,100
accumulate over time.

496
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,259
Do you think they'll go to war?

497
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,940
Are you worried your fellow sect disciples will be involved?

498
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,260
I'm worried

499
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,420
we won't be able to enter Qingqiu.

500
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,340
(Stop by and take a look!)

501
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,660
(This doesn't look too bad.)

502
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,540
(Yuelai Inn)

503
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,579
If we want to go to Qingqiu,

504
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,259
we'll have to cross the Obsidian River

505
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,700
by boat.

506
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,740
But now,

507
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,979
the Taoists have blocked

508
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,499
all the boat crossings

509
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,699
to catch

510
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,900
(Boat Crossings) the Nine-Tailed Fox.

511
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,060
So it's impossible to take a boat.

512
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,820
How are we going to get across then?

513
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,260
See this?

514
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,779
(Boat Crossings) The river flow here is rapid

515
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,859
and rarely traveled.

516
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,140
Why don't we just swim across it?

517
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,020
Do you know what this place is?

518
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,780
This is the Obsidian River we're talking about.

519
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,099
This barrier was constructed

520
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,739
by the Taoist grandmasters

521
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,619
and the Great Leaders of Qingqiu of past generations.

522
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,780
Within this river, nothing floats.

523
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,540
If you enter,

524
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,740
you'll only die.

525
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,500
But if nothing floats,

526
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,819
why do the boats

527
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,580
at the crossing float?

528
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
Excellent question.

529
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,099
That's because the boats at the crossing

530
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,020
are made of Ganhong bamboo.

531
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,700
Ganhong bamboo?

532
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,899
(Ganhong Bamboo Grove) Ganhong bamboo is grown near

533
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,180
the Obsidian River.

534
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,659
The dew in the core

535
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,580
of the Ganhong bamboo

536
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:59,100
has a natural counterbalance to the water of the Obsidian River.

537
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,620
So it's not affected by the river.

538
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,620
Then we can chop

539
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,460
some Ganhong bamboo

540
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:04,619
and build a raft out of them

541
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,460
to cross the river.

542
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,900
A raft?

543
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
Don't you think that's a little risky?

544
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,460
Why are you hesitating?

545
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,340
You were not this timid before.

546
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,820
(Breaking news! Breaking news!)

547
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
(The evil dragon battles Master Suying.)

548
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,219
(Only seven wen for the answer.)

549
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,820
(Give me one copy!)

550
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,380
(What kind of news?)

551
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,699
(Kid, I want a copy.)

552
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,300
(Here you go.)

553
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,100
Kid, I want one too.

554
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,140
I'll have one copy.

555
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,180
Me too.

556
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,939
Can you lend me seven wen?

557
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,500
I'll pay you back later.

558
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:33,100
(Don't snatch.)

559
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,939
(There's enough for everyone.)

560
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,980
I want a copy too!

561
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,780
(I'll have one.)

562
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,420
(They battled out.)

563
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,100
(Did you buy a copy?)

564
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,380
(Please enjoy reading.)

565
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,660
That scared me. This thing talks.

566
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,540
This Flower Bulletin can talk?

567
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,260
(There's enough for everyone. Don't snatch.)

568
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,860
(This one.)

569
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,659
Is this for real?

570
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,099
The Flower Bulletin's news spreads

571
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,459
throughout the world!

572
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,739
It's trustworthy

573
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,300
and absolutely no falsehood!

574
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,940
(Come and hear about it!)

575
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,620
(Here's your copy.)

576
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,060
Let's go inside and read it.

577
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,740
(Here you go.)

578
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,339
(Breaking News! Revenge Battle!) (As the evil dragon arrived alone, )

579
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,899
(a dark cloud loomed over the city.)

580
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,460
(Master Suying remained undaunted)

581
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,620
(and displayed her dominance by unleashing the Myriad Thread Spirit Binding Formation.)

582
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,499
(The evil dragon made a desperate move to break through the formation.)

583
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,299
(But Master Suying resisted fiercely.)

584
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,779
(In the end, she was defeated)

585
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
(and pinned down)

586
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:19,780
(on the seat of the Guanghan Sect's main hall.)

587
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,180
Do you think

588
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,340
this news is real?

589
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,380
It's real.

590
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,740
There's Feng Qianshuo's

591
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,500
secret treasure flower mark

592
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:37,900
on this.

593
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,940
He would never spread fake news.

594
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,460
Then

595
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
what are you thinking now?

596
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,820
Congratulate him, I guess.

597
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,860
He has finally avenged himself.

598
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,700
That's it?

599
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,860
Let's get some rest for a while.

600
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,300
After our meals,

601
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,940
we'll go to Ganhong Bamboo Grove.

602
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,740
(Your life)

603
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,180
(is different from anyone else's)

604
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,860
(to me.)

605
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,940
(Yanhui, )

606
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,460
(you're a special one.)

607
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,700
Yunxi,

608
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,860
you died because of me.

609
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,140
I'm taking you home now.
