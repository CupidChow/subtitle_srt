00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,140
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,060
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,239
(Tongluo Village)

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,110
You're back from the market?

5
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,470
Aunt!

6
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,000
Well...

7
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,600
Aunt.

8
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,360
Aunt!

9
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,750
Take a seat.

10
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,159
Please sit down.

11
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,110
Last night,

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,960
Fu

13
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,520
kidnapped a woman back here.

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,040
Fu had caused trouble!

15
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,390
Last night,

16
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:18,669
he kidnapped a woman back here!

17
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,870
This is bad!

18
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,870
Did you say Fu caught several birds?

19
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,830
I said.

20
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,800
Fu had caused trouble!

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,640
Fu sure is sensible.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,960
Well...

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,110
Aunt,

24
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,919
I want you to use some money.

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Use some money

26
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:40,869
to pay the authority to close the case!

27
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,360
Yes, it's time to discuss his marriage now.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,240
Yes.

29
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,870
It's time.

30
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,150
Did you say you found a match for Fu?

31
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,080
Yes.

32
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,270
Yes, that's what I said.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,479
I found a match for Fu.

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,520
Wait here.

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,550
These are

36
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,830
the betrothal presents I prepared for Fu.

37
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,990
Then,

38
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,320
let me help you give them to the girl.

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,430
Madam Zhou,

40
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,390
which family's daughter were you talking about?

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,080
Does she look pretty?

42
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,240
Yes.

43
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,919
She looks very pretty.

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,150
She's in the woodshed.

45
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,520
She's

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,549
in the woodshed.

47
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,989
I'll take you there.

48
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,760
All right, let's go.

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,590
Come on.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
I had yet to unlock my mind's eye,

51
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,520
so I can't use any spiritual power.

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,549
Now, I'm poisoned with snake venom.

53
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,040
I can't even use the ambient spiritual power.

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,110
This venom is pretty strong.

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,390
I'm hungry.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Why is that doofus

57
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,240
not delivering food to me?

58
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm hungry, doofus!

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,990
Is this doofus

60
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,590
really a fool, or is he pretending to be one?

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
I won't let you go.

62
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,230
I'm sure he's not a fool.

63
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,590
She's right inside.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,470
Yes.

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,590
Here's a stool.

66
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
She's a nice girl.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,269
Miss,

68
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,879
why are you in the woodshed?

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,640
I was kidnapped!

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,640
No,

71
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,760
she said

72
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,440
she wants to give you a surprise.

73
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,959
Why is this girl wearing

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,200
so many bangles?

75
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,270
Now that you've met her,

76
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,960
you should go back and get some rest first.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,639
Tonight, you can attend the wedding reception.

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's go.

79
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,390
All right.

80
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,710
Come on.

81
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,270
She's a nice girl.

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,879
We'll have the wedding reception.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,229
Come with me.

84
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,150
Fu's wedding reception?

85
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,710
Yes, Fu's wedding reception.

86
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,830
Stop staring. You'll get to see her tonight.

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Be careful.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,200
Watch where you're going.

89
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,390
Who on earth are you?

90
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,590
Who am I?

91
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,230
I'm.

92
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,710
Madam Xiao's niece

93
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,200
and your elder.

94
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,829
I don't know why

95
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,440
that doofus kidnapped you here.

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,000
But I'll give you a piece of advice.

97
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,349
Be good

98
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,200
and don't cause any trouble.

99
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,830
Just complete this wedding ceremony.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,080
Or else,

101
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,080
I'll make you suffer.

102
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,710
Understand?

103
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,320
So you're taking advantage

104
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,830
of the old madam's poor vision and hearing

105
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,589
and her grandson

106
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,640
who's a simpleton and doesn't speak much,

107
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,470
you're planning to use me

108
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,320
to cheat her out of money, right?

109
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:54,735
I see, the doofus kidnapped

110
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,830
a smart girl.

111
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,790
I don't care

112
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,389
where you go after this.

113
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,559
But no matter what,

114
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,709
you must complete

115
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,789
the wedding ceremony

116
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,790
with that doofus tonight.

117
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,790
Wedding ceremony?

118
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,760
You're still his relative in any case.

119
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,640
Aren't you going to match our dates of birth?

120
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,789
Aren't you afraid I'll bring ill fate upon him?

121
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,029
I don't care about that.

122
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,149
You'll have to go through the wedding with him.

123
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,389
All I care about

124
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,589
is getting

125
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,440
these betrothal gifts.

126
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,680
Miss,

127
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,349
the fool

128
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,269
may have kidnapped you here.

129
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,470
But I'm aware

130
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,989
of what you're trying at here.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,590
So behave, and I'll see you tonight.

132
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,760
Didn't you say

133
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:45,909
you know

134
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,270
what I'm trying to do?

135
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,030
Why couldn't you predict that I'd kick you?

136
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,640
I...

137
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,030
Fine!

138
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,320
You're going to get it soon.

139
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,680
She's pretty strong.

140
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,200
Just you wait!

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,710
This is great.

142
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,640
That's right.

143
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,759
(Tongluo Village) Fu is finally getting married.

144
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,079
This is so unexpected.

145
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,000
I didn't see that coming.

146
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,270
The food is here!

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,589
It's the last dish for tonight!

148
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,760
Please help yourself!

149
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,390
Aunt,

150
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,520
today

151
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,640
is your grandson's wedding day.

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,520
All right. Eat up.

153
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,200
Fu, you're back.

154
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,000
Your bride has waited all day for you.

155
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,560
All the people in the neighborhood

156
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,390
are here.

157
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,270
Look.

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,150
Today

159
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:45,680
is your wedding day.

160
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Everyone, may I have your attention, please?

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,640
Let us all wish

162
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,269
the newlyweds

163
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,859
to live in bliss day after day.

164
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,660
(To live in bliss day after day.)

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,270
(This wedding)

166
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,350
(is)

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
(your funeral.)

168
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,860
Get lost!

169
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:30,053
Get lost.

170
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,590
What...

171
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,110
Fu!

172
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,510
Why

173
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,560
is he acting up

174
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,800
at this time?

175
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,829
Why is he causing trouble

176
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,510
on his wedding day?

177
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,320
Fu.

178
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,630
Fu.

179
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,800
If your wife is nice,

180
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,590
it'll be good for you too.

181
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,390
You will no longer be lonely after this.

182
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,920
Fu, go inside now.

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,160
Go.

184
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,680
That's right.

185
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,319
Go now.

186
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
Go.

187
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,280
Just go.

188
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,749
She's waiting for you.

189
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,280
-Just go. -She's waiting.

190
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,750
Fu,

191
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,800
go.

192
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,440
Go.

193
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,510
I'm hungry. I want food.

194
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,510
Baozi?

195
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,400
Did you spend the whole day out there

196
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,630
just to buy baozi?

197
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,710
I thought you wanted it.

198
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,440
How did you know

199
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
baozi is my favorite?

200
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,400
Didn't you beat me up

201
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,200
in the forest that day,

202
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,590
so you could make money

203
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,560
to buy baozi?

204
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,590
(So he's the snake spirit.)

205
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,560
(I can't believe he saved me from the trip.)

206
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,200
So you're the snake spirit.

207
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,750
Let me go.

208
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,920
I knew

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,440
you were not a fool

210
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:37,510
because you don't look like one.

211
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,079
Today, I'll do justice for Heaven

212
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
and capture you.

213
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,110
And do all Taoist and cultivators

214
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,470
as disgusting as you?

215
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,799
You better

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,110
don't bring cultivators into this.

217
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,230
Tell me.

218
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,680
Why did you pretend to be a fool?

219
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,800
Did you do it to harm others?

220
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,990
How dare you glare at me.

221
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,709
I'm going to tear off

222
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,400
your human vessel

223
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,440
and see your spirit mark.

224
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,560
What's the matter?

225
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,200
Are you going to let me go or not?

226
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,200
I am not.

227
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,830
(I can't believe)

228
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,800
(this guy)

229
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,750
(could actually break free from me.)

230
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,990
(Could it be)

231
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,400
(that he's more powerful than me?)

232
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,040
I thought I tied you up.

233
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,080
Tied me up?

234
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,230
With that rope?

235
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,750
What's with that look?

236
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,920
How dare you look at me with contempt.

237
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,630
Do you admit defeat?

238
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,959
I have no intention of competing with you.

239
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,230
You did have the intention

240
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,080
when you retaliated against me.

241
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,959
So, will you behave now?

242
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,280
It would've been better if you had behaved earlier.

243
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,830
Forget it.

244
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,960
I'm not out here to capture spirits anyway.

245
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,920
You may have pulled a trick on me.

246
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,680
But like I always say.

247
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,829
I have nothing against you.

248
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,630
I'll spare your life

249
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,040
if you hand over the Flame Orb.

250
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,680
I'll give the Flame Orb

251
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,990
to you tomorrow.

252
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
Tomorrow?

253
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,350
I want it now.

254
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,110
I don't have it with me.

255
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,510
Where is it?

256
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,960
Tell me!

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,110
I forgot I was straggling you.

258
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,110
So tell me.

259
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,350
It's in the barrier at the back of the mountain.

260
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,400
You set up a lot of plots before this.

261
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,400
Why did you give up so easily

262
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,160
and tell me where the Flame Orb is?

263
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Why?

264
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,200
Because I can't beat you.

265
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,470
You're pretty honest.

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,630
I just want to make peace.

267
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,920
After you take the Flame Orb,

268
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,830
you should leave quickly.

269
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,750
Why do you want me to leave in a hurry?

270
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,440
Are you going

271
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,630
to make trouble in the village after I leave?

272
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,590
I stayed here

273
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,200
because I wanted to repay Madam Xiao's kindness.

274
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Repay her kindness?

275
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,079
The last time I heard a snake spirit repay the kindness

276
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,510
was the White Snake, Bai Suzhen.

277
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,710
Are you that kind?

278
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,710
I can't do anything

279
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,630
if you don't believe me.

280
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,230
Forget it.

281
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm warning you.

282
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
I have a foul temper.

283
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,080
If you dare to pull any tricks,

284
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,830
I'll make snake stew out of you.

285
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,750
I'll be sleeping on this bed.

286
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,940
You can sleep on the floor.

287
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,660
I guess he'll only behave after some beating.

288
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,300
(Tongluo Village)

289
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,980
Get on.

290
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,060
I thought you dislike me.

291
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,380
Are you that nice to lend a hand?

292
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,580
What a weird man.

293
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,500
Let's go.

294
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,820
What's the matter?

295
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,940
Nothing.

296
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,379
I've never had a good night's sleep

297
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,540
after you brought me here.

298
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,620
Tell me.

299
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,260
Did you use some kind of spirit magic?

300
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,620
Ridiculous.

301
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,539
You're pretty good

302
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,580
at finding a place to hide it.

303
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,700
There's even a barrier.

304
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,580
Are you not feeling well?

305
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,860
No.

306
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,820
Go in.

307
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,500
But there's a barrier here.

308
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,940
Can't you break it?

309
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,220
Do you know how to lay a formation

310
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,340
with your blood?

311
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,140
You set up the barrier.

312
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
So you can just break it.

313
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,820
You injured me.

314
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,460
So I have no spiritual power left.

315
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,740
I can't break it for now.

316
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,260
We took so much time to get here,

317
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,620
but you don't have spiritual power either.

318
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,940
Either?

319
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,899
What are you doing?

320
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,860
Did you try to enter my mind's eye?

321
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,480
You have yet to unlock your mind's eye.

322
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,580
You don't have any spiritual power at all.

323
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,620
You're not a Taoist at all.

324
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,379
Even my mind's eye is still locked,

325
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,060
I can beat you with martial arts skills alone.

326
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,660
(She's useless.)

327
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,740
What kind of expression is that?

328
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,940
(Why do I feel)

329
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,499
(he was hoping)

330
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,460
(that I could break this seal?)

331
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,660
(Something is fishy about him.)

332
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,940
(I must go to)

333
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,780
(Madam Xiao later)

334
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,740
(and ask her about this snake spirit.)

335
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,379
You're bringing them in after drying them only for a while?

336
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:00,860
Yes.

337
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,220
Grandma.

338
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,220
Yes?

339
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,860
Grandma, what are you making?

340
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm making shoes for you.

341
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,620
Shoes?

342
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,620
Grandma,

343
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,620
you don't have to make them for me.

344
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,700
My shoes

345
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,420
were specially made for fairies in Chenxing Mountain.

346
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,460
They won't spoil.

347
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,420
So you don't have to make me one.

348
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,620
Only the elders

349
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,940
of the family can make good shoes.

350
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,460
Try it.

351
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,980
It looks good on you.

352
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,020
Grandma,

353
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,539
I mean

354
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,500
you don't have to make these.

355
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:31,900
My shoes won't get spoiled.

356
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,459
I'll add more layers.

357
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,579
So your feet will feel warm.

358
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,019
No, Grandma.

359
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,179
You don't have to make these.

360
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,780
My shoes won't get spoiled.

361
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,020
Stop making them, Grandma.

362
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,260
Grandma,

363
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,580
it's time for your herbal concoction.

364
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,700
You're such a good boy.

365
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,260
Grandma,

366
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,660
drink slowly.

367
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,100
Don't try

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,020
to do anything funny to Grandma.

369
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,220
You're pretty nice to her.

370
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,020
That's because she's kind to me.

371
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,380
Where's her real grandson?

372
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,260
He's already dead.

373
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,100
If she knows about this,

374
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,700
she will be very sad.

375
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,460
All right.

376
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,700
Since

377
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:49,820
you're devoted to her,

378
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,580
I won't tell anyone

379
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,820
about your identity

380
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,660
after I get the Flame Orb.

381
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,060
When can you

382
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,940
break the barrier?

383
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,500
Soon.

384
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,140
Soon?

385
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,660
Soon?

386
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,820
All right.

387
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,740
(Tongluo Village)

388
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,779
This darned snake spirit.

389
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,980
He left so early in the morning.

390
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,180
Doesn't that mean I have to do all the work here?

391
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,500
(Madam Zhou's husband)

392
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,340
Why

393
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,779
is it getting harder

394
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,300
to trick that old woman?

395
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,299
I thought it was some treasure.

396
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,020
It turns out to be a pair of lousy shoes.

397
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,580
It doesn't even fit me.

398
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,740
Useless things!

399
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,500
Lousy shoes.

400
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,780
Dear, how about this?

401
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,740
Why don't we

402
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:49,780
grab those vegetables back home?

403
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,460
You're right.

404
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,940
It'll be a waste not to grab anything.

405
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,580
Let's go.

406
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,260
Come on.

407
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,380
What kind of hairstyle is that?

408
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,180
It looks pretty unusual.

409
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,660
What's

410
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,700
with this shoe?

411
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,380
What do you mean?

412
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,980
Can't you tell?

413
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,579
I've been taking

414
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,860
this old woman's things all my life.

415
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,860
It's not someone like you...

416
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,140
That's right.

417
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:18,419
who was picked up elsewhere

418
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,140
to meddle in this.

419
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,780
Let's go.

420
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,500
Let's go.

421
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,580
Stop right there!

422
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,860
What?

423
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,780
Do you want to hit me again?

424
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,060
Are you going to hit me again?

425
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Dear!

426
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,540
You...

427
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,140
You hit me!

428
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,300
You hit her?

429
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,620
You're asking for this!

430
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,780
That jinx from Chenxing Mountain is to blame.

431
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,380
She actually cracked my Flame Orb,

432
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,820
so I had to waste my time here for days.

433
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,900
I don't even know

434
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,019
when I can fix

435
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,860
this orb.

436
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,620
Who's there?

437
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,140
You're the young man

438
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,100
with that jinx.

439
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,380
What do you want?

440
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Snake spirits have Yin energy.

441
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,580
It fears fire the most.

442
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,100
If you force yourself to repair the Flame Orb,

443
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,540
it would exhaust your energy.

444
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,620
Just give up.

445
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,380
It's none of your business.

446
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,460
She's still looking for you.

447
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,060
I thought you were together.

448
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,780
I stay in Tongluo Village in seclusion

449
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,700
because I have secrets to hide.

450
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,420
And she...

451
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,780
She's currently blackmailing me.

452
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,060
This woman

453
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,660
is so hateful.

454
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,260
This...

455
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,260
This is

456
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,980
an ancient formation.

457
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,780
Who are you?

458
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,500
This formation

459
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,860
can help you recover from burns.

460
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,300
Why are you helping me?

461
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm not only helping you.

462
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,780
I set up this formation

463
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,740
because I want to check your spiritual power

464
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,940
and see if it can be of help to me.

465
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,100
This formation

466
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,100
is indeed powerful.

467
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,060
Your spiritual power is not bad.

468
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,740
Since you've helped me,

469
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,980
I will repay the favor.

470
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,700
Is there anything you want me to do for you?

471
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,740
There is a cave

472
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
at the other end of the lake.

473
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,340
Do you mean the barrier?

474
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,660
To repair my Flame Orb,

475
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,700
I've been searching for geothermal sources.

476
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,740
I was there before.

477
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,500
Can you break the barrier?

478
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,900
That seal is really powerful.

479
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,260
My spiritual power

480
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,020
may only create a small opening

481
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,020
and hold it

482
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,300
for one hour at most.

483
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,660
I see.

484
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,140
In a few days,

485
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,540
I'll come back to you for help.

486
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,980
Thank you for helping me.

487
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,740
Now both Taoists and spirits share the same hatred

488
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,820
that can't be reconciled.

489
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,060
You came

490
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:35,140
to the Taoist's boundary alone

491
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,380
in search of a treasure

492
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,620
that could harm you.

493
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,980
Why do you have to do it?

494
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,700
I did it to repay a kindness.

495
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,820
Repay a kindness?

496
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,220
I was saved

497
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,980
by a female Taoist.

498
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
Now, she suffers from a cold disease.

499
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,500
I stole the Flame Orb

500
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
to save her.

501
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,620
Taoists can't be trusted,

502
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,780
neither do they deserve to be rescued.

503
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,540
This young man

504
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,020
seems to have

505
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,260
a deep hatred

506
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,580
for the Taoists.

507
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,500
Not only do I dare hit you,

508
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,220
but I also dare hit him.

509
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,459
Return the betrothal gifts

510
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,180
you swindled from Madam Xiao!

511
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,820
Here.

512
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,780
Where's the rest?

513
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:23,859
That's it.

514
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,499
There's none left.

515
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,420
It's true. That's all.

516
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,260
Granddaughter-in-law,

517
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,220
do we have visitors?

518
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,780
No, Grandma!

519
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,260
I was beating some dogs.

520
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,980
The dogs were trying to steal the chickens.

521
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,340
Dogs?

522
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,620
(I only have one hour)

523
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,019
(to bring Yanhui through the seal)

524
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
(and retrieve the dragon bone.)

525
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,020
(And I can't let her run into the snake spirit.)

526
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,500
Madam Zhou,

527
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,140
your face is all swollen.

528
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,459
Look at me.

529
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,380
A young girl

530
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:55,460
beat an old woman like me in such a state.

531
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,620
Look at this.

532
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,340
Listen.

533
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,580
Fu's wife

534
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,700
is absolutely a bully!

535
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,140
A bully, I tell you.

536
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,460
Stop right there!

537
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,060
Their faces are all swollen.

538
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,060
That must have hurt.

539
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,380
I, Yanhui,

540
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,860
do live up to my name as a bully.

541
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,260
I'm warning all of you!

542
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,500
I'll be backing this family up

543
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,020
from now on.

544
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,700
Anyone dares bully Madam Xiao

545
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,140
and that doofus,

546
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,940
I'll definitely show you

547
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,780
what a true bully is!

548
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,780
All right, I got it.

549
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,580
Get lost!

550
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,540
All right.

551
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,420
Stop looking.

552
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,780
Don't just stand there.

553
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,180
Never mind you were bullied by me.

554
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,820
Why did you let them bully you?

555
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,380
You are quite clever when you're with me.

556
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,140
Now, you do look like a fool standing there.

557
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,900
It's really annoying.

558
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,300
Come inside.

559
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,860
Don't let Madam Xiao worry.

560
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,900
(Tongluo Village)

561
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,580
Where did he go

562
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,300
in the middle of the night?

563
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,620
I'm taking a bath.

564
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,860
Please close the window.

565
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,499
I didn't see anything.

566
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,180
You...

567
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,339
The window is broken.

568
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,140
I can't shut it.

569
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:54,260
You can continue with your bath. It's all right.

570
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,260
I can have a talk with you.

571
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:00,980
But

572
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,900
why are you

573
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,180
taking your bath in the yard?

574
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
This black basin

575
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,500
was dried in the sun during the day,

576
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,500
and the water from the well is also hot.

577
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,540
So I don't need to burn any firewood to warm it.

578
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,299
You're pretty frugal

579
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,380
as a spirit.

580
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,580
Then,

581
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,419
where did you get

582
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,620
those scars on your body?

583
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,820
It's not important.

584
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,300
What matters is

585
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,580
the water is getting cold.

586
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,980
You can continue with your bath.

587
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,300
Please leave.

588
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,300
All right.

589
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,380
You can't just

590
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,260
be a frugal spirit.

591
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,900
Even if you don't take advantage of others,

592
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,660
you can't let others

593
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:47,060
take advantage of your family.

594
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,460
Just like Madam Zhou,

595
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,100
you have to teach her a lesson.

596
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,940
Humans

597
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,620
can be very stuck up.

598
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,100
If you don't teach her a lesson,

599
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Grandma will have to suffer

600
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,180
with you.

601
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,100
I know

602
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,819
things will be fine when I'm here.

603
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,540
I can still help you.

604
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,540
After I leave,

605
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,420
you can only rely on yourself.

606
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,140
Where did he go?

607
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,100
How did you get changed so fast?

608
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,340
I'm so sleepy.

609
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,420
(There'll be a full moon soon.)

610
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
(I'm running out of time.)

611
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,580
This chicken will be a headache

612
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,860
if I don't get rid of it soon.

613
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,819
That smells so good.

614
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,179
What's that?

615
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,100
Good morning, Grandma.

616
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Have you taken your breakfast?

617
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,060
What are we having?

618
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,820
Today, we're having

619
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,220
a chicken!

620
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,700
You...

621
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,500
Did...

622
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,940
Did you...

623
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,260
Did you...

624
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,500
Did you slaughter the chicken?

625
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,580
Then Fu will have no eggs to eat.

626
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,939
Grandma, that's a male chicken.

627
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,660
No.

628
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,740
Fu will have no more eggs after this.

629
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,099
Fu can't eat eggs anymore.

630
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,580
Did he eat any before?

631
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,900
Grandma,

632
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,820
don't worry.

633
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,300
Fu can't eat eggs anymore.

634
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,900
Grandma,

635
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,100
how about Fu eat the chicken

636
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,259
and I'll drink the soup?

637
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,060
Enough!

638
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,580
Fu.

639
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,020
Fu.

640
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,740
Grandma.

641
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,380
There are no eggs for you anymore.

642
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,060
It's gone.

643
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,700
What's wrong?

644
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,500
There won't be any eggs anymore.

645
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,740
Grandma,

646
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,420
it's all right.

647
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,020
It's all gone.

648
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,820
Don't be sad.

649
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,260
Grandma, don't worry.

650
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,420
I'll go and catch

651
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
a hen for you.

652
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,460
Grandma, don't worry.

653
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,700
Granddaughter-in-law!

654
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,740
Grandma.

655
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,940
Bring her home.

656
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,220
Don't fight.

657
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,180
You must not fight.

658
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,940
All right, Grandma.

659
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,020
I promise you

660
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,780
that I'll bring her back.

661
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,620
Bring her back.

662
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,020
Go now.

663
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,420
Come home early.

664
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,620
It's the full moon tonight.

665
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
You'll be sick again.

666
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,500
What?

667
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,220
Don't you trust that I can catch one hen?

668
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,460
Grandma raised

669
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,300
that chicken for many years.

670
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,580
Even she doesn't know

671
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:54,740
if that's a male or female.

672
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,259
She only knows chicken lays eggs

673
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,140
and eggs can hatch into chickens.

674
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,020
Villagers in Tongluo Village are poor.

675
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,340
They're often reluctant to eat the chicken they raise.

676
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,300
That's why Grandma cares a lot about that chicken.

677
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,620
I'm sorry.

678
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,380
I didn't know.

679
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,300
Let's go back.

680
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,340
I can't.

681
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,140
I have to catch

682
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,140
a chicken for Grandma.

683
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,220
(This place)

684
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,580
(is not far from where the snake spirit appeared.)

685
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,620
(I hope she doesn't run into him.)

686
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,340
(It'll spell trouble if they run into each other.)

687
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Why are you following me?

688
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,380
Hunting for chicken.

689
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,180
The chances

690
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,700
of finding one will be higher if we split up.

691
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,340
You can go that way.

692
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,260
Why is he

693
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,500
so clingy today?

694
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,700
That's a lot of chickens.

695
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,580
Flame Orb?

696
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,820
You again?

697
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,820
Again?

698
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,180
I've been avoiding you for many days.

699
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,380
Why must you

700
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:12,420
go to extremes?

701
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,860
Don't tell me

702
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,540
you're the snake spirit.

703
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,940
If you're the snake spirit,

704
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,579
then who is the one

705
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,260
I married?

706
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:24,420
Who cares who he is?

707
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,660
Wait for a moment!

708
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,260
Let me get this straight.

709
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,060
Let me straighten this out.

710
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
He's a snake spirit.

711
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,860
Who's the snake spirit?

712
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,459
The bounty clearly states

713
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,180
that a snake spirit stole the Flame Orb.

714
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,020
If he has the Flame Orb,

715
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,899
that means he's the snake spirit.

716
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,380
Then who is that doofus?

717
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,140
Then my 88 gold taels...

718
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,060
(What's she doing?)

719
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:49,259
Why did that doofus take me back

720
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,860
to the village?

721
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,380
(Could it be)

722
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,340
(some powerful Taoist magic?)

723
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,020
What's going on

724
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,420
with both of them?

725
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,060
Who's the snake spirit?

726
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,259
My Flame Orb!

727
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,820
My 88 gold taels!

728
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,100
That does it!

729
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,180
Since you decided

730
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:08,220
to go to extremes,

731
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
it's a fight to the death!

732
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Bring it on!

733
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,700
So it's you.

734
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,820
Both of you actually created a distraction.

735
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,100
Previously, you said you wanted to help me

736
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,579
so that I would let down my guard

737
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,940
and she could take my Flame Orb!

738
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,019
So you were the one in the forest that day.

739
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,419
Tell me. Who on earth are you?

740
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,540
I have no time to explain.

741
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,900
You're not going anywhere!

742
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,460
(Sure enough, they ran into each other.)

743
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,740
(How should I calm)

744
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:49,020
(these two down?)

745
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,460
I can repair the broken Flame Orb.

746
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,900
Clever talk, but I'm not going to believe you.

747
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,620
Trust me.

748
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:54,940
I'll cut off your tongue now!

749
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,100
I agree with this idea.

750
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,340
That woman who's suffering from the cold disease

751
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,700
is waiting for you to rescue her.

752
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,980
You stole the Flame Orb to save someone's life?

753
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,780
How should we repair it?

754
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,660
I need to retrieve my belonging

755
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,940
that is sealed in the back of the mountain.

756
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
All right. We can go and get it now.

757
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,180
Not today.

758
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,660
We must wait until tomorrow.

759
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,020
Tomorrow again?

760
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,780
If

761
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,300
you trick me again tomorrow,

762
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,580
I'll kill you.

763
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,740
I agree with that idea too.

764
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,339
But can you

765
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,660
release me today?

766
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,060
Both of you

767
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,900
are not going anywhere

768
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,060
before the Flame Orb is repaired.

769
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,940
This is funny.

770
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,019
It's your turn to be locked in the woodshed.

771
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,780
So tell me, who are you?

772
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,900
My name is Tianyao.

773
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,940
Tianyao?

774
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,460
(There's some kind of mind power to a spirit's name.)

775
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,099
(It'll be with the spirit)

776
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,380
(ever since the spirit is born.)

777
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,100
(There will be a reaction when the name is called.)

778
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,660
(But why is my heart)

779
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,860
(reacting to it too?)

780
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,180
Keep going.

781
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,100
I'm the Millennium Spirit Dragon.

782
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,939
I can't believe this little spirit calls himself a dragon.

783
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,060
Have you ever seen a dragon before?

784
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,300
That's a legendary creature.

785
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,140
Something you can find on an emperor's robe.

786
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,580
It roams around the world,

787
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,660
and its existence is very mysterious.

788
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,739
It won't be trapped in such a remote village

789
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,220
by this kind of magic

790
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,420
in these clothes.

791
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,460
I'm telling the truth.

792
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,419
Where are your dragon horns and scales?

793
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,100
Well, at least,

794
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,380
you can show me your claws.

795
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,580
They say

796
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,100
a five-clawed dragon is the rarest.

797
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,260
How many do you have?

798
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,140
What's wrong?

799
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,700
What...

800
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,060
Well...

801
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
If you have something to say, just say it.

802
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,420
Stay away from me.

803
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,860
Go away.

804
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,420
Little Liar,

805
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,260
what's the matter with you?

806
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,620
Pervert! Rascal!

807
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,900
What are you doing?

808
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,300
Stay away from me.

809
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,700
Don't come any closer.

810
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,900
Don't go.

811
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,220
Don't go.

812
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,020
Stay.

813
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,180
Stay.

814
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,460
Please stay by my side.

815
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,220
He...

816
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,300
He's pretending to be pitiful again.
