1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,979
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,575
(Liudong Town)

4
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,580
(When I get past this town, )

5
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,060
(I'll be in Yongzhou City.)

6
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,340
(Why does that evil dragon keep following me?)

7
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,460
(Freshly made buns!)

8
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,220
(It smells so good.)

9
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,540
(Perfume pouches! Take a look!)

10
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,580
Don't forget, mister.

11
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,540
No problem.

12
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,020
(Buns Stall)

13
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,860
(Homebrew liquor!)

14
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,580
What do you want, mister?

15
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,340
What did the woman

16
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,620
tell you just now?

17
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:18,046
Why do you want to know?

18
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,086
Who are you to her?

19
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:21,766
She's my betrothed wife.

20
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:25,766
So it's you.

21
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,646
What did she tell you then?

22
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:32,126
She...

23
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,286
(She said she loved buns.)

24
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:37,446
How many do you want?

25
00:02:37,526 --> 00:02:38,246
Ten.

26
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:41,805
(And she said a man in black)

27
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:42,566
(was her sidekick)

28
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:43,486
(and that he)

29
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:44,406
(would pay for the buns.)

30
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,526
Don't forget, mister.

31
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:48,126
No problem.

32
00:02:48,726 --> 00:02:49,926
Pay up now.

33
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,966
50 wen for ten buns.

34
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,766
Come and take a look!

35
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,286
(I bet he is penniless, )

36
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:59,046
(so I should run when he's occupied.)

37
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,086
(He's so fast.)

38
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,686
(Where did he get the money?)

39
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,206
(Yes, I made you pay for those buns.)

40
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,046
(But do you have to keep chasing me?)

41
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,126
I'm exhausted.

42
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:50,326
Too exhausted.

43
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:51,806
I'm not running anymore.

44
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:03,126
(Can this evil dragon give me a break?)

45
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:52,646
Go away!

46
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,206
No one gets to eat.

47
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:41,886
Yongzhou City

48
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:43,406
is beyond the woods.

49
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:44,446
They are not friendly

50
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:45,446
to spirits.

51
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:46,446
So stop following me.

52
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,166
I can't go anywhere else

53
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,006
other than following you.

54
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,566
(I shouldn't have thrown it away.)

55
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,326
(At every full moon, )

56
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,886
(my body will hurt like never before.)

57
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,366
Today is the night of the full moon.

58
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,046
This is my time!

59
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:46,966
(But...)

60
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:56,846
No.

61
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,086
If my heart is softened,

62
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,406
I'll fall victim to it.

63
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,006
(My power is too weak tonight.)

64
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:43,446
(I can't sense)

65
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:44,726
(the Heart Protecting Scale.)

66
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,846
(Wujin)

67
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,406
Oh, my.

68
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:11,846
This delicious dragon scent.

69
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,486
It seems like

70
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:14,646
my pet

71
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:15,646
will feast tonight.

72
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:23,926
Shebishi.

73
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:25,646
Go now.

74
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,886
Bring me this delicacy.

75
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,406
(This scent...)

76
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:45,926
This sudden surge of spiritual energy...

77
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:46,846
That evil dragon...

78
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,486
He's a Millennium Spirit Dragon.

79
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:52,646
He'll be fine.

80
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:53,806
He'll be fine.

81
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,246
The Millennium Spirit Dragon?

82
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:40,406
No wonder you smell this good.

83
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:42,006
What a shame.

84
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,446
You're a shell of your former past.

85
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:45,966
Shebishi.

86
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:47,806
Don't dally.

87
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,526
Kill him.

88
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:30,926
(She's right.)

89
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,566
(The current me)

90
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,406
(is too weak)

91
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:37,166
(even to take my own life.)

92
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,566
(I can only endure the endless humiliation, )

93
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,206
(rage, )

94
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:44,606
(and pain.)

95
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,766
(Surviving)

96
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,246
(instead of living.)

97
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:49,486
I will protect

98
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,126
his life today.

99
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:16,926
Are you all right?

100
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,486
Are you OK?

101
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:23,286
If you're already dead,

102
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,326
there's no point in saving you.

103
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,726
Why are you smiling?

104
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:35,086
I have never met

105
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,646
someone like you before.

106
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:41,886
Did it hit you in the head?

107
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:44,246
Stop talking. Get up now.

108
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,966
They say a Shebishi is tame.

109
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,485
How did you stumble upon

110
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,486
a violent one?

111
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,766
(It seems like the Spirit Realm has changed a lot.)

112
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:56,886
All right. Stop overthinking.

113
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,046
Let's go.

114
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:02,926
It's about to get back on its feet.

115
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:03,806
Let's run.

116
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:04,366
Go.

117
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:09,926
This dragon

118
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,205
has a Taoist disciple

119
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:12,046
by its side.

120
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,526
So he still has some power left.

121
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,126
Interesting.

122
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:37,926
Why did you come back?

123
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,686
Didn't you say you would leave me alone?

124
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,046
That was indeed what I thought.

125
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,206
But I couldn't help it.

126
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,646
I have a good conscience.

127
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,566
I can't just do nothing when you're in trouble.

128
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:53,286
He'll be fine.

129
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,166
You...

130
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:06,886
You saw me.

131
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:09,726
Thanks

132
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:10,766
to your Heart Protecting Scale.

133
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:22,686
How did you

134
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,126
get the attention of such a powerful monster?

135
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,286
My mortal vessel

136
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:29,446
contains dragon bones.

137
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,406
For monsters who snuck into the Central Plain,

138
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:35,165
consuming me can boost

139
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,206
their power substantially.

140
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:41,206
Poor you.

141
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:43,246
The Taoists want to kill you.

142
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,166
All monsters want to eat you.

143
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:50,726
Can you hang in there?

144
00:15:57,766 --> 00:15:58,726
You know what?

145
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,846
Before you locate your other body parts,

146
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,445
you should try

147
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:03,885
to hide your scent.

148
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:04,726
Otherwise,

149
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:05,726
the dragon bones you finally found

150
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:06,726
would be devoured

151
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:07,806
by other monsters.

152
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,006
You're good

153
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,206
at fleeing.

154
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:17,566
Thanks.

155
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:23,966
They are here this soon?

156
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:29,766
We can hide our scent in there.

157
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:31,566
How long can you hold your breath?

158
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,606
If I regulate my inner qi,

159
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:34,486
I can hold it for two hours.

160
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,286
Do it, then.

161
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,726
Are you done?

162
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:47,686
No.

163
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,086
(It seems like my Taoist blood)

164
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:52,406
(can assuage his pain.)

165
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:48,646
(Oh, no.)

166
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,126
(They are still here.)

167
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:51,686
(But she...)

168
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:58,046
(Her life is more important.)

169
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:19,486
They are gone?

170
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:22,526
Shebishi.

171
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:23,886
Let's go.

172
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,326
What did you do to me just now?

173
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:54,806
Hush.

174
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:56,046
They are nearby.

175
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,366
My food is here.

176
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:26,765
Break your leg. Now!

177
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,686
What?

178
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:09,166
My leg.

179
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,086
Shebishi!

180
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:15,846
Think.

181
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,166
What else can we do?

182
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:19,046
Fend them off with spells.

183
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:20,765
Although I stayed in Chenxing Mountain for a decade,

184
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:21,766
I haven't unlocked my mind's eye.

185
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:23,206
And you want me to use spells?

186
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:26,846
Trust me.

187
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:29,366
One with the dragon soul.

188
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:30,886
Hearken to me,

189
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,286
the fire of sins.

190
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,126
Flame of Wrath.

191
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:35,686
Incinerate!

192
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:51,286
I can do that?

193
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:56,045
The brand on its forehead.

194
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,326
(Wu)

195
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,526
You are controlling it,

196
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:13,446
the master of Shebishi.

197
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:23,686
Scentless Twig.

198
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,806
No wonder we couldn't sense him.

199
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,286
That explains why this Shebishi was violent.

200
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,846
It was puppeteered by a dark practitioner.

201
00:22:32,206 --> 00:22:33,286
Dark practitioner?

202
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:35,526
You don't know that?

203
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:37,605
In the past ten years,

204
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,086
many practitioners

205
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:39,726
shrouded in a dark aura

206
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,406
appeared in the Mortal Realm.

207
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:42,846
Some are spirits.

208
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:43,926
Some are humans.

209
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,206
No one knows where they come from

210
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:47,806
or why they pursue this path.

211
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:49,046
It is still

212
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:50,406
a mystery.

213
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,006
Let's leave this place.

214
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:42,966
Go back.

215
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:44,566
You're free now.

216
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,086
I didn't know you were so kind

217
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:58,686
to your clan members.

218
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:03,406
Don't.

219
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:05,446
This hook comes with a barb.

220
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:06,966
You will tear the entire flesh like this.

221
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:08,886
I thought

222
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:10,286
you didn't care about this.

223
00:24:11,526 --> 00:24:12,246
You were asking me

224
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:13,166
to break my leg, weren't you?

225
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:18,646
Let me do it.

226
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:21,606
This spell

227
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:22,766
can relieve the pain for the moment.

228
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:28,326
Hang in there.

229
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:41,646
The cut isn't deep.

230
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:43,366
It didn't reach the bones,

231
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:44,806
so you're fine.

232
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,046
You tore the hem of my robe

233
00:24:58,526 --> 00:24:59,686
without asking for permission.

234
00:25:00,446 --> 00:25:02,085
You have done many things

235
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:02,966
without my permission, either.

236
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:09,726
I found the Scentless Twig

237
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,006
from the dark practitioner.

238
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:12,286
It can hide my presence.

239
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:13,766
From now on,

240
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:16,246
I won't put you in danger anymore.

241
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:19,006
From now on?

242
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:20,286
Danger?

243
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:22,886
Since you're safe now,

244
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:24,006
let's

245
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:25,006
part ways here.

246
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:41,326
You have depleted your inner qi

247
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:42,046
and can hardly walk.

248
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:42,886
Come.

249
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:48,806
Wait.

250
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:51,966
If you dare to drop me,

251
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:52,846
you will be done.

252
00:25:58,606 --> 00:25:59,766
You didn't do

253
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:01,206
anything

254
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,366
inappropriate underwater, right?

255
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:04,286
No.

256
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:05,086
I don't believe you.

257
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,766
Let's find a place

258
00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:11,366
to take a break.

259
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,916
(Yongzhou City)

260
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,320
(Wangshu Manor)

261
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:44,272
(Suying's Abode)

262
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:49,512
Do you remember this place?

263
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:52,792
What is this place?

264
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,592
It was your home

265
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:57,272
where

266
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:58,632
we spent years together.

267
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,106
Don't waste your time.

268
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:02,672
What you said has nothing to do with me.

269
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:05,032
Please release my wife

270
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:06,992
and let us return home.

271
00:27:12,992 --> 00:27:13,912
Mr. Lu.

272
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,912
After you left,

273
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:17,312
Master Suying forbade everyone

274
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:18,752
to touch anything here.

275
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,472
You should go in and have a look.

276
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:21,592
Perhaps

277
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:22,992
that will make you recall something.

278
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,072
(Back then, )

279
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:30,512
(Yongzhou City was plagued by spirits and monsters.)

280
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:34,152
(The temple worked with the Taoist clans.)

281
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:36,832
(You and I)

282
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,232
(fought)

283
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:41,992
(side by side.)

284
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:47,192
This is your sword from back then.

285
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,272
You killed many

286
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:52,832
monsters with it

287
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,232
and protected the citizens of this city.

288
00:27:58,432 --> 00:27:59,232
General Lu.

289
00:28:00,832 --> 00:28:02,392
Can't you recall a thing?

290
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:16,232
I'm but a scholar.

291
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,432
I cannot wield this sword.

292
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:23,592
I just want to return home with my wife.

293
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:24,592
Home?

294
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:29,072
She is a spirit. A spirit!

295
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:36,832
She is the reason why

296
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,992
we are like this today.

297
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:42,352
Don't make things up.

298
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:43,832
She isn't a spirit.

299
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,072
20 years ago,

300
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,112
I returned from my spirit-hunting quest.

301
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:04,152
Suying.

302
00:29:11,592 --> 00:29:12,752
Nine-tailed fox.

303
00:29:17,432 --> 00:29:19,552
(That nine-tailed fox abducted you.)

304
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:23,032
She saved me.

305
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:23,632
Saved?

306
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:26,712
Fox spirits don't save people.

307
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,512
She's avenging.

308
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:32,032
You have killed so many monsters.

309
00:29:33,592 --> 00:29:34,592
She's just toying with you.

310
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,472
Don't you see?

311
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:37,472
Sect Leader Suying.

312
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:39,711
I know better than anyone

313
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,312
what kind of person my wife is.

314
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:43,472
We don't need your commentary.

315
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:45,072
You

316
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:46,312
separated us

317
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:49,192
and used this object

318
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,392
to fabricate my past with you.

319
00:29:52,032 --> 00:29:53,232
What you are doing now

320
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:56,072
only makes me detest you further.

321
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:01,792
Detest.

322
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,432
What a strong word.

323
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:12,152
Bring me that perfumer.

324
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:14,632
Leader.

325
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:16,071
What perfume do you want

326
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,312
that perfumer to concoct for you?

327
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:24,832
Give him

328
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:26,832
the nine-tailed fox.

329
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:28,872
Noted.

330
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,272
And tonight,

331
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,912
you will come with me

332
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,032
to retrieve the dragon horns.

333
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,992
Why, ma'am?

334
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:37,032
The Dragon Bone Formation has been broken for a while now.

335
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:38,231
That evil dragon might be lurking

336
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,471
somewhere near it.

337
00:30:39,472 --> 00:30:40,511
If we retrieve the dragon horns now...

338
00:30:40,512 --> 00:30:41,352
I

339
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,752
want the dragon to show up.

340
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,831
(Juxian Inn)

341
00:30:49,832 --> 00:30:50,912
One with the dragon soul.

342
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:52,712
Hearken to me,

343
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:54,191
the fire of sins.

344
00:30:54,192 --> 00:30:54,832
Incinerate!

345
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:01,565
It was so powerful when I used it

346
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:02,871
against the dark practitioner.

347
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:03,672
Why can't

348
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:04,872
I use it again?

349
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:06,512
Can I come in?

350
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:09,512
Yes.

351
00:31:17,672 --> 00:31:18,792
I'll bandage you up.

352
00:31:19,632 --> 00:31:20,712
I have already done it.

353
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,112
Wait.

354
00:31:26,832 --> 00:31:27,952
I have a question for you.

355
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:29,992
What was the spell

356
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:32,111
you taught me to use

357
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:33,192
against the dark practitioner?

358
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:34,232
Spirit Dragon Spell.

359
00:31:34,552 --> 00:31:35,832
Spirit Dragon Spell.

360
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:36,727
How

361
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:37,552
do I use it?

362
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,272
Just activate the power of the Heart Protecting Scale.

363
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:43,831
(So the flame I unleashed)

364
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:44,872
(in Chenxing Mountain)

365
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,312
(came from his Heart Protecting Scale.)

366
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,512
(I could do it back then.)

367
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:50,912
(But why can't I do it now?)

368
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:54,112
How can I activate it, then?

369
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:57,952
You want to learn that?

370
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:02,312
Okay.

371
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:03,672
I'll unlock your mind's eye.

372
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:06,631
I trained in Chenxing Mountain for a decade,

373
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:07,712
but my mind's eye refused to be unlocked.

374
00:32:07,912 --> 00:32:09,032
You think you can unlock it?

375
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:11,512
We can give it a try.

376
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,192
Wait.

377
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:33,952
You think I'm a fool?

378
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:35,632
Unlocking the mind's eye can be dangerous.

379
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,897
I can't just let you experiment on me.

380
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,179
Go away.

381
00:32:38,944 --> 00:32:40,144
Without your mind's eye,

382
00:32:40,304 --> 00:32:41,583
you can't use Spirit Dragon Spell.

383
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,424
Nonsense.

384
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:43,543
It had been sealed before, but I managed

385
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,544
to unleash a blast once.

386
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:46,143
Fine. Don't teach me, then.

387
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:47,224
I'll figure it out myself.

388
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:52,463
(It would help if I kept this evil dragon)

389
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:53,664
(by my side.)

390
00:32:53,824 --> 00:32:54,664
(But he)

391
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:55,743
(is cunning and scheming.)

392
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:56,584
(He can be dangerous.)

393
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,744
(But we are about to arrive at Yongzhou City.)

394
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,783
(If I can lure him)

395
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:02,304
(into signing a pact of servitude with me, )

396
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:03,464
(he)

397
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:05,144
(will have to do my bidding.)

398
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:07,144
Wait.

399
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:08,904
Come.

400
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:11,424
I have something to talk to you about.

401
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:16,504
Come.

402
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:26,144
I admit

403
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:27,864
that I can't

404
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:28,824
get rid of you.

405
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:31,304
But

406
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:32,984
I'm going to visit Yongzhou City.

407
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:34,344
I know that.

408
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,823
Yongzhou City is a hub in Central Plain.

409
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:37,903
All merchandise to the West

410
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:38,943
and the South

411
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:40,064
will have to go through that city.

412
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:41,904
It is a populous place.

413
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:43,623
And to prevent any monster invasion,

414
00:33:43,624 --> 00:33:45,303
every sect dispatches their disciples

415
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:46,344
there.

416
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:47,384
The majority of them

417
00:33:47,385 --> 00:33:48,984
are disciples of the Guanghan Sect.

418
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:51,624
What is your point?

419
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:53,864
I...

420
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:54,864
Nothing.

421
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:56,264
Nothing at all.

422
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,144
I

423
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:00,384
think...

424
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:01,384
I

425
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:02,944
believe...

426
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:05,824
Well, it's just a suggestion.

427
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:07,944
You are a dragon.

428
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,343
Even though the Scentless Twig

429
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:10,583
can mask your dragon scent,

430
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:11,544
Taoist Cultivators

431
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:12,944
can see through it nonetheless.

432
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:15,784
So?

433
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:17,744
Therefore,

434
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:18,824
we should

435
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:21,503
sign a pact of servitude.

436
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:22,703
It's more practical.

437
00:34:22,704 --> 00:34:23,424
No, thanks.

438
00:34:25,424 --> 00:34:26,943
Don't turn me down

439
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,904
right away.

440
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:29,024
Think about it.

441
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:32,104
I heard

442
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,144
that monsters

443
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:33,584
without an owner

444
00:34:33,584 --> 00:34:34,464
could not

445
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:35,583
enter Yongzhou City.

446
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:36,264
Make sure

447
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:37,744
no one finds you out, then.

448
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:41,143
Think about it, all right?

449
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,224
Your leg is healed.

450
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:43,184
Pack up.

451
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,064
We'll depart soon.

452
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,343
(Inspection by Guanghan Sect!)

453
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:47,064
(Fellow)

454
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,144
(cultivators, )

455
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:49,624
(we're here for an inspection.)

456
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:56,144
Owners.

457
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,423
Please make sure the brand

458
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:58,743
of your familiar is visible.

459
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:00,304
The disciples of the Guanghan Sect are here for an inspection.

460
00:35:02,504 --> 00:35:03,264
Come.

461
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:04,424
They

462
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:06,904
are seven-star disciples of the Guanghan Sect.

463
00:35:07,264 --> 00:35:08,144
Just one of them

464
00:35:08,144 --> 00:35:08,944
is enough to defeat

465
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,224
ten Shebishi we met yesterday.

466
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:12,543
That's your familiar?

467
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,424
Yes.

468
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:14,424
That's my familiar.

469
00:35:14,824 --> 00:35:16,304
Are you sure?

470
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:20,504
Senior, she's not a familiar.

471
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:21,824
Take her away.

472
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:23,304
Come.

473
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:24,024
No!

474
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:24,984
-How dare you lied to us. -Don't take her away.

475
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:26,024
Take him away, too.

476
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,744
Come.

477
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:29,304
Continue!

478
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:31,184
Let's go.

479
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:34,343
I don't want to rush you,

480
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,984
but you should realize

481
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:37,304
we don't have

482
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,104
much time.

483
00:35:39,024 --> 00:35:39,944
We often

484
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:41,863
have to make choices in our life.

485
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:42,904
You just have to do it.

486
00:35:45,224 --> 00:35:45,944
And fortunately,

487
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,624
I know how to sign a pact with a familiar.

488
00:35:55,944 --> 00:35:56,584
(Yan)

489
00:35:57,344 --> 00:35:58,504
I'm not coercing you.

490
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:00,904
A palm brand?

491
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:01,704
Do you know how to do that?

492
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:20,544
Inspection from Guanghan Sect!

493
00:36:22,584 --> 00:36:23,784
You sure are enjoying yourself.

494
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:24,984
Your familiar?

495
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:26,984
Inspect him.

496
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:28,744
Go ahead.

497
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,784
It is a familiar. All is good.

498
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:40,864
What spirit is this?

499
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:41,344
I can't

500
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,504
pick up any scent at all.

501
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:45,584
Show me his spirit token.

502
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:46,664
Hurry up.

503
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:55,544
From Chenxing Mountain?

504
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:57,104
You're from Chenxing Mountain?

505
00:36:58,544 --> 00:36:59,504
I performed poorly,

506
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:00,664
so I was expelled.

507
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:04,064
The token is so blurry.

508
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:05,744
What is this spirit mark?

509
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:06,944
No idea.

510
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:09,104
He is...

511
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,064
A koi.

512
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:15,704
A koi spirit?

513
00:37:16,624 --> 00:37:17,184
Yes.

514
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:18,304
Look.

515
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,144
Look.

516
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:20,664
This fishy eye.

517
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:21,784
These fishy lips.

518
00:37:22,384 --> 00:37:23,944
And the gills!

519
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,703
It's a koi spirit!

520
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:28,784
Yes.

521
00:37:29,144 --> 00:37:30,343
This koi spirit

522
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:31,344
is so weak

523
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:32,624
that its spiritual energy is almost non-existent.

524
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:33,904
Well.

525
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:35,304
I'm also weak,

526
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:37,464
so I can only catch weak spirits,

527
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:41,104
unlike all of you here

528
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:42,984
who are smart enough

529
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:44,424
to be seven-star disciples

530
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:45,304
of the Guanghan Sect.

531
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,144
Needless to say.

532
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:47,264
I envy you.

533
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:48,424
We all have our journey.

534
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:49,384
No need to envy us.

535
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:50,984
Take care, my friend.

536
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:52,344
Here, keep it.

537
00:37:54,624 --> 00:37:55,224
Let's go.

538
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:08,144
A koi?

539
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:10,944
Aren't you

540
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,624
auspicious like a koi,

541
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:13,984
Doofus Fu?

542
00:38:22,424 --> 00:38:23,184
Anything unusual?

543
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:24,584
Not at the moment.

544
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:28,304
(I want buns!)

545
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:29,864
(And some napa cabbage too.)

546
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,584
I'm your master. You're my familiar.

547
00:38:35,904 --> 00:38:36,704
You walk behind me.

548
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:44,664
(Yan)

549
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,503
I should have done this earlier.

550
00:38:47,504 --> 00:38:48,823
I wouldn't have had to avoid you for a month

551
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:50,224
and worried that you might gouge my heart out.

552
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:52,944
I wasn't planning to do that.

553
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,104
Look.

554
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:56,584
Dragon horns!

555
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,143
Are these the legendary

556
00:38:58,144 --> 00:38:59,424
millennium dragon horns?

557
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:01,744
Yes.

558
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:03,784
Indeed.

559
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:10,184
How cruel.

560
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:11,224
Who hung it

561
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,424
on top of the city gates?

562
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:14,624
Who else?

563
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:15,943
Only Master Suying,

564
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:17,103
who killed the dragon 20 years ago,

565
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,904
can do that.

566
00:39:19,264 --> 00:39:20,624
(She knew Tianyao would come to retrieve them, )

567
00:39:21,304 --> 00:39:22,824
(so she hung)

568
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:24,424
(those horns above the city gates)

569
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:26,824
(to humiliate him.)

570
00:39:33,144 --> 00:39:33,824
Tianyao.

571
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:34,464
(Indeed.)

572
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:35,104
This is...

573
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:37,384
I walk in front of you.

574
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:57,944
Are those horns above the city gates

575
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,104
the real ones?

576
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:02,824
Yes.

577
00:40:06,864 --> 00:40:08,184
You are much more resilient

578
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,144
than I imagined you to be.

579
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:13,824
She wants to lure me into the trap.

580
00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:18,664
I shall uproot the trap, and the entire city,

581
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:20,824
for her.

582
00:40:23,664 --> 00:40:24,344
Using

583
00:40:24,904 --> 00:40:26,264
your current power

584
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:28,784
and my current power?

585
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,343
Don't look at me like that.

586
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:35,383
You think I'll say yes

587
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:35,904
if

588
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,064
you look at me with those eyes?

589
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:38,864
No way.

590
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:40,704
It won't work.

591
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:42,343
Retrieving the dragon horns now

592
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:43,744
is akin to a suicidal attempt.

593
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:55,264
But perhaps we can come up with

594
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:56,824
a win-win solution.

595
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:58,624
A win-win solution?

596
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,144
I have your Heart Protecting Scale.

598
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:05,104
and so do I.

599
00:41:05,224 --> 00:41:06,984
Because someone might come after my heart one day.

600
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,104
I just want to be alive.

601
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:10,464

Do you have a solution?

605
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:16,664
I don't.

606
00:41:17,304 --> 00:41:18,504
But I know a place

607
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:19,744
that does.

applies to your friend's heart?

648

Is she, one,

649
00:42:38,424 --> 00:42:39,784
