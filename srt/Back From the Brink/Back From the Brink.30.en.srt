Master Lingfei,

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:19,920
this spirit seems to be alone

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,830
and to have no skills.

37
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,760
She must have trespassed by mistake.

38
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,960
We must not harm innocent people

No, I am not.

Are you rushing off to report to Qingqiu?

132

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,680
Martial Aunt, if you're no longer upset,

141

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,120

Since he has betrayed Chenxing Mountain,

148

166
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,030
He has the most upright character.

167
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,790
He would never do anything
to betray the Taoist clans.

168
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,230
I ask that you

169
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,960
show mercy.

170
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
What a deep affection
between you fellow disciples.

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,830
If I don't fulfill your request,

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
I will be in the wrong.

Pufang,

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,510
there are no other trees here

175
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,560
to shade the sunlight.

176
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,680
The sunlight must be very abundant,

177
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,110
and it's windy here too.

178
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,590
You'll definitely like it here.

179
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,440
He's here.

180
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,080
It's still too late.

181
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,750
Pufang is...

182
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,080
Is she really...

183
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,660
[Tomb of Pufang]

184
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,340
You should bid your farewell.

185
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,280
Did she mention me before she died?

186
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,960
No.

187
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,920
She didn't say anything.

188
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
Pufang didn't mention him before she died.

189
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,630
I assume she didn't want to see him.

190
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,200
Never believe what people said.

191
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,110
You can't just believe anything she said.

192
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,280
You need to see what she did.

193
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,960
In her last moment,

194
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,230
Pufang was looking in that direction.

195
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,800
Pufang,

196
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,630
I'm here.

197
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,440
I,

198
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,110
Xifeng,

199
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,870
have been cultivating
under my master's guidance since I was young.

200
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,870
I remember the teachings of Taoist cultivators

201
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,660
to slay evil spirits

202
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,420
and never do anything
against the Taoist teachings.

203
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,060
I never thought I did anything wrong.

204
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,260
But when I heard of your demise,

205
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,100
I suddenly realized

206
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,100
I had made three big mistakes in my life.

207
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,300
First,

208
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,340
I shouldn't have sought immortality
and practiced Taoism.

209
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,180
Second,

210
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,580
I should have killed you

211
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,620
(without mercy)

212
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,460
(on the day we first met.)

213
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,020
Third...

214
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Third...

215
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,620
Third, I clearly had feelings for you.

216
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,820
But I didn't sacrifice

217
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
my life and moral principles to protect you.

218
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,740
I wanted to be true to righteousness,

219
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,340
true to my heart, and true to you.

220
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,220
(But now,)

221
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,180
(I've failed in all of them.)

222
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,500
(Pufang,)

223
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,540
(I'm here to atone for my mistakes.)

224
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,420
They're...

225
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,460
Let them go with the wind.

226
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,780
Decades ago,

227
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,140
I brought you back from Shadow Spirit Village

228
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,100
and immersed your true effigy in the dark aura

229
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,620
to cultivate this shadow robe

230
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,420
that can withstand all harm

231
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,940
in the world.

232
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,900
I gave you the power you have.

233
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,540
But now,

234
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,620
you continuously betrayed me

235
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,940
for a woman

236
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,420
whom you've only known for a few months

237
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,940
because you were certain

238
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,020
that I wouldn't punish you.

239
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,180
Punish?

240
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,100
Do you want to cut my true effigy

241
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,380
to torture me again?

242
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,420
I just feel that your punishment
is not severe enough.

243
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,900
You could have destroyed my true effigy

244
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,740
and taken my life.

245
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,020
That would be satisfying.

246
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,500
But do you dare?

247
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,940
No, you don't

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,380
because you are just

249
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,060
a coward hiding behind my true effigy

250
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,700
living an unworthy...

251
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,220
As part of the Shadow Clan,

252
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm the shadow in the light.

253
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,980
But you?

254
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,420
You're the shadow in people's hearts.

255
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,740
I used to fear you.

256
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,940
Your eyes

257
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,020
can see deep into my heart

258
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,180
that's filled with fears and weaknesses.

259
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,020
You would taunt me, manipulate me,

260
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,060
and even make use of my vulnerabilities.

261
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,290
But all of this

262
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,220
originates from you.

263
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,580
Come forth, Shadow Scimitar!

264
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,140
Fortunately, Yanhui found me.

265
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,780
She made me no longer fear you.

266
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,180
And I no longer

267
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,980
want to be your puppet.

268
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,540
(His power of black aura has not weakened at all.)

269
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,900
(I clearly destroyed)

270
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
(the statue Changlan made.)

271
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,060
Did you think you've succeeded?

272
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
(Changlan sacrificed himself)

273
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,340
(and made a crack)

274
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,340
(on the seal of Starhaven.)

275
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,300
Your efforts

276
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,100
are nothing but a drop in the bucket.

277
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,300
It's good that you have someone

278
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,580
you love.

279
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,340
That means I can make you watch

280
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,500
how I drag

281
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,740
the one you love

282
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,100
down to the depths of hell

283
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,220
step by step.

284
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,260
What's this?

285
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,700
What's happening in Starhaven?

286
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,220
Is the leader in danger?

287
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,260
Should we go up and have a look?

288
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
But with our skills,

289
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,020
it's difficult to ascend Starhaven.

290
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,060
Don't panic, fellow disciples.

291
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
With the leader in charge,

292
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,380
Starhaven will be safe.

293
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,780
I'll go to Sanchong Mountain

294
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,100
to bring our eldest senior back here.

295
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,740
The situation is too tense recently.

296
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,740
Our eldest senior is back!

297
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,420
I wonder

298
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,020
when Zichen is coming back.

299
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,900
Our eldest senior has returned
from the front lines.

300
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,540
Zichen is back.

301
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,380
Zichen, you're back.

302
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,140
-Zichen!
-Zichen!

303
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,900
Zichen.

304
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,780
Zichen, you're finally back.

305
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,540
I've met the other Taoist Elders

306
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,580
at their base.

307
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,740
When the Taoist Elders saw

308
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,740
Qingqiu withdraw their troops,

309
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,140
they also intend to ease the situation

310
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,780
and withdraw their disciples

311
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,900
to stop pressuring Qingqiu.

312
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,700
It would be best

313
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,420
if there's no war between the two realms.

314
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,940
That's great.

315
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,180
The other Taoist clans have already left.

316
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,940
We should also go back to Chenxing Mountain.

317
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,540
I dare any of you to desert!

318
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,820
Two nights ago,

319
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,940
the traitor Yanhui and the evil dragon

320
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,300
had appeared at Sanchong Mountain.

321
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
I guess

322
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,540
they must have gone

323
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,500
to the dragon veins formation
under the Sword of Heaven.

324
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,780
Yanhui?

325
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,140
She came to Sanchong Mountain?

326
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,420
Not only did she come,

327
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,380
but she also saved a fox spirit

328
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,700
that intruded into the Taoist clan's base.

329
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,660
Where is she?

330
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,380
She must have escaped back to Qingqiu.

331
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
She also took another traitor with her,

332
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,980
Xifeng.

333
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,900
This incident made me realize

334
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,780
how united

335
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,020
the Chenxing Mountain disciples

336
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,100
of this generation are

337
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,540
in defying their elders.

338
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,540
Zichen,

339
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,900
Xifeng wanted to find that fox spirit.

340
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,660
But the elder...

341
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,540
She destroyed Xifeng's mind's eye

342
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,900
and gave him serious injuries.

343
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,820
But he still insisted on leaving the camp

344
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,180
and has not returned until now.

345
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,940
Master Lingfei, why did you...

346
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,940
I'm the Elder of the Discipline Hall
of Chenxing Mountain.

347
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,020
What is wrong

348
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,940
with punishing a disciple?

349
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,380
You...

350
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,740
Xifeng, a disciple of Chenxing Mountain,

351
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,500
should be executed for colluding
with the evil spirits.

352
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,300
Destroying his mind's eye is a light punishment.

353
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,340
If you want to blame someone,

354
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,180
you can blame him
for not cultivating diligently.

355
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,100
Zichen.

356
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,260
Zichen,

357
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,500
are you trying to test my patience too?

358
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,340
Is this how my senior, Lingxiao,

359
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,180
taught you the rules of Chenxing Mountain?

360
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,620
Master taught us very well

361
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,940
about Chenxing Mountain's rules.

362
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,820
As for you, Master Lingfei,

363
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,700
you're not even a member

364
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,780
of our Chenxing Mountain.

365
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,500
If it weren't

366
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,900
for Master Suying,

367
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,220
how could you

368
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,060
be Chenxing Mountain's elder

369
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,060
with your level of skill?

370
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,860
How dare you!

371
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,140
All of you return to Chenxing Mountain first.

372
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
I will go

373
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,820
and find Xifeng.

374
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,820
-Okay, Zichen.
-All right, Zichen.

375
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,260
Let's go.

376
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,860
Stop!

377
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,340
I'm the Elder of the Discipline Hall
of Chenxing Mountain.

378
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,660
I command you to stay.

379
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,420
Let's go.

380
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,460
Yunmeng,

381
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,940
the disciples of Chenxing Mountain

382
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,620
don't obey me.

383
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,260
Master Lingfei,

384
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,700
the Chenxing Mountain disciples

385
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,580
were not wrong.

386
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,180
The only person in this world
who truly cares about you

387
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,140
is your sister.

388
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,180
What's the use

389
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,420
of saying this now?

390
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,540
Master Lingfei,

391
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,900
don't be sad.

392
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,740
Recently,

393
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,700
I've finally found

394
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,540
a way to make Leader's life star rise again.

395
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,740
It's just that...

396
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,380
Tell me.

397
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,620
At that time, the Leader used nearly

398
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,740
all of her cultivation

399
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,420
to make a bangle to prolong Lu Musheng's life.

400
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,340
That's how the evil dragon had the upper hand

401
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,340
and caused serious injury to Leader.

402
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,700
Now,

403
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,780
I have found the bangle.

404
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,900
As long as the Leader

405
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,180
wears it again,

406
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,980
she will wake up.

407
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,100
Then why didn't you

408
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,220
put it on her?

409
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,340
Releasing the power

410
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,900
requires blood kinship.

411
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,140
I am powerless to do so.

412
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,300
Blood kinship?

413
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm going back to Guanghan Sect right now.

414
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,340
(Suying,)

415
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,980
(I won't have to suffer this humiliation anymore)

416
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,380
(after you wake up.)

417
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,460
I summon boundless and infinite blood

418
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,210
from all directions.

419
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,860
No, you can't!

420
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,100
This is my spiritual power!

421
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,100
No!

422
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,660
I can't give you any more!

423
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,100
This is my spiritual power!

424
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,580
Mine!

425
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,580
No, I can't.

426
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,140
No.

427
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,580
Stop!

428
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,100
Stop it. My spiritual power...

429
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,500
Stop...

430
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,820
No...

431
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,500
My spiritual power...

432
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,700
No...

433
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:50,940
Suying.

434
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,620
Suying.

435
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,780
Su'e?

436
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,780
Suying.

437
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,860
Did you perform the Art of Blood Sacrifice
to awaken me?

438
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,740
The Art of Blood Sacrifice?

439
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,500
Suying,

440
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,100
I didn't know it was the Art of Blood Sacrifice.

441
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,300
I had no idea!

442
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,060
My mind's eye has withered,

443
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,050
and my cultivation is all gone.

444
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,140
Who told you

445
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,460
to use such dark sorcery?

446
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,300
It was...

447
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,780
Yunmeng.

448
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,700
Yunmeng?

449
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,940
Ma'am.

450
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,420
When did you...

451
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,060
I've always been working

452
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,500
for the Dark Phantom.

453
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,860
What's your motive for staying

454
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,460
by my side all these years?

455
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,060
Master Suying,

456
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
I know you desire

457
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,460
the Heart Protecting Scale.

458
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,180
I can help you.

459
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,900
Do you think you're worthy?

460
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,220
Am I not worthy?

461
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,460
We worked together

462
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
twenty years ago

463
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,220
when slaying the evil dragon.

464
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,300
The dragon is now gravely wounded!

465
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,740
Hurry, cut his scale and take the inner core!

466
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Qingguang?

467
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,980
Did you control

468
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,700
Master Qingguang back then?

469
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,340
Yes.

470
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,020
Twenty years ago,

471
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,940
you used me to get rid of the evil dragon.

472
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,460
Master Suying, how could you say so?

473
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,780
We both wanted to slay the evil dragon.

474
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,820
As long as it's still alive,

475
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,900
that makes us allies.

476
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Allies?

477
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,380
Our next step is...

478
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,660
Guanghan Sect

479
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,580
does not ally with the Spirit Clan.

480
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,020
(You have already become obsessed.)

481
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,820
(One day,)

482
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,860
(you will stand by my side.)

483
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,780
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am.

484
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,780
Ma'am.

485
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,100
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am.

486
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,060
Your life star has risen again.

487
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,580
Ma'am has indeed awakened.

488
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,780
It truly is the leader.

489
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,940
As expected from you.

490
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,620
Master Lingfei was the one who saved me.

491
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,780
Help her up and let her rest.

492
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,780
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

493
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:42,900
Let's go.

494
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,260
Where's Lu Musheng?

495
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,060
Ma'am,

496
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Mr. Lu left the Guanghan Sect

497
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,100
a long time ago.

498
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,580
Find him.

499
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,340
Yes, I'll give the order right away.

500
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,980
Where is

501
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,060
the evil dragon now?

502
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,700
When Master Lingfei returned earlier,

503
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,780
she informed us

504
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,540
that the evil dragon had appeared
in Sanchong Mountain.

505
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,460
He may be plotting

506
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,180
to obtain the dragon veins.

507
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,780
He won't succeed.

508
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,700
Tianyao,

509
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,140
after we retrieve the dragon veins,

510
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,540
I will capture Lingfei.

511
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
If it weren't for her,

512
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,460
Pufang would not have died here,

513
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,860
and Xifeng would not

514
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,380
have severed his meridians and died.

515
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,420
I will make her kneel and apologize

516
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,020
for these two lives.

517
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,340
What do you want to do to her?

518
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,260
I want her to know

519
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,420
that monsters and humans are the same.

520
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,420
Both deserve to be treated with true affection.

521
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,220
Those who are unworthy of love

522
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
are those with evil thoughts

523
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,660
like her

524
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,420
and her sister.

525
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,060
Whatever you want to do,

526
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,940
I will accompany you.

527
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,620
That is the life star

528
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,220
of Suying from the Guanghan Sect.

529
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,860
I wanted to wait several days

530
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,220
and enter the formation

531
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,900
on the night of the new moon
when it's at its weakest.

532
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,860
But it seems

533
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,780
we can't delay any longer.

534
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,380
How strange.

535
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,300
They just ran into us

536
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,020
several days ago.

537
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,740
Why isn't

538
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,140
anyone guarding this place?

539
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,580
We just need to avoid the Taoist clan's base.

540
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,420
This formation

541
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,980
doesn't need anyone to guard it.

542
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,780
This is...

543
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,420
This is Golden Yama Dungeon.

544
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,740
Gold?

545
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,340
All the liquid flowing down here

546
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,700
is gold?

547
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,140
The dragon veins correspond to wood
in the Five Elements.

548
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,620
Among the Five Elements, gold restrains wood.

549
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,020
Suying hid my dragon veins

550
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,610
in Golden Yama Dungeon

551
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,420
and sealed them here
with the Golden Sword of Heaven.

552
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,020
I see.

553
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,100
This place is so hot

554
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,780
with hidden magic powers.

555
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,540
It's not easy to go over there.

556
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,340
No wonder no one is guarding it.

557
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,700
Do you remember

558
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,700
my Dragon Flame Technique?

559
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,220
But will it work here?

560
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,700
The hottest thing in the world

561
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,460
is my dragon flame.

562
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,260
So do you think it'll work?

563
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,060
Using fire to conquer fire.

564
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,380
That's brilliant.

565
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,540
Using fire to conquer gold is more accurate.

566
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,220
Let's go.

567
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,060
Be careful.

568
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,940
Your dragon veins

569
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,100
are right down here?

570
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,860
Braised dragon veins.

571
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,020
I was joking.

572
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,460
Wouldn't braised dragon veins be delicious?

573
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,340
You little dragon,

574
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,620
you're becoming

575
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,020
more and more mischievous.

576
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,420
I learned it from someone.

577
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,580
Just focus on the task at hand.

578
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,460
Go now.

579
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,980
I'll stay here and guard the Sword of Heaven

580
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,220
to make sure the formation doesn't close.

581
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,180
Come back soon.

582
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,100
Hang in there for a while.

583
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,900
Yanhui!

584
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,900
Suying?

585
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,020
Dragon-scale armor?

586
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,860
Why

587
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,300
is the dragon-scale armor on you?

588
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,380
Have you seen Lu Musheng?

589
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,820
Lu Musheng?

590
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,420
Where is he?

591
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,660
I killed him.

592
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,500
(He deceived Suying)

593
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,260
(so as)

594
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,940
(to completely sever her attachment)

595
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,740
(and allow Lu Musheng to be free.)

596
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,060
You can die now.

597
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,820
Tianyao!

598
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,140
Yanhui!

599
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,460
(Dragon flame?)

600
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,500
Did you return the Heart Protecting Scale?

601
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,860
Without the Heart Protecting Scale,

602
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,220
you are nothing.

603
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,420
Tianyao!

604
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,140
Tianyao!

605
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
Well then,

606
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,020
you can go and accompany him

607
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,180
on the road to the underworld.

608
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,260
(Yanhui is my disciple from Chenxing Mountain.)

609
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,620
(There is no need for you to intervene.)

610
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,260
Lingxiao,

611
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,180
are you protecting
the traitor of the Taoist clans?

612
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,820
Something's not right.

613
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,420
Let go of me!

614
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,860
I must go back and save Tianyao!

615
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,700
He almost killed you once.

616
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,620
That was Suying's fault,

617
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,540
not his.

618
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,580
Let go of me!

619
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,300
Let me go!

620
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,620
You still have
the Heart Protecting Scale inside you?

621
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,420
So what if I do?

622
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,340
Let go of me!

623
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,980
Zichen.

624
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,860
Zichen, you're finally back.

625
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,380
Have you found Xifeng?

626
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,300
He will be fine.

627
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,460
Xifeng

628
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,780
is a very calm and resolute person.

629
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,060
Wherever he goes,

630
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,660
it must be where his heart leads him.

631
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,060
I certainly hope so.

632
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,940
That's Master's sword light.

633
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,180
Master has returned!

634
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,540
But why does it seem

635
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,420
like he's going to the Starfall Terrace?

636
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,860
Do you think something happened?

637
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,580
Let's go and take a look.

638
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,260
Let me go!

639
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,020
Let go of me!

640
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,380
Let me go!

641
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,500
I'm no longer

642
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,620
Chenxing Mountain's disciple.

643
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,660
Why did you bring me back to Chenxing Mountain?

644
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,380
-(Destroy the Heart Protecting Scale.)
-Let go of me.

645
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,500
After you destroy it,

646
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,140
the Dark Phantom's power will cease to exist.

647
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,740
Promise me.

648
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,860
(Promise me you'll do it!)

649
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,940
Let go of me!

650
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,340
Master!

651
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:32,660
Yanhui!

652
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,820
-Master!
-Master!

653
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
Why are you

654
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,500
tying Yanhui up?

655
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,500
Yes, why?

656
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,660
Yanhui colluded

657
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,180
with the evil dragon

658
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,140
and used the evil dragon's
Heart Protecting Scale

659
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,820
as the source of her mind's eye.

660
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,460
This is a betrayal

661
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,500
of the Taoist clans.

662
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,940
Yanhui conspired with the evil dragon

663
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,980
and did bad things together.

664
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,180
It's a serious offense.

665
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,820
She should be put

666
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,460
to death.

667
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,300
That serious?

668
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,620
Master Suying, you claimed to slay evil spirits

669
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,540
to pursue your selfish desires

670
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,980
of obtaining the Heart Protecting Scale.

671
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,620
Now that the Heart Protecting Scale
is in my possession,

672
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,140
I've become a criminal in the Taoists' eyes.

673
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,140
Why?

674
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,100
Is it all up to you

675
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,660
to make the rules in this world?

676
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,260
You are truly hypocritical.

677
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,340
Master Lingxiao,

678
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,140
what's the matter?

679
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,620
You don't have the heart

680
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,980
to personally execute the traitor?

681
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,860
It seems that you can't bear to do it.

682
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,260
Then I'll do it for you.

683
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,740
I will destroy

684
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,940
the Heart Protecting Scale.

685
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,540
Soul-Annihilating Whip?

686
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,300
It's the Soul-Annihilating Whip.

687
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,860
The Soul-Annihilating Whip
will shatter the bones

688
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,980
and destroy one's mind's eye.

689
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,860
Yanhui can never

690
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,980
cultivate again.

691
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,700
She may...

692
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,940
She may even become disabled.

693
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,620
Master.

694
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,100
Master, please calm down.

695
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,940
-Master, please reconsider.
-Master.

696
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,420
Yanhui has been with us

697
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,340
at Chenxing Mountain for ten years.

698
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,860
-They're right, Master.
-Please think it through.

699
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,580
Please reconsider.

700
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,220
This is

701
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,420
dragon flame?

702
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,180
Yanhui

703
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,300
really learned it.

704
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,300
How could she do this?

705
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,340
She really learned the evil dragon's magic spell.

706
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,500
Is she still the one we know?

707
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,980
I can't believe it's true.

708
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,500
Back then, you taught me

709
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,180
that there's no such thing
as a good human or an evil spirit.

710
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,900
Both good and evil exist.

711
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,940
When you meet good people,

712
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,140
you should treat them sincerely.

713
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,740
When you meet evil people,

714
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,340
you must face them without fear.

715
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,820
I may be kicked out of Chenxing Mountain.

716
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,700
But I have always remembered

717
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,300
your teachings along my journey.

718
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,420
But now,

719
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,940
you have become a person

720
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,340
who doesn't distinguish between good and evil.

721
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,180
Lingxiao,

722
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,580
you're really disgusting!

723
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,940
You can whip me.

724
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,860
I won't surrender!

725
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,060
I won't yield!

726
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,060
With 81 lashes of the Soul-Annihilating Whip,

727
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,820
the mind's eye will be shattered

728
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,420
and the spiritual power
of the Heart Protecting Scale will be destroyed.

729
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,020
You only gave nine lashes.

730
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,700
What's wrong? You got soft-hearted?

731
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,540
I won't miss a single one

732
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,060
of the 81 lashes.

733
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,700
I just

734
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,460
don't want to finish it today.

735
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,500
You've intruded

736
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,220
Chenxing Mountain's forbidden area

737
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,020
and meddled in our sect's affairs.

738
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,900
I'm afraid that's not proper.

739
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,180
Zichen.

740
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,660
Yes, Master.

741
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,580
Please show her the way out.

742
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,300
Yes, Master.

743
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,380
This matter now concerns

744
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,860
all of the Taoist clans.

745
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,460
It's no longer the private affairs
of Chenxing Mountain.

746
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,260
I won't leave

747
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,660
until you've completed the 81 lashes.

748
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,420
At the same time tomorrow,

749
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,420
I'll be here again to continue with the whip.

750
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,780
You're welcome

751
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,420
to witness it.

752
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,620
All right.

753
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,540
Pardon the intrusion.

754
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,060
