00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 26)

3
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,760
He left nine stars

4
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,109
in her mind's eye.

5
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,040
A love that is as deep as the sea.

6
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,920
If only

7
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,800
someone would love me

8
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,830
so deeply and with such devotion too.

9
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,960
If I take him for myself,

10
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,589
I can have

11
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,390
such love, too, can't I?

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,149
Who do you think

13
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,320
that Yinghuo is?

14
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,430
She's so unique.

15
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I'm not sure either.

16
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
I've been affected by the Obsidian Riverhead.

17
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,639
I cannot identify her true effigy.

18
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,990
Pretending to be cute?

19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,639
You've soiled

20
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,200
my beautiful eyes.

21
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,800
Spirits and demons

22
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,990
will always

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
retain some of the habits of their original forms.

24
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,670
They will inevitably show

25
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,550
their fears and likes

26
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,360
unconsciously.

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,240
Identify their true effigies,

28
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,989
and you can find a way to deal with them...

29
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,800
(Identify their true effigy...)

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,590
and subdue them.

31
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,800
(and you can subdue them.)

32
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,110
Yinghuo

33
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,670
revealed some clues…

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,040
What did you discover?

35
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Look.

36
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,760
Her name is Yinghuo.

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,480
She cares about her appearance very much,

38
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,040
and she likes bright and shiny things.

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,670
What's even stranger is

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,480
that there are lights all over the place,

41
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,870
but none of them is lit.

42
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,760
Moreover,

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,390
she wrapped you up in silk.

44
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,830
It might be a spirit that morphs into a butterfly.

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,590
Yinghuo's previous form

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
must've been a moth.

47
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,520
Most likely.

48
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,920
But I can't subdue her in my current state.

49
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,829
I do have a primitive method

50
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,109
that doesn't require any spiritual power.

51
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,480
Maybe that will work.

52
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,270
Have you come to a decision yet?

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,800
Who will divorce who?

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,239
You moth!

55
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,320
Let us go at once!

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,270
I think you misunderstood.

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,710
Well,

58
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm not letting him go.

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,960
I must have him stay

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,789
with me…

61
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,830
Dream on!

62
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,350
You're the one that's dreaming.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,680
Only my beauty

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,200
is worthy of him.

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,959
No matter how pretty you think you are,

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,790
you're not worthy of him!

67
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,320
You're unworthy of him!

68
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,519
I'm going to touch him now.

69
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,679
Don't you dare touch him!

70
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,789
I want a kiss.

71
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,350
If you kiss him, I'll rip your mouth off!

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,960
If you touch him, I'll cut your hand off!

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,440
If you look at him,

74
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll pluck out your beautiful eyes!

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,120
Oh, how scary!

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You really think I would be scared of you?

77
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,590
I was wondering what you had up your sleeves.

78
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,389
But all you did

79
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,760
was place down a rusty sword.

80
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,520
You think you can do anything to me with that?

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,350
Not a chance.

82
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,560
I'm going

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
to kiss him

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640
-right before your eyes… -Why are you looking at her?

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,320
Turn away!

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,440
You think you're a match for me?

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Of course.

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,350
If that's what you think,

89
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,960
give it a try.

90
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,960
All right.

91
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,349
I'll show you.

92
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,200
Bring it on.

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,000
I want to kiss you…

94
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,080
My teeth hurt.

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,760
Your teeth hurt?

96
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,960
Why?

97
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
Your master is about to lose his innocence!

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,880
Hurry up and do something!

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,000
Flaming Dragon Fang!

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're going to bear it

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,560
even if you bleed from pain!

102
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,760
Can teeth bleed?

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,590
I don't care how much your teeth hurt.

104
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,612
I'm going to kiss you.

105
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,790
Look!

106
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,760
It burns!

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,470
I'll make you pay!

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,760
This isn't fair…

109
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,350
How I envy you…

110
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,470
You have someone

111
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:58,790
who is willing to risk their life to protect you.

112
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,440
Yanhui!

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,350
Yanhui!

114
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,860
(Obsidian Riverhead, Bamboo Hut)

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,030
Tianyao.

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,590
How are you feeling?

117
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,790
Where are we?

118
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,320
Obsidian Riverhead.

119
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,760
It is located behind Yinghuo Bamboo Forest.

120
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,030
This is where Chenyi cultivates.

121
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,320
Chenyi?

122
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,079
Did Xiange find His Majesty?

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,350
Did His Majesty save us?

124
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,320
He removed the dark aura

125
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:06,560
on Yinghuo,

126
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,320
turning her back

127
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,470
into a bamboo butterfly.

128
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,559
Didn't they say that no immortal or spirit

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,080
could use their powers here?

130
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,910
He doesn't appear

131
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,640
to be affected by that rule.

132
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,270
As expected of His Majesty.

133
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,080
He has begun translating

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,030
the Ghostly Eulogy.

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,830
Really?

136
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,320
That means I'm saved.

137
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,000
Where is he?

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm going to see him.

139
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,350
Wait.

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,270
Xiange will take you to him.

141
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Drink your medicine first.

142
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,870
It's bitter.

143
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,630
Yanhui.

144
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,710
Have you ever fallen in love with me again?

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,680
You…

146
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,200
Why do you suddenly ask?

147
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,710
Because of

148
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
last night.

149
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,869
Last night?

150
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,919
Because of what you said last night.

151
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,960
What did I say?

152
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,320
Don't you dare touch him!

153
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,160
If you kiss him, I'll rip your mouth off!

154
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,230
If you touch him, I'll cut your hand off!

155
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,440
If you look at him,

156
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,200
I'll pluck out your beautiful eyes!

157
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
I…

158
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,800
I just didn't want her to attack you.

159
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
If that's what you say it is,

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll believe it.

161
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,590
(Please control yourself.)

162
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,510
(It's impossible for us to be together.)

163
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,400
I will not fall for you again.

164
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,280
So I sincerely suggest you

165
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,709
stay true to yourself

166
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,440
and become

167
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,080
a spirit dragon that roams the world.

168
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Do not indulge in worldly feelings.

169
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,160
There is no future in doing so.

170
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,159
(Those are all the things)

171
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,320
(I said.)

172
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,279
(I must memorize them)

173
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,230
(and recite them once every day.)

174
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,920
Yanhui.

175
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,870
Sometimes, I wonder

176
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,080
what it would be like

177
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,160
if I had met you

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,710
20 years ago.

179
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,560
20 years ago,

180
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,320
I was still inside

181
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,440
my mother's womb.

182
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,750
Why do you laugh?

183
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,440
Getting to meet you

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,510
is already a blessing.

185
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,710
Yet, I still hoped for us to meet sooner.

186
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,160
That is too greedy of me.

187
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,710
What does he mean?

188
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,980
(Silver Moon Cliff)

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,320
His Majesty

190
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,630
finished translating the Ghostly Eulogy in such a short time.

191
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
That Brush Sprite

192
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,750
took so long

193
00:11:40,751 --> 00:11:41,990
but still couldn't produce any results.

194
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,800
I knew he was just stalling.

195
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,920
The Ghostly Eulogy

196
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,280
was written by Her Majesty.

197
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
No one would know the book

198
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,870
better than His Majesty.

199
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,990
Then…

200
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,440
Is His Majesty amiable?

201
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,230
Is there any etiquette I should observe?

202
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,349
If he is a stickler for the rules

203
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,710
like that Brush Sprite,

204
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,440
I might not be able

205
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,200
to get the Ghostly Eulogy again

206
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,440
if I accidentally offend him.

207
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,800
I will get it for you.

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,319
His Majesty is most amicable.

209
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,990
Don't worry.

210
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,230
It's just up ahead.

211
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,440
This place

212
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,160
feels familiar.

213
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,870
That is the Silver Moon Cliff.

214
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,709
This was where His Majesty and Her Majesty

215
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,630
pledged their love to each other.

216
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,439
You may have seen it on the screen

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,110
of Her Majesty.

218
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,200
I see.

219
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,400
This place

220
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,509
is as ethereal as the scene depicted

221
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,160
on Madam Xuelin's screen.

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,350
Such a pure aura.

223
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,590
It's Chenyi's aura.

224
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,110
Let's go.

225
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,990
Your Majesty.

226
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,439
Changlan?

227
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,100
(Chenyi, Leader of Qingqiu)

228
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,110
His Majesty and Changlan are twins.

229
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
Naturally, their appearances are similar.

230
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,630
The Spirit Dragon Tianyao.

231
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,710
I never thought you would break the seal

232
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,200
and return to the world.

233
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,110
It was merely heaven's will.

234
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

235
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,200
Miss Yan.

236
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,400
Your Majesty knows me?

237
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,110
Xiange

238
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,230
told me everything about you.

239
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,229
If Xuelin knew

240
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,510
that it was you who took the Ghostly Eulogy,

241
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,510
I'm sure she would be happy.

242
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,710
Madam Xuelin's barriers

243
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,320
were highly recondite.

244
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,399
It was only by coincidence

245
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,830
that I acquired the Ghostly Eulogy.

246
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,400
You're too modest, Miss Yan.

247
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,510
I've translated the Ghostly Eulogy.

248
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
(Ghostly Eulogy) Thank you.

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,870
Does it require two

250
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,590
to cultivate the Ghostly Eulogy together?

251
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,110
There is no such requirement.

252
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,800
Did Mr. Yan

253
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,750
give you a hard time?

254
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,160
He did more than that.

255
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,040
He practically tried to kill us.

256
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,040
Mr. Yan is an upright man

257
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,350
despite being set in his ways.

258
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,400
Xuelin and I trust him.

259
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,110
I have another question.

260
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,630
Can the Ghostly Eulogy

261
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,230
dissipate the dark aura

262
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,229
or set one free

263
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,160
from its control?

264
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,800
Yes

265
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,750
and no.

266
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,350
The dark aura

267
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,560
is a power

268
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,440
independent of Taoists and spirits.

269
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,680
To control it,

270
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,680
you must become a stronger form of it.

271
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,630
In fact, the Ghostly Eulogy

272
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,920
is Dark Phantom's chant.

273
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Dark Phantom?

274
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,679
Perhaps he is better known to you

275
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,110
as the Lord of Dark Aura.

276
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,230
I've seen him.

277
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,440
The aura cultivated in the Ghostly Eulogy

278
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,630
is neither the spiritual power of heaven and earth

279
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,800
nor is it part of the magic

280
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,710
of the spirits and Taoists.

281
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,560
It is an entity made of the dark aura and chaotic energy.

282
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,990
Xuelin spent her entire life

283
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:12,470
studying and researching it,

284
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,039
yet, she was still unable

285
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,280
to eradicate it.

286
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,750
Unless

287
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,230
one becomes

288
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,440
another Lord of Dark Aura

289
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:24,830
by practicing its cultivation techniques,

290
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,110
then it might be possible

291
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,870
to escape Dark Phantom's control.

292
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,630
Fight poison with poison?

293
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
There is

294
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,350
no other way.

295
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
What about

296
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,750
what you did to Yinghuo

297
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,040
in the bamboo forest?

298
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,589
I dispelled the dark aura

299
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,040
within her body

300
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,560
as well as

301
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,350
all

302
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:46,830
her powers and cultivation,

303
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,200
making her turn into her original form as a spirit.

304
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
She will no longer be able to cultivate.

305
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,040
But the dark aura I dispelled

306
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,750
will never disappear.

307
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,590
Instead,

308
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,350
it returns to the Lord of Dark Aura.

309
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,960
But that's odd.

310
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,710
He…

311
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,870
His Flaming Dragon Fang

312
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:02,990
can cut through the dark aura.

313
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,110
You can?

314
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,110
If you are capable of such,

315
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,350
why do you still need to cultivate the Ghostly Eulogy?

316
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,750
My Flaming Dragon Fang

317
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,510
can cut through the dark aura,

318
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,710
but it cannot free those

319
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,510
under the control of Dark Phantom's dark aura.

320
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,110
Then, it's not too late.

321
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,109
I would like to ask both of you

322
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,510
to stay here for some time.

323
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,679
Perhaps we can work out a way

324
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,510
to counteract the dark aura.

325
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,589
I don't mind.

326
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,160
It'll take time

327
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,280
to practice the Ghostly Eulogy too.

328
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,230
We shall trouble you,

329
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,440
then.

330
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,510
Venerable One.

331
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
You're prompt this time.

332
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,230
Venerable One,

333
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,830
you promised

334
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,400
to return

335
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,600
my true effigy to me

336
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,309
if I retrieved the Ghostly Eulogy

337
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,070
for you.

338
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,360
But now,

339
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,270
I would like to change my wish.

340
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,840
What do you want instead?

341
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,200
I wish for you

342
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,709
to return Yanhui

343
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,550
her freedom.

344
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,640
Bai Xiaosheng.

345
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,510
It would appear

346
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:28,310
that I have been too lenient on you.

347
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,990
So much so that I have given you the delusion

348
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,989
that you possess the power

349
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,710
to negotiate with me.

350
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,960
My…

351
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,030
My true effigy…

352
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
The Ghostly Eulogy,

353
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,030
Yanhui,

354
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,160
and your true effigy.

355
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,710
You won't get any of them.

356
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,020
Hate me?

357
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,900
I like the way you feel.

358
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,220
The more, the better.

359
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,380
But alas,

360
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,740
I have no time to waste on you.

361
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,660
Xuelin…

362
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,620
Xuelin…

363
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
Is there a single sentence

364
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,140
in here that is meant for me?

365
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm sure there is.

366
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,420
There must be…

367
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
There must be…

368
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,980
Xiange.

369
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,540
Xiange.

370
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,140
Qianshuo?

371
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,460
Is that you, Qianshuo?

372
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,740
Is it you, Qianshuo?

373
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,419
I didn't expect my replica of the Flower Medallion

374
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,540
to actually work!

375
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,020
I sent you two messages before this,

376
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,660
but I never got a response.

377
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,700
I thought I had failed.

378
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,620
I was traveling before this.

379
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,740
Maybe I missed them.

380
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,900
I'm glad

381
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,380
to be able to hear your voice

382
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,420
even though you are thousands of lis away.

383
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,260
Me too.

384
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,340
Don't worry about me.

385
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,380
We have found

386
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,020
His Majesty.

387
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,220
Once Yanhui masters the skill,

388
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,979
we will return to the Royal Palace of Qingqiu

389
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,140
at once.

390
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,740
That's my Xiange.

391
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,780
If only I were Yanhui.

392
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm sure I'll be able to learn that skill in no time.

393
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,740
That way,

394
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,660
my beloved will get to come back

395
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,460
as soon as possible.

396
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,700
Such honeyed words.

397
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,500
(A group of dark practitioners is approaching.)

398
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,020
(A group of dark practitioners is approaching.)

399
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,500
What's wrong?

400
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,540
What's wrong, Qianshuo?

401
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,500
Did Changlan

402
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,380
discover your location?

403
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,100
Are you all right?

404
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,420
Don't worry.

405
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,940
They won't be able to find me.

406
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,020
I'll lure them away

407
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,900
and cause a commotion

408
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,420
to distract Changlan

409
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,339
and buy time for you.

410
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,900
You…

411
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,380
You must be careful.

412
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,820
I will.

413
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,820
You too.

414
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,860
I know.

415
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,100
Well…

416
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm going to go now.

417
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,380
Leader Chenyi.

418
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,660
Your Majesty.

419
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,220
Why are you here?

420
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,540
I am here every day.

421
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,060
Why?

422
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,540
This is where

423
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,340
I parted

424
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,340
with my late wife.

425
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,139
Since then,

426
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,420
I'd be reminded of her

427
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,660
when the sun rises.

428
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,299
I did not know

429
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,020
that this was where Her Majesty was laid to rest.

430
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,220
I should've paid my respects to her at her grave.

431
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,940
She did not leave behind her body.

432
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,700
She left to cultivate by herself

433
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,740
when writing the Ghostly Eulogy back then.

434
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,620
When she reached

435
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:04,100
the eighth stage of the Ghostly Eulogy,

436
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,740
she knew

437
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,660
her end was near.

438
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
She did not want to be consumed by the dark aura,

439
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,460
so she used the Frost Blossom Technique

440
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,059
to seal

441
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
her mind's eye.

442
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,780
On the last day of her life,

443
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,100
she put on her wedding dress

444
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,300
and danced her last dance for me

445
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,740
right here.

446
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,420
Our people live in the southwest,

447
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,100
where the climate is warm.

448
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,060
It does not snow where we live.

449
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,180
But during those few days…

450
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,180
The snow raged

451
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,420
for ten days and ten nights.

452
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:18,669
Everything was covered

453
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,180
in white

454
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,300
as if

455
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
to mourn her.

456
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,540
Your Majesty,

457
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,100
why are you telling me all of this?

458
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,779
The world always regarded

459
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,859
the Ghostly Eulogy of Qingqiu

460
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,020
as the ultimate treasure,

461
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,260
but it has never considered

462
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
the pain one must suffer

463
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,500
to practice it.

464
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,900
I ask you, Miss Yan,

465
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,500
are you prepared to die?

466
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,020
Nothing

467
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,660
in this world

468
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
is easy.

469
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,020
I practice the Ghostly Eulogy

470
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,260
to live.

471
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,020
Not to die.

472
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,540
To live.

473
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,700
Not to die.

474
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,060
Xuelin,

475
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,660
may their fates be different

476
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,020
from ours.

477
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,779
You guys won't be able

478
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,740
to catch me!

479
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,620
There! After it!

480
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:49,940
Come on!

481
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,260
After it!

482
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,300
Come on!

483
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,260
Catch me if you can!

484
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,140
Where is it?

485
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,620
Over here.

486
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Come on! Catch me if you can!

487
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,740
I'm right here!

488
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,740
Over here!

489
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,700
Here!

490
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,620
I'm over here, you fools!

491
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,220
This way.

492
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,540
Where?

493
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,020
The sound came from this direction.

494
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Where is it? It's gone.

495
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,980
You're right.

496
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,900
I don't see it anymore.

497
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,660
I don't see it.

498
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,940
Lord Changlan.

499
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,059
So this is the thing

500
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,220
that was messing with us.

501
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,740
No.

502
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,300
The Flower Medallion will give away Xiange's whereabouts.

503
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,660
I can't let him find her.

504
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,900
Count you lucky this time.

505
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,180
(The dark aura is the source of the greatest evil in this world.)

506
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,980
(Only by eliminating it)

507
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,660
(can peace be returned to the world.)

508
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,020
(The solution has yet to be found.)

509
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,820
(May there be someone who can solve this matter after me.)

510
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,820
The dark aura is the source of the greatest evil in this world.

511
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,060
Xuelin…

512
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,780
I never thought that, in the end,

513
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,620
you would go as far as ending your own life

514
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,020
to see my death.

515
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,460
Xuelin!

516
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,180
If you want me to die,

517
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,020
then come back to life!

518
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,220
Or

519
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,060
I will turn this world upside down,

520
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,420
and you shall not rest in peace.

521
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,979
(The Dark Phantom only sought the Ghostly Eulogy)

522
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,060
(because)

523
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,500
(of Xuelin.)

524
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,899
Five hearts facing the sky,

525
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,180
lying underneath the lake.

526
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,019
Calm your heart and stop worrying.

527
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,379
Understand the underlying meaning.

528
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,499
Ponder upon its logic.

529
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,099
Empty without emptiness.

530
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,220
Enlightenment from emptiness.

531
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,899
Entering one's mind with one's eye.

532
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,219
Move your brain, and you feel dizzy.

533
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,540
Only then, you shall see two.

534
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,219
(Ghostly Eulogy) I've read this countless times,

535
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,180
but I still don't have

536
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,020
a single clue.

537
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,180
But these two lines…

538
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,740
If you turn them around,

539
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,060
(Empty without emptiness) they sound like

540
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:15,033
(enlightenment from emptiness.) the Jingming Chant.

541
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,539
Maybe it'll be easier

542
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
if I use the Jingming Chant

543
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:20,900
to grasp the Ghostly Eulogy.

544
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,780
To avoid accidentally going off the deep end,

545
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,780
I should ask

546
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:29,940
Leader Chenyi first.

547
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,020
I just observed your mind's eye

548
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,660
and realized

549
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,140
that the Spirit Dragon was born

550
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,620
from the purest and brightest aura of heaven and earth.

551
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,100
It is the ultimate counter

552
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,700
to the darkest and most sinister dark aura.

553
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,620
It is a pity

554
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,340
that you isolated yourself in the Dragon Valley all those years ago.

555
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:04,740
If we had

556
00:32:04,741 --> 00:32:06,260
your one-of-a-kind powers

557
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,020
in the battle

558
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:08,420
against Dark Phantom,

559
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,820
perhaps

560
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:11,340
the situation would be different today.

561
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,900
Back then, I isolated myself

562
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,660
from all matters of the world.

563
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,580
Later, I was deceived

564
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,180
and gravely wounded,

565
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,580
causing the spirits to be oppressed by the Taoists,

566
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,420
the balance of heaven and earth to be lost,

567
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,300
and the dark aura to grow.

568
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,980
Once Yanhui recovers,

569
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,060
I will take up my responsibilities once more.

570
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,780
What are you doing, Your Majesty?

571
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,620
I thank the Spirit Dragon

572
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,540
on behalf of Qingqiu.

573
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,860
Please get up.

574
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,140
This is something

575
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:49,460
I should've done a long time ago.

576
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,420
Your Majesty.

577
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,300
Yanhui.

578
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,300
You're here too.

579
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,740
What are you guys doing?

580
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,100
We are discussing ways

581
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,380
to deal with Dark Phantom.

582
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,580
How are things coming along with the Ghostly Eulogy?

583
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,019
I've read it many times

584
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,940
(Ghostly Eulogy) and memorized everything.

585
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:06,980
But I still can't

586
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:08,260
find the right way to get started.

587
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,780
However, I noticed some things that were familiar.

588
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,740
Here.

589
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,979
It's written here. Empty without emptiness.

590
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,260
Enlightenment from emptiness.

591
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,459
This is similar

592
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,380
to the Jingming Chant of the Chenxing Mountain.

593
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,580
The Jingming Chant?

594
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,539
The Jingming Chant

595
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,619
is the basis of all magic

596
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,940
of the Chenxing Mountain.

597
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,900
Master Lingxiao once told me

598
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,060
that all magic and spells of the nine sects

599
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,140
originated

600
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,100
from the Jingming Chant.

601
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,620
I cultivated at Chenxing Mountain for ten years.

602
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
I am familiar

603
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:40,860
with the Jingming Chant.

604
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,260
I do have insights on that chant.

605
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,620
That reminds me.

606
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Her Majesty

607
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,380
once cultivated in Chenxing Mountain.

608
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,300
I wonder

609
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:50,259
if there is any connection between the Jingming Chant

610
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,420
and the Ghostly Eulogy.

611
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,179
I never heard her

612
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,140
mention this.

613
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,180
If that's the case,

614
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,139
then I have no idea

615
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,340
how I can practice this.

616
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:02,940
Miss Yan,

617
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,340
do not be anxious.

618
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,980
Cultivation requires steps and patience.

619
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,340
Let us begin

620
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,380
with the first stage.

621
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,580
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

622
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,220
But I will need you

623
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
to leave us, Tianyao.

624
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,980
Why?

625
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,780
Cultivating the Ghostly Eulogy

626
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,948
demands the practitioner to undergo

627
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,350
the pain of having their meridians overturned.

628
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,140
I am certain

629
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:26,260
that Miss Yan can endure it.

630
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,780
But I worry you might not be able to bear seeing her suffer.

631
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,540
There's nothing to worry about.

632
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,700
I will stay here

633
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,340
and protect both of you.

634
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,780
All right.

635
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,740
To cultivate the Ghostly Eulogy,

636
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,419
you must sit

637
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,820
facing north

638
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,860
with the strongest Yin energy

639
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,100
at the four hours

640
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,540
of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You.

641
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,620
It is the hour of Mao now.

642
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,140
The Silver Moon Cliff happens

643
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,660
to face Yin with its back against Yang.

644
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,299
Let us begin

645
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,260
cultivating.

646
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,340
All right.

647
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,380
Take the lotus position.

648
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,140
Fingertips facing forward.

649
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Open your Dantian.

650
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,260
Exhale.

651
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,700
Inhale.

652
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,820
Draw cold air into your Dantian.

653
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,500
A struggling life.

654
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,340
You dare to attempt to cultivate my technique?

655
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,620
Tianyao.

656
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,860
Be patient.

657
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,420
She has no choice

658
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,980
but to rely on herself now.

659
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,300
Yanhui.

660
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,620
How much longer will it take?

661
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,300
12 weeks.

662
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,740
Yanhui.

663
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,140
This is just the beginning.

664
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,500
With every stage, every breakthrough she makes,

665
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,780
the pain of meridians being reversed

666
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:43,900
will intensify.

667
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,660
Tianyao,

668
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,100
I can understand

669
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:48,300
how you feel.

670
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,620
How I wished I could suffer on behalf of Xuelin

671
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,740
when she cultivated his technique back then.

672
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,140
Did you regret

673
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,220
not taking the risk for her

674
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,860
when she died?

675
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,900
I am burdened with the responsibility of protecting all spirits.

676
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,460
It was a sacrifice I had to make.

677
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,140
I've already failed her once.

678
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,300
I won't fail her again.

679
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,580
We have unwanted guests.

680
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,260
Stay here and look after her.

681
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,100
I won't let anything happen to you.
