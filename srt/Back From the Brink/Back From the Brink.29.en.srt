1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 29)

3
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,590
This is...

4
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Where am I?

5
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
The visual spell master?

6
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,360
Immortal Zichen?

7
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,520
Taoist Zihuan?

8
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,240
The Taoist masters who had ascended to Heaven

9
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
are all here?

10
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,520
Lingxiao.

11
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
Master?

12
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm relieved.

13
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,830
You arrived

14
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,990
right before my departure.

15
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,670
Master, why are you...

16
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,430
I don't have much time.

17
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
Listen to me.

18
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,590
This is Dark Phantom's mind's eye.

19
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,920
What you saw just now

20
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,669
were the 100,000 ghostly figurines.

21
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,960
Every figurine

22
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,590
acts as a vessel.

23
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,080
They contain

24
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,080
Dark Phantom's true strength.

25
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,390
Ever since I sealed Dark Phantom within my body,

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,830
I engaged his powers in a conflict

27
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
for hundreds of years.

28
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,990
In order to cut off

29
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:44,430
all of his connections with the outer world,

30
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,080
I stayed here

31
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
to seal his powers away.

32
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,270
However, over the last decade,

33
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,920
powers from external sources

34
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,920
had been pouring into this place.

35
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,800
Now,

36
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,760
I can only put the 100,000 figurines

37
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,270
under my control.

38
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,990
No other powers must come inside

39
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,710
and tip the scale.

40
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,640
If not, Dark Phantom will break the seal and be released.

41
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
By then,

42
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,150
no one else can keep him in check.

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Master,

44
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
so, you were waiting for me all along.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,640
I never waited for you.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,880
I was waiting for hope.

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,560
Coincidentally, you came.

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,030
Thus, you're the hope of the Taoist clans and all beings.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,910
Lingxiao,

50
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,960
after this, I'll turn into a kind of spiritual power,

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,560
merge myself with the seal

52
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,080
and use my life to suppress Dark Phantom.

53
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,710
I will open a path of escape

54
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,120
for you.

55
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,080
Take the path

56
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,560
and leave this place.

57
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,680
However, you must accomplish this task.

58
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,560
Destroy the Heart Protecting Scale.

59
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
Heart Protecting Scale?

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,880
Dark Phantom wishes to use the power of the Heart Protecting Scale

61
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,320
to break the seal.

62
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,320
Once you destroy it,

63
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,830
nothing else in the world can boost Dark Phantom's power.

64
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,710
Promise me.

65
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,080
Promise me!

66
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,910
Master!

67
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,590
Master!

68
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,830
(Lingxiao!)

69
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,120
(You must fulfill my request!)

70
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,400
(No regrets, Monk Kongbei, Diyi Clan. The past resentment, gushing out from the blood.)

71
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,660
(Souls wandering for lis, out for blood. Immortal Zichen of Zixiao Clan)

72
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,540
(Master Lingxiao, Chenxing Mountain)

73
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
(The Heart Protecting Scale.)

74
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,960
(Yanhui.)

75
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,790
So, this is Qingqiu.

76
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,640
Yunxi,

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,440
I've finally brought you home.

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,080
We were able to resolve the crisis in Qingqiu

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
all thanks to your help.

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,200
How's Changlan doing?

81
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,790
He took his own life.

82
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,590
It's over now.

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,390
However, even if we had dealt

84
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,960
a huge blow to Dark Phantom,

85
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,520
the root issue hasn't been dealt with.

86
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
It'll still haunt us.

87
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,320
Now, it seems

88
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,680
that only your spirit dragon flame

89
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,270
can get rid of the dark aura once and for all.

90
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,880
I understand what you mean.

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
I do intend

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,440
to retrieve my body.

93
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,270
Ever since my soul

94
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,680
managed to escape from the Soul Binding Wood,

95
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,320
I've retrieved my dragon bones and horns.

96
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,830
I still have two parts left.

97
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,030
I'll depart in three days.

98
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,910
I'll head to the place where my dragon veins were sealed away.

99
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,830
Where is it?

100
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,390
(Sanchong Mountain)

101
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,590
(It's within Sanchong Mountain, )

102
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,440
(under the Sword of Heaven.)

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,760
Sanchong Mountain?

104
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,680
It's the territory of the Taoist clans.

105
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
(Now, )

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
(the Taoist clans)

107
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,320
(are guarding the Obsidian River.)

108
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
(It's difficult for you)

109
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,200
(to cross the river.)

110
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,710
I have one item

111
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,150
that might be able to help you out.

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,390
This is?

113
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,710
This is the Leader's Seal.

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,830
It should be able to help you

115
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,880
cross the river discreetly.

116
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,150
You're giving me the Leader's Seal just like this?

117
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm afraid it's inappropriate to do so.

118
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,760
It's not.

119
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,080
The future of the world

120
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,470
depends on you.

121
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,590
Right now, Taoists and spirits are at odds with each other.

122
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,200
A war will happen eventually,

123
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,790
and Dark Phantom's influence will grow.

124
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,319
I can't dispatch my people

125
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,760
to assist you in the war openly.

126
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,910
I'll wait here for your return.

127
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,160
Thank you.

128
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,920
Your Majesty, I'm Feng...

129
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,710
Mr. Feng,

130
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,990
Xiange mentioned you to me before.

131
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,560
What's the matter?

132
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,830
Someone's here.

133
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,800
Who is it?

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,960
Mr. Lu, come in.

135
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,230
The sinner, Lu Musheng,

136
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,280
is here to greet Your Majesty.

137
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,080
Get up.

138
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,680
I was a boorish and lowly person.

139
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,830
I was lucky enough to win the heart

140
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,280
of Your Majesty's precious daughter, Princess Yunxi.

141
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,230
Although I'm seven chi tall,

142
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,440
(I couldn't protect my own wife.)

143
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,280
Initially, I wanted to take my own life

144
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,200
to repay her for her love.

145
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,750
However, I thought of her homeland.

146
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,440
Thus, I brought her back.

147
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,200
I hoped Yunxi's soul

148
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,110
could rest in her homeland.

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,350
What is this?

150
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,230
This is

151
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,800
the scented hair pouch

152
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,630
I exchanged with Yunxi when we got married.

153
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,350
This is also

154
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,320
her only proof of existence now.

155
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,710
Nothing else

156
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,830
was left behind.

157
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,990
Suying, the sworn enemy who had murdered Yunxi,

158
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,510
had already been nailed to the throne of Guanghan Sect's leader

159
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,350
by the Spirit Dragon, Tianyao.

160
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,590
I was useless.

161
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,440
I let my other half down.

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,590
Now, there's no way for me to be happy again.

163
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,470
Although I had disheveled hair and bare feet all my life,

164
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,280
I intend to reproach myself and repent for my mistakes.

165
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,990
My life is the only thing I have left.

166
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,920
Your Majesty, please decide what to do with me.

167
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,200
It's your family affair.

168
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,160
We shouldn't remain here.

169
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,110
Tianyao!

170
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,630
Since Yunxi was willing to marry you,

171
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,040
that means she truly fancied you.

172
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,870
I won't kill the person she loves.

173
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,750
Mr. Lu, please get up.

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,680
Suying was the one who killed Yunxi.

175
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,750
It wasn't you.

176
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,400
Yunxi and I were in love for over a decade,

177
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,800
yet I couldn't protect her.

178
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,200
Surviving until now,

179
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,990
I'm no longer attached

180
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,400
to anything in the world.

181
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,960
Mr. Lu,

182
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,470
thank you for traveling all the way here to send her home.

183
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,230
Your Majesty, if you're not willing

184
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,800
to grant me death,

185
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,800
please allow me

186
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,400
to remain in Qingqiu.

187
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,510
Please allow me to protect

188
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Yunxi's cenotaph for the rest of my life.

189
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,280
You're Yunxi's kin.

190
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,920
Qingqiu won't take your life

191
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,040
or chase you away.

192
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,440
If you do remain here,

193
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,990
you can live in the place

194
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,420
where Yunxi used to live.

195
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

196
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,500
Your Majesty.

197
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,860
Princess Yunxi passed away in Yongzhou.

198
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,740
My uncle, Feng Ming,

199
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,980
was Suying's accomplice.

200
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,820
Back then,

201
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,660
I couldn't stop him.

202
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,260
Are you worried

203
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,220
that I might hold a grudge against Yongzhou

204
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,540
and the Feng family?

205
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,620
Your Majesty, that's natural for you to do so.

206
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,620
However, the people of Yongzhou

207
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,980
shouldn't be implicated

208
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,020
because of the conflict between the two clans.

209
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,820
Suying was the cause of everything.

210
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,020
And it ends with her.

211
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
You may go.

212
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,860
Your Majesty, your benevolence knows no bounds.

213
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,540
However, I cannot rest at ease without getting rid

214
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,540
of the remaining evil supporters.

215
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,780
From now on,

216
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,020
I, Feng Qianshuo, am willing to hand over the Flower Bulletin

217
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,700
to the messengers of Qingqiu.

218
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,180
I swear that the descendants of the Feng family

219
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,420
will protect Qingqiu for generations.

220
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,300
Xuelin,

221
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,860
have you seen Yunxi?

222
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,020
If we do meet again in the future,

223
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,420
will you blame me

224
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,860
for failing to take care of our daughter?

225
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,580
Spirit Dragon Tianyao.

226
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,260
I will return the dragon-scale armor

227
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,940
to its owner now.

228
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,540
The dragon-scale armor doesn't contain the Heart Protecting Scale.

229
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,540
Although it cannot help you become an immortal,

230
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,500
it can sustain your life.

231
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,820
Without it,

232
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,060
judging from your body condition,

233
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,380
I'm afraid you won't survive for long.

234
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,780
That's the fate

235
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,580
I've been looking for.

236
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,380
Suying

237
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
has been nailed

238
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,620
to the throne of Guanghan Sect's sect leader.

239
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,340
Now, I can finally

240
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,420
take off the dragon-scale armor

241
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,340
and return it to you.

242
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,100
Now,

243
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,980
I can finally be alone.

244
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,980
I can finally keep guard over Yunxi without any worries.

245
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,500
You're leaving

246
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,340
together

247
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
with Yanhui?

248
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,860
She will remain in Qingqiu.

249
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,180
I might only be able

250
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,860
to return after some time.

251
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,740
During that period, you...

252
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,140
I understand.

253
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,460
She's Xiange's good friend.

254
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,260
I will look after her

255
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,740
when you're not around.

256
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,340
Don't worry.

257
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,700
No need for that.

258
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,540
She'll do fine by herself.

259
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,140
I just wanted to say

260
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,700
that I joined the Flower Bulletin

261
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,900
under her name before this.

262
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,980
If you do make a profit,

263
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,060
please don't

264
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,500
forget about her.

265
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,820
When I'm not around,

266
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,540
she'll be happier

267
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,300
if she has money to spend.

268
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,500
Tianyao,

269
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,140
I can feel

270
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,580
your love for her.

271
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,780
But you...

272
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,580
How can you think that I'm someone

273
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,980
who steals wealth from other people?

274
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,540
Although I'm young,

275
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,660
I'm a gentleman.

276
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,100
Also, I'm a man of my word!

277
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,940
Regarding the profit,

278
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,980
I'll make sure she receives every single cent of it.

279
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
You don't need to worry about it.

280
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,220
I'm glad to hear that.

281
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,300
Thank you.

282
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,260
Don't you think you're belittling me here?

283
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,540
What's the most charming thing about men?

284
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,940
It's their integrity.

285
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,260
Mr. Feng! We're in trouble!

286
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,940
Mr. Feng, I was looking for you.

287
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,860
This is rare.

288
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,340
Usually, no one looks for me.

289
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,780
But today, everyone is looking for me.

290
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,180
What's the matter?

291
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,980
It's about my relationship.

292
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,420
You came to the right person.

293
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,740
I heard

294
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,820
that you got yourself a mistress before.

295
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,980
Xiange is pretty generous, huh?

296
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,780
That was in the past.

297
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,180
And I did it to seek revenge.

298
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,540
I was finding myself an assistant.

299
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,420
Besides,

300
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,740
I did it to provoke Xiange.

301
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,940
What do you mean by that?

302
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,659
Let me put it this way.

303
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,260
Whenever I hold a wedding banquet,

304
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,180
it's always

305
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,860
the same person.

306
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,740
The same person?

307
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,140
I tell outsiders that I did it to recruit intelligence personnel.

308
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,820
It's just an excuse.

309
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,460
No one knows who the person is with a red veil on their head.

310
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,860
I understand now.

311
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,100
It's always the same person?

312
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,140
Do you still have passion for her then?

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,300
No.

314
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,740
Seems like you're inexperienced yourself.

315
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,420
Goodbye.

316
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,540
Why were you looking for me?

317
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,540
I'm going to propose

318
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,620
to Huan Xiaoyan.

319
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,180
Do you think I'll be rejected?

320
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,180
Yes, I do.

321
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,060
What?

322
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,740
Although I don't know

323
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,260
how exactly things are going on between you guys,

324
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,940
I feel like

325
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,140
that lass

326
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
is still quite immature.

327
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,500
I think it'll be difficult.

328
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,900
Besides, you're so childish.

329
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,860
No lady is willing to be together

330
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,660
with a man more childish

331
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,660
than her.

332
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,020
You do have a point.

333
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,580
Wait!

334
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,020
Are you saying

335
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,540
that I'll definitely be rejected?

336
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,140
Probably.

337
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,500
Now that I've exacted revenge,

338
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,060
I feel like the Phantom Ring

339
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,100
is even shinier now.

340
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
I was looking for you.

341
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,660
What are you doing here?

342
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,860
Why were you looking for me?

343
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,540
Nothing.

344
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,700
I did it just for fun.

345
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,620
I thought you would leave

346
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,180
without bidding farewell

347
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,420
after exacting revenge.

348
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,340
I do plan to leave.

349
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,820
You're really planning to leave?

350
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,820
Why do you look shocked?

351
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,980
Now, I'm the Phantom Queen.

352
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm a major figure that shoulders the fate of my clan.

353
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,700
Of course I have to travel around

354
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,220
and look for an excellent place

355
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,340
for the revival of my clan.

356
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,620
Excellent place?

357
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,380
Isn't Qingqiu an excellent place?

358
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,380
Qingqiu?

359
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,300
It belongs

360
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,940
to the Nine-Tailed Fox Clan.

361
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,340
No.

362
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,460
If so, I...

363
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,340
There are other spirits

364
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,580
in Qingqiu too.

365
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,220
If so, do you plan to give me a piece of land?

366
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,580
A piece of land?

367
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,580
I need a large piece of land.

368
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,620
First, I need to erect tombstones

369
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,780
for the late clan members.

370
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,740
After that, I'll recruit new talents

371
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,460
and teach them the ways of the phantom spirits

372
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,740
so that our bloodline can be extended.

373
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,060
From that moment onward, the Phantom Clan

374
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,820
will thrive for generations to come.

375
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,060
I need a large piece of land

376
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,420
and talents from all around the world.

377
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,660
You want a piece of land?

378
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,340
Right now,

379
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,340
I don't have the right to do so.

380
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,020
However, you protected me well.

381
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,100
I'm willing to bite the bullet

382
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,860
and take you under me.

383
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,900
You can be my aide.

384
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,740
In the future, you...

385
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,380
Stop!

386
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,100
I'm a queen.

387
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,740
You want me to bow to you?

388
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,180
I...

389
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,459
Thank you for your kindness.

390
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,220
But I don't need it.

391
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,220
Farewell.

392
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,140
You don't need to see me off.

393
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,740
What are you doing?

394
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,260
Why don't you stay here?

395
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,020
I'm the last surviving member

396
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,420
of the Phantom Clan.

397
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,260
I won't become someone else's subject.

398
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,260
Do you understand?

399
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,460
You're not here to be my subject.

400
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,140
Will you give me a piece of land then?

401
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,620
Yes...

402
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,860
and no.

403
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,340
Be specific.

404
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,220
When I'm capable enough

405
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,060
to rule over Qingqiu,

406
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,820
you can

407
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,340
be my queen.

408
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,100
That's what it means.

409
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,340
Over here.

410
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,620
There's a situation!

411
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,180
What's the matter?

412
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,100
It's something huge!

413
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,460
This time, it's huge!

414
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,220
Is it about the living

415
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,580
or the dead?

416
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,300
It's about me!

417
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,100
Why would someone

418
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,260
talk to me in that manner?

419
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,700
I was so shocked that I slapped him

420
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,660
without knowing it.

421
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:14,582
But I think

422
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,220
I went a little overboard.

423
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,259
I'm so frustrated and confused right now.

424
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,860
I'm so flustered!

425
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,380
Yanhui, you're experienced when it comes to this!

426
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,220
Hurry and think of something for me!

427
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,220
Is it about going bald?

428
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,180
I'm talking about marriage!

429
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,980
Marriage?

430
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,660
Zhuli said he wants to marry me.

431
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,340
Did Zhuli truly say that?

432
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,460
What about my hair?

433
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,980
Zhuli had feelings for you since long ago.

434
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,539
This isn't something bad.

435
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,700
Why are you so flustered?

436
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,220
I don't know.

437
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,260
I had never thought of it before.

438
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm very confused.

439
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,260
Is there an issue with that?

440
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
I kind of watched Zhuli grow up.

441
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,420
If that brat

442
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,300
could tell you something like that

443
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,220
personally,

444
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,820
that means he's deeply in love with you.

445
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm so envious that you have someone

446
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,820
with a deep crush on you.

447
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,180
Why don't you consider it?

448
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,780
Consider what?

449
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,420
Consider if you like him or not.

450
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
I've never fallen in love before.

451
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,860
But

452
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,940
I don't know if this counts or not.

453
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,140
You must think it through

454
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,820
before getting married.

455
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,540
It's a serious matter.

456
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,860
If so, did you think it through

457
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,460
before you got married

458
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,820
to the Dragon King?

459
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,220
We got married twice.

460
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,180
We were forced to get married both times.

461
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,580
I had no time to think.

462
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,220
But of course,

463
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,820
I don't regret my decision.

464
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,540
Anyway, I thought

465
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,220
it was troublesome

466
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,660
when you got married to the Dragon King.

467
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,740
Naturally.

468
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,340
In Qingqiu, we can only

469
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,020
marry one person our entire life.

470
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,220
Marriage is very important to us.

471
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,580
The six rites of marriage in Qingqiu,

472
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,460
matching, asking, preparing dowries,

473
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,980
cleaning, setting dates, and getting married,

474
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,380
all of them are essential.

475
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,540
And the nuptial agreement too.

476
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,500
I think it's pretty troublesome

477
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,420
to write something like that.

478
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,060
That's not required

479
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,860
in Qingqiu.

480
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,060
It isn't required?

481
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,220
Mr. Yan told me about it before.

482
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,060
He said

483
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,140
the Dragon King did so of his own accord.

484
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,140
(He did so of his own accord?)

485
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,660
The nuptial agreement is gone!

486
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,340
(Spirit Dragon Tianyao)

487
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,260
(Speaking of which, )

488
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,660
(I didn't even know what he wrote)

489
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,100
(in the nuptial agreement.)

490
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,620
(Excellence, azure)

491
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,780
(If)

492
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,020
(As well)

493
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,180
(Forever)

494
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,340
(Moon, kindness)

495
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,020
(Red, kindness, Forever, End, Morning)

496
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,900
(Prove)

497
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,980
(White)

498
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:46,140
(Forever)

499
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,580
"Today's the joyous day of our marriage."

500
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,340
May our happiness last.

501
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,980
In days to come,

502
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,980
may our love last eternally...

503
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,020
May we grow old together,

504
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,660
as the red string ties us together,

505
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,340
the flowers bloom and the moon shines.

506
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,180
We shall stay together

507
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,180
until the end of time.

508
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,580
With this as my proof, I, Spirit Dragon Tianyao,

509
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,020
am willing to lead my wife, Yanhui...

510
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,220
"-to enjoy our lives together." -To enjoy our lives together.

511
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,140
(Look at this dull man.)

512
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,060
(Tianyao, Yanhui) (He's better at writing than saying it out.)

513
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,220
Yanhui,

514
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,340
didn't you go for your hair treatment today?

515
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,180
Pufang did it for me the entire day.

516
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,140
Is there any progress?

517
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,940
Some baby hair did grow.

518
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,220
What is this?

519
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,700
The dragon-scale armor.

520
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,580
Lu Musheng returned it to me.

521
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,580
Dragon-scale armor?

522
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,140
That scholar, did he come to Qingqiu?

523
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,620
He's guarding Yunxi's cenotaph.

524
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,940
It seems like

525
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,660
you don't hate him.

526
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,340
Although he was the cause

527
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,660
of the conflict between me and Suying,

528
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,500
it had nothing to do with him.

529
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,900
I don't hate

530
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
this mortal.

531
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,260
Now,

532
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,060
he's just

533
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,420
a minor figure.

534
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,020
For her selfish desire,

535
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,740
Suying resorted to

536
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,940
all kinds of evil deeds.

537
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,380
In the end, she still didn't get what she wished for.

538
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,660
I guess

539
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,980
it's her retribution.

540
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,940
Now that you put it like this,

541
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,380
I do feel delighted about it.

542
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,020
Millennium Spirit Dragon, you got led astray.

543
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,620
It depends on the person I mingle with.

544
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,500
Why are you packing your stuff?

545
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,260
It was just a coincidence.

546
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,220
I was just about to look for you.

547
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,460
Open it.

548
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,180
I...

549
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,660
I'm not dreaming, aren't I?

550
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,420
No, you're not.

551
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,620
Look again.

552
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,540
It stings my eyes!

553
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,620
It's for you.

554
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,900
For me?

555
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,300
Wait,

556
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,940
where did you get so much money from?

557
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,420
Don't tell me

558
00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:19,860
you robbed Qingqiu's treasury?

559
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,860
I've been alive for a millennium.

560
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,340
I do have some savings

561
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,740
under my name.

562
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,260
If so, why were you so poor back then?

563
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,820
You even borrowed money from my friend.

564
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,300
Fine, I got it.

565
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,060
You were just having a difficult time back then.

566
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,660
But you're giving all of them

567
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,620
to me?

568
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,580
Yes, all of them.

569
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,180
Don't you want to keep some for yourself?

570
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,700
You can keep some just in case

571
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,260
you get into trouble again.

572
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:53,940
I don't need them.

573
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,900
I'm fine as long as you're happy.

574
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,100
When I'm away,

575
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,660
if you don't have enough money to spend,

576
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,500
you can go to Feng Qianshuo.

577
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,420
He'll give you money.

578
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,740
He'll give me money?

579
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,060
How much can he give me?

580
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,380
Wait.

581
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,260
Where are you going?

582
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
I'm going to retrieve my body.

583
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,340
I know you don't like to travel around.

584
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,140
You can wait for me in Qingqiu.

585
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,580
Yanhui.

586
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,940
Where are you going?

587
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,340
I'm going to pack my stuff.

588
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,420
I'll tag along.

589
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,020
You...

590
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,740
You want to tag along?

591
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,220
But it'll be a perilous journey.

592
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,820
If so, all the more we need to travel together.

593
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,540
It's decided then.

594
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,460
This.

595
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Take it back.

596
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,420
We can spend it together

597
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
after we come back.

598
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,780
Miss Yan.

599
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,260
What's the matter?

600
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,059
I invented

601
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,540
a new needle treatment for hair growth

602
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
that has never been seen before.

603
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,700
I thought we already completed the treatment today?

604
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,940
You can grow 80 strands of hair from 1 needle alone.

605
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,580
Really?

606
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,100
Try it.

607
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,300
Will this really work?

608
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,340
Trust me.

609
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
That Xifeng,

610
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,820
what did he do

611
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,740
when he was in Chenxing Mountain?

612
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,060
You mean my junior?

613
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,060
He's just an ordinary

614
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,540
four-star disciple in Chenxing Mountain.

615
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,380
How could you say he's ordinary?

616
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,980
He's not ordinary at all.

617
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,740
My junior has superb medical skills.

618
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,660
He's the number one healer in Chenxing Mountain.

619
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,100
If so, aren't you curious

620
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,580
as to how we got to know each other?

621
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,860
I'm not.

622
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,940
I'm curious.

623
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,540
How did you two get to know each other?

624
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,820
Let me tell you then.

625
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,220
Not long ago,

626
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,780
I crossed the Obsidian River in secret

627
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,260
to collect herbs in Sanchong Mountain.

628
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,820
Who are you?

629
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,860
Don't come near me!

630
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,780
Spirit, where did you come from?

631
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,900
Don't come near me!

632
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,059
(Pharmacist of Chenxing Mountain, Xifeng)

633
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,500
You...

634
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,460
Your medicine pot is pretty nice.

635
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,900
Taoist, the Chinese mugwort you gathered

636
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,540
was pretty good too.

637
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,580
You could tell

638
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,700
that it was top-grade Chinese mugwort?

639
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,700
Could it be that you're a pharmacist too?

640
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,500
Don't come near me.

641
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,860
I'm just here to gather herbs.

642
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,540
I won't make things difficult for you.

643
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,980
So don't make things difficult for me.

644
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,340
Let's go our separate ways.

645
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
What do you think?

646
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,740
I agree.

647
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,580
You can go first.

648
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,460
You first.

649
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
You first.

650
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,220
Let's depart together.

651
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,020
Okay.

652
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,900
Wait! You mustn't go over there!

653
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,020
That area is...

654
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,540
Didn't we agree to go our separate ways?

655
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,300
Don't go there!

656
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,180
Don't follow me!

657
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,780
That area is dangerous!

658
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,780
I only found out

659
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,580
that he came after me

660
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,940
because he was afraid that I might fall into

661
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,900
the magical trap.

662
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,460
When we were trapped inside...

663
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,380
You had a love-hate relationship.

664
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,180
After that,

665
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,380
you guys escaped.

666
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,060
Then, he released you.

667
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:39,700
And he didn't kill you.

668
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,260
Thus,

669
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:40,940
you fell for him.

670
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,700
Am I right?

671
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,300
How did you know?

672
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,060
Could it be that he mentioned me to you before?

673
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,020
It's a cliche plot that everyone knows.

674
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,340
I could come up with that with my eyes closed.

675
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,020
Hey, will I go bald

676
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,580
from all the needles you put on my head?

677
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,380
You were bald anyway.

678
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,940
It's fine that you think that I'm annoying.

679
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Don't let me know

680
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,300
and never tell me about that.

681
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,380
If I find out,

682
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,660
I'll stick the needles into your head

683
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,740
harshly.

684
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,100
You're something else.

685
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,300
You're truly something else.

686
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,580
I wish to know where he is so badly.

687
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,100
I wish to see the people that he had met

688
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,540
and the conversations they had.

689
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,540
Those operas performed by mortals,

690
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,460
they always talked about lovesickness.

691
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,420
I didn't understand it back then.

692
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,260
But now, I understand it completely.

693
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,060
I miss him so much.

694
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,460
So, does Xifeng

695
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,060
like you too?

696
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,060
The fact that I like him

697
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,340
has nothing to do with him at all.

698
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,580
So, it's a one-sided crush?

699
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,300
You're very brave.

700
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,300
I'm here to tell you

701
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,979
that you cannot stop the hair treatment

702
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,140
once you start it.

703
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,940
Are you trying to threaten me

704
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,220
with my hair

705
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,500
so that I could bring you across the Obsidian River

706
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,380
and meet my junior, right?

707
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,100
May I?

708
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,020
No.

709
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,219
The land of the Taoist is dangerous.

710
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,300
I cannot bring you there.

711
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,580
Don't you care about your baldness?

712
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,219
You cannot lump

713
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,180
these two matters together.

714
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Yanhui,

715
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,100
although I can treat all kinds of sicknesses,

716
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,420
I can't cure myself of lovesickness.

717
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,660
I know I shouldn't do this.

718
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,740
But you shouldn't

719
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,780
risk your life because of it.

720
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,540
Love needs patience.

721
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,420
You need to bear with it.

722
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,140
After all, you can only fall in love when you're alive.

723
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,860
Huan Xiaoyan,

724
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,380
didn't you say

725
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,660
that you want to leave Qingqiu

726
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,620
in search of an excellent place?

727
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
I'm going on a journey

728
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,140
to help Tianyao retrieve his body parts.

729
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
Why are you still in Qingqiu?

730
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,140
I...

731
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,900
I have to stay here for a few more days

732
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,060
and check the Records of Mountains.

733
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,140
Maybe it can lead me

734
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,740
to new discoveries.

735
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,340
Let me help you out.

736
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,220
Don't be a busybody.

737
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,140
I will go to

738
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:30,300
the Brush Sprite myself.

739
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,180
Xiange,

740
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,060
do you have news of Master

741
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:36,140
and Bai Xiaosheng?

742
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,780
Don't worry.

743
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,820
I'll notify you immediately

744
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,100
once I have any news of them.

745
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
The Flower Medallion is crushed.

746
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,700
We can't locate people that quickly now.

747
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,100
But you don't need to be too worried.

748
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,380
Losing your treasure

749
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,740
must be a huge blow

750
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,020
to your career.

751
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,260
Hang in there. The storm will pass soon.

752
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,300
You're making it as if

753
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,179
that didn't deal a huge blow

754
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,260
to your career.

755
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,780
Don't forget,

756
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,940
we share wealth and woe together.

757
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,100
We share the risk together.

758
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,660
What do you mean by that?

759
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,020
Who wants to share the risk with you?

760
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,580
Seems like you have no idea about it yet.

761
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,740
Tianyao spent quite a sum

762
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,980
for you to join the Flower Bulletin.

763
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,860
Is that true?

764
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,620
Yanhui,

765
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,300
ever since the relationship between the two realms turned sour,

766
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,820
the Taoist clans had stationed most of their forces

767
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,900
at Sanchong Mountain.

768
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,980
It'll be dangerous.

769
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,860
You guys must be careful.

770
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,940
You guys don't need to worry.

771
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,220
My father instructed me

772
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,380
to wait for the Dragon King's return.

773
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:26,460
If he's in danger,

774
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,820
Qingqiu will do everything in its power

775
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,020
to keep you guys safe.

776
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,020
Okay.

777
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,580
Thank you.

778
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,100
It's no wonder you told me

779
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,740
to ask Feng Qianshuo for money.

780
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,580
When did you...

781
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,780
I owed you too much before this.

782
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,380
It'll be great

783
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,940
if I can make it up to you

784
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,740
with these worldly items.

785
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,540
You call this making it up to me?

786
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,580
In the future, you don't need to hide your intention

787
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,820
if you wish to be nice to me.

788
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,180
Okay.

789
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,940
We've arrived at the Obsidian River.

790
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,420
Let's go and chop some bamboo.

791
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,020
There's no need for that.

792
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,540
Chenyi gave me this item.

793
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,820
It can help us out.

794
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,020
As long as I activate the seal,

795
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,100
we can cross the river in a flash.

796
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,620
Something like that actually exists?

797
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,420
There's only one item like that.

798
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,740
It belongs to the Leader of Qingqiu.

799
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Let's hurry and cross the river.

800
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,300
Pufang?

801
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,340
What are you doing here?

802
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,260
You're so bold.

803
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,340
How dare you come here?

804
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,180
Tianyao, send her back.

805
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,460
I'm not going back.

806
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,860
Enough. Stop messing around.

807
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,100
You shouldn't be here when you're this weak.

808
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,220
Are you here to die?

809
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,620
They don't understand me at all.

810
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,780
I thought at least

811
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:50,820
you would understand me.

812
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,540
Stop pretending to be pitiful.

813
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,380
Do you think I'll allow you to go

814
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,620
just because of your act?

815
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,700
How could you be

816
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,580
so unsympathetic?

817
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,060
I'm telling you to go back

818
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,660
because I'm sympathetic.

819
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,940
I told you already. You can only fall in love when you're alive.

820
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,780
Do you know that?

821
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,340
I'll come back after seeing him.

822
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,660
I won't stay there for long.

823
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,780
Are you okay?

824
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,180
We mustn't let her wander off.

825
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,500
I don't know where she went.

826
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,500
Let's split up.

827
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,380
We have to find her.

828
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,180
Be careful.

829
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,260
Xifeng!

830
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,220
It's me.

831
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,140
What are you doing here?

832
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,740
Why did you come here?

833
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,060
I'm here to see you.

834
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,940
I missed you.

835
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,100
Do you know where you are?

836
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,620
Moreover, you're a spirit.

837
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,660
You shouldn't be here.

838
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,260
Hurry and go back!

839
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,500
I was always sincere with you.

840
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,860
Were you ever sincere with me?

841
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,860
Even just a little?

842
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,860
Although I didn't kill you before,

843
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,220
it doesn't mean I won't kill you today.

844
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,180
It's not too late

845
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,700
for you to kill me right now.

846
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,020
There's a full moon today.

847
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,500
It's inappropriate for me to kill.

848
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,100
Just go.

849
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,980
You're more stubborn than me.

850
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,220
I just said

851
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,979
that no spirits would ever risk their lives

852
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,380
and come to Sanchong Mountain.

853
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,060
I didn't expect

854
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,340
to see one today.
