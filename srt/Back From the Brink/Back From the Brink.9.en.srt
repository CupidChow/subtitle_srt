1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,444
She wishes to seal off Yongzhou City.

4
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,494
We mustn't stay here any longer.

5
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:57,774
You will be implicated.

6
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,774
I'm not afraid. So what are you afraid of?

7
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:00,694
Don't worry.

8
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:14,044
The area above ground is no longer safe.

9
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,974
Let's head underground.

10
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,374
Be careful.

11
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:21,604
(Yongzhou Underground City) Xiange,

12
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:22,759
what place is this?

13
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:23,924
Yongzhou City is quite far away

14
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:25,004
from Qingqiu.

15
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:26,134
As the relationship

16
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:27,134
between the Taoists and the spirits

17
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:28,324
grows tenser,

18
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,435
to help monsters

19
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,490
that had lost their home

20
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:31,949
to avoid the Taoists,

21
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:33,854
I started to build

22
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:34,694
this underground city in secret

23
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:35,854
a few years ago.

24
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,004
Although it doesn't look the best,

25
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:39,484
it's the best I could do.

26
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:41,294
Be careful.

27
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,574
Is it easier for you if you hold this?

28
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,374
It's much better.

29
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,604
Go there and bring them here.

30
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:48,044
Be careful.

31
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:48,604
Fifth.

32
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:49,854
Bring him to his resting spot.

33
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:50,884
Yes, miss.

34
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:52,164
Let's go.

35
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,204
I'll check that place out.

36
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,324
Be careful.

37
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:56,574
Be careful.

38
00:02:59,574 --> 00:03:00,444
Hang in there.

39
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:01,574
Be careful.

40
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:02,414
Is he okay?

41
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:03,884
He'll be fine after taking the medicine.

42
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:04,814
Take the medicine first.

43
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:05,924
Don't worry.

44
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,164
Miss.

45
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,574
We're still sending the monsters

46
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:11,654
we saved to this place.

47
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:12,814
However,

48
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:14,534
the number of disciples of the Guanghan Sect on the streets is increasing.

49
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:16,204
If we keep this up,

50
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:17,094
I'm afraid

51
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:18,699
this place will get found out.

52
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,654
Be more careful.

53
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,044
Try to save as many as you can.

54
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:24,934
Yes.

55
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,004
So, all these years,

56
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:40,534
you spent all of Wangyu Tower's profit

57
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,004
on this underground city.

58
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,334
This place is huge.

59
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:44,774
How many monsters have you saved?

60
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,094
I didn't save that many of them before today.

61
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:48,884
However, the Arena was destroyed.

62
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:50,214
All of the monsters had escaped.

63
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,334
So,

64
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,214
you guys blew up the Arena, right?

65
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:57,774
We didn't expect it

66
00:03:57,814 --> 00:03:59,284
to be such a huge deal.

67
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,164
You're a human.

68
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,054
Why are you trying so hard to save the monsters?

69
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:07,844
I was raised by a spirit.

70
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:09,124
I'm just trying

71
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,534
to return the favor here.

72
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,444
It's a shame that taking them in

73
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:16,934
is the best I could do.

74
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:26,374
Lend me a hand.

75
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:37,764
With the flow of Zi and Wu,

76
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:39,414
all is one.

77
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,324
Listen to my call, dragon scale.

78
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,564
And purge all sickness.

79
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:11,854
(Tianyao has been cultivating his spiritual power)

80
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:13,204
(after retrieving his dragon bone.)

81
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,684
(I never expected him)

82
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:15,979
(to be this powerful already.)

83
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,174
Are you okay?

84
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:31,084
I'm fine.

85
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:32,974
Stop acting tough.

86
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,124
I'm healed.

87
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,444
I'm healed too.

88
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,003
I'm healed!

89
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,721
-Me, too. -We're all fine now.

90
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:43,884
Sir, were you casting

91
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:45,524
a Spirit Dragon Spell just now?

92
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:50,644
You...

93
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,374
Are you the Spirit Dragon, Tianyao?

94
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:57,524
You know my name?

95
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,524
It is you!

96
00:05:59,644 --> 00:06:01,084
All hail the Dragon King!

97
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:01,854
All hail the Dragon King!

98
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:03,644
All hail the Dragon King!

99
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,644
He's the Spirit Dragon that vanished.

100
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:06,934
The Dragon King has returned!

101
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,124
There's hope for the Spirit Clan now!

102
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,614
All hail the Dragon King!

103
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:13,174
All hail the Dragon King!

104
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:27,294
You guys are injured.

105
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:28,884
Spare the formalities.

106
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:29,974
Get up.

107
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:32,174
Thank you, Your Majesty!

108
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:39,564
The Spirit Dragon has returned.

109
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:40,764
Everyone, do not give up on hope.

110
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,764
I've already ordered my men

111
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:43,054
to dig a corridor.

112
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:44,684
It'll be completed within three days.

113
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,084
By then,

114
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:47,544
you guys will regain freedom again.

115
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:49,524
This is great!

116
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,494
We're free!

117
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:51,174
We're free!

118
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:52,414
We're free!

119
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:54,204
We're free!

120
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,254
We're free!

121
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:01,734
This is great!

122
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,004
We're free!

123
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:09,854
Thank you.

124
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,854
Although you're powerful,

125
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:16,854
you shouldn't act tough.

126
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:17,884
I've saved you

127
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,204
many times.

128
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:20,734
Your life is considered precious.

129
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:22,524
I'm still waiting for you

130
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:23,934
to retrieve the rest of your body

131
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:25,934
and become the Spirit Dragon that can travel anywhere

132
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:26,734
so that you can repay me

133
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:28,004
and help me make a fortune.

134
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:32,524
Now that the Arena is blown to bits,

135
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:33,764
there's no need for you

136
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,004
to hide your identity any longer.

137
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,414
As for the pact of servitude,

138
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,494
I'll terminate it.

139
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:44,494
In the future,

140
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,414
you can meet her

141
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,374
as the Spirit Dragon.

142
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:58,294
Terminate.

143
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:11,764
I will definitely

144
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:13,614
repay your kindness in the future.

145
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:14,644
In the future?

146
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:15,854
What about today?

147
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,124
I've unlocked my mind's eye.

148
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,294
I wish to check it out.

149
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,414
Can you teach me

150
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,004
how to enter my mind's eye?

151
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:24,884
It's your first time, right?

152
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,084
I'll bring you in.

153
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:44,694
(He's so near!)

154
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:47,164
(Why does my heart still beat so fast)

155
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,574
(even though the Fox Incense has worn off?)

156
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:56,454
Must we

157
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:57,924
do it like this?

158
00:08:58,094 --> 00:08:58,804
Yeah.

159
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,644
(Yanhui's Mind's Eye)

160
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:33,694
All these black rocks,

161
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,719
what are they?

162
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,937
They should be the seal in your body.

163
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:38,404
Seal?

164
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,775
Why is there a seal in my body?

165
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,129
Who placed it here?

166
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,044
Is it because

167
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,771
I possess the Heart Protecting Scale?

168
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:46,884
Seals of such levels

169
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,574
can only be placed by grandmasters.

170
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,494
(Don't tell me it was Lingxiao?)

171
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,124
(If so, why did he...)

172
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,124
Did it remind you of someone?

173
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:06,004
No.

174
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,214
I was wondering

175
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:08,884
how to break the seal.

176
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,164
As long as your power

177
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,804
exceeds the power of the seal owner,

178
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:12,974
the seal will be dispelled.

179
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,214
So, how long do you think I need to train

180
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:15,854
with my aptitude?

181
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:19,974
If you do train hard enough,

182
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:20,884
the seal may be dispelled

183
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,004
one day.

184
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:25,804
Since this seal is that powerful,

185
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:26,694
I think even Suying

186
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,974
cannot dispel it.

187
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:30,044
Not really.

188
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:31,764
Suying already obtained the power of a master

189
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,734
20 years ago.

190
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:36,804
Do you wish to bet on that possibility?

191
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:40,854
If so, I think I'll train hard

192
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,129
and strive to return this stupid thing to you.

193
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:48,644
After this,

194
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,044
if you wish to enter your mind's eye again,

195
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:51,644
you must calm your heart, focus your mind,

196
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,574
and focus your consciousness on your dantian.

197
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,299
There goes your dinner.

198
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:14,849
Look at what you've done.

199
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,459
Since you're awake,

200
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,154
you should get dinner yourself next time.

201
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:21,249
Where am I?

202
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,299
This is the underground city.

203
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,386
It's a shelter for monsters like you all.

204
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,249
The underground again?

205
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,419
Is your boss a groundhog?

206
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:29,682
She loves digging holes, huh?

207
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:31,249
Hey, you.

208
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:31,945
Wait.

209
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:33,299
Where's the couple?

210
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:33,939
What couple?

211
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:34,579
That couple.

212
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:35,219
Who?

213
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:35,699
Dragon.

214
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,419
Dragon who?

215
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:37,889
Yanhui!

216
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,009
You mean Yanhui and Tianyao?

217
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,129
They're discussing important matters inside the room.

218
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:42,849
Important matters?

219
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,579
What important matters

220
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:44,489
do they have to discuss?

221
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,459
Are they getting married?

222
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:46,939
Are they going to consummate?

223
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,299
Are they going to have a child?

224
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:49,849
How should I know?

225
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:53,699
What else is more important

226
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:54,419
than

227
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:55,369
their date?

228
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,769
When I saw Suying,

229
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,249
she didn't even use her true effigy.

230
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,099
She suppressed us

231
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,009
with her primordial spirit alone.

232
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:05,729
Seems like it'll be difficult for us

233
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,009
to retrieve the dragon horns.

234
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:08,699
However,

235
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,699
why didn't she use her true effigy today?

236
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,129
Could it be

237
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:12,849
that there's something

238
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,129
more important than acquiring the dragon scale?

239
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:15,939
She might be cultivating elixirs with the Nine-Tailed Fox

240
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:17,849
using the dragon horns.

241
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,889
Nine-Tailed Fox? Elixirs?

242
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:30,609
(So, )

243
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,249
(the girl who was floating in mid-air, )

244
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,489
was she the Nine-Tailed Fox?

245
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,539
Isn't Suying afraid

246
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,099
that she might cause a conflict between Taoists and spirits?

247
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,419
The Fox Incense you were struck with

248
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:40,769
might be related to this.

249
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,059
The Fox Clan of Qingqiu

250
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,404
excels at charming spells.

251
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,419
Such incense

252
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,009
can only be produced using their essence.

253
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:49,489
The Nine-Tailed Fox of Qingqiu,

254
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,099
where exactly is she hiding

255
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:52,586
in my territory?

256
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,009
The Nine-Tailed Fox belongs to the nobles of Qingqiu.

257
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:55,969
You won't

258
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,249
find her whereabouts

259
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,819
even if you kill us right now.

260
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,649
So, Lingfei

261
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:02,489
was capturing fox spirits on Chenxing Mountain

262
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,579
to help Suying

263
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,849
locate the Nine-Tailed Fox.

264
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,769
Lingfei captured fox spirits on Chenxing Mountain.

265
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,299
After that, Suying

266
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:10,299
cultivated elixirs

267
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:11,419
with the Nine-Tailed Fox essence in Tianxiang Workshop.

268
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:12,459
If that's the case,

269
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,579
it seems like Chenxing Mountain and Guanghan Sect

270
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,539
were in cahoots all along.

271
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,889
That's impossible.

272
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,099
My master, he...

273
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,369
Lingxiao will never

274
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,459
let that happen.

275
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:26,059
As the acting sect leader

276
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,299
of Chenxing Mountain,

277
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:28,609
how could he have no idea

278
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:29,609
about what Lingfei had done?

279
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,059
I'm sure he had no idea.

280
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,249
Although he doesn't

281
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,769
see spirits as equal,

282
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:34,969
he will never

283
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:36,419
harm them

284
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,339
for his selfish desires.

285
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,539
Do you trust him that much?

286
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:42,849
You're not willing to burst your bubble.

287
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,299
However, the truth

288
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:45,459
is always the fact

289
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:46,489
you cannot accept the most.

290
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:47,539
You don't know him!

291
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:48,369
You don't know human nature!

292
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:49,769
Enough! Stop it!

293
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:53,419
What's with the commotion?

294
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,099
Where did you come from?

295
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,609
You scared me.

296
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,769
I could say the same for you.

297
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,539
I didn't risk my life to save you guys

298
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,419
so that you could argue with each other.

299
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:02,849
What do you want then?

300
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,009
What do I want?

301
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,729
Of course I want you two

302
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:07,855
to stay sweet

303
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:09,459
all the time.

304
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,179
Rest well.

305
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,219
I'll make a move first.

306
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:17,649
Who said you could leave?

307
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:18,249
Sit down!

308
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,369
If you dare step out

309
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,299
of this room,

310
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:24,889
I'll lure Suying

311
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:26,369
to the underground city tomorrow.

312
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,099
You must be out of your mind!

313
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:31,729
What's in it for you

314
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,099
if you reveal our whereabouts to her?

315
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,009
Do you think I'm a charity worker?

316
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,249
Of course there's a catch

317
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:38,649
to the favor I did for you two,

318
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:39,459
right?

319
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,099
If you two don't fulfill

320
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:42,649
my request,

321
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:43,579
I won't make things easy

322
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:44,939
for you two.

323
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:47,369
Come on then.

324
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,369
Give it a try.

325
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,369
I'm already tired enough.

326
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,969
I don't wish to argue with him.

327
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,649
Who said we were arguing?

328
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,339
We were doing fine.

329
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,538
It's just

330
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,609
that we raised our volume because we were too excited.

331
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,339
Am I right, Yao?

332
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,345
That's more like it.

333
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,249
Listen.

334
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,459
It's common for couples

335
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,339
to argue.

336
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:31,009
That means

337
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,699
you two are baring your hearts to each other.

338
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,219
But what's the most important thing?

339
00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:35,819
It's that you two must clear up the misunderstanding

340
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,179
after the argument.

341
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,527
Do not avoid any confrontations

342
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,849
or give each other the cold shoulder.

343
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,219
You two mustn't blame each other for it.

344
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,579
You two must talk

345
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:44,969
and communicate with each other.

346
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:45,729
Communicate, okay?

347
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,969
Yes, you're right.

348
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:49,434
All right then.

349
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:50,179
You two can spend

350
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,059
the night together.

351
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:54,922
What's the matter?

352
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,369
You guys wish to stay in separate rooms?

353
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:01,104
I don't want to

354
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,369
see that.

355
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:04,001
I want you two

356
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,240
to stay in the same room.

357
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,951
It's not like we never stayed in the same room before.

358
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,459
It's not a huge deal.

359
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:12,849
Sure.

360
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,009
We'll stay together.

361
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,489
Dragon, what's the matter?

362
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,849
Are you unhappy with it?

363
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:22,059
This isn't a negotiation anyway.

364
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,339
Although I'm injured,

365
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:26,339
I can spread your secrets

366
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:27,975
to the entire.

367
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,609
Yongzhou City.

368
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,889
Don't do that.

369
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,539
We'll follow your will.

370
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:34,819
Sleep in the same bed.

371
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:36,969
Sure, we'll sleep in the same bed.

372
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,009
Use the same blanket.

373
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,699
We'll use the same blanket.

374
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,579
Sleep on the same pillow too.

375
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,419
Perfect.

376
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,939
I will keep an eye on you two.

377
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:57,179
A great man knows when to yield and when not to.

378
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,129
We cannot afford

379
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,419
to make new foes again.

380
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:11,434
(Wangshu Manor)

381
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:31,609
You're very weak right now.

382
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,579
You must rest and recuperate.

383
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,259
This is the elixir I made for you.

384
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,259
Take it,

385
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,409
and you'll regain your memories.

386
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,929
You won't be bewitched by that fox spirit anymore.

387
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,059
She's not a spirit.

388
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:56,259
She's a human.

389
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,369
How could she help me

390
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,409
create this pill if she wasn't a fox spirit?

391
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:07,099
Help you create this pill?

392
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:08,209
That's right.

393
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,099
I created this pill using her essence.

394
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,129
You actually used Yunxi as a component for your elixir?

395
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,499
It's because she's a spirit!

396
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:21,539
Take it.

397
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:25,739
Musheng,

398
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,369
take it.

399
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:32,539
You'll remember everything, and everything will be fine

400
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,579
once you take it.

401
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:34,739
Take it.

402
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:35,739
No!

403
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,779
You actually sacrificed a live human for your elixir.

404
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,129
You've lost your mind!

405
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,889
Even if I do remember the past,

406
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,459
I will never love

407
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,329
an inhumane freak like you!

408
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,019
You're the monster here.

409
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,129
You're the devil!

410
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,129
Fine.

411
00:18:57,849 --> 00:18:59,299
I'll show you

412
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:01,019
a true monster today!

413
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,369
This is your so-called wife.

414
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,219
Did you see that?

415
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:18,939
She's a spirit.

416
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:22,059
She's the source of evil

417
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:24,779
that we swore upon our lives to get rid of!

418
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:31,019
Yunxi!

419
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:34,459
Yunxi!

420
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,019
Musheng?

421
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,939
Yunxi, it's me!

422
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:44,129
Yunxi!

423
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,499
Yunxi, it's me!

424
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,569
I'm going to bring you home.

425
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,939
The pear blossom in our courtyard

426
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,059
has started to bloom.

427
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:13,339
When the wind blows,

428
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:15,609
it's as if there's snow in our courtyard.

429
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,819
I'm sure you'll like it.

430
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:44,539
Musheng?

431
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:54,449
Don't look at me!

432
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,449
I'm a spirit!

433
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:56,499
You saved me!

434
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:57,889
Don't look at me!

435
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,649
We went through thick and thin together for 20 years.

436
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:04,539
How could I detest you

437
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,449
because of your looks?

438
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,209
You're my wife.

439
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,979
It doesn't matter if you're a spirit or a human.

440
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:19,499
Musheng,

441
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,369
I want to go home.

442
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,019
(It's all because of that fox spirit.)

443
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,209
She's a spirit!

444
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:17,409
(She was trying to seek revenge!)

445
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,929
I created this pill with her essence.

446
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,129
(She's a spirit!)

447
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:22,339
(She's a spirit!)

448
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,129
You've been completely bewitched

449
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,929
by this fox spirit.

450
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,369
That's why you cannot differentiate

451
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:34,415
between good and evil.

452
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,819
You will pay for it.

453
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:47,129
I will kill you!

454
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:18,929
I will make you remember everything.

455
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,409
I will help you

456
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,129
return to your original self.

457
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,059
The Nine-Tailed Fox?

458
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:35,259
Suying actually captured Princess Yunxi?

459
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:37,369
The clans of Qingqiu value their bloodline.

460
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,209
If they hear about this...

461
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:42,649
Try to bring this news

462
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:43,849
out of Yongzhou.

463
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,554
If Qingqiu hears about this,

464
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:46,409
they'll definitely send someone

465
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:47,539
to rescue Princess Yunxi.

466
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:49,209
That's a good thing for us too.

467
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,339
Yongzhou City has been sealed off.

468
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,129
The channels we used to convey news and information

469
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:53,129
are no longer available.

470
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:55,209
The underground corridor isn't completed yet too.

471
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:58,144
Go to Feng Qianshuo.

472
00:23:58,224 --> 00:23:59,014
He'll surely come up with an idea.

473
00:23:59,054 --> 00:23:59,904
Qijue Agency?

474
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,664
However, disciples of the Guanghan Sect

475
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,294
are crawling on the surface now.

476
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,574
It would be extremely difficult

477
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:06,464
to get in contact with Mr. Feng.

478
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:08,494
I'm indebted to Qingqiu.

479
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:09,774
Now that Princess Yunxi is in trouble,

480
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:11,494
I can't just stand idly by.

481
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:12,704
Prepare yourself.

482
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:14,904
Tonight, we shall make a secret trip to Qijue Agency.

483
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:15,464
Yes.

484
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:21,334
(The evil dragon has brought harm to Yongzhou City.)

485
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:22,574
(As per the order)

486
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:24,224
(of Master Suying of the Guanghan Sect, )

487
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:26,664
(from today onward, Yongzhou City will be sealed off.)

488
00:24:26,774 --> 00:24:28,224
(Apprehend the evil dragon)

489
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:29,734
(and the escaping monsters.)

490
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:32,424
(Take them down on the spot if you discover any of them.)

491
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:41,334
Qianshuo, you were hard to find.

492
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:43,631
(Yongzhou's Qijue Agency) You actually

493
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,014
got yourself a decent place.

494
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:48,624
That's fine.

495
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:50,464
In the end,

496
00:24:50,494 --> 00:24:51,774
Qijue Agency

497
00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,224
still became mine.

498
00:24:57,424 --> 00:24:58,814
Since when did you

499
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,384
start to suspect me?

500
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:04,944
To steal the Feng family's business,

501
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:06,944
you ordered your familiar to kill my parents.

502
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:09,224
How long did you think

503
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,055
you could hide that greedy intention of yours?

504
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,464
It's a shame

505
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,664
that you were under the protection of the Guanghan Sect for many years.

506
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,624
That's why I couldn't avenge my parents.

507
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:24,014
Back then,

508
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:25,144
your father died

509
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,974
because he was too kind

510
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,774
to those monsters.

511
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:30,624
I never expected you to follow in his footsteps

512
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:31,904
and collude with monsters.

513
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:41,054
Be honest with me

514
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:43,254
and tell me where the evil dragon is.

515
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,365
On account of our ties as uncle and nephew,

516
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:46,944
I might spare you.

517
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:48,254
Evil dragon?

518
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,534
Stop pretending!

519
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:50,624
You asked me

520
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:52,224
for the pair of master and familiar many times!

521
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:53,804
Wasn't her familiar the evil dragon?

522
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:56,734
Do you truly think

523
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:58,464
you can protect them?

524
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,184
So, you don't wish to speak?

525
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:06,624
My dear nephew.

526
00:26:08,774 --> 00:26:09,974
Seems like

527
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:11,974
we need to add a new memorial tablet

528
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,494
to the Feng family's ancestral hall.

529
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,109
(Closed)

530
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,259
(Qijue Agency)

531
00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:31,974
Come here!

532
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:33,704
Come here!

533
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:34,734
Come here!

534
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,734
Miss Xiange.

535
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:37,664
Did you come here

536
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:38,384
because you knew

537
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,294
what Young Master Feng was thinking?

538
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:40,334
Where's your young master?

539
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,534
My Young Master...

540
00:26:41,664 --> 00:26:42,664
He was captured.

541
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:43,734
Now, I'm afraid he...

542
00:26:43,864 --> 00:26:44,624
What?

543
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,384
Miss, calm down.

544
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:48,254
Judging from Mr. Feng's ability,

545
00:26:48,384 --> 00:26:49,334
I'm sure he's still safe now.

546
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:51,014
You're right.

547
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:52,664
But why was he captured

548
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:53,704
so easily?

549
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,294
He... I...

550
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:56,814
Don't panic.

551
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:57,734
Take your time.

552
00:26:58,224 --> 00:26:59,144
By the way,

553
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:00,624
this is the last item Young Master had left behind.

554
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:01,904
He told me

555
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:02,904
to pass it to you

556
00:27:02,974 --> 00:27:04,534
if he dies.

557
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:07,264
It's impossible

558
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:08,264
for him to die this easily.

559
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:09,584
When was the last time

560
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:10,374
you saw him?

561
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:11,984
Feng Ming took him away

562
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,024
and said he would add a new memorial tablet

563
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,214
to the Feng family's ancestral hall.

564
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:19,784
That's enough.

565
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:21,584
Forget it. Let's call it a day now.

566
00:27:21,744 --> 00:27:22,494
It'll be troublesome for us

567
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:23,694
if he dies right now.

568
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:24,551
Let's go.

569
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,054
The third brick.

570
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:36,334
Father once told me

571
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:37,384
that I could only use this

572
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:38,464
if my life was in danger.

573
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,610
I've finally found it

574
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:40,704
after so long.

575
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:44,494
I can finally

576
00:28:45,664 --> 00:28:46,774
avenge my parents now.

577
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:19,974
My biggest regret

578
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:21,664
is that I couldn't marry Xiange

579
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:23,294
in the end.

580
00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:45,664
Mr. Feng,

581
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:46,974
we meet again.

582
00:30:07,144 --> 00:30:08,424
Listen.

583
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:10,664
This is a matter of expedience.

584
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:12,144
We'll sleep in different beds

585
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:13,334
once he finishes his inspection.

586
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:16,944
You're unhappy?

587
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:18,734
I'm unhappy too.

588
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:24,814
Once everyone manages to leave Yongzhou safely,

589
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:26,944
I'll go to the surface and lure Suying away.

590
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:28,014
By then,

591
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,924
you can break the seal on the dragon horns.

592
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:31,534
Me?

593
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:34,384
Before this, some holes were drilled into the black rocks

594
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:35,734
when I entered your mind's eye.

595
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,664
You can try

596
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,574
to smash those rocks in the next few days.

597
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:40,864
It'll help you

598
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:41,864
increase your spiritual power.

599
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:43,144
I'll give it a try.

600
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:45,774
(Calm my heart, focus my mind, )

601
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,124
(and focus my consciousness on my dantian.)

602
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:50,968
(Yanhui's Mind's Eye)

603
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:03,184
How did it go?

604
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:05,534
How long did the foolish old man take

605
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:07,144
to move the mountains?

606
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,054
Over 60 years.

607
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:11,494
Did he succeed then?

608
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,734
He succeeded in moving Heaven.

609
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,774
And Heaven sent some deities to move the mountains away.

610
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:20,224
I guess you're the only person.

611
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,494
I can move here.

612
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:25,054
Can you help me to move the black rocks away then?

613
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:29,814
I could if it was in the past.

614
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,624
Then, how long did Jingwei, the mystical bird, take to fill up the sea?

615
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,144
I think

616
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:36,624
it's still doing it.

617
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:42,734
I can't survive that long.

618
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:47,384
All is not over yet.

619
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:48,734
Do not give up.

620
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,334
Do you have a way then?

621
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,574
What are you guys chatting about?

622
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:54,944
Time for an inspection!

623
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:02,704
You two are discussing your careers

624
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:04,144
instead of your relationship

625
00:33:04,294 --> 00:33:05,464
in the middle of the night.

626
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:07,494
You told me that you were going to sleep soon.

627
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:09,224
If so, why didn't you remove your earrings?

628
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:10,734
I will.

629
00:33:11,054 --> 00:33:11,624
I will.

630
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,334
I removed them.

631
00:33:13,944 --> 00:33:14,944
I removed them.

632
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:17,814
I removed them.

633
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:18,944
What exactly

634
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,235
do you want?

635
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,573
I want you guys to do something sensual!

636
00:33:25,574 --> 00:33:26,494
Didn't we follow

637
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,229
your instructions already?

638
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:29,502
We're sleeping in the same room, in the same bed,

639
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:31,944
and using the same blanket.

640
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:34,774
How dare you raise your volume?

641
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:36,664
Are you getting impatient?

642
00:33:36,774 --> 00:33:37,974
I'm going to cause a ruckus.

643
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:39,144
Wait!

644
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,904
What other requests do you have?

645
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:46,534
Actually,

646
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:48,624
I'm trying to repair your relationship here.

647
00:33:48,704 --> 00:33:50,294
I hope you two can resolve

648
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,384
the misunderstandings between you two,

649
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,664
bare your hearts to each other,

650
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:54,814
and

651
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:59,574
sleep under each other's warm embrace.

652
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:03,704
All right.

653
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:06,054
We'll do everything you say.

654
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:10,144
But you see, don't you think

655
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:11,894
it's inappropriate for the third wheel

656
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,104
to be here?

657
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:16,334
You have a point.

658
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,254
I'll give you guys some privacy.

659
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,814
I'll make a move then.

660
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:33,664
You can sleep now.

661
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:37,814
Be careful.

662
00:34:37,854 --> 00:34:38,504
Be careful.

663
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:39,704
Miss.

664
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:44,144
Miss, he's from the Feng family!

665
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:45,024
I know that.

666
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:46,144
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

667
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:47,184
Tend to his wounds.

668
00:34:47,894 --> 00:34:49,184
Take your time.

669
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,144
Let's go.

670
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:56,184
Here, eat up.

671
00:35:10,104 --> 00:35:11,374
You actually saved this many spirits?

672
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:13,064
You should say

673
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,373
that the Arena had kept

674
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:15,294
this many of them locked away.

675
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:21,414
Why are you helping the monsters?

676
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:25,504
Although I'm a human,

677
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,024
I was abandoned by my parents.

678
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,144
A spirit rescued me

679
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,254
and raised me.

680
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:31,504
I'm just trying

681
00:35:31,664 --> 00:35:33,144
to repay the favor here.

682
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,144
Even so,

683
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:35,774
you shouldn't trust monsters easily.

684
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,934
My parents were always kind

685
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,224
to their familiars.

686
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:39,894
However, they were bribed by Feng Ming.

687
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:41,504
It only took him 100 gold taels to bribe them.

688
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,104
And all the familiars betrayed their masters!

689
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:45,774
What did you say?

690
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:46,664
What's wrong with being a spirit?

691
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:48,854
Don't be scared.

692
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:53,664
Monsters will be monsters.

693
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:54,934
Humans will be humans too.

694
00:35:55,624 --> 00:35:57,334
Prejudice, stubbornness, hatred.

695
00:35:57,504 --> 00:35:59,414
Mr. Feng, what's the difference between the emotions you feel

696
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,144
and the emotions they feel?

697
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:03,184
What gives you the right

698
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:05,144
to think that humans experience a noble level of emotions

699
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:06,964
and your hatred

700
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:08,504
is justice?

701
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,670
You should stay and recuperate first.

702
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:20,504
He was too much.

703
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:22,414
Who does he think he is?

704
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:29,734
Yanhui.

705
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:34,894
Yanhui?

706
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,104
So, how long do you think I need to train

707
00:36:48,254 --> 00:36:49,774
with my aptitude?

708
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:52,414
I guess you're the only person

709
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:54,224
I can move here.

710
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,584
Can you help me to move the black rocks away then?

711
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:00,984
(If so, I think I'll train hard)

712
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:02,544
(and strive to return this stupid thing to you.)

713
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:28,934
Baozi.

714
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,544
Such huge baozi.

715
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:34,584
They're delicious.

716
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:42,414
Tianyao.

717
00:37:57,814 --> 00:37:58,984
The underground city

718
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:00,854
is stuffy and humid.

719
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:03,144
And we cannot see the sun here.

720
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:04,224
We don't even know

721
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:05,854
when to sleep or wake up.

722
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:41,334
I did manage to crush the black rocks yesterday!

723
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:42,374
Seems like

724
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:45,064
the seal might indeed be dispelled one day.

725
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:46,814
Tianyao, you were right.

726
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,774
We mustn't give up so easily.

727
00:38:52,104 --> 00:38:53,224
It's good that you have confidence.

728
00:38:56,254 --> 00:38:56,934
Time for an inspection!

729
00:38:57,374 --> 00:38:58,294
Yao,

730
00:38:58,454 --> 00:38:59,704
you look much suaver

731
00:38:59,894 --> 00:39:01,664
than yesterday.

732
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:03,934
That's more like it.

733
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:08,544
Have you guys

734
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:09,854
resolved the misunderstandings

735
00:39:10,024 --> 00:39:11,184
between you two last night?

736
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:12,906
We have.

737
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:14,584
Everything is as clear as day now.

738
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:16,704
Am I right, Yao?

739
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:19,454
Great.

740
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:21,854
That's great.

741
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:27,984
What's the matter?

742
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:29,144
Why are you staring at me?

743
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:30,294
Am I interrupting something?

744
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,934
Wait, am I interrupting you two from doing something here?

745
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,734
I'll make a move then.

746
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,224
Very good. Keep this up.

747
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:51,374
How long

748
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:52,894
do we have to keep this up?

749
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,414
We don't know his identity.

750
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:57,024
Do not get too close to him.

751
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,184
However,

752
00:39:58,544 --> 00:39:59,624
he did save us

753
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,854
from Suying.

754
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:06,024
I'm sure he has a hidden agenda for making that risky move.

755
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,030
It's just that we don't know

756
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:09,584
