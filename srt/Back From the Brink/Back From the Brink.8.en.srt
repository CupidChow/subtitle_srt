(Episode 8)
(Watch on www.kisskh.co)

3
00:01:42,337 --> 00:01:43,447
Just admit your defeat.

4
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,927
I'll never admit defeat.

5
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:07,086
Invincible Fiery Wheel!

6
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,977
Tianyao, face it head-on!

7
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:09,817
What?

8
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:20,537
Right now!

9
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:21,767
Jump!

10
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,727
Do a backflip!

11
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,417
We won!

12
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,257
Tianyao, we won!

13
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:00,887
End of the match!

14
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,256
Together with Self-Cultivator Yanhui

15
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:04,537
and her familiar, Lucky Carp, has won!

16
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:11,937
Not bad.

17
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:15,937
Tianyao,

18
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:17,497
how are you? Are you all right?

19
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:20,817
I'm fine.

20
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,047
I'm glad you're fine.

21
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,497
It's all thanks to me, right?

22
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:24,426
Yes.

23
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:26,137
If it weren't for you,

24
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:27,697
I wouldn't have suffered so many punches.

25
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,184
When a familiar is injured,

26
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,049
the owner feels the pain too.

27
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:31,396
I wasn't having a great time either.

28
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,269
Besides,

29
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,454
it's because you're not good at fighting.

30
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:35,046
You punch like you're scratching an itch.

31
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:35,996
If it were me,

32
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,701
I'd knock it down in three punches.

33
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:38,676
Three punches.

34
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:41,796
Help me up.

35
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:44,166
Tianyuan Tapir is useless now. Let's go.

36
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:02,206
The defeated familiar has been put to death.

37
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:04,956
How could this happen?

38
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:12,486
When a familiar

39
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:15,046
is abandoned by its master in the Arena,

40
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:17,156
death is the only outcome.

41
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,446
(Couple Trial) Congratulations to you both

42
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:30,716
for passing my trial.

43
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,516
Master, I failed you again.

44
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,356
Forgive me, Master.

45
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,686
My cultivation is too weak.

46
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:15,396
Useless.

47
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,516
Get lost.

48
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,086
Yes, Master.

49
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:30,821
(Wangyu Tower)

50
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,036
These two said they were going to probe around the Arena.

51
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,086
It's already dark

52
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,246
and they haven't come back.

53
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:39,086
Could something have happened to them?

54
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,476
Don't be too worried.

55
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,596
Miss Yan is lively,

56
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,126
and they're probably having fun.

57
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,086
So it's normal

58
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,326
to come back late.

59
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:48,916
Xiange.

60
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,036
Mr. Feng?

61
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,126
Are you all right?

62
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:54,156
Yes, I'm fine.

63
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,326
It seems Feng Ming didn't give you a hard time.

64
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:58,596
He didn't.

65
00:05:58,716 --> 00:05:59,886
But...

66
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:00,916
What's wrong?

67
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,276
Your two friends didn't enter

68
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,246
the honored guest area

69
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:04,396
for some reason.

70
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:05,916
Instead, they became participants in the fighting competition.

71
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:06,686
What?

72
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:07,886
Don't worry.

73
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,836
They've won

74
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:09,836
today's match

75
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:10,886
and are safe now.

76
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:11,821
But tomorrow,

77
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:12,691
they'll start

78
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:13,806
the next match immediately.

79
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:16,086
Yuli, come with me to rescue them.

80
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,646
I can help you.

81
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,086
No, thanks.

82
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:24,036
Feng Ming is already suspicious of you.

83
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:26,476
I don't want you to be in danger because of me.

84
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:27,916
I don't want you

85
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:29,246
to be in any danger either.

86
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,326
But one of them is a spirit.

87
00:06:34,886 --> 00:06:35,836
Would you still be willing to help?

88
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,276
Yes, I'm willing.

89
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:43,476
You don't have to force yourself

90
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:44,396
for my sake.

91
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,246
Yuli, see our guest off.

92
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:52,646
This way, please.

93
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:57,155
(Qijue Agency)

94
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:57,916
Sir,

95
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:58,596
Miss Xiange seems

96
00:06:58,716 --> 00:06:59,766
to have left Wangyu Tower

97
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,766
and is preparing to make her move.

98
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,716
I don't want Xiange to take any risks.

99
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:04,956
Before she takes action,

100
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,716
I'll try to buy those two

101
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,126
from Feng Ming.

102
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,956
But if I don't make it back today...

103
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:16,156
you must give this to Xiange.

104
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,806
After that, all matters of Qijue Agency

105
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,036
will be handed over to Xiange.

106
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:20,276
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:22,446
Sir,

108
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,206
take these ten golden beans.

109
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:25,806
Please make an exception for me.

110
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:27,126
Fine.

111
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,246
You only have one hour.

112
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:30,156
Be quick about it.

113
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,356
Thank you.

114
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:47,956
Tianyao,

115
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:49,916
I brought you medicine for external injuries.

116
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,326
Take it for now.

117
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:52,156
We can't fight

118
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:53,036
in the second match tomorrow.

119
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,156
I don't want to watch you die,

120
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,446
nor do I want to see other monsters die

121
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:01,686
because of us.

122
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:04,356
I'm getting you out of here.

123
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:10,036
Have you thought of a plan?

124
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:10,886
That's why I came here

125
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:11,916
to discuss it with you.

126
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:15,716
If I can use my magic,

127
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:16,766
this place won't be able to keep me in.

128
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:18,446
But as soon as I entered this place,

129
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:19,686
I lost my spiritual power.

130
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:20,916
Do you know what could be the reason?

131
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:23,956
After we were separated,

132
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,326
the person in charge

133
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:26,956
took away the spirit token

134
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,086
and still hasn't returned it to me.

135
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,476
Could it be related to the spirit token?

136
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,086
Where are they keeping the spirit token?

137
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,949
It is hung on a wooden pendant full of spiritual power

138
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,279
(that can collect spirit tokens)

139
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:38,686
(on its own.)

140
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,116
(It seems to have)

141
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,406
a swirling cloud pattern on it

142
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:42,756
and looks very expensive.

143
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,636
Universal Divine Tree.

144
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:48,206
What is that?

145
00:08:49,926 --> 00:08:50,926
One hundred years ago,

146
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,326
there was an immortal from the Taoist clan

147
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:53,116
who loved collecting familiars.

148
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:54,446
He collected so many of them

149
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:56,046
that he began to worry

150
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:57,356
that these familiars would unite and rebel against him.

151
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:58,326
He was so worried

152
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:00,046
that he couldn't sleep at night because of this.

153
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:01,956
So he found the Universal Divine Tree

154
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:02,836
that was compatible

155
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:04,356
with the spirit token contract

156
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,636
and borrowed the power of this mystical tree

157
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:06,876
to dissolve the spiritual power of the familiars

158
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:07,926
of the spirit token contract.

159
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:09,566
By doing this,

160
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:10,836
he could sleep soundly every night

161
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:12,236
without any worries.

162
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:14,526
So...

163
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:17,236
It's not a hopeless situation at the moment.

164
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:18,356
The Universal Divine Tree

165
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,286
only affects familiars under the pact

166
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,206
and has no restrictions over their masters.

167
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:23,566
As long as you take my spirit token off

168
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:24,806
the divine wood pendant,

169
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:25,956
I can regain my spiritual power.

170
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:26,876
Then,

171
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:27,956
we can figure out

172
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:29,356
how to break out of this dungeon.

173
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:31,636
Is it that simple?

174
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,236
Yes, it's that simple.

175
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:35,236
Then...

176
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:37,956
why are they still here?

177
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:40,756
Our masters

178
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,446
are only here for profit.

179
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:44,206
After they won the match,

180
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,876
they'd sell us to the Arena.

181
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,716
They have no intention of saving us.

182
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:53,476
I'm heading there now.

183
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,636
Stay here

184
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:55,686
and wait for my return.

185
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,476
Be careful.

186
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:09,636
If all humans and spirits

187
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:11,756
could get along like you and her,

188
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,236
that would be great.

189
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,956
(The circular holes)

190
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,476
(on the ground here)

191
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,356
(look exactly)

192
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,086
(like the Starpoint Formation triggered)

193
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,046
(on the gate that night, )

194
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,166
(which I should avoid.)

195
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:49,476
Thief!

196
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:50,996
What's wrong with you?

197
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,086
You scared me.

198
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:55,476
You want to take that spirit token, right?

199
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,806
I'll help you take it

200
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:58,596
since you have short limbs.

201
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:00,446
Come on!

202
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:08,716
Everything seems fine here.

203
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:09,756
There's nothing strange here.

204
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:10,756
That's odd.

205
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:12,716
I was sure I heard noises from here just now.

206
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,206
Senior,

207
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,756
I think you're too nervous.

208
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,446
The Starpoint Formation has already been set up here.

209
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:18,876
Even if a fly comes in,

210
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:19,926
it wouldn't dare to land.

211
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,206
Besides,

212
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:22,326
it's very late now.

213
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:22,756
We should go back

214
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:23,876
and rest early.

215
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,206
Master Suying ordered us

216
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:26,406
to patrol this area.

217
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:27,596
So we must not slack off.

218
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:28,596
Let's go

219
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,116
and check the lower level.

220
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:31,166
All right.

221
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:42,476
They're gone.

222
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,596
We're safe now.

223
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:44,636
You have the cheek to say that.

224
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,806
It was your fault.

225
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,206
If you weren't clumsy,

226
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:48,526
it wouldn't have drawn them here.

227
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:49,996
Let's put that aside for now.

228
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:52,326
I'm here to help you.

229
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,446
Help me?

230
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:54,876
Just last night,

231
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:55,836
you wanted to kill me.

232
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:57,636
How many times have you changed your stories in several days?

233
00:12:57,756 --> 00:12:59,166
You're so quick to change your mind.

234
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:01,446
It was all a misunderstanding.

235
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:02,596
Right now,

236
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,876
I only want you to rescue your familiar.

237
00:13:05,046 --> 00:13:05,686
What

238
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,596
are your ulterior motives?

239
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,406
Of course I have ulterior motives.

240
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:10,926
But getting that token

241
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,636
is your top priority now, isn't it?

242
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:14,446
Cut the crap

243
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:14,926
and get it.

244
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:15,406
All right.

245
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:46,636
Help me out.

246
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,206
I got it.

247
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,086
Now, go and save your familiar.

248
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:29,956
Thank you.

249
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:35,446
Tianyao.

250
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,476
What is he doing here?

251
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:41,356
I asked him.

252
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:42,635
He does have ulterior motives toward us.

253
00:14:42,636 --> 00:14:43,206
But he can get us

254
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:44,086
out of here today.

255
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:45,566
And you believed him?

256
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:47,046
You...

257
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:48,996
Hey, wait.

258
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,806
Please don't quarrel

259
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:53,356
because of me.

260
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:56,806
I'll just be honest.

261
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:58,116
For the past few years,

262
00:14:58,236 --> 00:14:59,236
I've been searching

263
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:00,686
for a pair of Taoist-spirit lovers

264
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:02,286
who are deeply in love with each other.

265
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:03,996
My previous mischief toward you

266
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,566
was to test

267
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:06,876
your affection toward each other.

268
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:07,876
So I apologize

269
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:09,756
for that.

270
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:11,356
But

271
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:12,636
now I know

272
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:15,356
that you two are truly devoted to each other

273
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:16,926
through thick and thin.

274
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,806
If we look at your appearances,

275
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:20,806
they're truly among the best in this world.

276
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,166
How compatible.

277
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:27,396
(Couple Trial)

278
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,086
You're pretty thorough.

279
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:31,356
Take a look at this.

280
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:32,393
The first two criteria.

281
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:33,658
(Beauty, Virtue) are easy to meet.

282
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:34,326
But

283
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:35,996
where do you two stand out?

284
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,206
You two stand out

285
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:39,956
in your extreme loyalty

286
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:40,996
and trust toward each other.

287
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:44,526
Tell me.

288
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,086
Why do you want to look for Taoist-spirit lovers?

289
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,122
Because I have one thing

290
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:54,686
that only a pair of Taoist-spirit lovers

291
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:55,526
who are deeply in love

292
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:56,926
can help me complete it.

293
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:00,926
I won't help you with that.

294
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:03,046
I have my own things to do.

295
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:07,336
All right.

296
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,256
I'll leave then.

297
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:10,616
Don't stop me.

298
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:11,336
Come on. Just wait.

299
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:11,686
Don't stop me.

300
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:12,216
Don't...

301
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:14,576
Don't reject him so soon.

302
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:15,766
We can always discuss it.

303
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,286
If you want us to help you,

304
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:18,856
shouldn't you

305
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:19,856
get us out of here first?

306
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:22,376
I can get you out.

307
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:24,766
But

308
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,406
he must get back what belongs to him.

309
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:32,136
You do know his identity,

310
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:32,766
don't you?

311
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,166
He's weak

312
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,286
without that thing.

313
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:36,686
Even if you get us out,

314
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,136
we'll be too weak.

315
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:39,376
Not only we can't help you,

316
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:40,806
but we also might even ruin things for you.

317
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:41,406
So,

318
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:42,646
can we help him

319
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:43,526
retrieve what he needs first?

320
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,533
You have a point.

321
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:47,806
I'll help you.

322
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:51,976
Why?

323
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:53,806
You don't want my help?

324
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,136
Do you know

325
00:16:56,286 --> 00:16:57,286
who helped you take this?

326
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:57,766
He...

327
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:58,926
He took it.

328
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:07,926
The thing I need

329
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:09,966
is at Arena's lowest level.

330
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:11,296
To go down,

331
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:12,056
we must use

332
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,096
the wooden mechanism outside.

333
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,536
And now,

334
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:16,166
there are many disciples of the Guanghan Sect outside.

335
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:18,376
It won't be easy to deal with them.

336
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:22,686
What are you afraid of?

337
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:28,016
You have me.

338
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,136
(Only by getting the dragon horns)

339
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,336
(can I save them.)

340
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,376
Help!

341
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,336
Who are you?

342
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,206
I hit someone.

343
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,016
Wait right there!

344
00:18:00,616 --> 00:18:01,246
Come.

345
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:03,406
There are so many of them.

346
00:18:03,576 --> 00:18:04,816
You don't need to bring so many.

347
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:05,616
Stop right there!

348
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:06,646
Hold it right there!

349
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:07,246
Stop!

350
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:08,056
After him!

351
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,016
Get him!

352
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:09,576
After him!

353
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:12,296
This monster is pretty smart.

354
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:13,376
If I could,

355
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,336
I'd like to make him

356
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,336
draw a pact of servitude with me.

357
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,296
We don't know his origin.

358
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:18,296
Don't trust him.

359
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:20,966
All right. Let's get out of here now.

360
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:50,886
Come on.

361
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,721
(Arena, Level 18)

362
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:12,646
The entrance to Level 18 is blocked.

363
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,336
My dragon horns

364
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:22,856
are inside.

365
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:34,471
(Tianxiang Workshop)

366
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:41,206
My dear nephew, what urgent matter

367
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,166
brings you here at this late hour?

368
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:44,816
Uncle,

369
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:48,886
I can't forget

370
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:50,536
the woman named Yanhui

371
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:52,576
that I saw today.

372
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,166
I think of her all the time.

373
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:55,016
So,

374
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:56,686
I could only come to bother you.

375
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:00,296
Uncle.

376
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:00,686
Ridiculous.

377
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:01,376
Don't reject me

378
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:02,616
just yet.

379
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:04,686
This Arena is a place

380
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:06,486
for making profits after all.

381
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:09,166
Why not sell that woman

382
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:10,296
and her familiar to me?

383
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,646
You want the familiar too?

384
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,246
Lucky Carp is adorable.

385
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:16,966
Adorable?

386
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:18,726
All monsters in the world

387
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:19,885
are despicable

388
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:20,926
and hateful criminals.

389
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,096
Qianshuo,

390
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:24,856
don't forget

391
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:27,056
how your parents

392
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,446
and my wife and children

393
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:29,686
were cruelly killed

394
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,136
by monsters.

395
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,056
When you turned 20,

396
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,055
I gave you this painting...

397
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:40,726
(Parental Love)

398
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:42,966
as a reminder of this vengeance.

399
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:44,096
So you can join me

400
00:20:44,296 --> 00:20:45,726
and kill all the monsters in the world.

401
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,296
It has only been a few years,

402
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:50,136
but you have become so ridiculous.

403
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,886
Are you certain

404
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,446
my parents were killed by the familiars?

405
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,376
My dear nephew,

406
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:05,406
what do you mean by that?

407
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,486
I may be a child

408
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,406
when my parents passed away.

409
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:14,776
But I still remember

410
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,445
that my father was in charge

411
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:17,576
of the Feng family.

412
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:19,776
After your wife and children's mishap,

413
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,136
you've repeatedly suggested building a place

414
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,776
to retaliate against monsters.

415
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:24,816
But my father refused.

416
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:26,926
It wasn't until he died

417
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,446
that you took over the Feng family

418
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,776
and used several generations of the Feng family's wealth

419
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,336
to build this Arena.

420
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:37,616
If I wanted to pursue this,

421
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:38,686
shouldn't I be the one

422
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:40,336
who inherits the Feng family's property?

423
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:43,166
Why do I have

424
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,966
to grovel and beg you

425
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,336
just for one familiar?

426
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:09,776
What are you doing?

427
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:12,016
Since there's

428
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:13,136
a commotion upstairs,

429
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,166
who cares if there's a Starpoint Formation?

430
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,926
After I break this door

431
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:18,576
and retrieve your horns,

432
00:22:18,646 --> 00:22:19,206
we'll get out of here.

433
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:23,246
Break?

434
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,296
How are you going to break it?

435
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,646
With my strong fists.

436
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:35,926
What kind of look are you giving me?

437
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:37,886
Listen here.

438
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,016
I've already reached

439
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,486
the peak of my martial arts skills.

440
00:22:40,646 --> 00:22:41,446
Breaking through this wall

441
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:42,336
is not a problem.

442
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:43,576
Move aside.

443
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:45,096
Or you might get splattered with blood.

444
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:48,246
Wait.

445
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:52,816
It's Heaven-Repairing Stone.

446
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:53,926
If you could break it with your fist,

447
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:55,886
the whole sky would have collapsed.

448
00:22:58,206 --> 00:22:59,816
Heaven-Repairing Stone?

449
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:02,486
This arena went to great lengths

450
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,096
to obtain the Heaven-Repairing Stone

451
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:05,886
for the sake of constructing this mystical formation.

452
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,376
If we take a bit of it back,

453
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:09,646
we can sell it for a lot of money.

454
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,536
Watch out!

455
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,096
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

456
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,376
I didn't know he had hidden the formation

457
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,576
within the door.

458
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:36,206
He actually set a formation

459
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:37,336
within the Heaven-Repairing Stone.

460
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:38,166
It was a very sneaky move.

461
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:42,616
There are more traps!

462
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,055
Wind dissolves ice, Heavenly Fire illuminates the cavern.

463
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:03,486
Obey!

464
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:06,966
Get inside the barrier now.

465
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,686
Can't you make it bigger?

466
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:11,816
With my current dragon bone power,

467
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:13,136
I can't break this formation.

468
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:15,886
I need you

469
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,406
to use the power of your mind's eye

470
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:18,446
to melt it.

471
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:20,726
You want me to learn it now?

472
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,206
Recall the feeling

473
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:23,486
of using your mind's eye

474
00:24:23,686 --> 00:24:25,016
to defeat Shebishi last time.

475
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:32,486
Remember my hand seal.

476
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:36,776
With my dragon's knowledge...

477
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,536
With my dragon's knowledge...

478
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:39,536
With my breath...

479
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,616
With my breath...

480
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,096
With my undying body...

481
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:45,375
With my undying body...

482
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:46,446
And with the never-ending wildfire...

483
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:48,576
And with the never-ending wildfire...

484
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,096
Attack!

485
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:51,406
Attack!

486
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:04,886
I have also been practicing

487
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:06,296
a little on my own.

488
00:25:06,446 --> 00:25:08,336
It's true that I have some spiritual power.

489
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:09,446
But

490
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,289
I can only use so much.

491
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:12,536
Why don't we

492
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:14,296
think of another way?

493
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,136
After all these years,

494
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:24,406
are you trying to accuse me

495
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,686
of fratricide?

496
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:32,376
Of course not, Uncle.

497
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:33,856
I won't fight you

498
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:35,686
over the inheritance.

499
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,376
I just want the familiar.

500
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,776
Why make things difficult for me?

501
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,816
What exactly is the background

502
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,926
of the master and familiar

503
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,856
that you're so desperate to own them?

504
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,486
Uncle, just tell me if you're selling or not.

505
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:14,446
If you really want them,

506
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,616
I can make an exception.

507
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:19,206
But you'll have to trade them with Qijue Agency.

508
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:22,856
Uncle, you must be joking.

509
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,726
What does Qijue Agency have to do with me?

510
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:28,166
At this point,

511
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,646
there's no need to hide from me anymore.

512
00:26:30,406 --> 00:26:31,486
My dear nephew,

513
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:35,576
there are no secrets in this world.

514
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:40,016
I must unlock your mind's eye

515
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,536
to activate more Heart Protecting Scale's power.

516
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:43,096
If you're worried...

517
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:45,056
It's fine. Stop wasting time and do it now.

518
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,246
Can you feel it now?

519
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:31,966
It seems

520
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:33,536
to have opened.

521
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:35,856
There is a small pond

522
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,926
in my mind's eye.

523
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:45,446
Let's make do with that.

524
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:47,056
Follow my breathing

525
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:48,776
and feel the surge of spiritual power in your body.

526
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,376
Harness your energy.

527
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,136
Form the seal.

528
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,336
With my dragon's knowledge...

529
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:05,206
With my dragon's knowledge...

530
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,376
-with my breath, -with my breath,

531
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,886
-with my undying body, -with my undying body,

532
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:12,206
and with the never-ending wildfire.

533
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:13,726
And with the never-ending wildfire.

534
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:14,446
Attack!

535
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,576
Attack!

536
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:44,646
(The power of dragon fire.)

537
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:52,646
Let us out!

538
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,776
Let us out!

539
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:55,446
Let us out!

540
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,486
Uncle, the place is collapsing.

541
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:31,966
No.

542
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:34,536
I should leave now.

543
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:41,776
Mother, look.

544
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:43,406
It's raining monsters.

545
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:00,136
Miss,

546
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,856
it seems that someone has beaten us to it.

547
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,056
Don't wait here.

548
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:04,886
Take advantage of the chaos,

549
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:05,726
bring Twelve Young Misters,

550
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:06,646
and rescue these monsters

551
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:07,446
back to the underground palace.

552
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:08,246
Yes.

553
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:16,136
Mr. Feng?

554
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:18,016
-Mr. Feng! -Mr. Feng!

555
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,166
What are you doing here?

556
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:20,816
I've been looking for you everywhere.

557
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:21,726
Hurry back

558
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:22,336
before anyone notices you.

559
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:23,536
Feng Ming has close ties

560
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:24,406
with the Guanghan Sect.

561
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,296
The Arena was blown up,

562
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:26,376
they will investigate and pursue this matter to the end.

563
00:30:26,486 --> 00:30:27,376
I don't want you to be implicated.

564
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:28,096
I won't go back.

565
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:29,486
I won't sit by and watch them die.

566
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:31,406
These are just a group of monsters.

567
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:32,096
If you

568
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:32,926
get involved now,

569
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:33,686
the Guanghan Sect will surely...

570
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:34,246
That's enough.

571
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:35,576
We don't have time to argue.

572
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,296
Yuli, send him

573
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:37,296
back to Qijue Agency.

574
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:38,336
Then we'll take action immediately.

575
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:38,966
Yes.

576
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:40,816
You...

577
00:30:59,016 --> 00:30:59,926
Yanhui.

578
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:02,376
Yanhui.

579
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:05,816
Yanhui!

580
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:12,446
Yanhui.

581
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:14,686
Get up now.

582
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:19,376
Are you all right?

583
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:21,966
I'm all right.

584
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:25,336
I didn't know.

585
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:27,296
I would be that powerful.

586
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:28,686
I also didn't expect

587
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,336
the small pond of your mind's eye

588
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:31,856
could produce such power.

589
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:34,206
It turns out that using the mind's eye spiritual energy

590
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,496
is so exhausting.

591
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,376
I feel a little dizzy now.

592
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:45,016
Are those

593
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:47,536
the dragon horns?

594
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:05,176
What is this?

595
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:07,536
Suying?

596
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:19,856
This is...

597
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:22,086
it's Suying's primordial spirit.

598
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:25,216
Let's get out of here.

599
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,256
The evil dragon, Tianyao.

600
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,256
You're finally here.

601
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:37,216
Suying's cultivation technique

602
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:39,416
has become so powerful.

603
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,336
I never thought you would walk right into my trap.

604
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,006
Hand over the Heart Protecting Scale.

605
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:26,366
Bai Xiaosheng, are you all right?

606
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,056
I'm glad both of you are still alive.

607
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,006
We must go now.

608
00:33:29,646 --> 00:33:30,576
Yanhui.

609
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:32,606
-Yanhui. -Xiange?

610
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:33,936
Xiange, what are you doing here?

611
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:35,136
I heard you took part in the beast gladiatorial game.

612
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:36,006
I was worried something might happen to you.

613
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:36,806
Come with me now.

614
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:37,496
Let's go.

615
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:39,296
Come on.

616
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:48,886
Master.

617
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,166
Master.

618
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,416
Immortal,

619
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:54,926
where's Master Suying?

620
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,326
She's cultivating.

621
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:57,416
No one should disturb her.

622
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:00,726
I'm glad she's fine.

623
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:02,856
A mere spell like this

624
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,256
can never hurt Master Suying.

625
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,886
But your arena

626
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:08,296
actually let the evil dragon enter

627
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,446
without anyone's notice.

628
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:10,656
Forgive me.

629
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:11,856
The Arena

630
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:13,376
has always been heavily guarded.

631
00:34:13,576 --> 00:34:15,376
Such a mistake would never happen.

632
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:17,096
The evil dragon that blew up the Arena

633
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:18,256
and managed to infiltrate the Arena

634
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,096
must have

635
00:34:19,926 --> 00:34:21,206
something to do with my nephew,

636
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:22,576
Feng Qianshuo.

637
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:23,656
Feng Qianshuo?

638
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:25,166
Yes, it's him.

639
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:26,376
He repeatedly asked me

640
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:28,376
for the master and the familiar.

641
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:30,096
He even deliberately lured me away today.

642
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:31,166
I originally thought

643
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,376
he wanted a plaything.

644
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:35,976
I didn't expect him to collude with those spirits.

645
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:36,766
It's unforgivable.

646
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:37,446
I warned you

647
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:38,536
to be careful of this person.

648
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:40,256
But you were still so careless.

649
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:42,296
Immortal, please forgive me.

650
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,606
Now,

651
00:34:43,766 --> 00:34:46,326
we can find out the whereabouts of the evil dragon

652
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:47,885
if we can catch Feng Qianshuo.

653
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:48,576
However,

654
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,206
he has been growing his power behind my back

655
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:52,136
over the years.

656
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:53,856
With my power alone,

657
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:54,886
I'm afraid...

658
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,766
You've failed so many times.

659
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:57,886
And you still have the nerve to find excuses.

660
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:00,606
Forget it.

661
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:01,926
I'll send the disciples

662
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:02,726
to assist you.

663
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:05,416
I won't let you down this time.

664
00:35:05,976 --> 00:35:06,886
I'll take my leave now.

665
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:19,886
Congratulations, ma'am.

666
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:20,656
The elixir

667
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:21,696
that will restore Mr. Lu's memory

668
00:35:21,856 --> 00:35:22,856
has finally been refined.

669
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,696
The evil dragon infiltrated this place.

670
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:45,326
Yet, the Guanghan Sect's disciples stationed here

671
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:47,096
were completely unaware.

672
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:50,456
Today, all disciples who were guarding the place today

673
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,776
will have one of their Immortal Stars stripped away

674
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,486
and tell them to cultivate all over again.

675
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:54,566
Yes, ma'am.

676
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:57,366
This evil dragon achieves such power

677
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,336
by just retrieving the dragon's bones.

678
00:35:59,856 --> 00:36:00,656
There was also

679
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,096
a man and a woman with him.

680
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:03,126
Go and find out.

681
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:05,016
I want to know who they are.

682
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:05,856
Yes, ma'am.

683
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,096
-What is this? -What's that?

684
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:45,646
Ma'am, you trapped the entire city of Yongzhou

685
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,376
with the power of the Dragon Horn Formation.

686
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:50,166
Starting today, I want all of you

687
00:36:50,296 --> 00:36:51,736
to search every house in the entire city of Yongzhou

688
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,006
to find the evil dragon.

689
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:05,376
(I want them to have no place to hide.)
