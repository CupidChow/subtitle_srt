(Episode 13)
(Watch on www.kisskh.co)

3
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,028
Seriously?

4
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:53,817
I only knocked his head

5
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:54,708
very gently.

6
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,458
You don't even

7
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,338
take such good care of Tianyao.

8
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,308
This is my eldest senior.

9
00:01:58,538 --> 00:01:59,378
He took care of me the most

10
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:01,068
when I was in Chenxing Mountain.

11
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:03,508
You beat him up after a disagreement.

12
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:04,588
Don't you think you're too hot-tempered?

13
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:06,148
I'm hot-tempered?

14
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:08,988
Fine.

15
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:10,148
I was hot-tempered.

16
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,738
I'll control myself in the future.

17
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:12,898
I'll apologize to you, okay?

18
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:13,938
However,

19
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:15,738
if Tianyao gets injured in the future,

20
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:16,498
you have to

21
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:17,707
take better care of him,

22
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:18,338
did you hear me?

23
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,427
Why did you bring him up?

24
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:21,828
Of course I have to.

25
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,308
Tianyao is the one for you.

26
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:25,148
Yanhui,

27
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:26,588
this is a warning.

28
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:28,427
If you dare

29
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:31,178
two-time him,

30
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,308
I'll never let you off.

31
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:35,778
You must be sick in the head, huh?

32
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:36,778
Go away.

33
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:38,178
Stop nagging.

34
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:39,268
You annoy me.

35
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:41,738
Leave.

36
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,618
Fine.

37
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:48,028
Conduct yourself.

38
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,218
Don't try anything indecent!

39
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:50,658
-Go away! -Fine.

40
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:54,548
You're so fierce to me and Tianyao usually.

41
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:56,657
But why are you treating

42
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:58,148
your eldest senior so gently?

43
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:00,827
Indeed. The one who dedicates himself to the relationship

44
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,708
will have to endure more grievances.

45
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,116
That's how women are.

46
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:05,874
Scram!

47
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:07,108
Scram? How?

48
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,458
Like this?

49
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,108
Or is it like this?

50
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:10,588
I...

51
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:12,910
-Scram! -Fine! I'll scram!

52
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:13,738
Shut the door!

53
00:03:13,738 --> 00:03:14,388
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,828
Senior, you're awake?

55
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,738
Are you okay? Does your head still hurt?

56
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,388
You...

57
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:30,658
Why did you

58
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,827
have to mingle

59
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:32,708
with all those monsters?

60
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:33,828
I got it.

61
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,178
I've already taught him a lesson.

62
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:35,778
But I won't return

63
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:36,778
to Chenxing Mountain.

64
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,308
Staying by my side

65
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:39,828
isn't a wise choice.

66
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:40,708
No.

67
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,148
I have to bring you back.

68
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:43,548
I won't go back.

69
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,108
This is Master's order.

70
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,457
Master was the one

71
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,738
who kicked me out of the sect.

72
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:49,778
I'm no longer

73
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:50,938
a disciple of Chenxing Mountain.

74
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:52,658
And he's no longer my master.

75
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,218
So why should I obey his order?

76
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:55,338
Yanhui,

77
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,737
don't hold it against Master.

78
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:57,827
I'm sure he chased you out

79
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,178
for a reason.

80
00:03:59,268 --> 00:03:59,588
How about this?

81
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,827
You can return with me first.

82
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:01,498
Don't worry.

83
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,458
This time, I'm here.

84
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,657
It won't end up the same.

85
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:04,588
Eldest Senior,

86
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:05,778
don't try to persuade me.

87
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,708
I won't head back.

88
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,618
And I have other affairs

89
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:08,388
to attend to.

90
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,028
What affairs?

91
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,058
(If I tell Eldest Senior)

92
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,547
(that I'm helping Tianyao)

93
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,548
(to regain his body, )

94
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,708
(he will definitely hinder us.)

95
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:17,898
(Maybe he'll even)

96
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,508
(tell Lingxiao about this.)

97
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:20,628
(No.)

98
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,388
(I cannot tell him the truth.)

99
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,218
I'm going to seek treatment.

100
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,418
What?

101
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:30,388
You!

102
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:36,098
You...

103
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:41,538
You...

104
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:44,948
What are you diagnosed with?

105
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:45,748
Since you're sick,

106
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:47,027
you should return to Chenxing Mountain with me

107
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:48,538
so that Master can treat you.

108
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:49,508
Chenxing Mountain

109
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,148
cannot cure my disease.

110
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:52,218
Chenxing Mountain can cure all kinds of diseases.

111
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:53,297
(So, they're only making)

112
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:53,828
(small talks.)

113
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:54,418
Do you think...

114
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:54,658
(It's nothing major.)

115
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:55,628
Do you think outsiders can cure you then?

116
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,148
(These two...)

117
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:56,538
Hurry and return with me.

118
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:57,028
(should be fine.)

119
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,298
I won't return with you.

120
00:04:58,538 --> 00:04:59,588
If you won't return with me,

121
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,098
I'll bring you back by force.

122
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,067
I'm not going back!

123
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,587
I made a promise to someone.

124
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:05,947
I have to keep my promise.

125
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,267
You have to keep your promise?

126
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:07,948
I have to keep my promise

127
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,067
to Master too.

128
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:09,708
Come with me!

129
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:11,827
Senior, I'm not going back!

130
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,097
Stop treating me like a child!

131
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:14,028
Right now,

132
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,147
I am emotionally unstable!

133
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,187
Once you return to Chenxing Mountain,

134
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:17,297
you won't be emotionally unstable.

135
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,027
I'm really emotionally unstable!

136
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:19,898
Just leave me alone!

137
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:20,858
I can take care of myself!

138
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:21,947
Yanhui, this is a warning!

139
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:22,898
You have to come with me

140
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:23,658
no matter if you like it or not!

141
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,978
I'm not going back!

142
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:26,298
I'm not going back!

143
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:27,588
-Come with me! -Let me go!

144
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,268
Not again.

145
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:33,747
I'm sorry, Eldest Senior.

146
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,508
I couldn't take it anymore.

147
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:36,828
You can take a nap for now.

148
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,898
(I wonder how Tianyao is doing.)

149
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:21,778
(Isn't it dangerous for him to retrieve the sword himself?)

150
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:43,778
(Forget it.)

151
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:45,948
(He's just retrieving a sword from his house.)

152
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:50,708
To me, your life

153
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,338
is different

154
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:53,588
from anyone else's.

155
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:56,338
(Yanhui, )

156
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:57,978
(you're very unique to me.)

157
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:10,218
Let's go.

158
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,268
I'll take you home.

159
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:15,538
(No.)

160
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:16,858
(I have to think of something.)

161
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:56,028
She sure is willing to sacrifice a lot

162
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:57,628
just to sleep.

163
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:18,218
Yanhui?

164
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:18,898
Tianyao.

165
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:19,858
It's me.

166
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:21,218
She just fell asleep.

167
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,418
Let's keep this short.

168
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,978
There is absolutely something going on

169
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,978
between her and her eldest senior.

170
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,777
Her eldest senior is bent on

171
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:31,068
bringing her back to Chenxing Mountain.

172
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,058
I think

173
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:33,898
they're childhood sweethearts

174
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,108
or something of the sort.

175
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:39,148
Well...

176
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,147
Why don't I get rid of her eldest senior

177
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:42,898
for you?

178
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,898
Don't do unnecessary things.

179
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:45,388
She may look indifferent to Mount Chenxing,

180
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,107
but she actually cares about the sect

181
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,058
and sect members.

182
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:49,868
If you dare do anything silly,

183
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,178
I won't forgive you.

184
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:55,577
So, compared to your jealousy,

185
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:56,988
you're more worried about

186
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,658
the things she cares about,

187
00:08:58,938 --> 00:08:59,818
right?

188
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:02,868
There's no jealousy.

189
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:04,228
Take good care of her.

190
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,018
Don't let anyone take her away.

191
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:06,938
Don't worry.

192
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,578
I'll keep a close eye on her

193
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,788
when you're not around.

194
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,547
I will definitely not let them

195
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:13,667
spend time

196
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,218
alone.

197
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:17,578
But you?

198
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:18,618
Once you're done...

199
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:19,938
Tianyao?

200
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,028
Tianyao?

201
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:22,218
Tianyao?

202
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:29,218
He's jealous.

203
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:08,978
(Why can't I)

204
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,188
(pull out the Flaming Dragon Fang?)

205
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:15,858
The Dragon King's Flaming Dragon Fang

206
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:17,508
is finally completed.

207
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,697
His Majesty is asleep?

208
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,787
His Majesty doesn't care about

209
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:21,977
what concerns him at all.

210
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,387
He actually fell asleep

211
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:24,938
right after his first sword was forged.

212
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:27,098
That's His Majesty for you.

213
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:28,618
Why don't we get him a gift

214
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,338
while he's still asleep?

215
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:32,308
-Okay. -Sure.

216
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:06,148
What are you guys doing?

217
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:07,858
Your Majesty,

218
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:08,388
we're sending you

219
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,908
a gift.

220
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,388
Your Majesty, you protect the valley

221
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:17,458
and its people.

222
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,787
I also hope that this sword

223
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:20,097
can protect you

224
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:21,268
during crucial moments.

225
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,307
Your Majesty, your sword is completed.

226
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,697
I hope you can train harder

227
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:26,428
in the future.

228
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:28,097
Your Majesty, I hope you can become

229
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,098
the strongest dragon in the world.

230
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:31,268
You fool.

231
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,217
His Majesty is the only dragon in the world.

232
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:34,548
That makes him the strongest dragon.

233
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:41,268
They poured all of their spiritual power

234
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:44,508
into it.

235
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,098
That's right.

236
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:47,738
It's their blessing.

237
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,618
That should be the case

238
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:51,028
for your first sword.

239
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,428
From now on,

240
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:54,858
only a pure person like you

241
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,388
with the intention

242
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,428
of protecting others

243
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:00,188
can wield it.

244
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:35,788
(However, this blessing)

245
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:37,938
(is a curse too.)

246
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:41,308
(In the future, )

247
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:42,668
you mustn't turn the blessing

248
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,268
into a burden.

249
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,028
So this is my curse.

250
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,578
My heart

251
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,578
is no longer pure.

252
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,737
(Wuqi Hall)

253
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:41,578
Yanhui

254
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,268
has become violent.

255
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,028
I can't just let her keep this up.

256
00:15:45,218 --> 00:15:46,548
If she dared knock me unconscious today,

257
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:47,458
tomorrow...

258
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,338
Doesn't that mean she'll knock Master unconscious tomorrow?

259
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:54,428
No.

260
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,338
I must bring her back.

261
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,697
I can't just let you

262
00:16:09,698 --> 00:16:11,098
stay by her side.

263
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:14,388
The disciple of Chenxing Mountain with seven stars,

264
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:15,788
I won't kill you.

265
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:17,618
What?

266
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,507
But I heard that it's easy for people

267
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:22,068
to get lost in the forest in the west.

268
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,148
-You should go there... -What are you doing?

269
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:27,458
and get lost for now.

270
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:29,098
Yanhui!

271
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:30,978
Senior?

272
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,098
Yanhui!

273
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:34,068
Senior!

274
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,068
Bai! Put him down now!

275
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:48,458
Senior!

276
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,895
Bai Xiaosheng! Show yourself!

277
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:53,148
Here I am.

278
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:54,098
You're sick in the head!

279
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,188
Release him immediately!

280
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:58,908
That's right!

281
00:16:59,028 --> 00:16:59,548
Senior said

282
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:00,788
you're a total scoundrel!

283
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:04,658
Senior,

284
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:05,698
I didn't do it.

285
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:06,987
Why would I be in cahoots with him?

286
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,618
We're unrelated.

287
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:14,378
That's right.

288
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,418
Release him immediately!

289
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:20,308
You and your senior

290
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,027
have such perfect chemistry.

291
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:23,578
That's why I cannot release him.

292
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:26,177
After all, I just wanted to tie him up

293
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,707
and release him into the forest.

294
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,028
The forest isn't dangerous at all.

295
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:29,988
You...

296
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:34,618
It does look

297
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:35,857
a little dangerous, huh?

298
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:36,897
Why are you still standing there? Go and save him!

299
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:37,618
Wait.

300
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:40,308
It might be dangerous inside.

301
00:17:40,468 --> 00:17:41,228
You shouldn't...

302
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:45,386
I have no time for this.

303
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,978
(Misty Forest)

304
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:57,818
Eldest Senior?

305
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,818
Bai Xiaosheng?

306
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,508
Eldest Senior!

307
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,818
Bai Xiaosheng!

308
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:16,578
Bai Xiaosheng!

309
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:19,898
Eldest Senior!

310
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,748
Where are you guys?

311
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,338
Give me some responses!

312
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:29,748
This tree...

313
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:31,418
It looks so strange.

314
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:38,898
Where's my wrist strap?

315
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,947
Zixiao Clan?

316
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:23,353
(The past resentment, gushing out from the blood. Souls wandering for tens of li, out for blood.)

317
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:29,803
(From Zitai to the desert, ) Tiandao Clan?

318
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:30,748
(a lonely grave faces the sunset) Tiandao Clan?

319
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:34,227
(Unparalleled in sword techniques and might)

320
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,028
This...

321
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,898
So many tombs.

322
00:19:38,068 --> 00:19:39,618
(No regrets. Diyi Clan, Monk of Pity) Who are they?

323
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:44,338
Monk of Pity?

324
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:07,418
This forest is something else.

325
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:09,898
Yanhui is pretty reckless.

326
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,267
I hope she won't

327
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:12,028
lose her life here

328
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,578
and ruin my plan.

329
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:20,658
Sheng.

330
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:23,578
Sheng?

331
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:26,068
Sheng.

332
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,618
Sheng.

333
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:40,548
You're a storyteller indeed.

334
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,138
After so many years of doing this,

335
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,657
your epitaph

336
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:44,898
has the most words on it.

337
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:48,508
I guess you weren't done with your storytelling before you died.

338
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,378
This is so tiring.

339
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,068
Miss.

340
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:05,178
Excuse me.

341
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,378
(Phantom spirit, Huan Xiaoyan) A living human?

342
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:08,788
You're a living human!

343
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:13,237
What are you doing?

344
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:15,378
Not bad at all.

345
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,178
Not only are you alive,

346
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:18,617
but you're also a cultivator.

347
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:19,818
And you're pretty.

348
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:22,658
I'm sure you can keep me company for a long time.

349
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:23,748
Keep you company?

350
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,618
Do you live here?

351
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:26,378
Yes.

352
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,788
This is my home.

353
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:29,267
I've been living here

354
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:30,178
ever since I could remember things.

355
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:32,578
You live here?

356
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:33,898
Don't you think this place is dangerous?

357
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:34,988
Dangerous?

358
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,948
There's nothing dangerous about this place.

359
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,618
Everything is fine except for the fact

360
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,818
that you cannot leave the place.

361
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:41,658
We cannot leave the place?

362
00:21:41,748 --> 00:21:42,508
But why?

363
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,490
For no reason.

364
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:44,520
You just can't leave the place.

365
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,600
You'll know when you stay here for a few more days.

366
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,890
(Feng Qianshuo said)

367
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,520
(it was difficult to exit this forest.)

368
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,930
(Seems like he was telling the truth.)

369
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,450
(It's just)

370
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,320
(that this forest is strange.)

371
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:56,970
(First, some vines)

372
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:58,305
(dragged Eldest Senior into the forest.)

373
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,520
(After that, the wrist strap)

374
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,210
(Tianyao tied on my hand vanished too.)

375
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,690
(And now, )

376
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,970
(there's this strange girl here.)

377
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,800
Are you a human or a spirit?

378
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,410
Me?

379
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,598
My name is Huan Xiaoyan.

380
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
I'm a phantom spirit.

381
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,800
Phantom spirit?

382
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,600
The ones

383
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,690
that can cast illusions.

384
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,009
What is this?

385
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,600
(Listen.)

386
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,250
(Stay here. Don't be afraid.)

387
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,450
(I'll show you)

388
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,010
(whatever you want to see.)

389
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,520
Sheng.

390
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,120
I will make sure you're entertained

391
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,650
until the day

392
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,600
you pass.

393
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,080
When?

394
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
The day of your passing.

395
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,170
Say something auspicious.

396
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,120
I won't let myself

397
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,840
die here.

398
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,249
Speaking of which, did you see

399
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,010
the other two guys?

400
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:40,250
There are two more guys?

401
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,010
It'll be lively in here then.

402
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,760
Since you're familiar with the place,

403
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,600
why don't you

404
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:45,650
help me find them?

405
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,410
There's no rush.

406
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,929
Follow me.

407
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,730
I've decided

408
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:50,800
to let you cut the queue.

409
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,360
Cut the queue?

410
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,599
Which kind of burial do you prefer?

411
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Burial?

412
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,320
I'm an expert

413
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,360
at preparing funerals.

414
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,760
Look.

415
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,040
Look at all of these.

416
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,360
I made them.

417
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,120
When it comes to holding a funeral,

418
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,560
I can give you

419
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,800
whatever you desire.

420
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,010
However, you need to

421
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,010
finish your epitaph beforehand.

422
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,250
I'll carve them on your tombstone later.

423
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,969
Forget it. I can't afford to deal with her.

424
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,040
Where are you going?

425
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,280
Sheng.

426
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Sheng.

427
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,320
Sheng.

428
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,360
Mother?

429
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,690
Let's play a game of hide and seek.

430
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,360
If you have

431
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,280
any special requests,

432
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,970
I'll try my best to fulfill them.

433
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,970
Why are you walking so fast?

434
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:38,930
I was talking about

435
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,490
an important matter.

436
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,040
Why are we back here again?

437
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,559
Did a ghost build an illusory wall here?

438
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,170
That's right.

439
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,599
Your guess is on point.

440
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,170
All those who came in never left.

441
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,890
So, the tombstones here...

442
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,600
They're all real?

443
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,360
Did you think

444
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,650
I was joking with you?

445
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,320
All of these are tombstones.

446
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,760
There's a person

447
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,450
under each tombstone.

448
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,280
Don't be scared.

449
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,840
The owner of the tombstone you touched

450
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,320
passed away peacefully.

451
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,930
He had a great temper.

452
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,520
Look at his epitaph.

453
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,359
"Eternal bliss."

454
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,760
He wrote blessings and all for his epitaph.

455
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,890
Did...

456
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,760
Did they all die here

457
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,209
because of old age?

458
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,890
They turned into smoke and vanished.

459
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,930
In here,

460
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,360
there's only one way to die.

461
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,319
Regarding the types of burial I mentioned,

462
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,319
like burial at sea and cremation,

463
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,600
they were only meant for the clothes you leave behind.

464
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,970
Mother?

465
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,730
Sheng.

466
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,730
Sheng,

467
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,560
let's play a game of hide and seek.

468
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Stand properly.

469
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,279
I'll seek you out

470
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,520
once I count to 100.

471
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Mother.

472
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,010
(All right.)

473
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,840
(Let's play hide and seek.)

474
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,120
Dark aura?

475
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,170
The game begins.

476
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,040
Find me before I count to 100.

477
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,800
If not, all of you will die.

478
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,010
My Lord?

479
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,010
One.

480
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,690
Lord?

481
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,170
There's a lord here?

482
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,599
My lord was always inside the ring.

483
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,320
Three.

484
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:11,599
But he never plays games

485
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,520
like hide and seek.

486
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,760
Five.

487
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,840
Six.

488
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,650
Seven.

489
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,360
Eight.

490
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,560
(Nine.)

491
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,450
(This place is strange.)

492
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,250
(Ten.)

493
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,359
(It makes the dark aura within my mind's eye)

494
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,320
(go berserk.)

495
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,690
Eleven.

496
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,040
Twelve.

497
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,010
We're done for.

498
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,650
My Lord has lost his mind.

499
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,559
Although I knew that would happen eventually,

500
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,490
I didn't expect it

501
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:39,729
to happen so suddenly.

502
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,210
14.

503
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,280
-Let's go! -15.

504
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,320
16.

505
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,280
What's going on?

506
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,690
Did your lord create

507
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,560
all this mess?

508
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,690
18.

509
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,450
19.

510
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,650
20.

511
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,560
That sounded like Bai Xiaosheng!

512
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,689
What hide and seek?

513
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,360
What maze?

514
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,600
What's going on?

515
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,839
My lord must have constructed this maze

516
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,929
using the inner darkness

517
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,520
of the intruder.

518
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,226
23.

519
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:11,583
-24. -Over here!

520
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,330
What do you mean by inner darkness?

521
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,120
We're phantom spirits.

522
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,399
Our lord can magnify

523
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,770
the fear inside one's heart,

524
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,089
trap the person inside,

525
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,050
and kill them!

526
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,530
Forget it.

527
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:23,010
We have to find Bai Xiaosheng first.

528
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,010
Over here!

529
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:28,412
43.

530
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:30,372
44.

531
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:32,652
45.

532
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,201
46.

533
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,198
47.

534
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:41,702
48.

535
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:45,225
(I'll seek you out)

536
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:46,466
(once I count to 100.)

537
00:27:47,116 --> 00:27:48,306
93.

538
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:51,676
94.

539
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:54,596
95.

540
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:57,546
96.

541
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:01,676
97.

542
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:03,836
98.

543
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:06,436
99.

544
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:09,836
98.

545
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:12,916
97.

546
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:15,356
96.

547
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:18,766
(Young Bai Xiaosheng)

548
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,026
Another dead end?

549
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,116
Isn't this your territory?

550
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:23,786
What should we do now?

551
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:25,306
You know.

552
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,156
Bai Xiaosheng, right?

553
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:28,201
Since this is the projection of his inner heart,

554
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:29,305
you should think about

555
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:30,116
his characteristics.

556
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:31,436
Bai Xiaosheng?

557
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:32,466
Shadows.

558
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:33,811
He's a shadow spirit!

559
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:34,636
Shadow spirit?

560
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:35,746
Over here!

561
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:39,226
51.

562
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:41,196
52.

563
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:43,266
53.

564
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,466
62.

565
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:50,116
61.

566
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:52,066
60.

567
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:52,956
54.

568
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:54,746
55.

569
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:56,676
56.

570
00:28:57,746 --> 00:28:58,636
(57.)

571
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:01,026
(58.)

572
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:01,956
59.

573
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,416
(Dark Phantom)

574
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:15,066
So, you're my offering?

575
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:28,706
(When I was waiting for Mother to seek me out, )

576
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,156
(I counted from one to 99.)

577
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:35,156
(And I then counted from 99 to one.)

578
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,306
(However, it's been ten years.)

579
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:40,916
(She never came back.)

580
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,116
(Until that day, )

581
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,266
(I finally had the chance)

582
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,421
(to go outside.)

583
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:48,706
His power

584
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:50,636
was actually sealed away?

585
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:53,786
(I'm finally free now.)

586
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:00,266
Mother?

587
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:03,786
Big shadow, small shadow.

588
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,505
(Shadows Village) Hand in hand under the moonlight.

589
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:09,115
I leave when my mother leaves.

590
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:11,986
I look around.

591
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,595
Run!

592
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:16,436
What's going on?

593
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:17,356
What's going on?

594
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:18,916
What happened?

595
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:20,156
This is...

596
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,436
Are you.

597
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:28,876
Bai Xiaosheng?

598
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:29,596
Why is he back?

599
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:30,676
(Bai Xiaosheng's Mother) Wasn't he sacrificed?

600
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:31,436
Wasn't he sacrificed?

601
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:32,396
-How did he make it back? -Precisely.

602
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:32,956
Isn't he...

603
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,676
You were an offering to the lord!

604
00:30:34,786 --> 00:30:35,986
You better scram!

605
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:37,466
I'm not an evil child.

606
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:39,676
I've never committed any evil deeds.

607
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:41,915
When the evil child returns,

608
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:42,985
the village will be cursed!

609
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:43,676
What should we do?

610
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:44,266
Mother?

611
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,436
Why did he come back?

612
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:00,676
Mother!

613
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:03,719
You were an offering!

614
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,876
You're no longer related to the Shadow Clan!

615
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,115
Your mother

616
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,506
doesn't exist in the clan!

617
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:14,195
You're the evil child in the prophecy!

618
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:15,306
How dare you come back?

619
00:31:16,066 --> 00:31:16,956
You better scram!

620
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:20,266
Do you wish to get everyone here killed?

621
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,196
Run!

622
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:29,876
Run!

623
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:33,706
Run!

624
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:56,546
Mother.

625
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:00,306
You once said

626
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:01,986
that you would seek me out

627
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:03,916
after you counted to 100.

628
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:05,706
Did you ever seek me out?

629
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:07,546
I...

630
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:11,636
I did.

631
00:32:12,986 --> 00:32:14,706
But when I went back,

632
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:18,836
you were already gone.

633
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:22,356
You're lying.

634
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,156
You're lying!

635
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:26,786
I was in the same spot!

636
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:28,506
If you did seek me out,

637
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,356
you would've found me!

638
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,226
(I'll sit here and wait for my mother.)

639
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:36,356
(If not, )

640
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:38,266
(she won't be able to find me later.)

641
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,305
I did seek you out.

642
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:41,675
I searched everywhere.

643
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,306
I didn't lie to you.

644
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,746
You're lying.

645
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:46,635
I'm not.

646
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:48,226
You never sought me out!

647
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:50,066
You abandoned me!

648
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:52,306
What else can I do?

649
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:56,356
It wasn't my wish to give birth to an evil child.

650
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,155
You'll get me into trouble

651
00:32:58,156 --> 00:32:59,225
if I keep you around,

652
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:00,636
do you know that?

653
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:03,986
(You didn't do anything wrong, )

654
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,595
(but you were abandoned by your own mother)

655
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:07,196
(and detested by your clan members.)

656
00:33:07,266 --> 00:33:09,155
(Fate is unfair to you.)

657
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,306
(What are you waiting for?)

658
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:13,876
Since you guys want me to be the evil child so badly,

659
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:16,916
I'll grant you your wish then!

660
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,266
(Mother, )

661
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,876
(it's so cold here.)

662
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:27,706
(I'm so scared.)

663
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:30,676
(Why aren't you here yet?)

664
00:33:38,786 --> 00:33:40,436
(Kill her.)

665
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:55,396
Yanhui?

666
00:33:58,956 --> 00:33:59,756
(My dragon horns)

667
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:00,666
(aren't detecting Yanhui's aura.)

668
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:02,116
(I'm sure she's in trouble.)

669
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:03,586
(I can't afford to delay this any longer.)

670
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:11,986
(From now on, )

671
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:13,306
(only a pure person like you)

672
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:14,626
(with the intention)

673
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:16,916
(of protecting others)

674
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,626
(can wield it.)

675
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,836
Today,

676
00:34:26,276 --> 00:34:27,426
I will protect him.

677
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:11,316
(Hatred)

678
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:12,586
(and grievances)

679
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:15,316
(had corroded my pure heart.)

680
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:18,796
But even so,

681
00:35:20,396 --> 00:35:22,876
I have my own reason to wield this sword!

682
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,316
The killing intent is getting stronger and stronger.

683
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:49,544
Can you

684
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:50,666
actually find that person?

685
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:53,436
I don't want to

686
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,876
hold my funeral in this dark maze.

687
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:57,836
I haven't finished writing my epitaph yet.

688
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:02,106
I found him.

689
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:03,276
You found him?

690
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:11,876
81.

691
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,916
82.

692
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:16,146
83.

693
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:18,506
84.

694
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:20,956
85.

695
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:23,356
86.

696
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:25,396
87.

697
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:28,916
88.

698
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:30,935
89.

699
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,546
90.

700
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:35,395
91.

701
00:36:35,396 --> 00:36:36,066
Bai Xiaosheng!

702
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,466
92.

703
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:39,066
Bai Xiaosheng!

704
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:39,916
Wake up!

705
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:41,066
94!

706
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:42,395
It's not the right time for counting.

707
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:43,236
Wake up!

708
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:43,876
90.

709
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:44,396
Let's go!

710
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:12,436
Yanhui.

711
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,186
You found me.

712
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:18,836
What's the matter with you?

713
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:22,916
He became normal just like that?

714
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:30,395
How could you throw

715
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:31,466
the ring to the ground?

716
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:32,546
What if

717
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:33,106
you hurt my lord

718
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:34,146
by doing so?

719
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,716
You said your lord resides within a ring.

720
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:37,836
You mean this ring?

721
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,466
Yes, that's the ring.

722
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:40,876
Release him

723
00:37:40,877 --> 00:37:42,146
and ask him why he attacked us.

724
00:37:42,506 --> 00:37:44,626
Can you please don't beat him up then?

725
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:46,146
He's a poor soul too.

726
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,186
Fine. Hurry up.

727
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,986
I think my lord is asleep.

728
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:05,146
Watch out!

729
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:14,106
Is he done yet?

730
00:38:14,356 --> 00:38:15,836
Wait!

731
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,276
That isn't my lord's power!

732
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,275
That's the dark aura! It has been revived!

733
00:38:19,276 --> 00:38:20,626
I'll hide in the ring first!

734
00:38:22,756 --> 00:38:24,235
You should bring us with you!

735
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,506
Let's leave this place first.

736
00:38:25,876 --> 00:38:26,626
Okay.

737
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,236
What are you guys doing here?

738
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:37,146
Eldest Senior, let's go!

739
00:38:38,236 --> 00:38:38,916
Watch out!

740
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:42,186
Eldest Senior!

741
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:46,796
Eldest Senior?

742
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:47,756
Eldest Senior!

743
00:38:59,146 --> 00:38:59,876
Eldest Senior!

744
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,145
Eldest Senior! Wake up!

745
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:02,796
Just go!

746
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:03,986
Leave this to me!

747
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:18,106
Hide behind the Shadow Shield!

748
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:22,066
By my knowledge,

749
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:23,716
Eight-Directional Flame of Anger!`

750
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:37,466
(Why can't I utilize my dragon fire?)

751
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,436
(The dark aura in my mind's eye)

752
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,666
(is getting out of control.)

753
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:44,356
(Heart Protecting Scale, )

754
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:46,626
(you have to do something about this.)

755
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,459
(We'll be done for)

756
00:39:48,836 --> 00:39:50,586
(if I can't use my dragon fire.)

757
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:20,916
Stand behind me.

758
00:40:24,316 --> 00:40:24,986
Today,

759
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,026
I have to save this person.

760
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:30,236
I don't care if you yield or not.

761
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:46,236
Flaming Dragon Fang, heed my order!

762
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:26,276
(Bai Xiaosheng.)

763
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:35,546
Yanhui,

764
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:37,186
wait for my return.

765
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:41,876
You're leaving right after the crisis is over?

766
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:43,396
What a disloyal friend!

767
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,236
Do you feel better now?

768
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:07,355
The dark aura in my mind's eye

769
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:08,236
has been vanquished.

770
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:09,356
I feel much better now.

771
00:42:20,436 --> 00:42:21,236
Tianyao!

772
00:42:21,436 --> 00:42:22,356
Tianyao!

773
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:23,586
Tianyao!

774
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:25,146
Tianyao!

775
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:26,466
Why are you seriously injured?

776
00:42:26,466 --> 00:42:27,026
Yanhui.

777
00:42:27,146 --> 00:42:27,796
Tianyao!

778
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:28,796
Who is he?

779
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,276
It's a long story.

780
00:42:30,626 --> 00:42:31,626
He's a dragon.

781
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:33,506
But he saved us.

782
00:42:33,956 --> 00:42:34,796
A dragon?

783
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:39,836
Forget it.

784
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:41,236
Let's leave this place now.

785
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:42,796
Let me.
