1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 18)

3
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:00,943
Elder Lingfei.

4
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:01,773
Immortal Yunmeng.

5
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:02,823
I found it.

6
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:04,052
The culprit of the destruction

7
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:05,612
of Guanghan Sect's three monasteries on Sanchong Mountain

8
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:06,942
is Crown Prince of Qingqiu,

9
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:07,663
Zhuli.

10
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,263
Outrageous!

11
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,812
Qingqiu and Spirit Clan

12
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,023
went too far this time!

13
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,022
They seized the opportunity when my sister's life star fell

14
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:15,743
and Lingxiao

15
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,053
was away at Starhaven.

16
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,052
Did they really think we were without a leader?

17
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:20,332
We will make them pay for this!

18
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:20,893
-Yes! -That's right!

19
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:21,813
-We will make them pay! -We will make them pay!

20
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:22,863
Make them pay!

21
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:24,933
Now the evil dragon is missing.

22
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:26,582
A nine-tailed fox

23
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,862
could cross the Obsidian River

24
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,023
right under our watch.

25
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:30,743
I shall capture

26
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,423
this fox spirit!

27
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,093
(The Heart Protecting Scale has left Yanhui for some time.)

28
00:02:57,743 --> 00:02:58,812
(I can no longer)

29
00:02:58,813 --> 00:02:59,933
(locate her.)

30
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:04,863
(Calabash!)

31
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:06,703
(Calabash for sale!)

32
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,333
(Yanhui.)

33
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,093
(Where are you?)

34
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,373
(Where are you now?)

35
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:35,453
Sorry.

36
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:46,053
He threatened you?

37
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:49,543
Let's go.

38
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:50,573
Quick, Bai Xiaosheng.

39
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:05,023
(Obsidian River)

40
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,223
No.

41
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,013
I can't stay in the Taoist clan.

42
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:17,863
We have to cross the river now.

43
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:19,813
The Taoists and the Spirits

44
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,013
guard their borders tightly.

45
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:22,302
After we cross the river,

46
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,933
perhaps Tianyao

47
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,052
won't find us so easily.

48
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:24,903
When we reach Qingqiu,

49
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:26,253
we should be able to shake him off.

50
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:29,613
No matter how powerful he is,

51
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,102
he needs more than just magic spells

52
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:32,492
to cross

53
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:33,253
the Obsidian River.

54
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,453
Let's gather some bamboo sticks.

55
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:42,493
You said it was called Ganhong bamboo.

56
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:46,253
Why is it green instead of red?

57
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,252
Are we getting the right plant?

58
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,493
This should be it.

59
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:51,013
The marking on the map shows...

60
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:54,783
Yanhui.

61
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:55,863
I prepared the bamboo for you.

62
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:01,613
How did you find us?

63
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:06,903
Here is the only boat crossing

64
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:07,933
to avoid the Taoists

65
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,013
and reach Qingqiu.

66
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:11,453
Qingqiu?

67
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,253
No one is going to that lousy place.

68
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:15,613
I don't know

69
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:16,783
what you've done to Yanhui,

70
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,223
but I know

71
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:20,343
you have always wanted to take her to Qingqiu.

72
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,743
The Ganhong bamboo looks the same as normal bamboo.

73
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,693
Its color changes after it's cut down.

74
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,783
Of course I know that.

75
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,053
Did you think I got the wrong bamboo?

76
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:32,863
Why do you

77
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:33,903
keep pestering us?

78
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,013
It's none of your concern.

79
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,343
How is it none of my concern?

80
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:39,452
She and I

81
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:40,813
went through life and death together.

82
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:42,783
(Kill him.)

83
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,422
(Take out the Heart Protecting Scale.)

84
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:45,663
Whatever concerns her

85
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:49,183
concerns me.

86
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,783
She doesn't want to see you.

87
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,373
Don't you get it?

88
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:53,983
Yanhui.

89
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:57,813
(What's wrong with Yanhui?)

90
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:01,053
Yanhui?

91
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,613
You already took the Heart Protecting Scale.

92
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:08,903
What more do you want?

93
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,813
Won't you show me the slightest mercy?

94
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,053
No.

95
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,903
Why won't you stop pursuing her?

96
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:18,013
You...

97
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:18,813
What?

98
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:21,053
When Yanhui confessed to you

99
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,423
and you apologized to her,

100
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:23,613
I thought

101
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:25,422
you only did so because you had to leave her love

102
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:26,453
unanswered.

103
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:28,743
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,613
(It seems you had already intended)

105
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:34,613
to steal

106
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,053
the Heart Protecting Scale from her back then.

107
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:41,783
So...

108
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:43,663
You were apologizing

109
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,453
for my life.

110
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:48,783
That's not true!

111
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:51,493
There is nothing more

112
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:52,573
she can give you.

113
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:54,103
Spare her.

114
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:55,933
Step aside.

115
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:57,182
This is between Yanhui and me.

116
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,783
Don't go.

117
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:58,743
I'm not going anywhere.

118
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:08,543
Yanhui.

119
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:11,863
I want to speak in private.

120
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:13,663
How dare you even ask?

121
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,863
Bai Xiaosheng.

122
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:17,223
I know

123
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:18,783
we are no match for him,

124
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:19,613
but we are

125
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:20,693
in the same boat.

126
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:21,573
You can't leave me

127
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,253
when I need you

128
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,303
the most.

129
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:24,103
Yanhui.

130
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:25,253
Don't worry.

131
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,543
I'm not like him.

132
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:37,093
Fine.

133
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,383
I'll help you cross the river.

134
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:42,453
No!

135
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,053
Stay away!

136
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:53,213
Yanhui.

137
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:55,903
Let's go.

138
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:05,383
Bai Xiaosheng.

139
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,183
(A nine-tailed fox.)

140
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:12,213
Who are you?

141
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:12,623
Are you blind or what?

142
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:14,212
(Zhuli, Crown Prince of Qingqiu) I am Crown Prince of Qingqiu.

143
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:15,183
If you help me defeat

144
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:15,903
the Taoists,

145
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:17,183
I will reward you handsomely.

146
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,423
Are you nuts?

147
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,573
They are here! Stop them!

148
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,622
Fox spirit! You are cornered!

149
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:23,423
Lingfei?

150
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:25,423
Yanhui?

151
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,263
What are you doing here?

152
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:29,023
I...

153
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,053
I...

154
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:38,453
Very well.

155
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:40,182
Not only did you conspire with the evil dragon

156
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,262
to destroy Yongzhou City,

157
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:42,183
but you also conspired

158
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,093
with the fox spirit

159
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,213
to destroy our monasteries!

160
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,213
That is not true!

161
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,623
It's a complicated story.

162
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:47,812
I don't know if you'll believe me,

163
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:48,383
but I...

164
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:49,733
You are a traitor.

165
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,093
I'll make sure

166
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,973
you die by my sword today!

167
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,623
Hold on!

168
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:56,333
(I could use Lingfei)

169
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:57,853
(to stall Tianyao.)

170
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,213
(That should give us a chance to escape.)

171
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,093
Martial Aunt,

172
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:02,302
you got it all wrong.

173
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:03,093
This is his fault.

174
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:04,183
He is the evil dragon!

175
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,423
He is the one

176
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:07,902
who took me hostage and destroyed Yongzhou City.

177
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:09,022
He conspired with the fox spirit

178
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,663
to destroy the Guanghan Sect's mountains.

179
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:12,053
Yes.

180
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:13,183
It's his doing.

181
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:14,383
I can prove it.

182
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:23,933
So what if it's me?

183
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,303
Time to go.

184
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,573
I'm going to kill you.

185
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,263
I must avenge my sister!

186
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:44,783
What?

187
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:46,663
Have you dealt with those Taoists?

188
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,813
-Are you also crossing the river? -Can we share the raft?

189
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:50,452
I think

190
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:51,902
it's safer for the three of us

191
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:52,933
to cross the river together.

192
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:53,813
What do you think?

193
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,143
Yeah!

194
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:57,182
You have a point.

195
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:57,573
Let's go.

196
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,503
Bai Xiaosheng, are you all right?

197
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:21,213
Tie yourself

198
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:21,733
to the raft.

199
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:22,813
If not, you might fall into the water.

200
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:23,543
Come on.

201
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:28,603
Yanhui.

202
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:31,243
Bai Xiaosheng!

203
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:33,403
It's too dangerous.

204
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,483
Just go without me.

205
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:35,903
Don't be absurd.

206
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:49,453
Yanhui!

207
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:15,303
Yanhui?

208
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,503
Stay away!

209
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,383
Stay away!

210
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,663
Stay away!

211
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,212
There's no more

212
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,213
Heart Protecting Scale in my body.

213
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,183
Don't tell me you'll do it again.

214
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:52,783
No.

215
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:55,573
I have no ill intentions.

216
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:57,733
No?

217
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,093
I see.

218
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:03,573
I get it now.

219
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:05,693
You must think

220
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:07,023
you're becoming a dragon

221
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,303
after taking the Heart Protecting Scale.

222
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:10,053
You'll become powerful soon.

223
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,333
You don't want anyone else

224
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,903
to know all the unspeakable things you did.

225
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:16,693
You are here to cut off the loose end, right?

226
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,143
I assure you

227
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,263
that after we part ways today,

228
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:33,383
I will not tell a single soul

229
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,143
about all the things you have done.

230
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,023
No one else will know.

231
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:46,663
Yanhui...

232
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:52,663
Please don't kill me.

233
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:00,783
I...

234
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:07,933
I will never hurt you.

235
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,303
No?

236
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,143
That sounds

237
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,453
awfully familiar.

238
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,573
Back at the Dragon Bone Formation,

239
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:19,733
didn't you

240
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,143
tell me the same thing?

241
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,182
(Are you lying to me again?)

242
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,262
(The Heart Protecting Scale)

243
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:28,383
(is only a piece of scale.)

244
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:29,693
I don't mind leaving it there.

245
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:43,453
Yanhui...

246
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:48,423
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:52,733
I'm truly sorry.

248
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,813
Enough! You won't fool me again.

249
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:58,333
But this time...

250
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,903
I will never believe you again.

251
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,143
What you did to me

252
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:07,183
and what Suying did to you...

253
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,213
Aren't they of the same nature?

254
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:16,453
I've never hurt you as Suying did.

255
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:17,733
But you

256
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:20,093
turned into the same monster as her!

257
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,212
You should be grateful

258
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:30,143
that I didn't bind you to a chair.

259
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:32,663
To you,

260
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,333
I'm no longer

261
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,573
of any value.

262
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,423
Please spare me.

263
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,453
I don't want to see you again.

264
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:48,663
Stop following me!

265
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:22,693
Wake up!

266
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,733
Wake up!

267
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:26,933
Wake up!

268
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:32,693
What's wrong with you?

269
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,183
You ingrate.

270
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:34,733
I saved you.

271
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,663
Instead of thanking me,

272
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:36,503
you yelled at me!

273
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:38,782
Bai Xiaosheng!

274
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:39,503
Yanhui.

275
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:40,543
Are you hurt?

276
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:41,423
I was so scared.

277
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,143
I thought I'd never see you again.

278
00:16:45,023 --> 00:16:46,023
It's all right.

279
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:47,623
I'm still alive and well.

280
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:49,503
You two must be very close.

281
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:51,972
You don't see a Taoist falling in love

282
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:52,853
with a spirit every day.

283
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:55,973
Miss.

284
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:57,933
Thank you for your help.

285
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,263
I am a person

286
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:01,023
who knows gratitude.

287
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:02,143
How about this?

288
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:02,853
I'll let you

289
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,423
follow me to the palace to get your reward.

290
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:10,453
Never mind.

291
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:11,933
We saved you, but only incidentally.

292
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:12,623
We have

293
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:13,902
other things to finish.

294
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:15,013
We'll go our separate ways here.

295
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:17,253
Very well.

296
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,693
Hold on!

297
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:23,423
The thing we want

298
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:24,903
is right in the Royal Palace of Qingqiu!

299
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,292
That was a hospitable invitation.

300
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:32,692
We don't mind going there.

301
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:33,623
Isn't that right?

302
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,583
You still want your reward?

303
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,493
Whatever, I am a generous person.

304
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,343
Unlike

305
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:40,293
the other spirits,

306
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,533
I don't discriminate against the Taoists.

307
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:41,973
-Yes. -Indeed.

308
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:42,663
-Indeed. -Yes.

309
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:43,423
Well then,

310
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,423
follow me.

311
00:17:45,183 --> 00:17:46,663
It's been an exhausting journey.

312
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,862
I'm finally home.

313
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:49,863
What a fool.

314
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:51,773
Things will be much easier

315
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:52,973
with an escort.

316
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:53,823
Let's go.

317
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:15,143
Bai Xiaosheng?

318
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:18,693
Why is your robe with me?

319
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,102
I gave it to you last night

320
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:25,143
so you wouldn't catch a cold.

321
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:28,213
Take it back.

322
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:29,733
Never mind.

323
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:30,423
I'm not cold.

324
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:31,623
Keep it.

325
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:35,423
This shadow spirit cares a lot about you.

326
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:36,933
He even gathered some fruits for you.

327
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:42,453
Who would've thought?

328
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,903
You're a thoughtful person.

329
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,533
I don't do that for everyone.

330
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,933
Don't you feel

331
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,903
someone is following us?

332
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,012
There is no one here in Qingqiu.

333
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:56,973
There are only spirits.

334
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,343
Don't be paranoid.

335
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:01,903
Yanhui, don't fall behind.

336
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:06,493
Take this. It tastes good.

337
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:09,663
When did you

338
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:11,182
get so interested in fruits?

339
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,143
I don't want you to starve.

340
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,382
Both of you brought me fruits.

341
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:14,583
I can't finish all of them.

342
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:15,693
There is someone else.

343
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,423
Someone really is following us.

344
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:19,292
Finish your fruit.

345
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,293
We can ignore the others.

346
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,123
I am dog-tired.

347
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:32,443
Why won't you

348
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:33,512
follow the directions I gave you?

349
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:34,683
If you keep taking detours,

350
00:20:34,793 --> 00:20:35,403
it will take

351
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,643
forever to reach the palace!

352
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:39,713
That fool

353
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,683
is following us like a pestering fly.

354
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:42,953
We can't seem to shake him off.

355
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,713
I tried to get rid of him.

356
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:51,123
But he followed me everywhere.

357
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:52,513
Of course

358
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:54,083
a little detour won't shake him off.

359
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,123
Wait, hold on.

360
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:56,643
I followed you this entire time,

361
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:58,553
but you were trying to get rid of him?

362
00:20:58,683 --> 00:20:59,713
What else could it be?

363
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,843
You could've said so.

364
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:03,273
I'll talk some sense into him.

365
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,513
Hey, spirit.

366
00:21:20,643 --> 00:21:21,713
Don't you know shame?

367
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:22,753
We told you to stop tailing us,

368
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:23,603
so when will you relent?

369
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,603
I know.

370
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,553
You are in love

371
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,953
with the girl.

372
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:31,883
But listen to me.

373
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:34,202
There is a limit as a spirit.

374
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:35,272
You can't simply do as you please

375
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,443
because you are young.

376
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:38,753
What...

377
00:21:39,203 --> 00:21:40,273
What are you looking at?

378
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:41,883
That won't stop me from scolding you.

379
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:42,793
Listen up!

380
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,553
The two of them are close.

381
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:45,922
Why must you interfere?

382
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:46,713
Don't you feel any shame?

383
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,203
They are not in love.

384
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,883
But you are still the outsider.

385
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:54,123
I'm not an outsider.

386
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,513
Don't deny it.

387
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,032
If you weren't an outsider,

388
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,033
why would she be with him

389
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:58,923
and ignore you?

390
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:03,442
The girl really hates you.

391
00:22:03,443 --> 00:22:04,713
They've been taking detours.

392
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,203
Why are you still following her?

393
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:10,602
Who knows what's wrong

394
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:11,713
with this world?

395
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:13,512
A lowly spirit like you

396
00:22:13,513 --> 00:22:14,712
has become so shameless

397
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:15,753
that you don't know when to stop.

398
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:17,792
She doesn't like you.

399
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:19,843
Why must you pester her?

400
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,443
The shadow spirit cares a lot about her.

401
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,993
He always listens to her.

402
00:22:25,273 --> 00:22:27,233
They are a match made in heaven!

403
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:29,513
What do you want?

404
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:31,033
Are you going to hurt me?

405
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:33,443
I didn't say anything wrong.

406
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:45,203
Now you've come to your senses!

407
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:50,443
You got rid of him?

408
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:51,473
But how?

409
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:52,203
I told him off.

410
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:53,403
What did you say?

411
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:54,883
Well...

412
00:22:54,993 --> 00:22:55,953
I called him shameless.

413
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:58,272
Is that all?

414
00:22:58,273 --> 00:22:58,793
Yeah.

415
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,233
You're the shameless one here!

416
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,473
Yanhui.

417
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:03,513
Huan Xiaoyan?

418
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:05,643
Where did you come from?

419
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:07,753
What are you doing here?

420
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:09,083
I never left.

421
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,272
I was in the ring

422
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,403
when you crossed the river.

423
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:15,643
Dragon King carried me the entire time.

424
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:17,553
I sneaked out

425
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:18,363
of the ring

426
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,443
when he wasn't looking.

427
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,473
Dragon King doesn't know.

428
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,403
What kind of name is that?

429
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:26,032
He might as well be a chicken,

430
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:26,643
a duck,

431
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:27,313
or a goose.

432
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,313
What did you say?

433
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:29,553
I dare you to say that again.

434
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,443
You're the worst of the bunch.

435
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:32,792
You kept nagging all the time.

436
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:33,793
You wouldn't stop talking.

437
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,603
They may be too ignorant to care,

438
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,362
but even you are barking like a bully

439
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,472
-to take advantage of them. -Barking?

440
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:39,752
I'm a proud fox!

441
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,442
I am Crown Prince of Qingqiu!

442
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:42,163
I'm a nine-tailed fox!

443
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:43,402
Who do you think you are?

444
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:44,793
How dare you speak to me this way?

445
00:23:45,403 --> 00:23:46,472
And how dare you

446
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:47,642
bring up your title

447
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:48,842
as the crown prince?

448
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:49,922
You're just dust when you die.

449
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:51,842
How dare you disrespect my title!

450
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:53,032
I should teach you a lesson.

451
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,713
How dare you hit me?

452
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:56,793
I'll make you pay!

453
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:05,883
Ouch! My hair!

454
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:11,122
He's Crown Prince of Qingqiu.

455
00:24:11,123 --> 00:24:12,643
She is the only heir of Phantom Clan.

456
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,083
They are going to be rulers.

457
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:16,643
Look at them now.

458
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:18,753
I bet Qingqiu

459
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:19,882
will fall just like

460
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:20,843
the Taoist clan.

461
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:24,203
All right, stop fighting.

462
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:27,473
Ouch!

463
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,403
Enough! Stop fighting!

464
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:35,643
Considering

465
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:36,753
the favor from my life savior,

466
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:37,753
I'll let it slide this time.

467
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:39,473
Who are you to spare me?

468
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:40,712
I must teach you a lesson!

469
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:41,203
Enough!

470
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,312
It's the middle of the night.

471
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:44,473
Go elsewhere if you want to fight.

472
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:45,953
Strike a different pose.

473
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:46,793
Don't copy my pose!

474
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:51,553
Phantom spirit.

475
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,313
I don't get it.

476
00:24:53,473 --> 00:24:54,553
He doesn't know better.

477
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:56,512
He doesn't know the whole story,

478
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:57,203
but he would still

479
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,403
take our side.

480
00:24:58,953 --> 00:24:59,883
What about you?

481
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,602
You saw that dragon

482
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,122
stab her heart with a sword.

483
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:05,993
What?

484
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,473
He stabbed you?

485
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:10,403
Stop yelling.

486
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:12,712
More and more lowly spirits

487
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:13,713
can't tell right from wrong.

488
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,993
They would defend even the villains.

489
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:16,513
What do you...

490
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:18,603
Get over here.

491
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:22,233
You got on my nerve.

492
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:27,753
Yanhui.

493
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:29,712
I think

494
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:31,443
Dragon King has gone through a lot.

495
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:33,162
He's been looking for you

496
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,683
ever since he came back.

497
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:41,443
You master beat him up.

498
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:42,843
My master?

499
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,753
Master Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain.

500
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:49,032
Dragon King calls him that.

501
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:49,683
He's back?

502
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:50,793
Where did he go?

503
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:52,473
I don't know.

504
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:55,793
I think he knows you're in trouble.

505
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:57,643
He beat up Dragon King when he arrived.

506
00:25:58,033 --> 00:25:59,713
Dragon King was already hurt.

507
00:25:59,923 --> 00:26:00,993
She asked for his location.

508
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:02,793
Just tell her where he is.

509
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:04,953
I don't know!

510
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:08,553
Perhaps

511
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,603
he thought you were dead

512
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,273
and just left.

513
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:14,603
It seems

514
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:15,952
I should send my eldest senior a message

515
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:17,163
and tell them not to worry.

516
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:18,033
Seriously?

517
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,203
You ran into Lingfei

518
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,203
at Ganhong Bamboo Grove.

519
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:21,712
She will tell the others

520
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,843
you are still alive.

521
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:24,883
You're right.

522
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,643
I'm not done yet!

523
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,952
Before your master beat up Dragon King,

524
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,473
something big had gone down.

525
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:35,952
He hurt you

526
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:36,643
because of Suying.

527
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:37,363
I know.

528
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:38,883
You know?

529
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,442
Master Suying was pinned

530
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,083
by the evil dragon on the seat of the Guanghan Sect's main hall.

531
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:46,313
The whole world knows.

532
00:26:47,603 --> 00:26:48,993
I rushed back to Dragon Valley

533
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,603
and saw the aftermath.

534
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:52,923
By connecting the dots,

535
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,123
I can tell

536
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:55,842
Suying must have done

537
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:56,883
something to provoke him.

538
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:58,603
That is the only reasonable cause.

539
00:26:59,033 --> 00:26:59,643
Suying

540
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:01,313
is too cruel and vile.

541
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:03,403
She killed Yun.

542
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:07,793
Yun?

543
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,032
(On the cliff west of the path)

544
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:11,233
(where you came in, )

545
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,643
there is the Linglong Grass that bears blue flowers.

546
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,083
They can treat burns.

547
00:27:18,923 --> 00:27:20,313
Don't be sad.

548
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:25,683
(Sorry, Miss Yanhui.)

549
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:32,033
Suying killed Yun

550
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:33,602
and took all the elves

551
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:34,713
to blackmail the Dragon King.

552
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:35,843
Dragon King

553
00:27:35,844 --> 00:27:36,953
didn't have a choice.

554
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:39,513
So...

555
00:27:40,603 --> 00:27:41,643
He had no choice

556
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:44,313
but to do it.

557
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,993
What about the other elves?

558
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:54,033
What happened to them?

559
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:55,603
They were rescued.

560
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:57,082
Dragon King sent them

561
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,163
somewhere safe.

562
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:01,083
Good.

563
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:06,033
Yanhui?

564
00:28:07,993 --> 00:28:08,883
I get it.

565
00:28:11,443 --> 00:28:12,882
All right, it's time to go.

566
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:13,753
Give her some peace.

567
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:14,883
Go on.

568
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:16,603
You should go.

569
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:27,233
Yanhui.

570
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,443
Now you know the whole truth.

571
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:31,403
Have you wavered?

572
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,363
The best I can do

573
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,953
is not hate him.

574
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:58,163
Sorry.

575
00:28:59,713 --> 00:29:01,163
I only found out today

576
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:03,083
that you had passed on.

577
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:08,443
Yun.

578
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,793
I hope that in the afterlife,

579
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:12,923
you can have a bunch of lovely friends

580
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:15,473
as you did in Dragon Valley.

581
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,793
May you be happy there.

582
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:19,993
I don't have any candles

583
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:22,363
or the little sunflowers you liked.

584
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:26,123
I could only gather some twigs

585
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:28,123
and some wildflowers

586
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:29,883
to pay my respect.

587
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,083
Sorry.

588
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,603
I couldn't keep you safe.

589
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,203
But Suying

590
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:39,233
got the punishment

591
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,643
she deserved.

592
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,403
Your Dragon King

593
00:29:42,923 --> 00:29:44,443
avenged your death.

594
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:46,953
May you find peace

595
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:48,513
in the next life.

596
00:29:59,403 --> 00:30:00,843
I finally understand

597
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:03,123
that Tianyao

598
00:30:03,993 --> 00:30:05,473
stabbed me that night

599
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:07,273
to take the Heart Protecting Scale

600
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:10,033
because he had no choice.

601
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:12,603
The cause of everything

602
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:15,033
was Suying.

603
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,993
Perhaps I should forgive him.

604
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:28,993
But I...

605
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:34,513
When I see him,

606
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:37,033
I am terrified.

607
00:30:38,473 --> 00:30:39,682
I can't help but think about

608
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:41,163
those horrible things.

609
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:44,273
I'm afraid

610
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:49,083
I can never look him in the eyes again.

611
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:52,313
Yun.

612
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:54,443
I'm sorry.

613
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:56,923
Please forgive me.

614
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,953
This is outrageous!

615
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:28,753
Dragon King.

616
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:34,273
Dragon King.

617
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:39,313
Just now...

618
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:42,273
I couldn't help it back in the cave.

619
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,842
So I told her about Yun...

620
00:31:44,843 --> 00:31:45,513
I know.

621
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:49,953
But Dragon King,

622
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:51,273
it seems Yanhui is really

623
00:31:51,403 --> 00:31:53,363
going to forget about you for good.

624
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:55,203
What should we do?

625
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:57,993
I searched for her

626
00:31:58,993 --> 00:32:00,683
because I was worried her life could be in danger

627
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,203
without the Heart Protecting Scale.

628
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:03,603
Now,

629
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,713
I only want to escort her to Qingqiu

630
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:07,713
and make sure she is safe.

631
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:09,363
Then, I'll leave her.

632
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:12,163
But...

633
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:13,603
From then on,

634
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:15,403
she'll get what she wishes for.

635
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:18,443
We'll be even.

636
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,123
But Dragon King,

637
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,923
doesn't that make you sad?

638
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,752
I bet he left this morning

639
00:32:37,753 --> 00:32:38,993
and plans on following us.

640
00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:39,883
You!

641
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:41,883
You said you chased him away.

642
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:43,162
The fire was just put out.

643
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:44,363
He was clearly still here.

644
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:45,553
But...

645
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:46,203
How should I know

646
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:47,953
he'd be so shameless?

647
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:49,883
Whatever, we should move on.

648
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:50,993
Wait.

649
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:52,882
Enough detours.

650
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:53,643
I'll lead the way.

651
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,233
I know a shortcut.

652
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:56,403
But

653
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:57,752
people rarely use that path.

654
00:32:57,753 --> 00:32:58,793
It could be dangerous.

655
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:01,403
But

656
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,793
we can shake those two off.

657
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:04,443
Why didn't you tell us? Lead the way!

658
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:05,553
I'd love to slap you.

659
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:06,403
Quick!

660
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:06,843
This way.

661
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,513
You two, hurry up!

662
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:43,553
Hurry!

663
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,883
This fox spirit

664
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:01,363
has great stamina.

665
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,233
It's not the stamina.

666
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,643
I can feel

667
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,392
there's a karmic force

668
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:09,712
causing a repulsion with the dark aura

669
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:10,873
inside us.

670
00:34:12,913 --> 00:34:13,683
I never knew

671
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,913
there was a place like this in Qingqiu.

672
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,233
If this place

673
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:20,163
does

674
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:21,793
have this karmic force,

675
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,163
perhaps

676
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:24,753
we can find a way to control

677
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:27,003
the dark aura there.

678
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:40,562
Stop dilly-dallying.

679
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:42,083
You made the shortcut a detour.

680
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:43,233
No.

681
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:45,203
Listen,

682
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:46,963
I can't walk anymore.

683
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,162
What kind of spirit are you?

684
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:49,913
You couldn't cross a river,

685
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:50,963
and now you can't walk the desert?

686
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,273
Why did you fall

687
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:53,433
for this feeble spirit?

688
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:55,832
We just got here.

689
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:56,913
We have trouble acclimating.

690
00:34:57,273 --> 00:34:58,353
Please be considerate.

691
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:00,272
Hang in there.

692
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:01,083
The Royal Palace of Qingqiu

693
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:02,083
is just over this plain.

694
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,203
You can find everything you need there.

695
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:05,833
Come on.

696
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:06,393
Come on.

697
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:07,353
Let's go.

698
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:23,523
Fox spirit.

699
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:27,643
What is it this time?

700
00:35:29,273 --> 00:35:30,233
I can't take another step.

701
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,043
Let's take a break.

702
00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:32,963
Take a break.

703
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,683
You are too weak to be a spirit.

704
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,753
I can't take it.

705
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:39,793
Me either.

706
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,083
You too?

707
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:42,273
I am exhausted.

708
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:43,523
The sun is too hot.

709
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:44,792
I am so thirsty.

710
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:46,002
-Fine, take a break. -It's so hot.

711
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:46,833
Don't take too long.

712
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:03,873
Thanks.

713
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,163
This shade here

714
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,203
makes me feel much better.

715
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:13,603
Don't mention it.

716
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:14,393
It's nothing.

717
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:15,643
That's not his doing.

718
00:36:28,123 --> 00:36:29,003
Huan Xiaoyan?

719
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:30,122
What are you doing here?

720
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,083
Why are you

721
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:32,203
still following us?

722
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,523
You can't outrun us

723
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:35,873
with your short legs.

724
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:36,233
You...

725
00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:37,393
How naive.

726
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:38,713
This is your fault.

727
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:39,793
You...

728
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:41,873
Stupid fox, don't yell at Yanhui.

729
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:48,082
Dragon King knows you wouldn't see him.

730
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,003
He wants you to have this.

731
00:36:57,163 --> 00:36:57,963
Take it.

732
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,043
And don't forget

733
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:02,833
that he drove the cloud here

734
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,712
using magic

735
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:05,713
to give you some shade.

736
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:07,602
When you crossed the river,

737
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:08,833
-he was worried you'd catch a cold... -So,

738
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:10,162
aren't you a prince?

739
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,913
Can't you get us some water?

740
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:14,272
You let this lowly phantom spirit

741
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,913
get the chance to earn her favor.

742
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,163
If I didn't know better,

743
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:17,563
I'd thought

744
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:19,003
this was the phantom spirits' turf.

745
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:20,353
Nonsense!

746
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:22,162
It's just a jar of water and a small cloud!

747
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:23,203
What's the big deal?

748
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:24,432
Wait here.

749
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:25,313
I'll give you

750
00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:26,393
a hearty dinner tonight!

751
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:28,563
Bluff all you want.

752
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:29,753
Care to have a match?

753
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:31,313
Let's see who makes the better dinner!

754
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:32,523
So be it.

755
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:33,753
I'm not afraid of you.

756
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,233
Short-leg.

757
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:38,433
Wait! That's cheating!

758
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:39,713
Short-leg!

759
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:45,713
It's almost time.

760
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:49,523
Come on.

761
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:51,753
Let's go.

762
00:37:59,203 --> 00:38:00,043
What is this thing?

763
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:01,203
Don't drink this.

764
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:22,963
(Kill him.)

765
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:25,713
(Take the Heart Protecting Scale.)

766
00:38:35,683 --> 00:38:36,433
(Yanhui?)
