1
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
(Back From The Brink)

2
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
(Episode 28)

3
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,270
What heart mantra

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,640
did you teach me today?

5
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,910
It was so powerful.

6
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,080
It's the Spirit Dragon Heart Mantra.

7
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,960
Now that the Heart Protecting Scale

8
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,200
has returned to your body,

9
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,320
it's only natural for you to practice

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,270
dragon's cultivation techniques.

11
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,390
You should stop cultivating

12
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,800
that Ghostly Eulogy.

13
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,390
It hurts to cultivate the Ghostly Eulogy.

14
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
I feel more comfortable with your cultivation techniques.

15
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,550
Now, I'm cultivating the dragon's cultivation techniques.

16
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,429
Does that make me a successor to the dragons?

17
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,640
Then will the Flaming Dragon Fang

18
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,870
listen to me?

19
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,870
Do you want to try it out?

20
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,870
Try commanding it.

21
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,550
If it hits me,

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,870
you must hold on to it tightly.

23
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,110
Don't worry. It won't hit you.

24
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,960
It's swift and has light movements as well as strong and powerful strikes.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,990
It's indeed a fine sword.

26
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,870
If it's comfortable to use,

27
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,960
you can keep it.

28
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,270
I just wanted to try something new.

29
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,430
You should keep using it.

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,320
As for me, I can pick up tree branches

31
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,320
and river stones

32
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,590
as weapons.

33
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,360
What's wrong with it?

34
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,360
Maybe

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,080
it feels upset

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
because you compared it

37
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,080
to stones and branches.

38
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,960
Why is it so petty?

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,080
By the way,

40
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,520
is the Life-Swapping Spell still inside me?

41
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,870
Bai Xiaosheng's timely arrow managed to stop

42
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,040
the Life-Swapping Spell from activating fully.

43
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,560
It should still be in your mind's eye.

44
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,470
I want to remove the Life-Swapping Spell.

45
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,440
Why?

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
I may be afraid of death.

47
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,390
But I don't want others

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,640
to bear the responsibility for my life and death.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,590
Besides,

50
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,680
I like you.

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,350
Once the Life-Swapping Spell is cast,

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,470
there's no way to remove it.

53
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,760
If you're worried about me,

54
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,590
just protect yourself well.

55
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,640
But I'm a human

56
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,760
made of flesh and blood.

57
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,200
My lifespan is also limited.

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,320
If you put your life in my hands,

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,080
wouldn't it be a waste?

60
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,390
Don't underestimate yourself.

61
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,150
Go to your mind's eye and take a look.

62
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,470
Is this...

63
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,560
Is this my mind's eye?

64
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,270
I guess I can be considered

65
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,680
at the level of a Seven Star Disciple

66
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,710
of the Taoist clan now, right?

67
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,440
With the power of the Heart Protecting Scale, it should be so.

68
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,520
If you cultivate a little more,

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,520
even reaching the level of a grandmaster of the Taoist clan

70
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,880
won't be difficult.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,230
The Heart Protecting Scale is just a protective armor.

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,590
How can it be so powerful?

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,640
The Heart Protecting Scale

74
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,150
is not only a piece of my protective armor.

75
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,710
It's

76
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,120
also my inner core.

77
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,830
Your inner core?

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,230
Why is your inner core outside?

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,000
When Suying tried

80
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,390
to take my Heart Protecting Scale,

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
there was another mysterious person.

82
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,470
The evil dragon is heavily injured.

83
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:07,000
Quick, cut open the scale and take the core!

84
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,640
(I was not able to see his looks.)

85
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,320
But I knew

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,880
he was after my inner core.

87
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
To stop Suying and him

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,030
from achieving their goals,

89
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,680
(I merged the Heart Protecting Scale and inner core together)

90
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,120
(and cast them away.)

91
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
This way,

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,350
neither side can get

93
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,830
what they want.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
Instead, they'll turn on each other.

95
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,470
That was brilliant.

96
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,640
But wait.

97
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,470
So now I have your inner core

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,440
fused with the Heart Protecting Scale

99
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,790
and the Life-Swapping Spell in my body now.

100
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,789
Does that mean

101
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,760
you can never get back

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,710
your inner core?

103
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,150
It takes one thousand years of cultivation for the inner core to develop.

104
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,270
It can still be developed.

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,710
Did you say one thousand years?

106
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,030
I might not even have the chance

107
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,910
to meet you again in a thousand years.

108
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,350
Then I'll have

109
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,960
to work even harder.

110
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,230
So I can carry

111
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,880
the burden

112
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,640
of these two lives.

113
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,120
Then

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,710
I'll thank you in advance.

115
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,120
I have another question.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,000
Since my mind's eye

117
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,470
can be this vast,

118
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,560
which

119
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,390
Taoist grandmaster planted a seal

120
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,470
on the Heart Protecting Scale in my body

121
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,960
in the first place?

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Perhaps it was your master,

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Master Lingxiao.

124
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,560
I thought of that possibility before.

125
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,150
But why would he do that?

126
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,350
Maybe he was worried that you were too young

127
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,790
and someone might covet it.

128
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,790
So he hid the power of your Heart Protecting Scale.

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,790
I didn't expect you to defend him.

130
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,030
When he couldn't find you at Dragon Valley,

131
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,680
(he was as anxious as I was.)

132
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,760
Where's Yanhui?

133
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,230
You knew something happened to her?

134
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,230
Could the seal on the Heart Protecting Scale...

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,120
You took her scale?

136
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,320
If that's the case,

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,520
(there must be a reason)

138
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,710
(he drove me down the mountain.)

139
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,000
Where is he now?

140
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,200
I haven't heard from him

141
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,000
since that day.

142
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,860
(Master Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain)

143
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,800
(It seems)

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,110
(that there are even more tombstones)

145
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,350
(in the Misty Forest now.)

146
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
(Now, where did I cast my spell)

147
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,750
(the last time I was here?)

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,040
(Where's my entrance?)

149
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,800
Found you.

150
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,520
(First, I'll use Shadow Concealment to block the entrance)

151
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,680
(and cut off Dark Phantom and Changlan's method of communication)

152
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,990
(to buy Yanhui some time.)

153
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,440
(Then I'll figure out)

154
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,800
(how to destroy this entrance.)

155
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,510
Your Majesty,

156
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,230
I received some news

157
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,320
from Flower Bulletin outside Obsidian Riverhead

158
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,509
when I left Silver Moon Cliff yesterday.

159
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:47,960
But...

160
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Xiange, let's not panic.

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,590
All right.

162
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,960
Your Majesty. Xiange.

163
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,400
What brings you here?

164
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,989
Xiange, I have something to ask you.

165
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,230
Yanhui, just ask away.

166
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,040
Do you know the whereabouts of Master Lingxiao?

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,470
He was last known

168
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,110
to be nearby Misty Forest.

169
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,470
Misty Forest?

170
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,870
Yes.

171
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,110
That was quite some time ago.

172
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,160
Can you ask Feng Qianshuo

173
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,680
to use the Flower Medallion to help search for his news?

174
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,230
I was about to report this matter to Your Majesty.

175
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,160
Qianshuo hasn't replied to me

176
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,400
for some time now.

177
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm afraid Changlan might have discovered him.

178
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,750
Then we should hurry back.

179
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,110
It's true that we shouldn't wait any longer.

180
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,280
Yes, we should leave right away.

181
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:28,920
All right.

182
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,710
Cross the Obsidian River and level the Taoist clans!

183
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,870
Cross the Obsidian River

184
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,510
-Don't go! -and level the Taoist clans!

185
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,399
Cross the Obsidian River and level the Taoist clans!

186
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,590
What is this old man trying to tell us?

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,870
Mr. Yan must have lost his mind now.

188
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,080
He kept tugging at us every day without speaking.

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,990
And he

190
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,800
(Changlan, the visual spell master deludes Qingqiu) looks angry too.

191
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,870
(Don't send the troops, don't go) He keeps holding

192
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,750
that blank banner with him.

193
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,510
Well, let him be.

194
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,590
We should head to the Obsidian Riverhead first.

195
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,750
Level the Taoist clans and cross the Obsidian River!

196
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,960
Level the Taoist clans and cross the Obsidian River!

197
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,590
Don't go!

198
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,800
No!

199
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,630
No, don't!

200
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,200
Mr. Yan,

201
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,800
you've been doing this for days now.

202
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,870
You knew it would be useless.

203
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,560
That's right.

204
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,590
They're under Changlan's Visual Spell.

205
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,960
None of them could hear what you said.

206
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,870
I should've known

207
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,560
that was what he meant.

208
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,830
Had I known he'd implicate me...

209
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
From now on,

210
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,200
I forbid you to speak!

211
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,710
This is the rule I just set.

212
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,200
I...

213
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,280
Now, only Zhuli

214
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,350
and I

215
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,920
are not under Changlan's Visual Spell.

216
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,350
As for the rest,

217
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,440
you should stop wasting time on them.

218
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Even if no one believes me

219
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,080
or listens to me,

220
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,040
I still have to continue

221
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,990
spreading this news.

222
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,399
If the last person

223
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,510
becomes silent too,

224
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,080
the lies will become the truth.

225
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,750
Even if I die,

226
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,200
I won't be able to face

227
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,200
our ancestors.

228
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,230
Mr. Yan...

229
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,510
I believe you.

230
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,590
-You believed me? -Second Uncle...

231
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,680
I'll make sure Changlan pays

232
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,470
for his evil deeds in Qingqiu one day.

233
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,750
You finally look like

234
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,990
someone who'll inherit the throne.

235
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,920
Enough talking. Help him up.

236
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
We must leave now.

237
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,920
Let's go.

238
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,590
But they're...

239
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,080
Come on.

240
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,960
Tianyao, can you feel it?

241
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,400
For some reason,

242
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,400
there is a bit of a dark aura in Qingqiu's air.

243
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,200
Over here.

244
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,200
What did you find?

245
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,750
Look.

246
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
It's the Flower Bulletin's mark.

247
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,440
Your Majesty,

248
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll look around the area first.

249
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,630
If there is any news,

250
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,520
I'll contact you through the Nine Jade String.

251
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
Be prudent in everything you do.

252
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,800
I'll see you later.

253
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,160
-Mr. Yan. -Mr. Yan.

254
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,510
They might be created

255
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,990
by Changlan's Visual Spell.

256
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,560
We mustn't trust them.

257
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
It's me, Yanhui.

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,680
Huan Xiaoyan.

259
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,350
See the mark of the Phantom Clan?

260
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,800
Xiaoyan.

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,470
It's the Phantom Clan's mark. It's truly you.

262
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,040
Mr. Yan, it's us.

263
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,960
Yes, Mr. Yan.

264
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm Chenyi.

265
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,510
Father.

266
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,800
Father!

267
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm glad you're all right.

268
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,799
Do you recognize me?

269
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,630
Zhuli?

270
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,990
It's been more than ten years.

271
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,320
You're all grown up now.

272
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,960
Heaven blesses Qingqiu.

273
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,440
As your loyal servant,

274
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,750
I humbly welcome Your Majesty.

275
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,510
Mr. Yan, drop the formalities.

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,350
I have done wrong.

277
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,870
I have misjudged people.

278
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,590
I was used by Changlan

279
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,960
to assist his tyranny.

280
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,590
I even wrongfully accused the Dragon King and Miss Yan

281
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,920
and almost committed a grave mistake.

282
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,830
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

283
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,590
I only hope that the Dragon King

284
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,710
shows mercy on the innocent people of Qingqiu

285
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,200
and does not blame them.

286
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,040
No need to apologize.

287
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,990
It was not your fault.

288
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,830
Yes, it was not your fault.

289
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,920
If we are to hold someone accountable,

290
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,280
it's all Changlan's fault.

291
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,040
You're right.

292
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,440
We shouldn't have released him

293
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,080
from the dungeon. We really shouldn't have done that.

294
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,110
Your rules in Qingqiu

295
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,510
are fundamentally wrong.

296
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,200
I agree.

297
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,080
Actually, it has always been

298
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Qingqiu's fault.

299
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,750
Your ring...

300
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,710
You're the newly appointed Phantom King.

301
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,040
I'm Huan Xiaoyan.

302
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,960
Changlan of Qingqiu

303
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,560
is my enemy who annihilated my clan.

304
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm here to seek revenge on him.

305
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,279
(Cross the Obsidian River and level the Taoist clans!)

306
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,510
This is not the place to talk.

307
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,400
Let's leave first.

308
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,710
(Level the Taoist clans!)

309
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,870
Everyone, follow me

310
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,960
to my Phantom Ring.

311
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,470
Let's go.

312
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,350
(Level the Taoist clans!)

313
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,280
(Cross the Obsidian River and level the Taoist clans!)

314
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,440
Qian...

315
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,440
Where have you been recently?

316
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,920
After our last conversation,

317
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,960
I haven't received

318
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,990
any news from you.

319
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,080
Are you okay?

320
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm fine.

321
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,080
It's just

322
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,320
that the Flower Medallion was damaged during the chaos.

323
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,870
So I couldn't contact you right away.

324
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm glad you're all right.

325
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,830
We've brought

326
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,870
the Leader back.

327
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,750
The matter regarding Yanhui's life and death

328
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,990
has been resolved.

329
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,870
But the situation on my side

330
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
is not as optimistic.

331
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,510
Lingfei has returned to the Taoist clan

332
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,350
and is spreading the news

333
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,560
that Changlan used the peace talks as a cover to carry out assassinations.

334
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,160
And that he views peace between the two factions as meaningless.

335
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,230
All the Taoist clans

336
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,510
are restless

337
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,440
and have sent disciples

338
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,590
to gather at the Obsidian River.

339
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,080
This is exactly what Changlan wants.

340
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,440
As soon as both armies arrive

341
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
at the banks of the Obsidian River,

342
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,230
the great battle between the Taoist clans and Spirit clans will begin.

343
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,560
So it seems

344
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,280
that Changlan deliberately provoked the war

345
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,510
to release

346
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,110
the Lord of Dark Aura.

347
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,560
Did he also annihilate my entire clan

348
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,200
to help that Dark Phantom?

349
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,400
Yes.

350
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,710
Bai Xiaosheng has gone

351
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,919
to cut off their way of communication.

352
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,400
We need

353
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,560
to hurry back to the Royal Palace of Qingqiu

354
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,400
to stop Changlan.

355
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,590
But now, the army has already gone to Obsidian River.

356
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,110
Your Majesty.

357
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,920
Xiange,

358
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,440
have you found Feng Qianshuo?

359
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,870
It's rare

360
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,400
for you to be concerned about my safety.

361
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
How's the situation with the Taoist clans?

362
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
All the Taoist clans have united

363
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,200
and gathered at Obsidian River.

364
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,830
It seems that war is inevitable.

365
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,230
I request to go

366
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,560
to the Obsidian River to stop the war.

367
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,960
How can you fight off

368
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,470
thousands of soldiers by yourself?

369
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,350
Don't worry.

370
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,080
We have come up with a plan.

371
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,160
Qianshuo and I

372
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,080
will burn down the Ganhong Bamboo Grove

373
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,230
on both sides of the Obsidian River,

374
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,320
which will delay the start of the war.

375
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,030
Go, then.

376
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

377
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,920
This way, we'll have time

378
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:12,990
to hurry back to the palace.

379
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,640
However, the Qingqiu people are now

380
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,400
under Changlan's Visual Spell.

381
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,680
He's using the power of the Dark Phantom

382
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,750
to cast this spell.

383
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,880
The longer it lasts,

384
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,310
the more dangerous it'll be for the Qingqiu people.

385
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,360
I'll try to figure out

386
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,960
how to break his Visual Spell,

387
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,990
not only

388
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,440
to save the Qingqiu people

389
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,790
but also to act as a decoy.

390
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,750
I'll stay here to buy some time

391
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,880
and attract Changlan's attention

392
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,070
to distract him.

393
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,880
Your Majesty,

394
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm sure Changlan has been plotting this

395
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,990
for many years.

396
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,750
He has controlled so many people with the Visual Spell.

397
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,440
If you try to remove the spell

398
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,550
within a short time...

399
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,680
Say no more.

400
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,470
I have to do what needs to be done.

401
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,270
I'll leave it to you, Your Majesty.

402
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm the Leader of Qingqiu

403
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,400
and also Changlan's elder brother.

404
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,750
By right,

405
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,440
it's my obligation to do this.

406
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,790
Father,

407
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,230
I'm willing to stay and protect your formation.

408
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll also stay

409
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,459
to protect Your Majesty's formation.

410
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,220
Please rise.

411
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,020
In the palace,

412
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,740
Changlan will not wait idly.

413
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,580
Perhaps he has set traps everywhere.

414
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,220
We need to think of a plan quickly.

415
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,260
While you were away,

416
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,540
I've been hiding in the ring

417
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,780
and made a thorough observation.

418
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
I noticed that Changlan's Visual Spell

419
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,340
and the illusion technique of the Phantom Clan

420
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,820
come from the same origin and source.

421
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,820
I believe

422
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,420
that he acquired this skill

423
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,780
by seizing the Phantom Clan's power.

424
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,260
Since it's a power of the Phantom Clan,

425
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,340
I can use my Phantom Ring,

426
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,660
which has been passed down through generations

427
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,060
of the Phantom Clan,

428
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,340
to control him.

429
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,540
Once I put the Phantom Ring

430
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,780
on his finger,

431
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,740
I can activate the power of Phantom Clan

432
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,260
and deprive him

433
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,300
of his Visual Spell power.

434
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,980
But he's so cunning.

435
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,460
He wouldn't sit still

436
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,980
and let you put the ring on him.

437
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,020
In my opinion,

438
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,580
we should use his own tactics

439
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,580
against him.

440
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,420
The purple aura has dispersed.

441
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,780
Level the Taoist clans and cross the Obsidian River!

442
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,300
Level the Taoist clans!

443
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,220
What is this place?

444
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,060
What are we doing here?

445
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,020
How did we get here?

446
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,460
What's going on?

447
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,460
Your Majesty's technique is truly effective.

448
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,380
It can dispel

449
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,060
the Visual Spell on them.

450
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,980
But this is just the beginning.

451
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,180
Father's spell

452
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,660
must cover the entire Qingqiu.

453
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,220
You've come back just in time.

454
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,460
Only one of us can stay

455
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,220
in this vast Qingqiu.

456
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,660
Have they discovered us?

457
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,140
Protect the Leader!

458
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,300
I never thought

459
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,420
there would be a day

460
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,900
when we have to fight.

461
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,500
Do you think you can defeat me?

462
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,740
Yes, I can.

463
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,220
Now,

464
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,940
I can wield

465
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,180
your Flaming Dragon Fang, right?

466
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,300
I'll pretend to be Tianyao

467
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,140
and attack from the front gate of the main hall of Qingqiu

468
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,820
to distract Changlan and the others.

469
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,100
Tianyao will pretend to be me

470
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,340
and take the chance to get closer to Changlan.

471
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,420
Changlan will be less alert to me

472
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
than to Tianyao.

473
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,900
Tianyao can then take the opportunity

474
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,580
to subdue him.

475
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,020
It sounds like a great idea.

476
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,980
But you and Tianyao

477
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,220
don't look similar.

478
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,380
Changlan isn't a fool.

479
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,980
Surely he can tell that you were pretending

480
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,900
to be each other.

481
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,100
We didn't encounter

482
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,620
any other dark practitioners on our way back to the city.

483
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,220
Bai Xiaosheng must have cut off

484
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,620
the communication method between Changlan and Dark Phantom.

485
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,220
Changlan doesn't know

486
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,900
the Heart Protecting Scale

487
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,140
is in my body now.

488
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,220
He won't be able to distinguish

489
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,060
between the two of us just by our auras alone.

490
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,940
Besides,

491
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,580
have you forgotten that we have someone

492
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,820
who can use the illusion technique?

493
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,940
I can hide inside

494
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,100
the Phantom Ring

495
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,779
and disguise your appearances with my illusion technique.

496
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,460
That's right.

497
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,140
I'll pretend to be Tianyao

498
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,180
to distract Changlan.

499
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,540
Tianyao will carry Scentless Twig

500
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,820
and get closer to Changlan when the opportunity arises.

501
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,220
We also have the Leader of Qingqiu here

502
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:24,547
who can disrupt Changlan's Visual Spell.

503
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,700
With all three plans combined, we'll distract him.

504
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,700
(When Tianyao approaches Changlan)

505
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,100
(and subdues him, )

506
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,560
Huan Xiaoyan,

507
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,020
(you'll take that chance and put the ring on Changlan's finger)

508
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,060
(and start using your illusion technique.)

509
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:36,340
Rainbow illusion, boundless and infinite.

510
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:36,780
Seize!

511
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,380
Break his Visual Spell completely.

512
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,180
Your Majesty, they've succeeded.

513
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,180
The nature of the world dispels all impurities,

514
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,940
energy and spirits gather now.

515
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,820
Clear!

516
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,380
He wants to cut off his arm to survive!

517
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,260
Changlan,

518
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,820
it's over now.

519
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,220
The winner takes it all.

520
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,780
You can kill me if you want.

521
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,620
It's not my place

522
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,900
to punish you.

523
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,980
You're here.

524
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,060
It was also here

525
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,060
that we first met each other.

526
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,380
At that time,

527
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,580
you let me leave. You released me.

528
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,460
Do you regret it, Chenyi?

529
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,540
I've never regretted letting you go.

530
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,820
Even if I imprisoned you for more than ten years?

531
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Yes, even if you do that.

532
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,500
If I were given another chance,

533
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,900
I'd never

534
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,100
let you leave Qingqiu.

535
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,660
I'd never

536
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,820
let Dark Phantom take advantage of you.

537
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,900
Take advantage of me?

538
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,020
You got it wrong.

539
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,860
Dark Phantom and I

540
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,180
are only taking what we need.

541
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,620
When I left Qingqiu,

542
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,140
I didn't hate you

543
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,260
or Qingqiu.

544
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,380
But I would occasionally think about this.

545
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,940
We were born

546
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,740
to the same parents.

547
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,900
But why am I being given

548
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,300
such treatment?

549
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,060
I wanted to let go of my grievances

550
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,220
and find a place

551
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,940
where my heart could be more peaceful.

552
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,060
I went to the Dragon Valley.

553
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,340
(At that time, I thought)

554
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,620
(that the Spirit Dragon would create)

555
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,260
(a utopia of peace and happiness for everyone.)

556
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,900
(But he was too gentle)

557
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,220
(and gullible, )

558
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,020
which brought disaster to the Dragon Valley.

559
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,740
Even now,

560
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,460
he's still the same.

561
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,140
Even if he has the power to shake the heavens,

562
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,660
he is always worried.

563
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,020
He won't be able to achieve anything with this mentality.

564
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,500
Then Tianyao was sealed.

565
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,580
I suddenly realized

566
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,380
that kindness and goodness

567
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,940
cannot bring about peace.

568
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,180
Only absolute power

569
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,780
can bring about absolute obedience.

570
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,980
It's only under absolute obedience

571
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,300
can there be true peace!

572
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,260
A world built with such a foundation

573
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,260
will no longer need to choose

574
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,580
between sacrificing oneself or sacrificing others!

575
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,780
The rules of the Qingqiu twins

576
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,780
were abolished

577
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,340
way before

578
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,340
I let you leave Qingqiu.

579
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,700
So explain to me where am I now.

580
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,100
The palace

581
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
that you could easily obtain

582
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,180
from the moment of your birth.

583
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,740
No! It's a dungeon

584
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,380
where I grew up!

585
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
I have touched

586
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,900
every seam here

587
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,260
with my fingers.

588
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,500
To me,

589
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,180
this is

590
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,340
where I lived,

591
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,580
and this is where I'll die too.

592
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,220
I never thought

593
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,500
of taking your life.

594
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,460
What else can you do?

595
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,700
Release me

596
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,780
or imprison me here

597
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,180
for eternity?

598
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,460
That won't be necessary.

599
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,220
Changlan.

600
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,580
Chenyi,

601
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,340
it's okay.

602
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,660
We

603
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Will meet again

604
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,620
in another world.

605
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,460
Take care.

606
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,340
Changlan!

607
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,980
Where's His Majesty?

608
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
My father went to visit Changlan

609
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,420
in the dungeon.

610
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,660
I wanted to join him.

611
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,820
But my father didn't let me.

612
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,660
My father

613
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,860
exhausted all his cultivation

614
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,180
to break Changlan's Visual Spell

615
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,660
and save the people of Qingqiu.

616
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,300
What if Changlan tries to do something funny?

617
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,260
Don't worry. That won't happen.

618
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,700
I have already taken back all

619
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,020
of Changlan's powers

620
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,900
with my Phantom Ring.

621
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,780
Now,

622
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,820
he can't do anything.

623
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,460
I have taken back all the power

624
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,020
of my clansmen today.

625
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,700
My departed clansmen,

626
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,940
you can finally rest in peace now.

627
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:06,953
(Triumph over evil) Mr. Feng,

628
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,900
the boat to Ganhong Bamboo Grove

629
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,020
is ready.

630
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,900
That's no longer necessary.

631
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,540
His Majesty's decree.

632
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,180
It's Nine Jade String.

633
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,220
She's His Majesty's adopted daughter.

634
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,500
All the Qingqiu troops shall stop advancing

635
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,540
and camp where you are. The order must be obeyed.

636
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,380
-Yes, Miss Xiange! -Yes, Miss Xiange!

637
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,140
(Qingqiu has finally been pacified.)

638
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,100
(I hope it's the same with the Taoist clans.)

639
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,100
The bamboo rafts have been prepared for you.

640
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,620
Why are you not moving forward?

641
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,100
Why aren't you attacking Qingqiu?

642
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,980
Xifeng, did you lead them

643
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,500
to disobey orders?

644
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,380
Martial Aunt,

645
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,140
there has been a disturbance in Qingqiu today.

646
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,180
Elders from all sects have ordered not to act rashly.

647
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,180
I believe our Chenxing Mountain...

648
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,580
I'm the elder of Chenxing Mountain.

649
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,060
If you don't obey my orders,

650
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,300
what use are you to me?

651
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,460
Martial Aunt,

652
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,100
news of the Qingqiu disturbance

653
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,460
has already arrived.

654
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,420
We should not cross

655
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,620
the Obsidian River rashly at the moment.

656
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,860
-Senior! -Senior!

657
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,580
Why did you injure my senior, Elder Lingfei?

658
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,100
I thought you forgot that I'm the sect's elder.

659
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,820
Everyone, cross the river immediately.

660
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,380
I'd like to see who dares to cross the Obsidian River!

661
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,940
Crossing the Obsidian River

662
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,459
is a matter of great importance.

663
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,740
Other Taoist elders

664
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,100
have retreated and sought peace

665
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,820
after seeing the disturbance in Qingqiu.

666
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,780
They are extremely unwilling to provoke a war between the two realms again.

667
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,980
Martial Aunt,

668
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,460
if you have even half

669
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,100
of the compassion of a cultivator,

670
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,140
you should not be acting like this at this time,

671
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,900
going against everyone's wishes!

672
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,300
You...

673
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,380
Disciples of Chenxing Mountain, heed my orders!

674
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,460
No one is allowed to cross the river!

675
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,660
If there's any objection,

676
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,780
we shall wait for my master,

677
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,980
Master Lingxiao, to return

678
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,380
and make the final decision.

679
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,660
If there are any rewards or punishments to be given,

680
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,580
I, Zichen, will take full responsibility.

681
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,420
-Yes, Senior. -Yes, Senior.

682
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,740
Go back!

683
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,260
You...

684
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,020
Let's go.

685
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,820
All of you...

686
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,740
Zichen, let's go back too.

687
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,940
Martial Aunt,

688
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,540
I know you've suffered

689
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,740
some grievances in Qingqiu,

690
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,780
but the war between the two realms is of great importance.

691
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,860
I'm sorry,

692
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,300
but I can't let the disciples of Chenxing Mountain

693
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,660
go to help you avenge

694
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,740
your personal grudges.

695
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,500
Zichen.

696
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,340
Walk slowly.

697
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,980
One day,

698
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,260
I'll make sure the Spirit Clans perish

699
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,140
without a burial ground.

700
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,020
Changlan once told me

701
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,540
that the law of the jungle

702
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,420
is the world's biggest rule.

703
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,340
-That's right. -He's right.

704
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,660
But it's not!

705
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,580
Triumph over evil

706
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,660
is the biggest rule in this world.

707
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,220
That's right!

708
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,020
Triumph over evil!

709
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,460
-Triumph over evil! -Triumph over evil!

710
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,580
-Triumph over evil! -Triumph over evil!

711
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:07,740
Now that Changlan has been captured

712
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,780
and the Leader has returned to Qingqiu,

713
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,020
it's a great fortune to the world!

714
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,020
But we've made mistakes too.

715
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,140
Mistakes?

716
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,740
Do you think there are medicinal herbs

717
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,700
that can help me treat my baldness?

718
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
Dragon King and Miss Yan

719
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,940
are innocent.

720
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,260
I even threw rotten eggs at them.

721
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,340
We have misunderstood them.

722
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,740
Will these people still throw things at me?

723
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,540
We were really wrong.

724
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Absolutely wrong.

725
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,460
You're right.

726
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,620
Dragon King and Miss Yan are here.

727
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,580
-Miss Yan. Miss Yan. -Miss Yan.

728
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,060
Today

729
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,900
is a rare opportunity.

730
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,460
We must apologize

731
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,780
to Dragon King and Miss Yan

732
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,780
sincerely.

733
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,140
Of course!

734
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,660
No need, no need.

735
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
You don't have to.

736
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
No need to apologize.

737
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,540
Please get up.

738
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,420
Get up.

739
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,100
Our previous actions

740
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,779
were due to our foolishness.

741
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,380
Everyone, please get up.

742
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:58,820
Stop talking.

743
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,340
We hope that Dragon King and Miss Yan can forgive us.

744
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,020
You don't have to do this.

745
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,260
Get up now.

746
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,500
You really don't have to apologize.

747
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,420
You don't have to go this far.

748
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,380
Stand up now.

749
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,820
Please get up.

750
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,620
You really don't have to apologize to me.

751
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,740
Get up now.

752
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,780
What are you doing?

753
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
It's very smooth.

754
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,820
We are sorry, Miss Yan.

755
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,380
Everyone! Look!

756
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,620
Miss Yan is going bald!

757
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,260
It's okay.

758
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,620
There really is a bald spot.

759
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
It's true.

760
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,100
Miss Yan is going bald

761
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,219
to save Qingqiu!

762
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,860
What a noble sacrifice

763
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
this is!

764
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,500
What an admirable spirit this is!

765
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,300
You better stop talking now!

766
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,580
A lady went bald for us!

767
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,180
Let's go now.

768
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,060
As the people of Qingqiu,

769
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,500
we will always remember Miss Yan!

770
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,420
Let's go.

771
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,100
Remember Miss Yan's kindness and the fact

772
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,420
that she's gone bald for us!

773
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,700
I'm too embarrassed to show myself in public now.

774
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,620
I can't stay in Qingqiu anymore.

775
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,500
Everyone has seen

776
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,540
my bald head.

777
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,180
Can you still breathe?

778
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,220
You'll feel suffocated.

779
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,460
Enough already.

780
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,060
Can you hear it?

781
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
Hear what?

782
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Every breeze in Qingqiu

783
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,940
is clearly saying

784
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,900
that I am bald.

785
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,019
Hair will grow back eventually,

786
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,300
and it's just a small patch.

787
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:25,900
-Stop talking about it. -Let me have a look.

788
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,700
Show it to me.

789
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,300
You still have this tiara.

790
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,540
Don't touch it.

791
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,220
It'll fall off with a gust of wind.

792
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,740
This tiara is just an optical illusion.

793
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,660
It's useless.

794
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,340
Ah, an optical illusion.

795
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,020
How can I forget about Bai Xiaosheng?

796
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,860
I should ask him to cast some shadow

797
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,780
on my head.

798
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,380
That's a lot better than a tiara

799
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,580
or a head scarf.

800
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,020
It sure is a good idea.

801
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,620
But

802
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:51,820
it's been a while

803
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,620
since we've taken care of Changlan.

804
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,540
Why is Bai Xiaosheng not here yet?

805
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,620
Don't tell me he decided to go head-to-head

806
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
with Dark Phantom.

807
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,540
Don't worry.

808
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,980
I've sent someone to inquire

809
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,500
about Lingxiao and Bai Xiaosheng.

810
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,540
You should stop overthinking

811
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,460
about your hair.

812
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,220
Just get some rest. I have to go now.

813
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,500
What do I do now?

814
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,700
Miss Yan.

815
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,220
Physician Pufang,

816
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,900
I'm not sick.

817
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,660
What medicinal decoction did you make?

818
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,740
It's not medicine but tonic.

819
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,820
Tonic?

820
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020
It contains black sesame,

821
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,620
Chinese knotweed, Euryale seeds, and lotus stamen.

822
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,060
They are the best nutrients for your hair.

823
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,500
I've finished it.

824
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,660
When will my hair grow back?

825
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,460
Don't worry.

826
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,300
There is no illness or ailment

827
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,380
that I can't cure.

828
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,140
It's just losing a few strands of hair,

829
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,580
not losing one's life.

830
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,100
Physician Pufang,

831
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,580
are you thinking about Changlan again?

832
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,620
I have been by Changlan's side

833
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,300
for the longest time.

834
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,540
But I never realized he was the visual spell master

835
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,740
or that he had done

836
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,420
so many things

837
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,620
that harmed others.

838
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,340
Fortunately,

839
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,460
it hasn't come to

840
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,460
the worst possible outcome.

841
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,500
His Majesty

842
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,740
has returned alive too,

843
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,020
and there's no war

844
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,980
between Qingqiu and the Taoist clans.

845
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,220
Tianyao and I have also reconciled

846
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,060
because of this incident.

847
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,820
This is the best thing that has happened so far.

848
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,500
The Taoist clans and the Spirit Clans are incompatible like fire and water.

849
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,180
I'm so envious

850
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,100
that you and Dragon King can be together.

851
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,220
Could it be

852
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,540
that the person you fancy

853
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,860
is from Chenxing Mountain?

854
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,580
Stop talking nonsense.

855
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,860
I don't fancy anyone.

856
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,900
Zichen?

857
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,700
Zilian? Zifeng?

858
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,260
Don't push me.

859
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,180
I can recite

860
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,620
all the names of Chenxing Mountain's male disciples

861
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,340
in one go.

862
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,020
Fine. I'll tell you.

863
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,700
He is from Chenxing Mountain.

864
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,300
His name is Xifeng.

865
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,340
Oh, I know!

866
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,100
The disciple from a family of apothecaries.

867
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,460
Yes, it's him.

868
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,180
Success!

869
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,140
From now on, the dark aura in this world

870
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
will no longer be able to enter or leave

871
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,380
Dark Phantom's main hall.

872
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,420
Without this source of power,

873
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,660
the Lord of Dark Aura

874
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,180
is just a caged bird.

875
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,980
It's been a long time since I last saw Yanhui.

876
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,420
I should go and visit her.

877
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,660
Dark Phantom?

878
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,980
How could it be possible?

879
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:47,340
(Master Lingxiao of Chenxing Mountain)
