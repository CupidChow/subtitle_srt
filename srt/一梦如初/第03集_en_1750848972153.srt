1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmother

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Madam, it's my sister!

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Go away!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is my second daughter of the Wen family.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Grandmother of the Su family is her biological sister.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll see who dares to do it!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The Wen family has been confiscated.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,500
How can you call her your second daughter?

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Madam is pregnant now.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
If you're too impulsive,

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
you'll be beaten to death!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Go away!

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Madam!

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a begger!

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Go away!

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll kill you if you dare to touch my second daughter!

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll kill you if you dare to touch my second daughter!

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Go away!

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,000
You'll see!

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,500
You'll be beaten to death!

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Madam!

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
I'm a begger!

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Madam!

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm a begger!

26
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Shut up!

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Madam!

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Madam!

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Tell your master

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that he's a begger

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,500
and will be beaten to death!

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Open the door!

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is there anyone?

34
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Open the door!

35
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Is there anyone to save my second daughter?

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
I know that the Yu family is only to win the treasure.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,500
But I can't forget my kindness.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The Wen family never treats me as a servant.

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
The eldest son is even grateful to me for saving his life.

40
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I must protect my second daughter.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you for saving me, Brother.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Miss, don't be so polite.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's my pleasure.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I saw that you all got wet and fried some medicine.

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Drink it while it's hot.

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
Did you encounter any trouble?

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
To be honest,

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
the house was hit by a tornado.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
We couldn't find any relatives who ran away.

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Now,

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
we can't find anyone to save us.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm afraid that

53
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
the people who ran away

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
will be in danger.

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Now,

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
we are just friends.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
If you can't find a place to go,

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
my house is just empty.

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
You can just stay here and stay under the tree.

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
If that's the case,

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll rent this house to you.

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
We'll talk about it later.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We should take care of each other in the comments.

64
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
It's getting late.

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Take your medicine and rest early.

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Mother.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Qiu Niang.

68
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sister An Nian.

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
An Nian doesn't want me.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I want my father.

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
I want my mother.

73
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Don't cry, Qiu Niang.

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
We have a place to go now.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Everything will be fine.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Everything will be fine.

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Everything will be fine.

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I don't want it.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want my mother.

80
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,000
I want my brother.

81
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,000
I want to go home.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't cry, Qiu Niang.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Qiu Niang.

84
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Qiu Niang.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Look, Qiu Niang.

86
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Look at this.

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Look.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
People's lives

89
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
are like the glass tiles.

90
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
They are placed in the dark.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's dark and dark.

92
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
No one cares.

93
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
They are placed in a place with light.

94
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
They can shine the bright light.

95
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
If there's no light,

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
we have to light ourselves.

97
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
We can shine the light.

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
The light is on.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The road is easy.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
People

101
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
have to move forward.

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
It's a little bit hard now.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
But I promised my wife to protect you.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I won't leave you behind.

105
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I'll be with you.

106
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll treat you as a pearl.

107
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
My name is Baoyin.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can call me Baozhu.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
I'll listen to you.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't get used to it.

111
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn't bring your personal clothes.

112
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I made a pillow for you with my old clothes.

113
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
They are all your regular clothes.

114
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
You sleep first.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll be here to guard you.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Baozhu, go to sleep.

117
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
I'll be here to guard you.

118
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
People

119
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
have no hard work.

120
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
As long as we are alive,

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
there will always be hope.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wen family is down.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,500
I have to take good care of Baozhu.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm strong.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm not afraid of hardship.

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,000
I've learned a few words in Wen family.

127
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I also learned to do math.

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
I made a trick.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I made a business of selling small dishes on the river.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's enough for us to eat and wear warm clothes.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Today, I'll buy two small dishes and send one to you.

132
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,000
You can save two dollars if you buy ten dishes.

133
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Don't miss a good opportunity.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Save two dollars if you buy ten dishes.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Come, come.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Take it.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We are here to buy, take it,

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,500
and come back home without empty hands.

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Our small dishes...

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't expect that the village leader

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
moved away overnight.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He is really a man of the village.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm afraid I'll be implicated.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I heard that

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the Wen family was not executed for the crime.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They were just locked in the prison.

147
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
Locked in the prison?

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Who told you about this?

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait a minute.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Excuse me.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,500
Where is the Wen family locked up?

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
Anjie, I'm afraid.

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,000
Sir, let me out.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't be afraid.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Be good.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let me out.

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sir, let me out.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Zhu, don't be afraid.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm here.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Anjie, I'm afraid.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Sir, let me out.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Zhu, don't be afraid.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm here.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hurry up.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Put it on your body.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Qiongniang?

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Qiongniang?

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's Qiongniang.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Qiongniang.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mother, father.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Qiongniang.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My dear.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Qiongniang.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Good girl.

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Mother, she is my sister.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Anjie, I'm not Qiongniang now.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm Baozhu.

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Baozhu.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Madam, please forgive me.

180
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I dare not to let you know my real identity.

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm afraid that some officials will come.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can only let them follow me.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I gave her a name of Baozhu.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Get up.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Master, why are you only blaming me?

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The Wen family is guilty of all crimes.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Only Qiongniang is the only one.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If it weren't for you,

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
she wouldn't be standing here alive today.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm grateful that you're here.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why are you so upset?

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a sunny day in Wen's Mansion.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're the daughter of the Wen family.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't want to be a daughter.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Master and Madam are in the mansion.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They treat us as family.

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's a great favor to me and my husband.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I just want to protect my family.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll take it as a favor.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Where's Elder Brother?

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why isn't Elder Brother here?

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I heard that he went to the academy to get someone.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But I don't know where he is.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I feel sorry for Su.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know if he's alive or dead.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're scared?

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Sister said that people have to suffer.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
As long as they live, they'll have hope.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Our family will be reunited.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hurry up.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's time.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Master, Madam, please forgive me.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll definitely protect Second Young Mistress.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hurry up.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mother.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Mother.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mother.

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Please.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Mother.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Mother.

221
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Please.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mother.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Please don't go.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Thank you.

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Good.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sister, it's the last day of the festival.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Life is so confusing.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wonder if it's the last day of the festival.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Sister, there are so many lanterns here.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Many people are making wishes.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Look.

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I hope that my benefactor,

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Mr. Wen, will be safe and sound.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I hope that he will be safe and sound.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I hope that the Wen family will be reunited soon.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Sister, it's so lively over there.

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's go and have a look.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Good.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Good.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Good.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Good.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
First Young Mistress is here.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
She is the daughter that the late emperor loved the most.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I heard that she has half a tiger's tally

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and she only grows in the wind and earth.

248
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Even the officials are afraid of her.

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This garden is so beautiful.

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go.

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
First Young Mistress is used to talking about the mystery.

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This is the biggest art form in the whole Bianyang.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I heard that the first Young Mistress's husband

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
has a foreign background.

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They sent her to smoke her husband.

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No wonder.

257
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She has so many young and beautiful face.

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
As long as she can fall in love with the man,

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
no one can escape.

260
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Sister, who is the man beside the princess?

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Brother.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's me, Brother.

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm here.

264
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm here.

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm here.

266
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm here.

267
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm here.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm here.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm here.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm here.

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm here.

272
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm here.

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm here.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm here.

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm here.

276
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm here.

277
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm here.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm here.

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm here.

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm here.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm here.

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm here.

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm here.

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm here.

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm here.

286
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm here.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm here.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm here.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm here.

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm here.

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm here.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Every rain and wind

293
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
is like a dream.

294
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My heart is like a mountain.

295
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm going to travel around the world.

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll never forget our first meeting.

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Every rain and wind

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is like a witness.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not loyal to you.

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We're separated by the sea.

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I've held your hands.

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I want nothing more than you.

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Every rain and wind

304
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is like a witness.

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm not loyal to you.

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We're separated by the sea.

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I've held your hands.

308
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I want nothing more than you.

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Every rain and wind

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
is like a dream.
