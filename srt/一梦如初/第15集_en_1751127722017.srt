1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Mother, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I couldn't send you the porridge.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I could only make up for your funeral.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mother, I'm doing well.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Life is full of difficulties.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Most of the time, it's not what you want.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't be blamed.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't be blamed.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In this life,

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
if we don't work together,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we can't grow up there.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We can only work hard to grow up there.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let me go!

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let me go!

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let me go!

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let me go!

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You scumbag!

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who told you to rot here?

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're not a man!

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're a man!

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're a man who's suffering!

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You even taught me this!

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You want to curse your father, don't you?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll beat you to death!

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're a loser!

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't remember the day you pushed me out to be a prostitute?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If I'm alive for a day,

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
your son will beat me to death!

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
As long as you're alive,

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you can always bite me.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is that what you think?

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll teach you a lesson!

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Who do you think you are?

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're a woman!

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A woman?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What's wrong with a woman?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Our woman is also a woman!

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it only because a woman is born

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to be treated so unfairly?

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's ridiculous!

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have to tell the world that

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
from now on, there is no such possibility!

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I can leave this village with my ability.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can let everyone know with my ability in the future!

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Our woman can't rely on anyone

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to be able to do it on her own!

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
She can also be able to be strong!

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Fatty!

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Throw them into the coffin!

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Fatty!

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're talking nonsense!

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sister!

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sister!

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sister!

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're such a big fool!

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let me go!

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sister!

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sister!

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sister!

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Since ancient times,

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the first thing to do is to be filial.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But we have to see

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
what kind of father and brother

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
will do to our lives.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me out!

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let me out!

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Stay inside for a few hours

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and let your mother die with you.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let her be quiet.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let me out!

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let me out!

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The real smile is the destiny

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that broke the family's cycle.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's to make the parents' shortcomings

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and the forefathers' shortcomings

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
not repeat themselves.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The whole family's evil cause

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
is going to be on me.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let it not repeat itself.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the real smile.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Please tell the school committee

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that I thank you for your help.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The school committee used to be

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the student of Master Wen.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please say hello to the school committee

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
for my master.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're welcome.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I added some gold flower to the porridge.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It can calm the spirit.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It will make you sleep more.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Before the Crown Prince comes back,

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I must leave here.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And when my brother comes back,

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
he will give me the power.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then everything will be settled.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know my true heart.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Your Highness, although this method is feasible,

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
but after people wake up,

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
they can only maintain a moment.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What will happen next?

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I...

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll let you do it.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll take care of it.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Your Highness,

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
this is the soup made by Chang Le Palace.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You've been working hard recently.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You need to take care of yourself.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your Highness,

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
if there's no accident,

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Go outside and wait.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
After the official wakes up,

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I need to know

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
where the imperial edict is.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It seems I need to know where the imperial edict is as soon as possible.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Your Highness,

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your Highness,

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your Highness,

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Your Highness,

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Your Highness,

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your Highness,

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your Highness,

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
the official will wake up in less than a moment.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did you hear that?

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The official family has collapsed.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is this reliable?

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How did I hear that the Crown Prince had returned to the capital?

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How did I hear that the Crown Prince had returned to the capital?

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What you said is wrong.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What I heard is that

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the Princess has killed the official's family in secret.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the Princess has killed the official's family in secret.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
At present, the capital

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is already under the control of the Princess.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The Princess?

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The one who likes blue?

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The one who likes blue?

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
Oh, he is in power.

151
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,960
It's really unfortunate.

152
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,600
It's not.

153
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,560
You know what?

154
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,840
The Princess Royal gave you all the face-to-face hands.

155
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,000
It's true.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Once a person has the power,

157
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
it's different.

158
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,480
Sirs,

159
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,960
do you know if Jin Zhong can enter or leave the palace?

160
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,000
I heard that the Princess Royal controlled the situation.

161
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
But she didn't say that Bicheng won't let her in.

162
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,040
Wushuang,

163
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,680
you are a young lady.

164
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
You have to go.

165
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,920
If you don't go,

166
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
when the Crown Prince comes back,

167
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
the two sides will fight.

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,160
You will be the one to be sent off.

169
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,560
I'm afraid you will be in danger.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,960
I've decided to go to the capital.

171
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
In the future,

172
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
don't worry about the Wen family.

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,160
Someone will take care of the family matters.

174
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,600
You have to make good plans

175
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
for yourself and your parents, right?

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Young lady,

177
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
who are you in the capital?

178
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,560
It's dangerous there.

179
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,000
You'd better not go.

180
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My benefactor is there.

182
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
When I'm in danger,

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,720
I'll go and have a look.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,720
Sir,

185
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,640
you saved me once.

186
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,680
This time,

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll return your half of my life.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,600
You and I

189
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,200
will never meet again.

190
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:17,640
A

191
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,720
date

192
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,320
for

193
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,560
her you

194
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,360
And

195
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The ball is here!

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go and have a look!

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The ball is here!

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The yellow sun is like a dream,

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the sorrow is like a bow.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The flowers are falling, the love is still there.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Meet each other,

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
the wind blows, the rain falls.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's a love dream.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In this moment,

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we'll be together in this world.

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The wind and rain are entangled,

207
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
our hearts are not moving.

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We look at each other,

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the love is still there.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We'll be together in this life,

211
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the light is still there.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Meet each other in this life,

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the rain and the wind.

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We'll be together in this life,

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the love is still there.

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We'll be together in this life,

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the years are passing by.

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We'll meet each other in this life,

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
like we first met in the beginning.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This life is like a dream,

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
every rain and wind

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
turn into a witness.

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We don't need to be focused on this love.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We'll be together in this life,

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the hands are already tied.

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
With you, I have nothing to ask for in this life.

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This life is like a dream,

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
every rain and wind

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
turn into a witness.

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We don't need to be focused on this love.

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We'll be together in this life,

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
the hands are already tied.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
With you, I have nothing to ask for in this life.

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This life is like a dream,

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
every rain and wind

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
turn into a witness.
