1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Take a look.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And these.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want them all.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, Mrs. Chen.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wait a moment.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You want all these?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How much money do you need?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You've made it famous

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
by coming to the capital.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Even the daughter of Minister Song's family

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
is going to invite you to the banquet.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's nothing.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm just here to spend money.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Uncle Song asked me to be his guest.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's hard to go empty-handed.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've asked around.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The banquet of Mrs. Song's family

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is top-class in the capital.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They go to all the different regions.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Does Mr. Wen

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
trust you to go alone?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You...

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What did you do for him?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Nothing.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Didn't someone say

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
that the Wen family's business

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is over?

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then how about the people?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are they still here?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm here to keep it.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As his sister,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have to see him

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
leave the house.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can go back to Qingzhou

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to take care of the business tomorrow.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't worry about me.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You think I'm a trouble.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't let Mr. Wen misunderstand.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't care what he thinks.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's so good.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's red.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please enjoy.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If you don't like it,

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mrs. Song.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Mrs. Chen, you're here.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm a little bit rude.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is my sister, Baozhu.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Greetings, Mrs. Song.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're the famous Princess Ying.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Long time no see.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Greetings, Princess Ying.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've heard about

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mrs. and Mr. Wen.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No wonder Mr. Wen

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
saved my life three times.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've been waiting for

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
such a wonderful person.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mr. Wen

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
has talked about marriage?

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Not only that.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The door of the Wen family

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is almost broken.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's just that it's all rejected.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Come on.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll introduce some people

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to you.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mr. Wen is here.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mr. Wen.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Wen.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Wen.

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Look at me.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Is it beautiful?

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is mine.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're looking for me?

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Look at this.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I know.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Mrs. Chen,

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've heard about you for a long time.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's really a great opportunity to meet you today.

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's this?

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Look.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is my new painting.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's so beautiful.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's better than the last time I saw it.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right?

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mrs. Chen.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's have a drink together.

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing here?

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't invite you.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You've been roaming around the capital these days.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm worried about your safety.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm fine.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I met a lot of guys.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Guys?

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
These are all mischievous kids.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They roam around in the city.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't be fooled.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I wonder whose door

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
has been broken.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know a few guys.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What kind of logic is this, Mr. Wen?

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're jealous.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If someone asks me for a marriage,

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll go.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've said it.

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What I want to get

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
is only you.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sister.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't listen to Uncle Song's nonsense.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Brother has never

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
fallen in love with any girl.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know what others don't know.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How can I not know?

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're not a girl.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm a girl.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm a girl.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a girl.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm a girl.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm a girl.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm a girl.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm a girl.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm a girl.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm a girl.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Brother has been waiting for you

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
for so many years.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He has suffered a lot.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Suffered?

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Him.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Wen.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why are you doing this?

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're having an affair with the saint.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You married the saint's sister

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and married the official's daughter.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Isn't it right?

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you bring Madam Baoyan back,

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that concubine

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
will be in trouble.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
torturing yourself here?

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I, Wen Wen,

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
will never take

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the marriage contract

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
of my marriage.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can only

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
take one.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This...

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Mr. Wen.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Mr. Wen.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mr. Wen.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Someone!

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Call the doctor!

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Call the doctor!

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That time,

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Brother almost died.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Father had someone

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to give him a coffin.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He had to wait for five days.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He saved the lives of thousands of people

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
from the official's death.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He was so brave.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Brother said

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
he wouldn't marry her

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
because he was afraid

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you would come back one day.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If he marries her,

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you will be disappointed.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or maybe Brother

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
really loves

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
his sister.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's obvious that he's willing to.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He's willing to.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's willing to.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's willing to.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's willing to.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's willing to.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So,

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
what he said is true.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He can really

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
protect everything

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and keep his promise.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you've made up your mind,

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll respect your decision.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just want you to know

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
that the one I want to marry

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is only you,

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Chen Baoyi,

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and the Wei family.

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Have you thought about it

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
these five years?

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I've said it.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The one I want to marry

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is only you.

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I've said it.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The one I want to marry

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
is only you.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Did I make a wrong decision

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
five years ago?

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I thought if I left,

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
she would marry the woman

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
who is her master's wife

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and help her stand firm in the court.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But I never thought

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
she would be so stubborn.

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Maybe I should have thought

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
it was her.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She doesn't need to rely on anyone

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to break through the barrier

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and be strong.

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The one who is really timid

216
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and makes mistakes is me.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Five years

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
can change a lot of things.

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not who I was.

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She relies on herself

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
to stand firm in the court.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If the heaven has a knife,

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
can it help lovers

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to make their dreams come true?

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll tell the first-class lord

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
my feelings.

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Brother.

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sister is missing.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She never leaves the mountain.

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Will something happen to her?

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Did you see her?

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She said she went to the backyard

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
to take a breath.

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I didn't see her.

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She's not here.

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If I go to find her again,

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll only see this.

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Lord Wen.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I found this at the door.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's for you.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Zhu.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Go to find the King of Ying with me.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You want to borrow the army?

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're crazy.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's a capital crime.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't care about the heaven.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Stop.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Stay away from the city.

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No one is allowed to leave the city.

251
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm Wen Su, the minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Get out of the city.

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Get out of the city.

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How could Lord Wen lead the army out of the city?

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Without the official's order,

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't let you go.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Get out of the way.

258
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let him go.

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Wen Su is in a hurry to leave the city.

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Report to the official.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is there anyone?

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Help me.

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Is there anyone?

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Help me.

266
