1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,960
regardless of the above

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,840
Your grace.

3
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,120
He said.

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,560
You are so devoted to the household.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,520
rut you Abbot is so trustworthy and enlarged and he is listen to his wife.

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,840
Baoyin.

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,560
Why are you still here?

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm the manager.

9
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm here for everyone.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,880
I heard it.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,440
The servants in the palace gave you a big reward.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
The Wen family is also common.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,480
Why are you still here?

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,040
Go to the capital early to clean up

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,320
and enjoy the wealth and glory.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
It's not a big deal.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,840
But I started this shop little by little.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,840
I can't just leave it alone.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,920
Baoyin.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,240
Did the Wen family do something bad to you?

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,800
The Wen family has always been nice to me.

22
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,040
It's just...

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,800
Sister.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,800
Sister.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,000
Sister.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,560
Go home and have a look.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,320
What's wrong, Baozhu? Why are you in a hurry?

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,320
It's Yu'niang.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,920
Yu'niang brought a young man from the Su family

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
to our house.

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,600
Mother asked me to call you back.

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
I don't know what I said to my parents.

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,400
I made my father so angry that he fainted.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,240
Lady He.

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
Look after the shop for me.

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,960
I'll go back.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,520
Okay.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
Don't worry.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,680
I'll go.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Who told you to enter my and sister's room?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
Come out!

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,760
Qiongniang.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm your sister.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,040
Why should I enter your room?

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
My name is Baozhu.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,520
Who are you, sister?

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,720
You don't care about your family.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,080
You've been ignoring me for a year.

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,520
What are you doing here now?

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,800
Qiongniang.

51
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,960
Sister had her reasons back then.

52
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,200
Qiongniang is so old.

53
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,720
She should be more sensible, right?

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,400
I don't care.

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
This is my sister's room.

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
Come out!

57
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,960
You...

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,640
Come out!

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Why are you so disobedient again?

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Let go.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
Let go!

62
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,120
You...

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,080
You...

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm the owner of this house.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,160
You can tell me if you need me.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Who are you?

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,840
How dare you act wild in my house?

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,880
Where are you from?

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,960
You even became the owner of my husband's nephew's house.

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
You're not afraid of being told off

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
by me.

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,120
First of all,

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't know any husband.

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,600
Secondly,

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
I rented this yard.

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
The seven-leaf tree is in the cabinet.

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
It's probably a demon.

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,440
It's only Chen for now.

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,600
Thirdly,

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
you came to my house tomorrow.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,440
Did you get my permission?

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
This is my house.

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,960
Master Wen and Madam Wen can prove it.

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,200
Okay.

85
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,640
I won't tell you anything.

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,600
Even if the Wen family lives in the same place as me,

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,040
whether it's a promotion or a fortune,

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
if your husband

89
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,760
is the eldest son of the Wen family,

90
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,920
shouldn't you go to the capital to find him

91
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,240
and force his parents to come here?

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,320
A man needs a face, a tree needs a skin.

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,760
Touch your own face.

94
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
See if there's a strong brick queen.

95
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,160
Who are you talking about?

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
You're the one who's talking.

97
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,760
You...

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,400
The child is ignorant.

99
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
He's growing up to be a bearded old man.

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,680
He's even throwing the soil into the roots.

101
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Why are you still ignorant?

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Shouldn't you be a fake sister?

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,120
I've heard of the hatred and revenge.

104
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
But I've never heard of the hatred and revenge.

105
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,720
If I were you,

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,400
I'd go home right now

107
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
and wait for Master Wen to forget about me

108
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,040
in the future.

109
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,240
Where are you from, wild girl?

110
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,360
You're so vicious.

111
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm the eldest son of the Master Wen.

112
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,080
You're a real old man.

113
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,480
You didn't care about the family

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,800
and chose the right person.

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,800
Now,

116
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,280
you're too ashamed to be an uncle.

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,160
You...

118
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,920
Father, mother.

119
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,720
Mother.

120
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,000
You must help me.

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
I told you to go home.

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,920
Why are you still here?

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Mother.

124
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,320
I'm your daughter.

125
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,320
Now that the eldest son is a master,

126
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,760
he can't turn a blind eye to others.

127
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,840
Besides,

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
you're now favored by the officials.

129
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a good thing that you're helping my husband

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
to get a position in the court.

131
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,560
You're pushing us around here.

132
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
You think we're just a family?

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,920
How dare you mention the eldest son?

134
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
He's not the same old man.

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
He's suffered a lot

136
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,400
and suffered a lot.

137
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,800
Do you think he's a good person?

138
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
Drink some medicine and wake up.

139
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,320
You...

140
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Look.

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
Look, everyone.

142
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,800
I found this

143
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,160
in his bag.

144
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,000
We call him the golden one.

145
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,120
But I'm a獅,

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,860
justしま

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,560
It's Citizen Wen's talent

148
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,560
that is wanted by your siblings

149
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,560
and it's intended to Somber legs,

150
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,000
but want to be the Head of the senators of the Si Vue Family.

151
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,680
Don't you你的臉

152
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,080
I did.

153
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,340
Your Majesty.

154
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,440
It's been a long time?

155
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,920
It's been a long time.

156
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,380
I could just...

157
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,540
Wiring down all the TCM's gaps all alone.

158
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,900
And they didn't release it.

159
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,020
It's true.

160
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,740
You are quite someone.

161
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,260
Your Majesty,

162
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,720
I think

163
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,980
the barely existing Standing Lsite

164
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,320
is a little too late.

165
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,840
If it is,

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,080
They are in love and have mutual feelings.

167
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
I said she is the head of the Wen family.

168
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Who dares to have any objection?

169
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
Your Majesty.

170
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,080
She is just a lowly maid.

171
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,440
I'm afraid she will be anxious

172
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,000
once she enters the Wen Mansion.

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,360
She wants to be a rich woman.

174
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,000
Your Majesty.

175
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,800
Don't be enticed.

176
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,720
Father, mother.

177
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,440
Don't be enticed.

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,640
All right.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
You don't know who she is.

180
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I'll tell you.

181
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,920
She saved the whole family of the Wen family.

182
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
If Chen Baoyin

183
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,040
can't be the eldest daughter of the Wen family,

184
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,880
she will be the only great-aunt of the Wen family.

185
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
Today,

186
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,320
you are close to the Wen family.

187
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,840
I...

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,320
The Wen family doesn't owe you anything.

189
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,080
In the future,

190
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,800
you will live a good life and a bad life.

191
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,880
It's all up to you.

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
Mother.

193
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,880
Go back.

194
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,520
Mother, listen to what father said.

195
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
He doesn't want a daughter.

196
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Mother, say something.

197
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,560
What your father means

198
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,040
is mine.

199
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,640
You should go.

200
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,920
Chen Baoyin.

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,960
What on earth

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,880
did you give them?

203
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,720
They were all bewitched by you.

204
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,840
Be careful.

205
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,520
You will die a horrible death.

206
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,960
I advise you to make a living for the child.

207
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
Your brother is gone.

208
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
The Wen family is alive.

209
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,520
Don't you know what he has given up?

210
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,640
But you know I was bewitched.

211
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,360
Good.

212
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,800
You are a family.

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,920
I am a daughter.

214
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,920
I am an outsider.

215
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,040
You are a family.

216
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
You are bullying me, right?

217
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Father.

218
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Mother.

219
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,040
Let's go.

220
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,240
Go.

221
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,560
Go.

222
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,120
Baoyan.

223
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Mother.

224
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Go after them.

225
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Go after them.

226
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,560
Baoyan.

227
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,760
Baoyan.

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,000
I went to the shop to find you.

229
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,360
You are here.

230
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,080
The gold...

231
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
I wanted to return it to you.

232
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,760
But I didn't get a chance.

233
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,640
Baoyan.

234
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
What I said just now

235
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,880
may be rude,

236
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,360
but it's from my heart.

237
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
I want to

238
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,360
grow old with you.

239
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,560
I want to grow old with you.

240
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
Will you?

241
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,120
I am just a servant of the Wen family.

242
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,840
I have to be grateful for what I have done.

243
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,280
How can I

244
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
take such a big responsibility?

245
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,160
Besides,

246
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,120
you don't know it yet.

247
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
My parents had a marriage arrangement.

248
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,760
But I don't want to

249
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
ask for your opinion on this matter.

250
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,320
Aldus,

251
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,160
because of your dad's death,

252
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,480
Alchemy Hall

253
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,600
dulled.

254
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,960
Now you must answer for that,

255
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,920
so I lost the interest of Alchemy.

256
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,920
That's right.

257
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,240
I'll save some money

258
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,040
with Alchemy Hall rating,

259
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,680
so trouble~!

260
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,640
You said

261
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,520
F deutlich Free Hundred Mist of music.

262
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
I know you suffered a lot

263
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,240
and suffered a lot at home.

264
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
But you're strong-minded

265
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
and never give in to people.

266
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,400
You're a hundred times stronger than men.

267
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,440
I respect you and love you.

268
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,560
I hate myself for not protecting you all the time.

269
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
Now everything is settled.

270
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,480
That's why I dare to tell you these words.

271
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,800
It's like a dream.

272
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
I never thought

273
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
you would understand me like this.

274
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,960
So you agreed?

275
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
Why are you tariffs on me?

276
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,240
I'll be with you in everything.

277
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,720
Forever and ever,

278
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,760
we will become a beautiful couple.

279
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,560
Forget why you are the same model of one man.

280
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,400
Two hearts together,

281
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,920
which medicine is available here?

282
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,800
Even though we've failed many times in life,

283
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,000
we'll be here together in every lifetime.

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,980
the wet 씻Let wings and theMark

285
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,620
take away the right spot

286
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,620
and turn the heart to a side

287
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,180
for the love

288
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,860
I don't want

289
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,180
you mark the distance

290
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,820
to will

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,440
today

292
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,000
We reunite again.

293
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
It's a good thing.

294
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,040
By the way, Su'er.

295
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,760
Where have you been recently?

296
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,200
How did you get here?

297
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,640
I...

298
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,760
Uncle.

299
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,760
Leng has been

300
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
following the Crown Prince secretly.

301
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,920
He's the crown prince now.

302
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,160
The royal family is very secretive.

303
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,240
It's hard to be loyal to the emperor.

304
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,720
Please don't make it hard for him.

305
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,720
You're right.

306
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,520
In that case,

307
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,560
how did you two get together secretly?

308
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,760
It's not

309
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
a question for your mother and I.

310
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,560
Don't talk about my parents.

311
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
Even I don't know.

312
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
You're right.

313
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,560
You two are in love.

314
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,760
You're a perfect match.

315
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,920
Your father and I are relieved.

316
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,440
I came back

317
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,960
to take my family to the capital.

318
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
We'll reunite soon

319
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
and never leave each other again.

320
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,520
Good.

321
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,280
Let's leave the wedding in the capital.

322
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,960
It's a grand wedding.

323
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Let's get the treasure money

324
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,800
and get married.

325
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,440
Okay.

326
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,640
Here, cheers.

327
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,040
Your Highness.

328
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,680
Your Highness.

329
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,600
Thank you.

330
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,400
Here.

331
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,640
Be careful.

332
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,680
Be gentle.

333
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,440
Yes.

334
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,440
Who sent you here?

335
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Did I send you to the wrong place?

336
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,920
How could I?

337
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,680
Your Highness.

338
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,680
I bought these

339
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,120
for my wife.

340
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Do you like them?

341
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,160
You're kind.

342
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,320
I know.

343
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,520
But there are too many good things.

344
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,760
I don't need them.

345
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
You're the wife of the Wen family now.

346
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,360
You'll have more of these things in the future.

347
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,600
And they

348
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,040
will take care of you and your daily life.

349
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
Just get used to it.

350
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Pack up.

351
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
I'll take you out for a walk later.

352
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,840
I heard that you were a servant of the Wen family.

353
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,080
We're all servants.

354
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,720
How could the Wen family fall in love with him?

355
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,760
I heard that he didn't leave when the Wen family was in trouble.

356
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,960
He took the second lady with him and suffered a lot.

357
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
He married her just to get her favor.

358
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,600
I see.

359
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,160
He's a bad guy.

360
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,760
What?

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,240
You're getting married again?

362
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,920
Are you defying the official?

363
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,120
Go back and ask for punishment.

364
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
Don't worry, father.

365
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,320
I know what I should do.

366
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,960
The official is worried that I'm not safe in the court.

367
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
So he insisted on getting me married.

368
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm a man of great power.

369
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,400
If I can't get married to a man of a family,

370
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,560
it's a shame to say it out loud.

371
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,640
Su,

372
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,360
don't forget your respect

373
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
because you're a friend of the official.

374
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
Remember,

375
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
you're a man of great power.

376
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,240
I don't dare to respect him.

377
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,880
Even if I don't get married,

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I still have to do it.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,480
I'll walk my own path.

380
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,080
Now everything is settled.

381
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,920
I don't want anything.

382
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
I just want to marry her.

383
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,600
It's useless to blame father.

384
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,640
He doesn't have any money.

385
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,000
If you can handle it,

386
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,080
you'll be involved in the treasure hunt.

387
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,320
Sorry.

388
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,280
Get married?

389
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,360
But you're so kind to him

390
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,600
even for my sake.

391
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,360
When'll you get married?

392
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,000
