1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,100
look so good

2
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,300
Come on, get up.

3
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,940
Your Highness, may you be blessed with a long life.

4
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,740
Have you seen it?

5
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,860
This is called He Yin.

6
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,900
Isn't it interesting?

7
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,500
I heard that you were in the female school

8
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,820
and stood up for your sister.

9
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,700
You were against the order of the Lord.

10
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,860
Is that true?

11
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,820
Yes.

12
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,580
Your Highness.

13
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,180
I didn't summon you here to punish you.

14
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,460
I wanted to give you a grace.

15
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,420
Your Highness.

16
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,940
Three chances.

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,980
If you hit the target,

18
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,260
I'll let you go.

19
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,380
조심하세요

20
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,180
Wait.

21
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,260
You gave up?

22
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,820
chỉ à la bataille,

23
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,680
et organise- Charlie

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,400
notre flower.

25
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,280
orthough

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,960
H路

27
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,000
Che-

28
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,300
tough

29
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,760
key

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,040
key

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,800
3

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Please spare me, Your Highness!

33
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Please spare me!

34
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Continue.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Your Highness, how could it be me?

36
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Your Highness, please spare me!

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Please spare me!

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Your Highness!

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
If you make another mistake,

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
the next one will be Wen Su.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Your Highness, I've never had a bow and arrow before.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Is it unfair?

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Your Highness,

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
it's unfair.

45
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
You want to be fair with me?

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Then I'll make Wen Su a hair-cutter.

47
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Fine, I'll make another one.

48
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Come on!

49
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
If both of them are shot,

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I'll let you go.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
If not,

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
both of you will die.

53
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Aren't you going to watch a play?

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Watch it.

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
This time you lose.

56
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
But I've been playing since I was a child.

57
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I'll let you go.

58
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Su Kan'en.

59
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Get out.

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Su Kan'en.

61
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Do I look good?

62
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Take off your clothes.

63
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Su Kan'en.

64
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,800
You make me very unhappy today.

65
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Your Highness.

66
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Sister.

67
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Your Highness.

68
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
What's wrong with you?

69
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Sister.

70
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
What's wrong with you?

71
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
This is a mistake.

72
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Why did you take off your clothes?

73
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm fine.

74
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Take care.

75
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm very hungry.

76
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
I want to eat roast goose.

77
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay, let's eat roast goose.

78
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Let's eat roast goose.

79
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Su Kan'en.

80
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Su Kan'en.

81
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
You make me very unhappy today.

82
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Kneel here tonight.

83
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Be punished.

84
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

85
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

86
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

87
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

88
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

89
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

90
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

91
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

92
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

93
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

94
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

95
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

96
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

98
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

99
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

100
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

101
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

102
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

103
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

104
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

105
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

106
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

107
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

108
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

109
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

111
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
The wind blows, the wind blows.

112
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
The long rainy wind

113
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
turns into a sword.

114
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
The heart is not ready

115
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
to give up this love.

116
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,800
The human being is scattered in the crowd.

117
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Two hands are close to me.

118
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,800
With you, I have nothing to ask for in my life.

119
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
The long rainy wind

120
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
turns into a sword.

121
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
The heart is not ready

122
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
to give up this love.

123
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
The human being is scattered in the crowd.

124
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Two hands are close to me.

125
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,800
With you, I have nothing to ask for in my life.

126
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,800
A dream is like a dream.
