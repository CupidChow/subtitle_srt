00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Untamed

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It was my fault before.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I apologize to you.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You can order whatever you want to eat or drink.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll treat you.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Royal Shulang has been paying respect to you for hundreds of years.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're so kind.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can lie to me about the relationship between A'Jie and Da Leng Jun.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As long as you don't tell anyone,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A'Jie will never be punished.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You've figured it out?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll ask them to make another one.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, A'Jie's shop

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
was opened by Da Leng Jun.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He's been paying respect to you.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can't blame him.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He's been paying respect to me.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The shop was opened by Da Leng Jun.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're just a servant of the Wen family.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How can you open such a good shop with so much money?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me tell you.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The whole Da Leng Jun was favored by the Chief Princess.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He's been rewarded a lot.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll have to rely on the Chief Princess to make money in the future.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But you can't ruin our good things.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How can I be so rich with the Chief Princess?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ye Lin.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Da Leng Jun.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's wrong?

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't you recognize me?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Aren't you my A'Jie's lover?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Watch your mouth.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What A'Jie? I don't know her.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Da Leng Jun.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You... you're crossing the bridge.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Keep your voice down.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm not.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
What?

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
I guess you're the late emperor.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,560
Brother, do you think I have a chance?

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
What chance?

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
To serve the Princess Royal.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
I heard that the Princess Royal

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,880
likes men.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm not married yet.

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,600
Isn't that perfect?

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Are you crazy?

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
Can the Princess Royal serve anyone?

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
If she's not happy,

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
she'll be beheaded.

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
You can serve your husband.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,760
He's not beheaded.

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,160
I'm not as good as him.

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,240
I'll go back and serve him.

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Brother,

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,720
please teach me.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,160
I'll be loyal to you after I'm dead.

61
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't be like this.

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
Brother, please teach me.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
You'll be rich with me.

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll never forget your kindness.

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Don't be like this.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
Look at my sister's ugly face.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I...

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,640
I'll never forget it.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Get up.

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Get up.

71
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,960
Brother.

72
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I'll teach you.

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Huastellen

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,840
The Crown Prince teachings

75
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Chief Platz.

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Royal Highness, please have mercy.

77
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,160
I'm just...

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,280
very attracted to your beauty.

79
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Everybody.

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Who are you?

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,360
Royal Highness, please have mercy.

82
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,120
Royal Highness...

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
Royal Highness, have mercy.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,520
I'm just bullying Your Highness.

85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,480
I heard from the city people that Your Highness is pregnant.

86
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,520
So I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

87
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,360
That's why I'm bullying myself.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
What did you hear?

89
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
I'm not a man of words.

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,840
I heard from the city people that Your Highness is pregnant.

91
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Even the bullies should be quiet.

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,760
That's why I'm

93
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
more powerful than Her Highness.

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
How dare you!

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,560
Take out your tongue from me!

96
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,960
Your Highness!

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,680
Your Highness!

98
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Your Highness,

99
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,440
there are people in the building.

100
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm afraid it's not appropriate to see them.

101
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
If you want to stop the bullies,

102
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,920
you need to stand in front of them.

103
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,440
Take her away from me.

104
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
Beat her up in public.

105
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,760
I'll see who dares to touch her after this.

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,280
Your Highness, please don't kill me!

107
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,200
Your Highness, I won't do it again!

108
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,600
Your Highness, please don't kill me!

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
Why did you hit me?

110
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm afraid you...

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
You want to serve me again?

112
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,920
You and your gang of thugs

113
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,640
are trying to frame me.

114
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,600
I'm going to report to the court.

115
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,840
Come with me.

116
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Others will only think you're taking revenge.

117
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
Who will believe you?

118
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,440
You...

119
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,000
If you weren't her brother,

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
I have a thousand ways to deal with you.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,480
You'll never get away with it.

122
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes, Wen Tian requited her brother.

123
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,160
isan cable我钉арт

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,960
I owe it to my brother Taeライ

125
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Den over her

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
Why are you spending so much money

127
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
I sent you back

128
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
by a cart today.

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,960
You must be afraid to come back.

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
Thanks to you.

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,160
It's just a small thing.

132
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,960
If he dares to come back,

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,640
he'll only scold me.

134
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
There's something on my face.

135
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,680
I didn't expect you to be so mean.

136
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
There's not only ink in your stomach,

137
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,640
but also bad water.

138
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
I'm doing this for you.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,800
The miracle will happen in a few days.

140
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,880
The gemstone will be released.

141
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
If...

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,960
If you can come,

143
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,800
it'll be more perfect.

144
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Okay.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,120
I'll pick you up then.

146
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,960
You can come.

147
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,440
What about the Princess?

148
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
I'll figure it out.

149
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,480
Master,

150
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,560
you're so kind to my Wen family.

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
I'm really grateful for that.

152
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
If there's anything else,

153
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,360
I hope

154
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
you can be honest with me.

155
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
I saved Wen family

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,920
not just to repay the kindness.

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,280
Wen family has been kind to me.

158
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,200
I decided to leave the Chen Village

159
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
and be someone

160
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,320
who doesn't depend on others.

161
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
I'll protect everyone who likes me

162
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,840
and treats me well.

163
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I hope

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,480
we can face

165
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
everything together.

166
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,320
Okay.

167
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,840
I promise.

168
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
I'll come to eat

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
wontons every night.

170
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
I have to develop more tastes

171
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
to keep you from eating.

172
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,640
Your Highness, your ball is ready.

173
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,920
Please have a look.

174
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
Do you want to see the jewelry?

175
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,040
I want to send someone to ride the shoe.

176
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,200
There are many things in the Naha Store.

177
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
The earrings are for the sake of the heart.

178
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,280
The hairpin is for the sake of the heart.

179
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,480
The clothes are for the sake of the heart.

180
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,160
What about this?

181
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,520
You have a good taste.

182
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,800
It's called

183
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:17,940
the

184
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,040
the

185
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
the

186
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
the

187
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
the

188
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,040
the

189
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
the

190
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
the

191
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
the

192
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
the

193
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
the

194
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
the

195
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
the

196
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
the

197
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
the

198
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
the

199
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
the

200
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
the

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
the

202
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
the

203
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
the

204
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
the

205
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
the

206
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
the

207
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,360
the

208
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
the

209
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,480
the

210
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
the

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,840
The officials are also�

212
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,320
ill.

213
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
We can't seek fast safety.

214
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
and observe the actions of the Chief Princess closely.

215
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,520
If there's anything wrong,

216
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,320
you don't need to inform me.

217
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,640
Just do it.

218
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,560
I didn't expect that this day would come again.

219
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,440
There must be a past between the two tigers and the elephant.

220
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
If the Crown Prince loses,

221
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,640
I can't only protect myself,

222
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,080
but also my family and the retribution will be paid.

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
What are you doing?

224
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,920
Your Highness.

225
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,800
Your Highness.

226
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Your Highness.

227
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Your Highness.

228
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Your Highness.

229
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Your Highness.

230
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Your Highness.

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Your Highness.

232
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Your Highness.

233
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Your Highness.

234
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Your Highness.

235
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Your Highness.

236
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Your Highness.

237
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Your Highness.

238
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Your Highness.

239
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Your Highness.

240
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Your Highness.

241
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Your Highness.

242
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Your Highness.

243
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Your Highness.

244
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Your Highness.

245
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Your Highness.

246
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Your Highness.

247
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Your Highness.

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Your Highness.

249
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Your Highness.

250
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Your Highness.

251
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Your Highness.

252
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Your Highness.

253
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Your Highness.

254
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
I will follow you for the rest of my life.

255
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Every rain, every wind.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,400
I will follow you around.

257
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Our hearts are like the night and the earth.

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We can't be separated by the snow.

259
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
We can't be separated by the time.

260
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Our hearts are like the wind.

261
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,800
Like the first time we met, we will never forget each other.

262
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,200
I will follow you for the rest of my life.

263
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Every rain, every wind.

264
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,400
We will become witnesses.

265
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,800
I will follow you for the rest of my life.

266
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,600
Even if we are apart by chance,

267
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
I will hold your hand tightly.

268
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:20,400
I will be with you forever.

269
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,400
I will follow you for the rest of my life.

270
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Every rain, every wind.

271
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
We will become witnesses.

272
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I will follow you for the rest of my life.

273
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Even if we are apart by chance,

274
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I will hold your hand tightly.

275
00:14:52,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I will be with you forever.

276
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Our dreams are like the first time we met.
