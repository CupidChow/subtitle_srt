00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are you doing?

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I want to write a letter to my parents in prison.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to write a letter to my parents in prison.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to write a letter to my parents in prison.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I think they can't see you write a letter.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What do you mean?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The jade seal came to report that the chief was ill.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The jade seal came to report that the chief was ill.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The jade seal came to report that the chief was ill.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Madam Wen is in danger.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please save my parents.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They can.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But I want you to go to the capital with me.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I know you are rich.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't keep you by my side

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to hide you.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When are you leaving?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will leave today.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Wensu,

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
your chance is coming.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Remember to clean up what you should.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't say I didn't remind you.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Grandpa Wang,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
what are you laughing at?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Brother Luo,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
why are you here?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why are you here?

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Look,

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I made a new tea.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
New year is coming.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want to add some new flowers in the restaurant.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Help me make an offer.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Not bad.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not sweet.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well,

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
on the day of the festival,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
why don't you stop running the shop?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll take you and Baozhu

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to the night market on the other side of the river.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's have fun.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What a coincidence.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have an appointment.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
An appointment?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Who is that?

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I know him.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Sister.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sister,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
bad news.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Dad,

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Dad is going to Shanghai.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Brother, wake up.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My family is seriously ill inside.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't see anything.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Just a glance.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Take it back.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I said no.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't give you money.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is what the princess told me.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Who dares to take it?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sister, what should we do?

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He said

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the man who got hurt would die.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't worry.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a strange thing.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll ask the man.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He will find a way.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The princess is gone.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is she still coming back?

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's good.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The country is going to change.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Stop the car.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Stop.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stop.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Stop.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Cheng,

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the old man is seriously ill in the prison.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I know.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But why are you here?

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm here to discuss with you.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't worry

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
about the Wen family in the future.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean?

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You know how to take care of your family.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I did it voluntarily.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why do you say that to me now?

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Someone will take care of the family affairs.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You don't have to worry about it.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The Wen family is in front of the Yue family.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you make a mistake,

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
you'll be punished.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is the princess threatening you again?

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What happened?

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the decision of Wensu.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It has nothing to do with others.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've made up my mind to go to the capital.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We'll never see each other again.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's say goodbye here.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You have to think about yourself and your parents,

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
right?

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I won't stop you if you want to be stupid.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But is the future really what you want?

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know what the princess has promised you.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But the old saying goes,

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the one who doesn't deserve the throne will be in trouble.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Where are your immortal books?

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm the one who has to decide.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't worry about it.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll make it.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I advise you to think about it.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There are things that you and I can't decide.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Baoyan.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know the court affairs.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The most important thing in this world is power.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Even if you don't deserve the throne,

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the one who has no power can't live.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Live your own life.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Just pretend I never appeared.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What kind of love is this?

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What kind of good and bad?

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
A gentleman with a good taste is absolutely ridiculous.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Go to your princess.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
From today on,

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
just pretend that the old Wen Su is dead.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you leave,

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
never come back.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Never!

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The most important thing in this world is power.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Only the one who has no power can live.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Someone fell into the water!

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're awake.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is there anything wrong?

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll go to the doctor.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll go to the doctor.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll go to the doctor.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll go to the doctor.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll go to the doctor.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I thought you were really leaving.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're never coming back.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I won't leave.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I won't go anywhere.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll stay here with you.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't cry.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mr. Big.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why did you suddenly leave?

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why did you speak so rudely to Mr. Bao?

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I know you have your reasons.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But we made a deal before.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We have to face everything together.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Have you forgotten?

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I made you sad.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Aoyi.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you regret it,

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can let you go now.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I dare not.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You haven't forgotten.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I still have your parents' lives.

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If not for this,

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm afraid you won't go with me.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You worry too much.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I've followed you.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no way out.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll let you know.

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Follow me.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You won't regret it.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's your plan?

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Destroy everything that belongs to me.

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll take you to the end of the world.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll be with you forever.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll be with you forever.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll be with you forever.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll be with you forever.

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll be with you forever.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll be with you forever.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll be with you forever.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll be with you forever.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll be with you forever.

186
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll be with you forever.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Every rain and wind

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
runs around you.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Our hearts are like the night.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We can stand on the top of the mountain.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I hear the sound of the years.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm glad to see you.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We can be as old as we were.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Every rain and wind

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
turns into a witness.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Our hearts are like the night.

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We can be as old as we were.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Our hands are like the night.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll be with you forever.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Every rain and wind

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
turns into a witness.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Our hearts are like the night.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We can be as old as we were.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Our hands are like the night.

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll be with you forever.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll be with you forever.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Our dreams are like the first time we met.
