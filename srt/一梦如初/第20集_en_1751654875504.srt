Episode 1

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,400
This...

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Su Er, where's Baoyin?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Mom, Dad, I'm in trouble.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm leaving.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I only have one letter left.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,000
This...

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,600
Uncle, Auntie, Baozhu, and the eldest son.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Baoyin is willful and left without saying goodbye.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Please forgive me.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Baoyin knew that the Wen family treated me with great kindness.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,600
The eldest son is my savior.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,600
I was born in a poor family.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,600
I met the Wen family.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
That's why I started to be strange.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
I know that people are abnormal.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,800
I also know clearly what I want.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,400
I...

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I know the eldest son with both my heart

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
and I know better than anyone

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
that he has been through a lot.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
The more I know the difference,

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
the more I understand

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
what's right and what's wrong.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,400
Everything in the world

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
is a chance for fate.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Fate will stop when it reaches its end.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,400
When fate is near,

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
it's time to say goodbye.

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,400
It's just that I don't have the courage

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
to say goodbye to the second son, the younger sister,

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and the eldest son.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Take care of yourself,

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Prince Wan.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,140
Video footage of compensation provided by the cordon guide

54
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,780
I used the promote money to pay off a piece of 9 high code

55
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,380
And based on my experience in business

56
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,020
many businesses were run by her.

57
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,900
She was so beautiful

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
that she made people feel at ease

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,260
when she was in her arms.

60
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,700
She became the first woman

61
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,340
to be the first lady in Qingzhou.

62
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,220
This pearl

63
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,860
looks smooth and smooth.

64
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,020
There are no obvious flaws.

65
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,140
The shine is delicate and delicate.

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,620
It can hold people's attention.

67
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,060
It also shines through.

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,420
But the roundness

69
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,620
is not enough.

70
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,300
It's not worth the money.

71
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,340
Boss Chen,

72
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,540
these are the best

73
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,980
South Asian pearls I've selected.

74
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,220
Look.

75
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,460
Such a big pearl

76
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,860
can't fit your hair.

77
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,860
The bigger the pearl is,

78
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,620
the higher the requirement for the original quality.

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,980
The more expensive it is.

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,940
Besides,

81
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,380
you're a single-wool pearl from Huaihe.

82
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,860
You want to fool me?

83
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,780
You're still a little tender.

84
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,620
I didn't say no.

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,380
No?

86
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,780
Your few pearl

87
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,940
is not bad.

88
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm going to make a necklace for Xiaomei

89
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,620
to celebrate her wedding.

90
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,620
There are still a few left.

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,660
Twenty percent of the new income

92
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,900
will be paid off.

93
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,900
Well...

94
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
Good.

95
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,860
Boss Chen has done a great business.

96
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,220
You're not only good at acting,

97
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,340
but also good at price-guessing.

98
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,340
You're the first woman in Qingzhou to be the first lady.

99
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,500
Don't be so funny.

100
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,860
Go and get the money.

101
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,580
Take it.

102
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,260
Go.

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,860
Your Highness.

104
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
This is the new dish.

105
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,420
The restaurant is opening for the fifth anniversary.

106
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,500
You're fooling me with this?

107
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,940
You're not fooling me with this?

108
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,300
Well,

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,180
the owner is getting more and more insolent.

110
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,660
Think about it. Five years ago,

111
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,340
you left without saying goodbye.

112
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,300
If I hadn't heard this from someone,

113
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,180
I didn't know you opened a restaurant here.

114
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,500
I admire you.

115
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,420
You have never lacked the courage to start again.

116
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,220
There's nothing you can't do in this world.

117
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,940
People just have to move up.

118
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,420
When it's cold,

119
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,180
the body moves upward.

120
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,780
We're getting better and better.

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Are you really going to

122
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,500
go to the capital to write to Baoru?

123
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,940
The one I care about most

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,420
is my sister who raised me.

125
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,540
She's out of the palace.

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,540
If I'm not there,

127
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,620
I feel really bad.

128
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,980
I heard that the Prince Ying

129
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,340
was a border guard.

130
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,260
He was rough and rough.

131
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,820
I wonder how Baoru

132
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,220
could get along with him.

133
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,900
I have to go and check on him.

134
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,180
What about Wensu?

135
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,860
It's all in the past.

136
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,420
Yes.

137
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,660
Sir Wen,

138
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,740
why don't you drink to your face?

139
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,100
No, thanks.

140
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,940
I don't drink.

141
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,220
Don't worry, sir.

142
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,140
I'll report to the authorities

143
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,220
about the tax evasion.

144
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,940
Just wait for the order.

145
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,860
Sir Wen. Sir Wen.

146
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,540
No, no, no.

147
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,900
Just tell me what you want.

148
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,540
How much do you want?

149
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,500
Tell me.

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,100
I won't pay you back.

151
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,820
You'd better not say that.

152
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,300
You'll make more mistakes.

153
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,060
I won't tell the officials

154
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,140
even a word.

155
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,060
Mr. Wen.

156
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,820
Mr. Wen.

157
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,860
Wen Su.

158
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,700
I won't forgive you.

159
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,220
Which one is the boss?

160
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,740
It's just a couple's shop.

161
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,020
Don't separate us.

162
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,340
No.

163
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,580
I remember that Mr. Luo

164
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,900
arrived in Qingzhou later.

165
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,620
He didn't see them get married.

166
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,100
Master.

167
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,260
The official from the capital

168
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,060
made the congee.

169
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,500
They're about to retire.

170
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,540
That old man

171
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,380
should have stopped him.

172
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,660
I'm afraid he won't be able to stay for a few days.

173
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,340
It's better to do more than less.

174
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,500
If you want to retire, just do it.

175
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,700
But the key is

176
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,740
the official from the capital

177
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,020
ate a bowl of seafood wonton.

178
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,380
There's no way to retire.

179
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,140
Seafood wonton?

180
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,140
Does the people from the capital

181
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,380
like this too?

182
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,380
Wen Su.

183
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,900
Mr. Wen.

184
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Mr. Wen is here.

185
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Hurry up.

186
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,340
Make sure the place is tidy.

187
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,380
Don't get scolded by Mr. Wen.

188
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,540
That book is a private book.

189
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,220
Hide it.

190
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,340
So this is Hu Pu Huo Yan.

191
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,580
Wen Su.

192
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Take a look.

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,340
It's you.

194
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,500
It's Lord Song's daughter.

195
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,340
Wen Su is rude.

196
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,260
You know me?

197
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,420
She loves to buy four treasures of the civil room.

198
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,260
And she's kind to men.

199
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,700
I think only

200
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,220
Lady Song is in the capital.

201
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,260
You're still mad at me.

202
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,580
I'm so embarrassed.

203
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,020
I want to see

204
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,820
which side of the line

205
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,420
Lord Wen is on in Hu Pu Huo Yan.

206
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,580
Now that I see it,

207
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,860
I can't even read it.

208
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,540
It's a marriage.

209
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,700
It's fine if you don't mention it.

210
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,220
I'm the daughter of the minister.

211
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,340
What's wrong with me?

212
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,460
Why am I so humiliated?

213
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,900
Lord, they're here.

214
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,620
Minister.

215
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,420
They're here.

216
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,100
Goodbye, Wen Su.

217
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,420
I told you

218
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,220
that you can't bring these two jars of wine in.

219
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,380
You can either drink it

220
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,340
or throw it away.

221
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,540
My Lord,

222
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,180
this wine is made by our own family.

223
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,580
It's about to be frozen.

224
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,260
We're going to the capital to visit relatives.

225
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,540
Please allow us to do so.

226
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,820
The Qing Dynasty's law

227
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,380
forbids the sale of wine.

228
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,420
How do I know if you're going to bring it in?

229
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,340
Is it for sale or for delivery?

230
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,740
Brother Luo.

231
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,100
Your Lordship.

232
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:27,980
My Lord.

233
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,460
It's not easy to make the wine

234
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,500
with snow.

235
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,700
Here's some money.

236
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,300
Make a small stove for everyone.

237
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,820
Take it back.

238
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,020
This is the rule.

239
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,620
Don't you know

240
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,980
our Ministry of Revenue has a great man?

241
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,380
Lord Wen is here.

242
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,260
It's him.

243
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,820
It's him.

244
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,500
It's okay.

245
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,460
Don't worry.

246
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,740
The relatives he's looking for

247
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,740
are in the open

248
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,260
and will always disturb your s 365 des role.

249
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,900
I hope you can forgive them.

250
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,780
The five years of memory

251
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:20,800
have changed into

252
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,620
such a terrible man.

253
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,080
The dream feels like I've seen it before

254
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,920
Got게get d d d d d d d d d d

255
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,100
not me

256
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,340
Water becoming white

257
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,000
Who's billion New Year's Eve

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We will be together forever.

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We will be together forever.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We will be together forever.

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We will be together forever.

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We will be together forever.

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We will be together forever.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We will be together forever.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We will be together forever.

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We will be together forever.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We will be together forever.

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We will be together forever.

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to follow the wind in each morning.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to chase you around.

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
My heart is like a leaf, it can be cut into the snow.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I want to spend my life with you.

273
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I want to spend my life with you.

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If we can never be apart in the beginning,

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's get in the car.

276
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Let's get in the car.

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Sir Wen, let's make way.

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's make way.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He came back to the capital to visit his relatives.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why are you here?

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Sir Wen,

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm very grateful that you helped me solve the problem.

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Although we came to the capital to visit relatives,

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
it's not necessarily to visit your family.

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't have relatives in the capital.

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You have relatives in the capital.

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's wrong?

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You underestimated me.

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I have relatives in the capital.

290
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Sir Wen,

291
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm here to visit Wen's family.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sir Wen, please make way.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Follow me.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The yellow sun is like a dream

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The sorrow is like a bow

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The prosperity is like a glass of wine

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Meet each other

298
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The wind blows

299
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A moment of love

300
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In this moment of love

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We are together

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The wind and rain are long

303
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The heart does not move

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I long to see

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The love is more important

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I long to be with you

307
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The lamp is still on

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want to be with you in this life

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Every morning rain and evening wind

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I want to be with you in this life

311
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Two hearts are like leaves

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Two hearts are like leaves

313
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The land is full of snow

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
People listen to the years

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The heart is used to meet

316
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Like the first time I had a dream

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This life is like a game

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Every moment of rain and evening wind

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
All turn into a witness

320
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't care about the heart

321
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't want to be in this love

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
People gather in a hurry

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Two hands are like a mirror

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
With you by my side

325
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have nothing to ask

326
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This life is like a game

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Every moment of rain and evening wind

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
All turn into a witness

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't care about the heart

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I don't want to be in this love

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
People gather in a hurry

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Two hands are like a mirror

333
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
With you by my side

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have nothing to ask

335
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This life is like a game

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Every moment of rain and evening wind

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
All turn into a witness

338
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't care about the heart

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't want to be in this love

340
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
People gather in a hurry

341
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Two hands are like a mirror

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
With you by my side

343
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I have nothing to ask
