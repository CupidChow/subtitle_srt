1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Seasons 1 and 2

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Do you think your mistress will still have you

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,200
after what happened?

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
You are already dirty.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,000
Other than me,

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
no other woman can accept you.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The End

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,000
If you don't investigate,

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,800
you have no right or power.

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Just take it if you don't want to see it.

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,200
If my father and mother are still alive,

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,200
I can't say that I feel wronged.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
My father is also a mistress.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,200
The End

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,000
You can stay by my side and do your work in the future.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
Your sister won't be bullied anymore.

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
How about it?

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,400
Big Sister,

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
why aren't you sleeping yet?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's nothing.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Go to sleep.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Big Sister,

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
did you see Xing

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
in the Princess's Manor during the day?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
It has nothing to do with him.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
I just think

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
we can't be bullied anymore.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,000
How can we not be bullied?

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
My mother is too big to live with me.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,600
I've thought about it for so many years.

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,800
Just go to sleep.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,960
I can't be a stubborn woman forever.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Wild flowers only grow on the side of the road

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,720
and are trampled on by people.

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,680
They can be seen from the top of the mountain.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
If I don't want to be bullied,

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,960
I have to go up and get out of the way.

38
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,960
tilde

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,940
Getting into a couple financial prostitution

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
is for sale to you.

41
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,100
Also,

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
I've found a good price for it.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,840
It's just a good business.

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
I won't do it if I can.

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,800
It's a pity.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
It's a good deal.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Brother Luo,

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,760
please give these two money

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
to the lady next door.

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll keep them for a few days.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,440
Take these money as food.

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
I'll go to the money house.

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
You're selling your property

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,680
and exchanging money.

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,880
You even entrusted your sister to someone else.

57
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,160
What's the problem?

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,680
Don't worry.

59
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
I found a business that makes money.

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,800
If everything goes well,

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,560
I can make a fortune.

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,120
What business makes money?

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
You talk like a mute.

64
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,840
You're in such a hurry to ask for money.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,400
How can I be at ease?

66
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,560
Just ask me how much you need.

67
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,840
I want the money for the bridge.

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,720
You have to move forward.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,960
that's it

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,440
That won't work.

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:51,520
And you are a

72
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll pay you three taels.

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,000
Three taels?

74
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,400
That's not much.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
Then please go somewhere else.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Wait.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,080
Three taels.

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,600
Just three taels.

79
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
I think you've written

80
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
a good book.

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
If you need money,

82
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,480
why don't you copy a book for me?

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,000
Ten taels of silver is half of it.

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
What kind of book is so valuable?

85
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,520
I'll go.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
The book

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,840
is printed by the government.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
The government doesn't approve it.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,600
If you copy one book less,

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
you can get ten taels of silver.

91
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
Isn't that a trick?

92
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,520
How can it be a trick?

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
It's a trick to print it.

94
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,360
Don't worry.

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
Don't ruin my life.

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,120
Go. Go. Go.

97
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,360
Go. Go. Go.

98
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,960
Go. Go. Go.

99
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Go. Go. Go.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
Isn't that Brother Jiu?

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,640
Come on. Come on.

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Is Baoyin home?

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,720
I don't know.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
He went to the sea to collect pearls.

105
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
He's been gone for half a month.

106
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
He went to the sea?

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,280
If I had known,

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,760
your sister's idea is so good.

109
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
To make more money,

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
I wouldn't listen to anyone.

111
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
He didn't say when he would come back.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,600
He didn't say that.

113
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,360
It's been two or three months.

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,680
He went to the sea

115
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
just to watch the sky.

116
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
He's a weak girl.

117
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,720
He hasn't replied to my letter.

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
I wonder how he is now.

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
I'll give him

120
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,760
the money when he comes back.

121
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,520
No.

122
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,600
That's not right.

123
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
Let's wait for him to come back.

124
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
You can give him the money.

125
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,840
Okay. Okay.

126
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,360
Don't come. Don't come.

127
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,680
Miss.

128
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,400
Miss.

129
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,560
Are you okay?

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm fine.

131
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,880
I'm fine. I'm fine.

132
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on. Hurry.

133
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Sit here.

134
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,400
You're having a fever.

135
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,440
I'm fine.

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm fine.

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,680
I'm fine.

138
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,560
Baozhu.

139
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I miss you.

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,120
I don't know why

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm in the sea.

142
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,840
I miss you and Uncle and Aunt.

143
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,520
I wonder if you're doing well.

144
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm so worried.

145
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm doing well too.

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:19,960
I don't miss you.

147
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,720
This is my first time

148
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,000
to see the sea and ship.

149
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,600
But it went well beyond my expectation.

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,600
I thought the life of the ship

151
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,000
must be hard and extraordinary.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Who knows it's more comfortable than on the road.

153
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,400
The ship treated me like a family.

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
It took care of me.

155
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,280
I have no desire to suffer.

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
I never thought

157
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,400
the pearl was born in the Gepang.

158
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I just need to catch it

159
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
and I can get it back.

160
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Mountains are covered by Red River.

161
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Its

162
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
glory

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
is alive.

164
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Also over here,

165
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
there's a well hidden pool of Sw Pete.

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,480
Look,

167
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,600
it gets buried in the water.

168
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
There's a very shady well on the sand,

169
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,720
Owutaka,

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Good-bye.

171
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,120
Master Bao,

172
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
if I had given myself an oppressive order before,

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,320
I have never experienced the pain

174
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,200
of being separated from my family.

175
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,960
There is lot of misty fog today.

176
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,680
If it hadn't been for their whims,

177
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,960
the sea of smoke on the right side of the lake.

178
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,760
Baozhu,

179
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,360
the sea is vast and far beyond human imagination.

180
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
It's hard to predict its changes.

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,480
Maybe my sister has understood

182
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,720
your brother's intention.

183
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,000
He carried the giant wave with his shoulder,

184
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,080
and under every slope,

185
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,120
he must take every step.

186
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
He went through the fog alone,

187
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,040
only to run to the red soil in his heart.

188
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
Don't blame him.

189
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,800
If you can see him,

190
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,280
please say hello to him for me.

191
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,600
You're not here.

192
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
No one lights up this lamp for me.

193
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Now I have no home to go to.

194
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,760
This grassland

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:08,740
became my most precious

196
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,440
life環.

197
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,440
When will you be able to be able to be yourself?

198
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
I have a lot of worries.

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,440
It's a long day.

200
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Fifty-four.

201
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Fifty-two.

202
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Fifty-three.

203
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Fifty-four.

204
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Fifty-three.

205
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Fifty-four.

206
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Fifty-five.

207
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Fifty-six.

208
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Fifty-seven.

209
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Who is this silly girl who is sitting here?

210
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Ah Jie! Ah Jie, you're back!

211
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
I've received all your letters.

212
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I miss you too.

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Ah Jie, why are you so skinny?

214
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
You're also tanned.

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
It must be hard.

216
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Little silly girl, what's the point of being hard?

217
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I made money to buy you delicious food and beautiful clothes.

218
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Look, I bought all of these for you.

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I'm back.

220
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Baoying!

221
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Brother Luo.

222
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
You're finally back.

223
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm not only back, I also brought you a lot of gifts.

224
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
These sea worms are all for you.

225
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
What do you want to eat tonight? I'll cook for you.

226
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Ah Jie, Ah Xiong said that if Ah Jie is back,

227
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,440
he will let me hang a red silk on the tree on the other side of the river to send him a letter.

228
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,440
The Great Wolf King, he came?

229
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Hey!

230
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Baoying, where are you going?

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I'll send you a letter tonight.

232
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Come back soon.

233
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Okay.

234
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Okay.

235
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Take care, everyone.

236
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I'll be back soon.

237
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Okay.

238
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I bought this.

239
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I bought this.

240
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
What's the matter?

241
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Your Highness, there's a drop of goods in front of us that broke the ship.

242
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,820
Wait a minute, I'll go and get aengers for you.

243
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
The человекnization depth that you made for me in the cargo quarters

244
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
should have arrived now.

245
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
It's listening to your s victims of disease.

246
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
I don't know if you long remember it for me.

247
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Go and get it.

248
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Yes.

249
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,720
and as what I now...

250
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,360
world would develop into a beautiful and beautiful world.

251
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,960
That is our common activity.

252
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,160
cholesterol

253
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,120
My worlds나

254
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,640
The four lives are like a beautiful rain and a gust of wind

255
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm going to travel around you

256
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Two hearts are like a drop of water in the sea

257
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,640
People have a long life

258
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,240
Heart is like a wind

259
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,440
If the past is not like the dream

260
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,840
The four lives are like a beautiful rain and a gust of wind

261
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,140
All turn into a thousand

262
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,640
Turn the heart and think that the love is not long

263
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,440
I wish to separate and leave

264
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,640
I can hold my hand

265
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,840
With you by my side, I have nothing to ask for

266
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,840
A dream is like a life

267
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,640
With enough

268
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,840
A dream is like a dream

269
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,440
The sorrow is more than a bow

270
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,640
The flowers fall into the love

271
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,240
Meet each other

272
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,840
Fulfill the dream

273
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,640
Make a moment of love

274
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,840
In this moment of love

275
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,440
Hand in hand

276
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,440
The wind and rain are entangled and the heart does not move

277
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,640
I wish to look at the white hand and the love is more heavy

278
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,440
I wish to enjoy the stars and lights are still there

279
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,440
The four lives are like a beautiful rain and a gust of wind

280
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,840
I'm going to travel around you

281
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,440
Two hearts are like a drop of water in the sea

282
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
People listen to the years

283
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
I want to meet you

284
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,440
If the past is not like the dream

285
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
The four lives are like a beautiful rain and a gust of wind

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
All turn into a thousand

287
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Turn the heart and think that the love is not long

288
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,440
I wish to separate and leave

289
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
I can hold my hand

290
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,440
With you by my side

291
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,440
The four lives are like a beautiful rain and a gust of wind

292
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
All turn into a thousand

293
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Turn the heart and think that the love is not long

294
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
I wish to separate and leave

295
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I can hold my hand

296
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,440
With you by my side

297
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,440
The dream is like a life and death

298
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,440
With you
