00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:19,900
Episode

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,240
I am like this

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,240
sold to the Wen family of Changxi

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,780
Hé. The master heard that it is also a Seventeenth class,

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,660
Although I don't have much money,

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,180
I earned it myself.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,660
No one can take it away.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,300
Since you're bought into the Wen family,

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,740
you should work hard.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,580
Master Wen is the head of the House of Worshipping in our Bianyang.

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,860
Now,

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,140
he's studying at Xishan Academy.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,420
His Lady Highness Yuniang is married into the Su family.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,980
You're going to serve the second lady.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,260
I'll take you to see the master later.

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,220
Do you understand?

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,700
Remember it.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,140
Look.

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,980
You like that?

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,940
Your Ladyship,

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,180
this is Chen Baoyin, the maid

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,020
who just married into the house and gave the second lady a new job.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,980
Mother, this sister is pretty.

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,940
It's good that she lives with me.

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,700
This child.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,780
My Lady, I'm just a maid.

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,380
I can't call you sister.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,060
It's okay.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,220
I'm used to having a sister.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,580
Yuniang is married.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
She likes to call me sister.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,100
Let her call you sister.

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,580
Come on.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,820
It's Mid-Autumn Festival.

36
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,780
No need to stand in line.

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,780
Let's sit together.

38
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,460
Yes, Your Ladyship.

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,260
Come on, sit down.

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,580
You can sit on the chair.

41
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,820
Sister, come here.

42
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,700
Sit here.

43
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:51,940
Come on.

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,220
Father said

45
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,460
all the people in the House of Worshipping are fated to meet each other.

46
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,700
We should cherish the one who is fated to meet us.

47
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,860
Father, Mother.

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,700
Su.

49
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,180
I'm back.

50
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,780
Xiong, you're back.

51
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,020
Let me see.

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,060
Why are you thinner?

53
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,700
Did you not eat well?

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,340
No.

55
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,020
I heard what father and mother said.

56
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,220
It's her.

57
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,260
Xiong, this is my new sister.

58
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,620
She's called Baoyin.

59
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,500
Greetings, Mr. Su.

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm Wen Su.

61
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,860
Wen Ru Chu.

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,060
I didn't expect that we would meet again.

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,940
It must be fate that made me keep my promise.

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,220
I'm afraid.

65
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,060
Then sit down.

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,380
Su is back this Mid-Autumn Festival.

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,940
We're a family.

68
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,140
We'll drink with father today.

69
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,660
Let's drink.

70
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,460
Come on.

71
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,340
Your Ladyship, something's wrong.

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,900
Her Highness sent someone to invite our husband

73
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,100
to have a drink with us.

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,580
Well...

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,500
Go and deal with him outside.

76
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,540
Yes.

77
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:27,900
Go.

78
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,740
Her Highness likes men.

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,260
Su sent someone to summon him here.

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,340
I'm afraid he might have

81
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,860
met Su a long time ago.

82
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,820
The best way to stop him is to go out of the city

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,860
and hide for a few days.

84
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,620
No.

85
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,060
I'll drag father and mother into this.

86
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,140
If you don't go,

87
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,220
will I let you

88
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,340
take your family's safety?

89
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,260
Where will you put our family's reputation?

90
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,460
What will you do if Su Hu再不管我?

91
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,340
It's only like this now.

92
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,060
I'll have examinations next year.

93
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,140
If Yuanshan sees that

94
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,620
and forces me to marry into a family,

95
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,780
my future will be ruined.

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,220
Isn't that goingム Wochen

97
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,940
better than the end of my life?

98
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,620
Zuo.

99
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,060
When the heaven crash electric,

100
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,100
we'll rely on each other.

101
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,020
Go now.

102
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,500
Mother.

103
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,020
Dad.

104
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,380
Go.

105
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,460
I can't go.

106
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
Go now.

107
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:17,980
Come on.

108
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,540
Su.

109
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,980
Did you know

110
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,900
Spring fever?

111
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,700
Spring fever is a disease and it spreads fast.

112
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,180
It causes red spots all over the body.

113
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,540
Some people even have a fever.

114
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,700
At that time,

115
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,260
our whole village will be infected.

116
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,940
Can you pretend to be sick?

117
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,620
I have a way.

118
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,940
It's not a problem to lie to them on the surface.

119
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,980
Okay, let me do it.

120
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,380
Lord Bao, I'm counting on you.

121
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,340
If you can get through this,

122
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,860
you are our savior.

123
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,180
You're being serious.

124
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,340
Sir, I'll go boil some hot water.

125
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,300
Spring fever patients need to be warm.

126
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,980
Sir, please change your clothes.

127
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,540
Sir.

128
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,620
Come in.

129
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's get started.

130
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,100
I'll repay you with my own way.

131
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,020
I can be my own master.

132
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,860
They all want me to die.

133
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
I have to choose a way for myself.

134
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,020
Do you need a face?

135
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,820
Yes.

136
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
The scar on my face is the most obvious.

137
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,180
Don't be afraid.

138
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,340
Are you okay?

139
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,780
Are you okay?

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,420
I've changed the medicine in the clinic.

141
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,220
It's not serious.

142
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,660
I asked someone to find you.

143
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,740
I don't know if you've changed your name.

144
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,260
Mr. Cheng, you're back.

145
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,820
Did you find the person who asked you to come?

146
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,660
I asked around in the market.

147
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,180
None of those people

148
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,900
had a name called Chen Pan'er.

149
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,300
Didn't he come to Bianyang?

150
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,420
Why did you sell yourself?

151
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,540
Mother has no money to treat her illness.

152
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,980
I'm just a poor woman.

153
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,540
I thought I was dying in the county office

154
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,980
with my sisters.

155
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,460
I sold myself

156
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,580
and let my mother live for a few more years.

157
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,460
I just didn't expect

158
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,580
to meet you again.

159
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,380
It's done.

160
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,620
It's almost done.

161
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,500
Your Grace, be careful.

162
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
The weapons in the room

163
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,020
can't be sucked into the mouth at all.

164
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
It's a very strong knot.

165
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,700
Your Grace,

166
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,820
look at the situation.

167
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,140
I'll go back and report to Zhang Wuzhu.

168
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,100
You just take care of the big guy.

169
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,380
I'll go and check on the big guy.

170
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,780
Thank you, Your Grace.

171
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,060
Thank you, Your Grace.

172
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,020
Father, mother,

173
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,820
Su has left.

174
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,220
Su,

175
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
take good care of yourself outside.

176
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,820
Father, mother,

177
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
when I come back from the army,

178
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,940
I'll bring you good news.

179
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,660
Okay.

180
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,460
Okay.

181
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,860
Go.

182
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,340
I'm leaving.

183
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
The End

184
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,580
Good news! Good news!

185
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,060
The three big guys

186
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,780
have been caught!

187
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
The big guy is back.

188
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,060
Where is he?

189
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,380
Maybe there are many people on the road

190
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,060
and he's delayed.

191
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
Good news! Good news!

192
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,540
The three big guys

193
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,260
have been caught!

194
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,620
The three big guys

195
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,060
have been caught!

196
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,500
The three big guys have been caught!

197
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,420
Congratulations, Your Grace.

198
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,380
The three big guys have been caught!

199
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,660
Su, where are you?

200
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,100
Master has gone to the gate to welcome you.

201
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,940
My son has been through a lot

202
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,900
these years.

203
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,820
Congratulations, Master.

204
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,660
Congratulations, Master.

205
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,860
Okay. Okay.

206
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,700
Today is a happy day.

207
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,140
I'll let you have a day off.

208
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,260
Thank you, Master.

209
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,020
Go. Go.

210
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,500
Greetings, Lord Xiao Wei.

211
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,460
This is...

212
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,580
All the family members,

213
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,740
including the daughter and the younger son,

214
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,740
are all in jail.

215
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,700
They're all in the house.

216
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,420
Lord Xiao Wei,

217
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
why is this?

218
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,660
I've been working day and night

219
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,460
to defend the mansion.

220
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,140
I've never committed any crime.

221
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,900
Minister Song of the Court is a traitor.

222
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,060
He's a criminal.

223
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,980
You've been in touch with him for years.

224
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,460
You're bound to be in trouble.

225
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,780
Lord Wen,

226
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,220
this is the order.

227
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,700
I'm just doing what I need to do.

228
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,020
Please understand.

229
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,940
Do it!

230
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,020
Master, please.

231
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,500
No.

232
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,340
You've been wronged, Master.

233
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,020
It's a misunderstanding.

234
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,460
It's a misunderstanding.

235
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,860
You can't let go of anything.

236
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,460
Stop.

237
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:39,860
Come here.

238
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,540
Hurry up.

239
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,980
Take the money and the indenture.

240
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,020
Go.

241
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,740
Don't let Wen family get you into trouble.

242
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,900
Go.

243
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,420
No.

244
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
Mengmeng, take them away.

245
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,420
Go. Go.

246
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,940
Go.

247
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,060
Take care, Madam.

248
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,900
Master,

249
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
why are you still here?

250
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,540
Madam,

251
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
what about Second Young Mistress?

252
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
I'm willing to take care of her.

253
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,740
Good girl.

254
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,060
You and Qiu Niang are fated to be together.

255
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,460
I have the last bit of money

256
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,780
that I'm indebted to you.

257
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,620
Take Qiu Niang to the Mansion of Jun to find her sister.

258
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,540
Mother, I don't want to go.

259
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,340
I don't want to leave you.

260
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,300
I want to be with you and my father.

261
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,340
I want to be with you.

262
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,460
You have a lot of days to live.

263
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,020
Mother.

264
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,620
Take care of yourself.

265
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,940
You must live on.

266
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,460
Mother.

267
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,460
Live well.

268
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,140
Go.

269
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,740
Take her away.

270
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,180
Madam, don't worry.

271
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,380
I'll send her back.

272
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,340
I'll do everything I can to save her.

273
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,380
Go.

274
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,020
Madam, I won't go.

275
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,180
Don't let me go.

276
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,460
Madam, I don't want to go.

277
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,100
Second Young Mistress.

278
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,100
I won't go.

279
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,300
Second Young Mistress.

280
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,340
Let's go.

281
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,100
No.

282
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,420
Go.

283
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,340
Second Young Mistress.

284
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,460
Go.

285
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
No.

286
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,820
Go.

287
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,580
Let me go.

288
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,140
Let me go.

289
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,020
Go.

290
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
Madam.

291
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,980
Live well.

292
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,020
The wind blows like a thousand times.

293
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,420
When I turn around, I think I'm in love.

294
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,340
I want to leave you.

295
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,620
I want to be with you.

296
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,620
I want to be with you.

297
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,580
Let's make it out in dreams.

298
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,740
Let's stay together in waiting.
