00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,600
I heard that when your parents were out of prison,

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,200
you brought them here to get married.

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
I want to try it too.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
Then try the Jiuzheng lamb.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
It's the signature dish here.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Brother Wen, long time no see.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Brother Tu, Brother Yuan, long time no see.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who is this?

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
My wife who hasn't married yet.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Your wife is so elegant and elegant.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
I wonder which family she is from.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm from the Xunchang family.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Brother Wen,

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
I heard that you are promoted to the Deputy Minister of Revenue.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
We haven't congratulated you yet.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Brother Wen,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
can I have a drink with you?

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Of course.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Sit.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Please.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
I'll get you some wine.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Thank you.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Brother Wen,

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,600
you are a great man.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
You are a man of great talent.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm not a man of great talent.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
You are a man of great talent.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
You are promoted to the third rank.

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,000
You can't marry a noble woman.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,600
How can you marry a commoner?

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,800
Yes, Brother Wen.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,200
You have a bright future.

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Why are you so anxious?

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,600
When you arrive in the capital,

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
you have to choose a good woman.

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Why do you have to choose a woman?

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,800
You may not know,

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Baoyin and I,

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,400
and our Wen family,

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,600
have a life-saving relationship.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
We have a mutual affection.

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,800
We can't compare with others.

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
With your position in the court,

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
you shouldn't have a mutual affection.

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,200
With the help of your father-in-law,

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,600
you can help your future disciples.

49
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
We have been through hardships for ten years.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Only you can help us.

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
You are the best.

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,800
Only we know the hardships.

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
But you are not concerned about your future

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
for the sake of your gratitude.

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
I feel so sorry for you.

56
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes.

57
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
You are worried too much.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
What's wrong, Baoyin?

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I just think you are talking about your problems.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
I can't get into the conversation.

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,600
It's okay.

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't mind them.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
Let me accompany you.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
They are here.

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
You marry me for the sake of your gratitude?

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
How can others think

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
that it's others' fault?

68
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm not the one who should be blamed.

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm the one who should be blamed.

70
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
I'm the one who should be blamed.

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm the one who should be blamed.

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
How can others think that it's others' fault?

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,800
If I don't want to do it,

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
who can stop me?

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
You know me best.

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
Since the day you gave it to me,

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
I've been wearing it.

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,600
But it's not complete.

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
I only realized this morning

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
that nothing in this world

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
is perfect.

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Maybe it's not perfect.

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
Just like this bracelet.

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
It still brings you to me.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Isn't he the leader of the Chief Princess?

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't talk nonsense.

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,400
He's the new...

88
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
It's him.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,400
He...

90
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,000
He's the leader of the Chief Princess.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,200
Yes.

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
I saw him on the boat.

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,800
We're separated by the waves.

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm holding your hand.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,400
I have nothing to ask for with you.

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Our dreams are like the first time we met.

97
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Little Bao.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,400
Brother,

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I want one, too.

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Let me have one.

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Who?

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Give me one.

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm the new leader of the Chief Princess.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm the new leader of the Chief Princess.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What?

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Uncle, auntie,

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,800
I know you're angry with Mr. Cheng.

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Others humiliated us

110
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
and tainted the Wen family.

111
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
They even made the Wen family suffer.

112
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
But others don't know

113
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
how they tolerated the humiliation

114
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,800
and suffered the humiliation.

115
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
They were humiliated and

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
were sacrificed.

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
They were even shed tears.

118
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
My son is so bitter.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm the one who hurt him.

120
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Uncle,

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
you care about him.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't say anything

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
that will harm him.

124
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
We're family.

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
How can we count his debts?

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,200
He never said how bitter he was.

127
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
That's why I came to persuade him.

128
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
He has such a reputation.

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
We're old.

130
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
We're not afraid.

131
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
It's just that you're bitter, Bao Yan.

132
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Su Er has inherited the official title.

133
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
There must be countless eyes staring at her.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm afraid

135
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
it's hard to live in the future.

136
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,800
We're just small people.

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
We have no name.

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
We're not afraid.

139
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm afraid

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
we'll suffer in the end.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm afraid

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
we'll suffer in the end.

143
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm afraid

144
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
we'll suffer in the end.

145
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Master.

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Uncle.

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
I'm hereby punished by family law.

148
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,000
Father.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Master.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
Father, what are you doing?

151
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,000
My son.

152
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
It's all my fault.

153
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
If it weren't for Bao Yan,

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
how long would you

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
endure it alone?

156
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I won't cry.

157
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Those people

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
are so stubborn.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
They caught you by surprise

160
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
and made you angry.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
They're going to ruin you.

162
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,600
Who knows my son

163
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
has been suffering for the country and the people.

164
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
He almost killed himself.

165
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't you think

166
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000
these things are not enough to make a living for others

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,000
and pretend nothing has happened?

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Mother.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Go back and rest.

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Su Er.

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
You're still young.

172
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Those rumors outside

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
won't stop for a while.

174
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
If you can't stop, just let him go.

175
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,200
Father.

176
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
I can stand on my own feet.

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Go back and rest.

178
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Go.

179
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
If you can't stand on your feet,

180
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,600
you can stand on your own feet.

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
He's still the country and the people.

182
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
His revenge is still not over.

183
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
If he's in the hands of those evil people,

184
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,000
he'll make a great contribution.

185
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
The

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
people are here.

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Why are you still sitting here?

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Why didn't you say anything when you were walking?

189
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,600
I picked a few wedding days.

190
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Choose one.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,600
I heard

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,200
you rejected the marriage order of the Guan family.

193
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Don't worry.

194
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
That's my business.

195
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Just marry me.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
If I marry you,

197
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
it's not just your business.

198
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Your business is my business.

199
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
Your business is my business.

200
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
If I insist on marrying you

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
and bring you a bad result,

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
how can I be satisfied?

203
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
You don't believe me?

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Other people's words

205
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,600
never affect my feelings for you.

206
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,400
I believe you.

207
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,200
But I can't accept that I'm dragging you down.

208
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,200
You have a weak foundation.

209
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
You need a wife who can take care of you.

210
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
And I'm from a country.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
It can't change the reality.

212
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
If we force ourselves to get together,

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
our future will be hard.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Our future will be hard.

215
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,800
What if you can't handle it?

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,600
I don't want to see you in danger.

217
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,000
You've been through everything.

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
You shouldn't be held back by this.

219
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,200
I shouldn't, either.

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're not willing to marry me?

221
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
You've been through everything.

222
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
Now you have a bright future.

223
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
You should face the hardships you've been through.

224
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
I'm not afraid of you.

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm not afraid of you.

226
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not afraid of you.

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If we...

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
If we fall in love...

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,800
If we can't be better because we fall in love,

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
we should break up.

231
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
We should break up.

232
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
People...

233
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,200
should always move forward.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Don't you think so?

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200
I've decided.

236
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm willing to follow your decision.

237
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
The wind is so gentle.

238
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
The moon is so bright.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
I just want you to know

240
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,200
that the one I want to marry is only you, Chen Baoying.

241
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I'm willing to marry you.

242
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm willing to marry you.

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm willing to marry you.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,200
We're in a hurry

245
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,600
to find a place to settle down.

246
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,800
You listen to the spring breeze

247
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,200
and leave the moonlight.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,200
It's too hard to get rid of the dust.

249
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
The moon is so bright

250
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
and the more blurred, the more perfect it is.

251
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200
It's the most beautiful and the most beautiful.

252
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,000
The snow is falling.

253
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,800
From the clear water

254
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,600
to the white memories,

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the snow on the sword.

256
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,800
But it's not right.

257
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't bear it.

258
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,000
I can't bear it.

259
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,000
I can't bear it.

260
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
God has his own way.

261
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
He won't let lovers separate.

262
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,400
God has no way.

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,800
We can only go this way.

264
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
The wind is so strong.

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,400
The clouds are so many.

266
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,200
We each run through the long journey.

267
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Greetings, Mr. Chen.

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,400
I'm Wen Su.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wen Rong Chu.

270
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,400
We're in a hurry.

271
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
The wind is so strong.

272
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
The clouds are so many.

273
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,600
We each run through the long journey.

274
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,600
We each run through the long journey.

275
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Seafood wonton.

276
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
All the customers are from the common people.

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
It's easy to read.

278
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
Everyone knows our wonton.

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Okay.

280
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
How many songs need to be sung?

281
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
How many tears of pain?

282
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,600
Who will the story remind?

283
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
The snow is falling.

284
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,800
The water is clear.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
The grey dust is scattered.

286
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The snow on the sword.

287
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The sound of the flute.

288
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The sound of the flute.

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The sound of the flute.

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The sound of the flute.

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,800
Su Er.

292
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
Where's the treasure?

293
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,200
In this case,

294
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,800
there is that person who left us this present every time.

295
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,000
Su Er,

296
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,600
give it to me.

297
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,800
Isn't this the answer?

298
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,200
You sent a letter to me.

299
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
Hello.

300
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
Brother, mother.

301
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,600
Sister is not here,

302
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
so I only left a letter.

303
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,400
Su Er,

304
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
why is it here?

305
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,000
Read it.

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,440
This...

308
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
This is for you by someone else?

309
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,240
Yes.

310
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,480
This bracelet is full of meaning.

311
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
It means we can meet again.

312
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,160
Are you really going to sell it?

313
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Why are we still talking about meeting again?

314
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,080
I have to completely cut off the past

315
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
and not leave any room for myself.

316
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,240
You don't have much money.

317
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,160
But...

318
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,960
If you regret it,

319
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,520
you can come and pick it up anytime.

320
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,240
The mountains are different from the fish.

321
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,520
The night is not as bright as the night.

322
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,960
The world is vast.

323
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,040
There will always be a bright future

324
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
and love in returning me a million dollars.

325
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
Bye.
