00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,720
моi Qianzheng

2
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,200
度轉心意為此情不休

3
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,640
tray may fall far grinded

4
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
無覓去三百東湧

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,320
rewind it along

6
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,000
有你余生便無所求

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,320
其夢如初相思

8
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,420
My Lord.

9
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,180
I...

10
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,700
You're a woman. How dare you

11
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,900
sneak out to sea?

12
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,660
The weather is so bad. How dare you go?

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,660
If the ship capsized,

14
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,500
you would have died long ago.

15
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,900
I'm back.

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,860
Don't be so lucky.

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,340
Think about it.

18
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,140
If something really happens,

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,180
what will you do?

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,820
What will you do to your mother?

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,060
You'll be in danger.

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,060
You'll be in danger.

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
You'll be in danger.

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
You'll be in danger.

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,060
You'll be in danger.

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,060
You'll be in danger.

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,100
What will you do?

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
I...

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,500
I...

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
I saw you were born a horse.

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,780
Now you're like a charcoal.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,700
Who will marry you?

33
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,140
Don't bother.

34
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,540
I've already booked a baby-sitting room at home.

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,100
When Wen is safe,

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,300
I'll go back to my hometown.

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,580
Someone will want me.

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,380
I mean,

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,780
I don't want you to neglect your own safety

40
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,100
just to make money.

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,820
If you want to spend money, you can tell me.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,660
I don't deserve to take care of

43
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,820
your life with Baozhu.

44
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,180
Take the money.

45
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,300
Where did you get so much money?

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,180
I have my own way.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,380
If it's not enough,

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,100
I'll give it to you in a few days.

49
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,860
I have my own way.

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,100
The money we made from the sea

51
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,620
is enough for us to live.

52
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,980
You'd rather suffer from the sea

53
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,980
than take my money.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,660
Don't think too much.

55
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,340
I'm just afraid you have no money

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,380
to help you in the Princess's Mansion.

57
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,020
Just take care of yourself.

58
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,620
Money

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,780
is more secure when you earn it yourself.

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,020
If you want to help me,

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,820
why don't you help me with a word?

62
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,740
What word?

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,500
my store is now open.

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
I used the soup base

66
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,180
I learned from Qingzhou in the East Sea.

67
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
The price is affordable and the ingredients are fresh.

68
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
Please have a taste.

69
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,620
The wontons are ready.

70
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Please have a taste.

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,060
Please have a taste.

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,460
The soup base is ready.

73
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,300
The wontons are ready.

74
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,340
Please have a taste.

75
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,620
Please have a taste.

76
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,060
The wontons are ready.

77
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,020
The wontons are ready.

78
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,740
Have you thought of the name?

79
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Seafood wontons.

80
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,900
All the customers are from the common people.

81
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,420
It's easy to write it down.

82
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,620
Everyone knows our wontons.

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,420
Okay.

84
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,000
Un Virgin,

85
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:44,860
even with its Santalizing

86
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,420
You have asked me..

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,420
The main battle and the main battle are in a mess.

88
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,020
For many years,

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
Qing Dynasty has been without a big war.

90
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,300
It's not easy for me to fight.

91
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,820
It's hard to find a general who can lead the troops.

92
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,580
Didn't you say the crown prince has been...

93
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,940
Keep your voice down.

94
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,420
Let's go.

95
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,140
Let's go.

96
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,700
peep

97
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,580
The tea is getting cold.

98
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,140
Wen Su, go fill the water.

99
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,620
No.

100
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,060
If Qing Dynasty comes to War against Xi Rong.

101
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,980
How do you think about moving to impregnated .

102
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,060
I dare not remind you.

103
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,620
It doesn't matter.

104
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,900
Drum and Filter

105
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,100
Chang'an

106
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,340
State of Shanghuan

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,900
Father

108
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,340
I want to go to Song temper soup

109
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,780
With that

110
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,420
Xin'er

111
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,860
I will go look for him.

112
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,540
Why don't we go together?

113
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,060
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Do you have wontons?

115
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,140
My dear,

116
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,780
why are you here?

117
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,380
It's your first day of business.

118
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
How can I not try

119
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,140
the dishes from Qingzhou?

120
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
I'm late.

121
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,860
Have you taken your medicine?

122
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,820
No.

123
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,980
You can have as much as you want.

124
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,220
olarak

125
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,460
Did I add the wrong thing?

126
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,460
Shame on me.

127
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,300
Well, you cheated me.

128
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,300
I think your wonton

129
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,460
is not only delicious and sweet,

130
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,700
but also has the taste of my mother.

131
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
I did add some secret recipes

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,300
that Madam Wen taught me.

133
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,820
I also added some

134
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,140
seafood wonton ingredients.

135
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,260
Of course, it has the taste of Wen's family.

136
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,380
You're so smart.

137
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,780
No matter where you go,

138
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,820
you're so good at making dumplings

139
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,900
and you're so warm-hearted.

140
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,100
Your life will definitely get better.

141
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,220
Thanks to the days

142
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,260
when I was in the Wen family,

143
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,260
I've seen and learned a lot

144
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,700
and I've learned a lot.

145
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,700
Otherwise,

146
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,380
I would be Chen Pan'er in the past.

147
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,340
I'm afraid I can't go through all of this alone.

148
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,620
You can eat as much as you want.

149
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,820
I won't eat.

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,380
No matter how late it is,

151
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,060
I'll leave you a bowl.

152
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,420
It's delicious.

153
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,660
Your Grace.

154
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,420
Your Grace.

155
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,740
Have you heard of a man named Chen Pan'er?

156
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Who's looking for Chen Pan'er?

157
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,620
There's a man who eats for free outside

158
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,580
but he doesn't pay.

159
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,660
He wants Chen Pan'er to meet him.

160
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,860
Where should I go to find him?

161
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,380
What should I do, Your Grace?

162
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,020
Don't panic.

163
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,060
I'll go and have a look.

164
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,660
Your Grace.

165
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,820
So, Sister is the shopkeeper.

166
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,060
Why are you here?

167
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,300
Something happened at home?

168
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Nothing happened at home.

169
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,700
Everything is fine.

170
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,780
But

171
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,460
why are you sending money to your family

172
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,860
less and less?

173
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,420
I heard you opened a big shop in Bianyang.

174
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,700
I came to have a look.

175
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,980
Since there's nothing wrong,

176
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,460
I'll leave as soon as I finish eating.

177
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,900
I won't ask for the money for these bowls of wontons.

178
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,820
I'm your brother.

179
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,660
What's wrong with eating a few bowls of wontons?

180
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,100
You have money to open such a big shop.

181
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,740
Can't you send more money to your family?

182
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,300
You want money?

183
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,580
Do you believe I'll break your head?

184
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,620
Get out!

185
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,660
Get out!

186
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,380
Get out!

187
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,340
Get out!

188
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,700
Get out!

189
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,140
Shopkeeper.

190
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,060
Report to the government.

191
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,540
If you don't leave, report to the government.

192
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,060
Anyone can be my brother.

193
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,500
It depends on whether I, Chen Baoyin, can recognize you.

194
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,420
Good.

195
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,580
You don't know us from Chongqing

196
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,660
if you have money.

197
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,620
You have money to open a shop.

198
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,660
You don't have money to give to

199
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,300
those who can't afford to eat.

200
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,660
Your sister is dead.

201
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
I'm Chen Baoyin, not Chen Pan'er.

202
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,820
Don't come here.

203
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,500
Get out!

204
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,180
Get out!

205
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,380
Get out!

206
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,460
You dare to come with me?

207
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,100
How can I be like you?

208
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,500
You'll see.

209
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,820
No matter if you change your name

210
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,900
or sell yourself,

211
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,340
you're still my family.

212
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,020
Wait and see.

213
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,660
You...

214
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,140
Baoyin, are you okay?

215
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,140
I wish to see you forever,

216
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,620
and grow old with you.

217
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,340
I wish to stay with you forever,

218
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,900
and wait for the day to come.

219
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,660
I want to spend my life with you.

220
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,420
Every rain and wind

221
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,740
is like a dream.

222
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,380
I want to spend my life with you.

223
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,340
I want to spend my life with you.

224
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,300
I want to spend my life with you.

225
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,620
I want to spend my life with you.

226
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,620
I want to spend my life with you.

227
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,620
Ever since the beginning of this world,

228
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,500
I've never returned to this established world.

229
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,860
Now, every passing rain and bag ofЪ是我每一場雨

230
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,260
make me fresh with человies.

231
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,980
I value this love more than the power of turn.
