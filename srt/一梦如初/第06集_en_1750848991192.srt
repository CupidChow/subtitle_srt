1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you going to buy me a car?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, it's not.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
let's get out of here.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's get out of here.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't let you get out.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What do you mean?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's okay.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know why

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you slept so deeply.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is it because you drank?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I added some gold flowers to your porridge.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's common to see this kind of flowers on the roadside.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It can calm your spirit.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You'll be unable to sleep if you drink too much.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did you have a nightmare last night?

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is it because you drank too much?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was a cloth sticker last night, right?

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sister...

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Take care.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're...

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're...

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Brother!

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's you, my brother.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes, it's my elder brother.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Brother, this is my neighbor, Brother Luo.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's a cook in the restaurant.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He also delivers the goods on the day of the festival.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's a good teacher.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's my duty.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Didn't you say that the yellow croaker was selling well?

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I bought some for you.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's not easy to find this season.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm not a good cook.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm a good cook.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you for your concern, Brother Luo.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And the peach blossom crisp I saved for you.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Here.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Brother Luo, have you eaten?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why don't you come in and have a bite?

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll get you some money.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Brother, don't go.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Brother, why are you here?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Didn't you give the elder brother...

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Elder brother came to celebrate the festival.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Brother.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Baozhu, come and eat this.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This silver is really...

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not easy to find this season.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you want to come, don't tell me.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or I'll go to the Youth House to order a table of wine and wine.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll treat you well.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Are you guys close?

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Not only close,

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Look, this is still sewn by Baoyin.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you don't say that the elder girl is nice,

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The people in our yard are particularly...

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Brother Luo.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you still have to go to work?

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No hurry.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, Elder brother.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You guys talk. I'm leaving.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll see you off.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No need.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Elder brother, take care.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So handsome.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Elder brother.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Baozhu didn't leave the image directly.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You've improved a lot.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Once you finish writing this, you can do your homework and continue your study.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go home after class.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you doing?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Give it back to me!

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Give it back to me!

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Brother, what's wrong with your writing?

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Give it back to me!

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Give it back to me!

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No?

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Didn't the teacher say that you have to pass the test?

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let me see.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Give it back to me!

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let me see.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let me see.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me see.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let me see.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Here, take care.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Master Bao, Master Bao, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's wrong, He Niangzi?

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Baozhu is in the school.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Something happened.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why don't you apologize to Master Tongpan and Miss Shen?

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She pushed me first.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why can't I push her back?

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If I don't, they will think I don't dare to.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Then they will definitely do something to me.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want them to know that I, Chen Baozhu, am not easy to bully.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You have a sharp history.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mu Ze, this is the student you taught.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You still don't admit your mistake.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's wrong with you?

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They hit me, I don't.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll fight back.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There is no such thing as a knife in the world.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mai Li, who taught you?

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Me?

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sister.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Master Tongpan, I'm Baozhu's sister.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not easy for a child from a poor family to go to a female school.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How can you cause trouble in the school and make trouble yourself?

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are not only a bully,

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but also scared my sister Huizhen like this.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Whose responsibility is this?

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Of course it's your responsibility.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If she is afraid of Baozhu,

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
how can she be so rude to her?

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What kind of reason is this?

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
As a Tongpan, is Master Shen also so inconvenient?

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The female school is a principle that the government has no rules.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The female school is for the sake of making women happy,

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to make them happy and to make them happy.

157
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Master Shen does this,

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
don't you agree with the female school's original intention?

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Do you want to fight with the government?

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Does Master Shen know about this?

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You...

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Forget it.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I, Tongpan, will not argue with the world.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You guys do it yourself.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Don't go.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's your turn to apologize to my sister.

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You should forgive others.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You have no right to be so rude.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Just take it.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Baozhu, are you okay?

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If my parents are still alive,

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
if my father and I are still here,

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I and Zheng Shu will be in such a big trouble.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My father is also a master.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Baozhu did the right thing.

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We can't be bullied because we have no rights and no rights.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We don't have to be afraid of people.

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is what my sister taught you.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You did a good job.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Miss, the school's headmaster wants to see you.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There's a carriage waiting for you.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Follow me.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Headmaster?

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Me?

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Please change your clothes.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You want to see the headmaster?

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You have this rule?

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please change your clothes.

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't keep the headmaster waiting.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Headmaster, the people are here.

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Come on.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
In this moment of love, we are together in this world.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The wind and rain are long, but I can't understand the heart.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I wish to look at each other forever, and the love will last forever.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I wish to enjoy the stars and lights forever.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to follow you in this life.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Every rain and wind,

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm always with you.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Our hearts are connected, and we will be together forever.

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We will live in a happy life.

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We will meet each other in every life.

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Like we were together in the beginning.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Every rain and wind,

204
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't understand the heart.

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I wish to look at each other forever, and the love will last forever.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We will live in a happy life.

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We will live in a happy life.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I want to be with you forever.
