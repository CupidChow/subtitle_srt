00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Untamed

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Step aside.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Step aside.

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Step aside.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Step aside.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Step aside.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're not a tiger.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good job.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Step aside.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Sir Wu.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sir Wu.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's me.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're a traitor.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Step aside.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Step aside.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Step aside.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Step aside.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Step aside.

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Step aside.

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let go.

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Step aside.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Step aside.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Step aside.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Step aside.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Step aside.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Step aside.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Step aside.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Step aside.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Step aside.

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Step aside.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Step aside.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Step aside.

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Step aside.

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Step aside.

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Step aside.

42
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Step aside.

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Step aside.

44
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Step aside.

45
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Step aside.

46
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Step aside.

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Step aside.

48
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Step aside.

49
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Step aside.

50
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Step aside.

51
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Step aside.

52
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Step aside.

53
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Step aside.

54
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Step aside.

55
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Step aside.

56
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Step aside.

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Step aside.

58
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Step aside.

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Generals.

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,560
Master.

61
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,280
Master.

62
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,240
Don't talk.

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,480
Follow me.

64
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,800
Did you tell me where Zhao Shu is?

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,880
Your Highness,

66
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,480
the soldiers are too strict.

67
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,920
Under the circumstances,

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,200
Zhao Shu must not be captured by the Princess Royal.

69
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,800
Alright. Leave us.

70
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,360
Yes.

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,080
Master.

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,160
What did you do?

73
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,480
You left with the Princess Royal

74
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
without saying goodbye.

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
Now you're in danger.

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
I need to ask you

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
so that I can explain to my parents.

78
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
Please tell me.

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,640
Alright.

80
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Since you came to the capital for Ruchu,

81
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,080
I guess you're also very affectionate.

82
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,960
I'll tell you the truth.

83
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll tell you the truth.

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,160
My sister is seriously ill.

85
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
She's trying to rebel.

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
Ruchu is the Crown Prince's confidant.

87
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
She has to be with him

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,560
and act on her own.

89
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,320
It happened so suddenly.

90
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,240
Her future is uncertain.

91
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,800
Ruchu can't tell her the truth.

92
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,160
No wonder she said those things.

93
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Master,

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
do you know when my husband will be killed?

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,080
Is there any way to save him?

96
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Ruchu has a official seal.

97
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,360
But when we were on the street,

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,080
the Princess Royal sent someone to catch him.

99
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
We don't know where the seal is.

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
As long as Ruchu doesn't tell us where the seal is,

101
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
the Princess Royal won't be so worried.

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,160
I have an adventure.

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,800
Can I take a try?

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
Who broke into the prison?

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,240
How dare you!

106
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,480
Princess Royal is a female official.

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
Her Highness ordered her to ask for mercy.

108
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,480
The Imperial Family is behind this.

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,720
Who dares to stop her?

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm sorry for offending you.

111
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,840
This way.

112
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,960
Go.

113
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,720
You may kill.

114
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,880
But in Putarin book,

115
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
she won't tell us one word.

116
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,160
Mr. Pi slice.

117
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Who let you in?

118
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,640
Do you know where this is?

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,160
How can I leave you alone?

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,480
I've seen the host of the party.

121
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,760
They shouldn't have let you in.

122
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,160
It's all my own wish.

123
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,560
If the host of the party didn't tell me,

124
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
how could I know that you're trying to do this?

125
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,860
No,

126
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,980
no one will dumplings,

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
just all of thoseali.

128
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
They are corrupt and pretentious.

129
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:35,040
They command

130
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,640
behind my back.

131
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,840
If I confess to it again,

132
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
I'll be punished in the cremation of MY die,

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
You're so kind.

135
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,400
I didn't know

136
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,120
you were so considerate.

137
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
What happened between us

138
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,560
has nothing to do with Baoyun.

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,080
Forget about her.

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,960
If you have any discontent,

141
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
just hit me.

142
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
I've never

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,760
made you feel uncomfortable.

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,160
I'm tired of it.

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,960
I want to play something new.

146
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
The whereabouts of the jade are there.

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,880
If you don't tell me,

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,520
I'll let your lover drink it.

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Since I dare to come,

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,240
I'll be prepared

151
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,440
to die for you.

152
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,920
You saved my life

160
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
in the first place.

161
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,760
Today, I'll pay you back.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
You and I are not alike.

163
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,840
Guan Ruochu!

164
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,480
Don't you want to know

165
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,440
where the jade is?

166
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,960
If you kill me,

167
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,720
no one will know

168
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,440
where the jade is.

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,080
I honestly

170
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
don't care about your life.

171
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,400
Don't cut me off.

172
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I planned to keep you

173
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,560
for the sake of great service

174
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,800
but for being officesome.

175
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Since you two

176
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,240
are so close,

177
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I was moreí• ours than you

178
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,020
I didn't expect if I was immediately flooding the sky

179
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,120
Different from other mothers

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,620
Different

181
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
Choose different

182
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,600
One step at a time

183
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,720
In my whole life,

184
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,040
I've been suffering from cold flu for more than ten years.

185
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,400
Now, the whole country is in battle for the throne.

186
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,720
MyMary is worried about the future of her homeland.

187
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
Humiliation.

188
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,520
Torture.

189
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:37,640
I can use blood to

190
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,560
But I have to protect only one person.

191
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Don't be afraid.

192
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,780
icken valley

193
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,380
Ma'am

194
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Your Majesty.

195
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Your Majesty.

196
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
