Episode 16

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is there anyone? Help me! Is there anyone?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is there anyone? Help me! Is there anyone?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Big Madam, stop screaming.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Your husband will come to save you later.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Who are you? Help me!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you want money, tell me everything!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm about to die.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What's the use of the money I want?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I didn't expect you to have a pair with Wen Su.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then I'll use you to lure him out.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then you two will be a couple who will be punished.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's you, old man!

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Bao Yun!

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Bao Yun!

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Old man, help me! I'm here!

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Honggui, I advise you to let him go.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Make a plan as soon as possible. Or you'll be punished.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wen Su, I'm already a dead man.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But before I die, I'll use you as my shield.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Kill him!

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Help! Help!

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wen Su, you two will be a couple who will be punished.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No!

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No!

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No!

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No!

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No!

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bao Yun!

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No!

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let go of me.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you die, I won't live either.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No!

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll find another way to repay you for saving my life.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm Wen Su.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm nice, affable, just like a snake Golden Snake.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are the盾紋阳, I can never see its filth.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Both of you are quartered in the void,

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
but you should let it be the upper hand.

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can never love me.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Mister

44
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Mister

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,340
This is also goodbye.

46
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Sure.

47
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,000
Baoyun.

48
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:40,960
Your Majesty,

49
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,640
Your Majesty,

50
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,440
please forgive my rudeness.

51
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,500
Our King is 말씀izing his value

52
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,240
as Dance Jean Paul Nopez.

53
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,720
And His Majesty

54
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
has asked His Majesty

55
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,840
Drink up.

56
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,720
Your Highness.

57
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,280
Doctor Wang.

58
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Your Highness.

59
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,960
Mincheng is、

60
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,920
Is safe and sound in his side,

61
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,680
Wake up.

62
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Please wake up.

63
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
You know me.

64
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,360
I never wake up.

65
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,840
I always want to get rid of this fate.

66
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
I want to move forward.

67
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,280
See what's ahead.

68
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
But

69
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
I don't want to be alone anymore.

70
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,880
Wake up.

71
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Wake up.

72
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
Wake up, okay?

73
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,040
Let's move forward together.

74
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,080
Let's see what's ahead.

75
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
Okay?

76
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
Okay?

77
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,520
Okay?

78
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,000
Tang Jun.

79
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm going home.

80
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I...

81
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Okay.

82
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm going home.

83
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go home.

84
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,500
Wu Kong.

85
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
Wu Kong.

86
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
That day,

87
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,900
when suddenly

88
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,020
I cried

89
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,700
for all these words

90
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,220
in the world to begin,

91
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,820
no one was there to take me out.

92
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,460
I was

93
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,820
W limbs are common in中國.

94
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,260
Good rhythm.

95
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,340
Impressive.

96
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,760
Wings.

97
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,560
a woman who is so considerate.

98
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,520
I remember you had done something

99
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
to earn my favor.

100
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,200
I was afraid.

101
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
But you still remember me.

102
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,560
I wonder if Mr. Wen...

103
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,320
Don't worry.

104
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,880
He's fine.

105
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,920
The imperial physician has been watching him.

106
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
He's getting better

107
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,520
since you were unconscious.

108
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
You two are close friends after you got married.

109
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,280
I wonder

110
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,720
how you got such a strong will.

111
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,520
You managed to drag the injured Wen Su

112
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
to the cave at the bottom of the cliff

113
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,640
and took good care of him.

114
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
You're lucky

115
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,800
to be found by the imperial guards.

116
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,760
Otherwise, you'll die a long death.

117
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
But even if you saved his life,

118
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,880
you should know

119
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,200
what crime he committed.

120
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,760
Wen Ruchu sent troops without permission

121
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,000
and broke into Xiaojin at night.

122
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,560
He didn't even care about

123
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
the law and the country.

124
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,520
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

125
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
It all started with a maid.

126
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
Mr. Wen made a big mistake

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and it was all for saving me.

128
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm willing to take Mr. Wen's punishment.

129
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
Even if I have to kill you,

130
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,920
you're willing to do it?

131
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,880
I'm willing to do it.

132
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,960
We will be together forever.

133
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,760
We will have a love story.

134
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,880
In this moment of love,

135
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,360
we will stay together forever.

136
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,440
We will never change our love.

137
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,360
We will look at each other forever.

138
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,880
We will hold hands forever.

139
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,840
We will wait for each other forever.

140
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,560
I want to follow you forever.

141
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,760
I want to be with you forever.

142
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,280
I want to be with you forever.

143
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,320
We will be together forever.

144
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
We will meet each other forever.

145
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,440
We will be together forever.

146
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,760
We will be together forever.

147
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,560
Every rain and wind

148
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,720
will become a witness.

149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,320
We will be together forever.

150
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,280
We will wait for each other forever.

151
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,480
We will hold hands forever.

152
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,720
We will be together forever.

153
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,880
Reg ultimately dispelled.

154
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,580
Regardless of every representatives in the world

155
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,720
We will find an answer

156
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
We will surely solve it.

157
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,900
We will be together together forever.

158
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,520
We will wait together forever.

159
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,540
We will meet each other forever.

160
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,040
We will stay together forever.

161
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
We will beat the time.

162
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,160
Now when each other is together forever,

163
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm willing to fight until we fantastic.

164
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,120
It is not difficult.

165
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Cavalry robots definitely have a tactic.

166
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,120
It has already become an example.

167
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
What I want is

168
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
to have a dream like the first time we met,

169
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
to think of each other

170
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,120
and to be together.
