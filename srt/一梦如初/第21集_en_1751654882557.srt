00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,420
My wife

6
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,980
May you live each day

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
Besides your handwriting is much better

8
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,540
You can'tbeing grateful

9
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,260
I set up a stage in Qingzhou

10
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,260
I have forgotten that there is a family in the capital.

11
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
He knows that I am in Qingzhou.

12
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,260
They say that now the treasury is full.

13
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,260
Half of it is the credit of Mr. Wen.

14
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,260
Really?

15
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
The bigger the official seat,

16
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
the more harsh the words.

17
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,260
He has asked me.

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
Wen.

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,260
Are you okay?

20
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,260
Why are you so thin?

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,260
How about you?

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Is it good?

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,260
As you see,

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,260
now you are the minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

25
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
What's wrong with that?

26
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,260
That's right.

27
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
What he did now is what he wanted to do.

28
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,260
What's wrong with that?

29
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,260
You are back.

30
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,260
You are back.

31
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
Who is she?

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
I...

33
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
It's you.

34
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260
I finally get you back.

35
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,260
I will go to inform the lady and the master.

36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,260
You are back.

37
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,260
You are back.

38
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,260
You are back.

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
There is your portrait in the house.

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,260
Mother told the servants in the house to recognize it.

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,260
No matter where you are,

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,260
you have to get it back when you see it.

43
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Father and mother must have a lot to tell you.

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
You go ahead.

45
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
I have to go back to the Ministry of Revenue.

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
You are back.

47
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,260
You are back.

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,260
You are back.

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Don't follow me.

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,260
I am back.

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
Where can I go?

52
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,260
You are back.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,260
I finally get you back.

54
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Baoyin.

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,260
Baoyin.

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Leave us.

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Yes.

58
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Come here.

59
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Let me see.

60
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Come here.

61
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
I will go with you.

62
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
I will go with you.

63
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,260
I will go with you.

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,260
I will go with you.

65
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,260
I will go with you.

66
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
I will go with you.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
Come here.

68
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
My son.

69
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,260
You are so hurt.

70
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
Are you worried about me and your uncle?

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
I am worried about you.

72
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Just keep on hammering.

73
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Until you are satisfied.

74
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
Baoyin, where are you?

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
I miss you so much.

76
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,260
I can't find you.

77
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
I miss you so much.

78
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Get up.

79
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Let me see you.

80
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,260
You left a letter to us.

81
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,260
We were looking for you.

82
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Suer sent people to the park.

83
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
But we couldn't find him.

84
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
So he went to your hometown.

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,260
We were happy.

86
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,260
We thought you were dead.

87
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,260
But we couldn't find you.

88
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Don't you know I am a harem?

89
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
I won't die so easily.

90
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
Don't be angry.

91
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,260
You are so angry for a poor man like me.

92
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,260
You don't know it.

93
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,260
You should feel sorry for me.

94
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,260
Don't stand outside.

95
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
Come in.

96
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
Don't catch a cold.

97
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
Come out.

98
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
Look.

99
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,260
This peach blossom cake is your favorite.

100
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,260
You buy it in a queue.

101
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
You finally come back today.

102
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,260
Try it.

103
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
Okay.

104
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Drink some tea.

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
Warm up your body.

106
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Tell me.

107
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Where have you been these years?

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,260
I opened a restaurant in Qingzhou with the gift of the government.

109
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
The business is good these two years.

110
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
In order to get the goods,

111
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,260
I opened shops in all cities.

112
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
You have been to many places.

113
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,260
You have seen the world.

114
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,260
You must have suffered a lot.

115
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Stay at home for a few days.

116
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Stay with your uncle and aunt.

117
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Yes, Mr. Bao.

118
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
I have to take care of the restaurant in Qingzhou.

119
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
This time, besides seeing Erlang,

120
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I heard that Baozhu was going to marry someone.

121
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I came to congratulate him.

122
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Where is he?

123
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
He must have gone to the next house.

124
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Now the woman is not loyal.

125
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
I know it.

126
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
I have to teach him again.

127
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
I have sent someone to report.

128
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
I should be back soon.

129
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,260
I have heard about Baozhu's marriage.

130
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
You don't agree?

131
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Suer is now in charge of the money of the government.

132
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,260
King Ying is in charge of the military power in Liaobei.

133
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,260
These two are the masters of the big ones.

134
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
If these two families are put together,

135
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
not only will they be suspected by others,

136
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm afraid the government will not be at ease.

137
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Sister.

138
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
You are a liar.

139
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
You said you would stay with me.

140
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
How can you leave without saying goodbye?

141
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
I don't care.

142
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
I have to keep you in my heart.

143
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
You can't run away.

144
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Look at you.

145
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,260
You are still a child.

146
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
It's all my fault.

147
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
I shouldn't have come back so late.

148
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,260
If you leave next time, I will take you with me.

149
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,260
If you lie to me again, you will be a dog.

150
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
I'm not a dog.

151
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
You are going to marry a girl.

152
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,260
You are still so clingy.

153
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Sister.

154
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Tell my parents

155
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
to let me marry King Ying.

156
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
You are so shameless.

157
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,260
How can a girl marry a man?

158
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,260
I like King Ying.

159
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
I will marry him.

160
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Now your brother is in charge of the family.

161
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
We can't make a decision.

162
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
You should go to your brother.

163
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Your sister is tired.

164
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
She should go to rest.

165
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,260
No.

166
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
What if she leaves again?

167
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
I came back this time

168
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
to send you out of the house.

169
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
Don't worry.

170
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
I won't leave.

171
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Come on, sister.

172
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Sister, look.

173
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
These things

174
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
were brought from Bianyang

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
to the capital.

176
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
Brother asked Yuan Mu Yuan Yang to decorate it.

177
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
He cleaned it every day and opened the window.

178
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
He also changed the flowers in the house

179
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
every month.

180
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
I will marry you.

181
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
I will marry you.

182
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
I will marry you.

183
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
I will marry you.

184
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
I will marry you.

185
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
I will marry you.

186
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
I will marry you.

187
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
I will marry you.

188
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I will marry you.

189
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
I will marry you.

190
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I will marry you.

191
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
I will marry you.

192
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
I will marry you.

193
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
I will marry you.

194
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
I will marry you.

195
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,260
Sister.

196
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
Sister.

197
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
What are you thinking about?

198
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Nothing.

199
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Sister, you have a big hand.

200
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
This pearl is bigger than my eyeballs.

201
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
It's nothing.

202
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,260
Sister has grown up.

203
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
In the future,

204
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
everything I want is yours.

205
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
I knew you would always love me.

206
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Sister, why are you laughing?

207
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
Qingzhou has no snow.

208
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
I haven't seen such snow for a long time.

209
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
Qingzhou has not only no snow,

210
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
but also me.

211
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
No parents, mother and brother.

212
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
I think you miss home.

213
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Yes.

214
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Home is better.

215
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Qingzhou.

216
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,260
The wind and rain are entangled in the pain of the world.

217
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,260
I can't understand.

218
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,260
I long to see you.

219
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
In the white-hands of love,

220
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
I long to hold your hand.

221
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
The starlight shines on you.

222
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
Brother, why are you back so early?

223
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Brother, you are so fierce.

224
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Sister is protecting me.

225
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
I'm sorry.

231
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
I'm sorry.

235
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,260
I'm sorry.

236
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
The wind blows into the sky.

255
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,260
The heart is full of love.

256
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,260
I long to be with you.

257
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
I long to hold your hand.

258
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,260
I long to have you by my side.

259
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
You are so old.

260
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,260
You are still playing with the kids.

261
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
I remember

262
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
you are a few years older than me.

263
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:51,260
I have a dream of us being together.

264
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Sister, let's go and sit.

265
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Brother, you have to be treated by me.

266
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Brother, you have to be treated by me.

267
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
You are always busy with work.

268
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
You can't see anyone.

269
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Sister, can you help me persuade Brother

270
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
to get engaged to Prince Ying?

271
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Baozhu, marriage is not a joke.

272
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,260
I have never seen Prince Ying.

273
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
I don't know how he treats you.

274
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
How can you give it to him so easily?

275
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
He treats me very well.

276
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,260
A few years ago, I almost broke my leg when I rode a horse.

277
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
He saved me.

278
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
He taught me how to shoot arrows

279
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
and taught me how to read and write.

280
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,260
He treated me like you treated me.

281
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
I was the first one to think of

282
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
what delicious food and fun to play.

283
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Your Baozhu has grown up.

284
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I am willing to help you.

285
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
But your brother is changing every year.

286
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,260
He may not listen to me.

287
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,260
He won't.

288
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,260
He listens to you the most.

289
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
He is cold now.

290
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,260
It's just that he has been suffering for years.

291
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Since you left, he has been depressed for a long time.

292
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
He is determined not to accept the marriage of the official.

293
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
My father said that the official business is complicated.

294
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,260
My brother is more careful when fighting alone.

295
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
So he doesn't like to talk these years.

296
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
He keeps everything in his heart.

297
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
So that's it.

298
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,260
Sister, actually I know

299
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
that my brother doesn't want me to marry the Prince of Ying.

300
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
He doesn't want me to marry him.

301
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
He is afraid that as a general,

302
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
he may not have a day to contribute to the country.

303
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,260
But I'm not afraid of these.

304
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
As long as he treats me sincerely,

305
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I will face it with him no matter what others say.

306
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
No matter what others say?

307
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Silly girl.

308
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
How can everyone have the courage to do this?

309
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Have you thought about it?

310
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
As long as you love each other sincerely,

311
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
you can get rid of all difficulties.

312
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
It's not impossible.

313
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,260
It's not impossible to get rid of all difficulties.

314
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
I hope you grow up.

315
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Sister, it's good that you're back.

316
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
Brother can be happier.

317
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
Just help me persuade him.

318
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Come in.

319
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
I don't know that you are changing your clothes.

320
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,260
So you just let me in.

321
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
You are changing your clothes.

322
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
I'll come back later.

323
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,260
You are not here to talk to me.

324
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,260
Chen...

325
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Chen...

326
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Chen...

327
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Chen Baoyin...

328
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Why is he so clumsy when he sees him?

329
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
I heard about Baozhu and King Ying.

330
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,260
As his brother,

331
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,260
I shouldn't break Baozhu's marriage for my reputation.

332
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
You are here

333
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
just to say this?

334
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
The past

335
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
should be put forward.

336
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Master and Madam are old.

337
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
You should have thought about it earlier.

338
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
You should have thought about it earlier.

339
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
You should have thought about it earlier.

340
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,260
The situation is already high.

341
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
You should have thought about it earlier.

342
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Don't let them worry.

343
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,260
You are so easy to let go.

344
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
So you are with Luo Teng.

345
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
What are you talking about?

346
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Brother Luo and I just opened a store together.

347
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
You married into Wei family.

348
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Have you ever thought about me these five years?

349
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
No.

350
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
No.

351
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
If you don't want to,

352
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,260
why don't you dare to see me?

353
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
The End
