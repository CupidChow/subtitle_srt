1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,720
One's I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
lies left behind by the sea.

3
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,060
체인

4
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,340
원kel

5
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,000
Ooh ee

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,460
oops

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,180
By the way,

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,680
The Mile Bullboard

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,700
Extra Till

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,020
Dylan

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,580
It's all left in the last week.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,060
In sunset

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,880
Está

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,040
Don't worry.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,440
I won't say anything.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,280
Whether it's the identity of Mr. Wen

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
or you and him,

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,000
I won't say anything.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,240
I'll just pretend

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,480
nothing happened today.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,440
You should recuperate for now.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,640
I still have to take the medicine in the morning.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll go check on him.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,240
Come on.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,560
Well,

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Be careful.

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
You'll fall if you're not careful.

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Brother,

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,280
I have something to ask you.

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,240
I asked the priest.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,280
The doctor said

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,160
Her Highness asked her to check the patient in the prison.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Master Wen and Her Ladyship are fine.

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
But now the prison is too tight.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,280
No one can enter.

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,840
She will definitely be brought back safe.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:25,840
Right?

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,720
I mean...

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
the other letter.

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
If that letter has been forwarded,

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
the visitors have to come back to check first.

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,760
If it succeeded,

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
the BA still won't need to go there.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,440
That's good.

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,360
vase

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,840
Who said

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880
I know that

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,480
you should stop

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
worrying about the Wen family.

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
We all have our own fate.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,560
Don't think you're right.

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
You can't protect some people.

54
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,040
Yes.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm just a commoner.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
How can I be compared to the Princess who is trying her best?

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,520
Your Highness,

58
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,400
it's just the seventh day of the lunar month.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,680
Why don't I go out with you?

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,760
Brother Mo,

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,200
you're willing to keep my secret.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm very grateful.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,240
I won't bother you anymore.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm not afraid of trouble.

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,240
I just want to protect you.

66
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,720
I don't want you to be sad anymore.

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,080
You'll be better off being home soon.

68
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,320
Sister,

69
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
Brother Mo promised to take us to the sky lantern today.

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,480
Will he be back anytime soon?

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,400
Is anything wrong with your brother?

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
I'm afraid that he won't make it.

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,280
Brother Mo is lying again.

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,960
He doesn't 건 that it doesn't count that he always keeps his promise.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,800
He wouldn't come back even if Sister's ill.

76
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,680
It's okay.

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Baozhu,

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,840
why don't I take you out for a walk?

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm not going.

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
Baozhu is not going either.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm not going.

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,800
The wind is so strong.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,200
The moon is so bright.

84
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,920
We are running towards each other.

85
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
The snow is so pink.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
He's right.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,040
He and I are so different.

88
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,840
We are in the same sky

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
and in the same ground.

90
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,640
But I still want to protect him.

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,880
So have you ever seen a moths with wings?

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
Sister,

93
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,840
let's make a wish.

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,360
After some time,

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,440
a fairy will see us.

96
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,520
I don't have any more wishes.

97
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,160
Sister,

98
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,080
don't keep me in secret.

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,920
A'S San has left

100
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,120
with difícil Princess 않아.

101
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,400
Right?

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,640
He doesn't care about us.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,240
Right?

104
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
I won't leave you alone.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,480
But it's not convenient for you to show up now.

106
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Close the door for now.

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,680
Live your own life.

108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,800
Don't think about anything else.

109
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,800
Think about your life.

110
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,920
I'll listen to you.

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
Someone else isn't as healthy.

112
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
Everyone said you were happy.

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
In the flesh.

114
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
In the heart.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Double education.

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,240
Lu Zhixun.

117
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,200
By the descent of the mountain...

118
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
it wasn't matchless...

119
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
Lord Yheng wrote it.

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,320
According to his own story...

121
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,240
someone showed this side of him.

122
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,880
This one...

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,480
I can't persuade everyone.

124
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,960
I can only persuade myself.

125
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,480
We are in a hurry

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,320
to find a place to settle down.

127
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,560
I hear the spring breeze

128
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,960
I see the moonlight

129
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,000
Many things will be in vain

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,040
How many songs need to be sung

131
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,320
How many tears of pain

132
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,280
Who will the story remind of

133
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Please, sirs.

134
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
This way, please.

135
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,000
What to do now?

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,800
Theme.

137
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,840
Isn't it said the Monster Uncle Zhao Jian

138
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,600
why brought us here?

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,040
Go through the payments

140
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Check your kroplin

141
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Wear the royal robe,

142
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,820
and beef up your soul.

143
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,460
Your Majesty.

144
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,900
Lord attached to an important message.

145
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,700
As the eldest daughter of the General,

146
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,880
I have the tiger talisman that the late emperor gave me.

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
I can send troops to get the general.

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
I can order the officials.

149
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Even if my brother is here,

150
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
what can I do?

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
You are a woman.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
You are so ambitious.

153
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
You don't even care about the official family.

154
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
How dare you!

155
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
The official family has not yet been sick.

156
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Your Highness is going to kill the court officials.

157
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,880
This is going to be completely rebelled.

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
How dare you!

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
You think I dare not kill you?

160
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
You killed the official of the court.

161
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
You are a sinner in Qing Dynasty.

162
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Not only the officials can punish you,

163
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,880
the people of the world can also be rebelled.

164
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Your Highness,

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
have you ever expected this?

166
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Before the official family was sick,

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,880
I was officially given the full power.

168
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
If anyone has any objections,

169
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,880
I will knock down the mountain and the tiger.

170
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Then don't blame us.

171
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
We'd rather die than obey.

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Guards!

173
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Don't think about leaving tonight.

174
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Your Highness,

175
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I have a request.

176
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
I want to ask you a question.

177
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Take it away.

178
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Your Highness,

179
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
are you trying to kill Zhongliang?

180
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
It's you.

181
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
You were already jailed.

182
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Who let you out?

183
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Before the official family was seriously ill,

184
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I had ordered the world to be set free.

185
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I have also been released from my position.

186
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
I am here to guard the prison.

187
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Minister Song is a important official of the three dynasties.

188
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
With him as the minister,

189
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
the Qing Dynasty will be saved.

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I will take my leave.

Baoyin,

193
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
you look good today.

194
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
It seems you are well.

195
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
You can't always lie down.

196
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
It's more important to earn money and eat.

197
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Thank you for your help in the past few days.

198
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
It's my pleasure.

199
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
But I've been in a panic these days.

200
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
It's not easy to do business.

201
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
It's okay.

202
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
People have to live.

203
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
We have to eat when we are alive.

204
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Let's open the factory and do our business.

205
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Baoyin,

206
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
once you come back,

207
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
there will be a main stock in our store.

208
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Move aside.

209
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
The court is here.

210
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Something happened in the capital.

211
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
The court is here.

212
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Let's go.

213
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Let's go.

214
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Let's go.

215
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Baoyin, I'll go and have a look.

216
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Let's go.

217
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Let's go.

218
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
Something happened in the capital.

219
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Let's go.

220
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Baoyin.

221
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Baoyin.

222
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
The big car is going home.

223
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Yes, the big car is going home.

224
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Yes, the big car is going home.

225
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
The big car is going home.

226
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
It's all right.

227
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Let's go.

228
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Let's go.

229
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Let's go.

230
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,760
I got it.

231
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
My hands are tied.

232
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,880
With you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.

233
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,880
A dream is like a life,

234
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,880
a song is like a song.

235
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,880
The End
