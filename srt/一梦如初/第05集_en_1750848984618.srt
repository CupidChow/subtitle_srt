00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Mother, here's the red ginseng.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you, Baozhu.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Here's a introduction for Father.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I hope Father and Mother can be blessed with good health and be cured of illness.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Mother, this is a new dress that I sewed for you.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The clothes are all made of cotton.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's dried with water and softened with my hands.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But I can sew it for you now.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
She sewed the necklaces inside, right?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They're all good.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They're all mother's little cotton.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The Wen family is in a difficult situation.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm afraid that those close friends and relatives

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
will leave the Three Realms.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
None of them will be able to come out.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Poison and silver.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They are a great pity to the Wen family.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They are very loyal.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that they will leave us.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If it weren't for the mercy of Madam Liao,

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
who would know that I'm now a widow?

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Wen family and I are like a child.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm a man of hard-to-see true feelings.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A woman who is so loyal and loyal

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
deserves to be treated well.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a pity that I'm not here.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You two are outside.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Didn't you hear about Su'er?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Madam, don't worry.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The Great Wolf's Faction has its own destiny.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It will be fine.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Baozhuo, come.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll go and get you some medicine.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Baozhuo, come.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Pour me some wine.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:38,300
The

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Su'er is even more

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
beautiful and beautiful.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She is very pure.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
God will bless her.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If I can't get her out,

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll have to work hard to get her back.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, let's not talk about this.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Baozhuo, come.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Give me some medicine.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll be right back.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now I'm in a state of emergency

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and I'm in front of my grandfather.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Isn't this the face of the First Princess?

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why is she wearing a big necklace

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
on a big day?

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's go.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't make any more trouble.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Young Master.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Young Master, come.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why are you so drunk?

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you still want the red wine?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Give me a bottle.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Young Master.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Young Master.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Young Master.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Young Master.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Young Master.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Young Master.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Young Master.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Young Master.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Young Master.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Young Master.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Young Master.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Young Master.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Young Master.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Young Master.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Young Master.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Young Master.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Young Master.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Young Master.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Young Master.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Young Master.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Young Master.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Young Master.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Young Master.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Young Master.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Young Master.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Young Master.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Young Master.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Young Master.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Young Master.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to the room.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The room?

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please forgive me.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're drunk.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Go inside and have some wine.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll leave after I warm up.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's wrong?

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Are you scared?

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you know what I'm doing?

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you know what a facial mask is?

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A facial mask...

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
is just a toy for people.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A man of honor.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A prince.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I've lost my dignity.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm just a corpse

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that I've always despised.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wait.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll apply the ointment.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's no use.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It'll be broken again.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
To prevent the poison from spreading,

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
we need to keep people's noses in check.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Only by doing this can we save each other.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Bo Yuan.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm not a man of honor.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm just a man of honor.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's ridiculous.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sir.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't laugh.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Madam knows that she should be sorry.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So what if she knows?

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm too ashamed to see my parents.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't deserve to be their son.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Once all this is over,

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll find a place where no one is there

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
to talk to myself.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why did you choose to die?

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you're sober,

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
don't always make me apply the ointment.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mr. Tan is a man of honor.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He's a man of honor.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's a man of honor.

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You've taken care of your family.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Leave the rest to me.

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll take good care of them.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The simplest thing in the world is to die.

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A rope, a knife.

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you don't do it, you'll be killed.

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But the most important thing in life is courage.

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Courage.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A sword with a straight edge.

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
A sharp edge is a sharp edge.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Under pressure,

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
a sharp edge is a sharp edge.

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Since you've made a choice,

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
why do you have to hurt yourself?

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Only if you love yourself

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
will you never give up.

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You must protect yourself.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Anyway, you must protect yourself.

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,260
Now you must remember the ^^

186
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,640
No more of this Straw since you are old

187
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Fine

188
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,960
I will remember that

189
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,360
Being happy the moment you are gone

190
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,920
This is valores

191
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
These memories

192
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,880
Does it matter if I forget it when I go back?

193
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,120
At least he made a promise

194
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,560
and asked me to go home and see.

195
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,880
Now I have no home.

196
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,320
I only have this place to go.

197
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,920
To prevent behaving like a circusxt.

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
No matter he makes a mistake or not

199
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
he's not organs anymore.

200
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,840
All he says is the same.

201
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,480
Long Storey,

202
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,800
all he~"

203
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,440
is only a receive single.

204
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,040
I just saw youurygous.

205
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,600
When Master and Madam are out of prison,

206
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,640
if we can't get back to work,

207
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
I want to set up a big courtyard

208
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,280
to settle everyone.

209
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Although the business on the ship is good,

210
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,720
the profit is a bit less.

211
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,160
At that time, I'm afraid it will be difficult to maintain the livelihood.

212
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,960
People have to move forward.

213
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,640
Have you ever thought about me?

214
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Of course.

215
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I've been thinking about it.

216
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
But I don't know

217
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
what kind of things you do.

218
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,920
The royal family's affairs are secret.

219
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
Who can tell you

220
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,240
what will happen?

221
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm afraid you can get away from it.

222
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
That's the best.

223
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,480
I can't tell him

224
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
about the Crown Prince.

225
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,680
Your Highness.

226
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,440
What now?

227
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,680
Perish right now.

228
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,100
Yes.

229
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,140
Your Highness.

230
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,320
Your Highness.

231
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,160
Your Highness.

232
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,060
Your Highness,

233
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
the drip has stopped.

234
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
Please legalize all the slaves.

235
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,740
You are too replaces.

236
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,920
Your Highness?

237
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,680
My mother has tost here.

238
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,960
You must foul on her.

239
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Get him back.

240
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I will always be with you, even if the stars and lights are out.

241
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I want to follow you in this life, I want to follow you in every rain and storm.

242
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,320
I want to follow you in every journey, I want to follow you in every heart.

243
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I want to follow you in every mountain and snow.

244
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,320
I want to follow you in every age, I want to follow you in every heart.

245
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I want to follow you in every time, I want to follow you in every moment.

246
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,320
I want to follow you in every storm and rain.

247
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,320
I want to follow you in every heart.

248
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,320
I want to follow you in every life.

249
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:02,320
Wait in Beijing

250
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,320
This life is like stars, a mashed´mashed´Mashed with hurt one glass

251
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,120
You can only play to the very end

252
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,320
In this capitalism of love, I put my clear heart into the hopelessness of their relationships

253
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,320
I'd rather spend all my time в this roving race

254
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Nothing can be changed.

255
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,640
A dream is like a life.

256
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,520
A song is like a song.
