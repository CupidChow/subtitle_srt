Good.

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,080
Water sword!

5
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,000
Good.

6
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,240
You did great.

7
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,160
Great and his life

8
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
is too short.

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,120

If he really wants to kill marnie

14
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,020
objection is simply that

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,520
How clever you think you can be.

18
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
Siu Zhi is loyal to Princess Royal.

19
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
If there is a lie,

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
then it is like this.

21
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
You are the master of my Qing Dynasty.

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
If you were Yu Dan,

23
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
there would be no smart people in the world.

24
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:14,040
So you still don't want to

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
This is late,

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll take it.

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
That's it.

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

29
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

30
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

31
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

32
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

37
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

38
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

39
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

41
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

43
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

44
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
The wind is so gentle.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
The wind is so gentle.

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
The moon is so bright.

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
We are running through time.

48
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
The snow is so bright.

49
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
We are running in a hurry.

50
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

51
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

52
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

53
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
I want to carve a treasure on it.

54
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
The silver bracelet is the perfect meaning.

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
It means the two worlds will be together.

56
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
If anything happens in the future,

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,840
I hope you can be honest with me.

58
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
I hope we can face it together.

59
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Okay. I promise you.

60
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Your Highness, this is the new place I rent for you.

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Your Highness, this is the new place I rent for you.

62
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
The house is much better than the house of Wen.

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Your Highness, please move in here.

64
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
I will find a better house for you.

65
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
The house is much better than the house of Wen.

66
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
I didn't expect that

67
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,840
we would have such a good house

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
after we were robbed by our parents.

69
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

70
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Your Highness, you are so kind to us.

71
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
How can we repay you?

72
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Madam, are you talking about Zhe Shan?

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Madam, are you talking about Zhe Shan?

74
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Madam, you are talking about Zhe Shan.

75
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Your Highness, we are not

76
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
the old ladies anymore.

77
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
If you don't mind,

78
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
from today on, call us

79
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
mother and father.

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
We will treat you like family.

81
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay.

82
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
You are too kind.

83
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
I have always treated you

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
as my own elder.

85
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
I think we should call you

86
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
as well.

87
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I don't want to.

88
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
We are family now.

89
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Don't be so polite.

90
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Sister, Brother Luo

91
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
ordered us a good meal at the Youth House.

92
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Let's go and receive the gift.

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
You are always thinking about food.

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
I don't know

95
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
how my daughter is doing now.

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Where is she?

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Is she dead or alive?

98
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
You are a lucky person.

99
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
If you don't have any news,

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
maybe it's the best news.

101
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
You can be safe

102
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
and sound.

103
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
We have a new house.

104
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Brother will find out

105
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,840
sooner or later.

106
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Mother, Baozhu is hungry.

107
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Let's go.

108
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Okay.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Mother, Baozhu is looking for you.

110
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
Madam, you are finally reunited with Baozhu.

111
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
I will cook for you.

112
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Okay.

113
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
The bride of the Buddha

114
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
is yours.

115
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Father,

116
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
don't let Pan'er go.

117
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
She will die if she eats.

118
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Pan'er, Pan'er.

119
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Pan'er.

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Mother,

121
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
what wish did you make to Buddha?

122
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
I wished for the Buddha

123
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,840
to be a blessing for Pan'er.

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Not only my mother,

125
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,840
but also the whole world.

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
Master,

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
why didn't you go to the restaurant?

128
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I ate too much.

129
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I sent Master and Madam to rest.

130
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
I want to come back and see the shop.

131
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Thank you for helping me.

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
You are welcome.

133
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
It's good

134
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
that the Wen family is released.

135
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Why do I see you sad?

136
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Did the Wen family bully you?

137
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
No.

138
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
The Wen family is nice to me.

139
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
But

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
I miss my mother.

141
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Look at my pig brain.

142
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
How could you forget this?

143
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Before she left, she reminded me

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
to give this to you.

145
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Mother sent me a letter.

146
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
It's a letter from Lv Xiuzai.

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
It's really from mother.

148
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Mother said she is much better.

149
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
It's just

150
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
that she misses me.

151
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Now that the Wen family is released,

152
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
it's a relief for you.

153
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
The business is booming.

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
You don't have to worry about it.

155
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Why don't you take the chance to go back?

156
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
I'm not going back.

157
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
I'm going to the shop.

158
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
I'm going to the shop.

159
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Why don't you take the chance to go back?

160
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Leave this to me and my wife.

161
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
I've learned a lot from your skills.

162
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I've saved some savings.

163
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I should bring mother here.

164
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
I'll go.

165
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
The Chief is here.

166
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
You can't enter the official's room.

167
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Official Song,

168
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
I respect you as an old official.

169
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
I don't want to touch you.

170
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
You'd better eat something

171
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
and let me in.

172
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
The official has told me

173
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
that no one is allowed to visit

174
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
before the Crown Prince enters the palace.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Are you going to disobey the order?

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
The official is forced to go to the palace

177
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
to see the Crown Prince.

178
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
The official was taken by you.

179
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
You are still in the dark.

180
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Official Song,

181
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
you said you were going to the Qing Dynasty.

182
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,840
What's the matter?

183
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm going to the Qing Dynasty today.

184
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Who dares to stop me?

185
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
If you insist,

186
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I'll go through the body of the official.

187
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
We'd rather die than obey.

188
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
We'd rather die than obey.

189
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
We'd rather die than obey.

190
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Official.

191
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Minister.

192
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Official.

193
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Minister.

194
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Official.

195
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Official.

196
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Official.

197
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Official.

198
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Mother.

199
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Mother.

200
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
You're back.

201
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
What are you doing?

202
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Where is Mother?

203
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Mother?

204
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Mother died long ago.

205
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
What?

206
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Mother.

207
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Mother.

208
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Mother.

209
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Mother.

210
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Mother died.

211
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
When did Mother die?

212
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
You think you sold yourself?

213
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Just that little money?

214
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Is it enough to treat my mother?

215
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
You should share it with me and Father.

216
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
This is the money I gave my mother.

217
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
This is the money I gave my mother.

218
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
You're not supposed to save me.

219
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
You...

220
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Mother died long ago.

221
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
But we're still alive.

222
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
We have to eat.

223
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Don't you think so?

224
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
And I'm telling you.

225
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
The last time,

226
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,840
we can't just let it go.

227
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
What do you want?

228
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Brother.

229
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Little sister is here.

230
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
It seems that the emperor's big day is coming.

231
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Before he agrees to let me fight,

232
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,840
you can't die.

233
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
You called me by surprise today.

234
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I didn't expect

235
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,840
you, a scholar,

236
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
to be so bold.

237
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
You dare to assassinate the officials

238
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
in the court.

239
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Your Highness,

240
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm just here to

241
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
help you clear the obstacles.

242
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Good.

243
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Before the crown prince

244
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
returns,

245
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,840
I must not leave this place.

246
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
I will not let you

247
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
leave this place.

248
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,840
When my brother returns,

249
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
hand over the power to me.

250
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Then everything will be settled.

251
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes.

252
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
What do you want?

253
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
A man should marry a woman.

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,840
Your brother hasn't married yet.

255
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
I've already married you

256
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,840
to that famous fool in the village.

257
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Tomorrow,

258
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,840
their family will come to marry.

259
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Marry?

260
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Good.

261
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm waiting.

262
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm waiting.

263
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Tie them up.

264
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,840
You...

265
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
What are you doing?

266
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
You're not filial.

267
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
What are you doing?

268
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
I want you to die with me.

269
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
I want you to die with me.

270
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I want you to die with me.

271
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
I want you to die with me.

272
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I want you to die with me.

273
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,840
I want you to die with me.

274
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I want you to die with me.

275
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I want you to die with me.

276
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I want you to die with me.

277
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
I want you to die with me.

278
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
I want you to die with me.

279
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,840
I want you to die with me.

280
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
I want you to die with me.

281
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I want you to die with me.

282
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I want you to die with me.

283
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,840
This life is like a rain and a gust of wind.

284
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,840
They are both turned into a sword.

285
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I turn my heart to think that this love is not too deep.

286
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,840
People get together and leave in a hurry.

287
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
I have already lost both hands.

288
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,840
I have you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.

289
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,840
This life is like a rain and a gust of wind.

290
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
They are both turned into a sword.

291
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,840
I turn my heart to think that this love is not too deep.

292
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,840
People get together and leave in a hurry.

293
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
I have already lost both hands.

294
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I have you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.

295
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,840
I have you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.

296
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,840
I have you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.

297
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I have you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.

298
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
This life is like a dream.

299
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I have you by my side, I have nothing to ask for.
