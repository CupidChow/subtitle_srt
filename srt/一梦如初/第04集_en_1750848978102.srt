1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Brother, it's me.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,600
He's the first son of the Zhuang family.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Why is he now with the Princess?

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
He doesn't care about the safety of the family.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
He doesn't care about the so-called literary fame?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He's even willing to be dragged by the world as a beast?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How should I explain to the King?

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I didn't expect Brother to be like this.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hush. Lower your voice.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He did it. Why can't he say it?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No wonder Brother wasn't locked up in prison.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's the one who became the Princess.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If this gets out, how will people look at our family?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Great Wolf Army is so greedy for wealth and peace.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They only care about their own happiness,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
not about their parents and sisters.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Our sister broke off her relationship with him.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
She won't be a member of the Wen family anymore.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't think so.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Maybe...

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
he has some reasons.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Calm down.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Great Wolf Army is no one.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're his sister.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He's not your brother.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's your brother.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He's your brother.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He's your brother.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No matter what, you're his sister.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You should know that.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No matter what,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
he won't ignore his family's safety and only care about his own happiness.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Before he's in full power,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
he can't forget about the chaos.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
At least we know now

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that the Great Wolf Army is safe and sound.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a good thing.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's quite cautious.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're here to serve him.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's still suffering in the prison.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Since he's gone,

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
what good day can it be?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Your Highness, may you be blessed with good health.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go and check on him.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's just a difficult task.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How can we do it?

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What?

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's wrong?

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Your Highness, please calm down.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have something to report.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You may leave.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Your Highness,

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Prince Qi has been found.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's a well-known person.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He's the head of the legal council

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that the Great Buddha Temple doesn't have.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Interesting.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, the seventh brother

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
has been hiding in the Great Buddha Temple.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm so lucky to find him.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It seems that the opportunity has come.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's both good at martial arts and martial arts.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If he can go out and help me,

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it'll be a blessing in disguise.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are so many guests today.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's really a good time to get together.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My food will surely sell out.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Your Highness,

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
please don't worry.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll be back soon.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Your Highness,

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
please don't worry.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's from a rich family.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Your Highness.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please bless my Pan'er.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mother, what wish did you make to Buddha?

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I wish

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
to have the whole life of

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
my Pan'er.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How can that be?

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Peace and prosperity,

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,600
The peace of the heart and the life of the child is complete.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The most important thing in a woman's life is to be complete.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Mother, I may let you down.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I dare not ask for the so-called life to be complete.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I only ask for the person I love to be healthy and safe.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This back shadow is so familiar.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Baoyin, please believe me.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You must have your reasons for doing this.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I heard that Wen family was going to be executed.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now we are spared the death penalty.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think you must have moved out secretly.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you for taking care of my mother.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You must be tired.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm tired.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I was hiding from you that you were here.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't want to tell you.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll thank you in person if I have a chance.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Take care, Your Highness.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wen family is still young.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They are afraid that you will return home safely.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Aren't you afraid that Wen family and I are both bad people?

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I only know Wen family treats me well.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You saved me once.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's enough.

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Your Highness.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There is no Zhao Hua Ying in this world.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There is only one monk here.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please forgive me.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But the Chief Princess already knows who the host is.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
She has been looking for me for many years.

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This day will come sooner or later.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Tell the Crown Prince to rest assured.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I promised him that I would never break my promise.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I also wronged you.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Staying by his side is not a good thing.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I will never forget it.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will never break my promise.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I also wronged you.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Staying by his side is not a good thing.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
With this sentence,

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the Crown Prince is forced to be a great man.

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bring another bottle when you come again.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Your pickled vegetables taste good.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

130
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't know if I will meet the big man again.

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Who are you looking for?

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Get lost.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh no.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wen Song came here to hide from the Chief Princess.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If she sees us...

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wen Song.

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You heartless man.

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You got the glory and wealth.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now you want to break the engagement?

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No way.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not like that.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Listen to my explanation.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What else?

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When you were asking about the past,

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
you said that you were going to break the engagement.

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But you didn't.

147
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You didn't.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You didn't.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You didn't.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know what?

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You seduced a maid from Wen Mansion

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
to be my maid forever.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Now the Wen family is in trouble.

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You didn't care about your sister and parents.

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You don't even accept my engagement.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You are a lady of the old dynasty.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You are a phoenix.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Since you want to be my maid forever,

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
you can't do anything.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I came here to tell you

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
not to wait for me.

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Take the money

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and marry a good man.

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is too much.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Your Highness.

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your Highness?

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Who are you fooling?

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This little money

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
is useless to me.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Your Highness.

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Your Highness.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please forgive me.

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Please give me justice.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's all my fault.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I believe you.

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This lady is so greedy.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Kill her.

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The Demon Gate is closed.

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can't kill her.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Brother Qi.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Brother Qi.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You made me look for you

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
after we parted this year.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The King of Qi died

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
in the fire 12 years ago.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm just a monk

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
who sent the Buddha with one heart

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and never asked about the world.

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Brother Qi.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have a lot to tell you.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No matter who you are now,

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I will always know

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that you are my most respected brother.

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Everyone knows

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that the King of Qi who was famous

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
shouldn't have ended like this.

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Forget it.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If you are willing to forgive

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the innocent two people,

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I will ask you to come in and talk to me.

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
God has the ability to survive.

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You should also

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
do something for yourself.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I also hope that

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can pray for you for many years.

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Get out of here.

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The King of Qi

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What?

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Are you still thinking about your lover?

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't make fun of me.

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or are you still thinking about your family?

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I just like to humiliate you

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and make you love someone you can't get.

215
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Today is the festival.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It is indeed a good day

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
for a family to reunite.

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It is indeed a good day for a family to reunite.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You still think you are

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
the leader of Qingfeng Lao Yue?

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If you beg me,

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I will let you go to the prison.

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The King of Qi

224
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The truth

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If you are not similar to that person,

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I am not the kind person

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
who can protect your family

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and that woman.

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you are not serious,

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
you will lose.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I feel sorry for you

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
for being so ungrateful.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I know you are a man of style.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But since you are with me,

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you should lose

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
your pride.

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Otherwise,

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you will hurt others

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and yourself.

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I will lose this time.

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Look at how serious you are.

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
As long as I am happy,

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it is not easy to make someone live.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Today is the festival.

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I will spend the day with you

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and go to the prison to meet your parents.

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Look how nice I am to you.

248
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't be so jealous

249
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
when you are not satisfied.

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
These buildings

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
are interesting.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Thank you for your concern.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I will go now.

254
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I am busy.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I made some green beans

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and pork for you.

257
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Please come over.

258
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Thank you, Brother Luo.

259
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I also made some dishes

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
for you.

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Please take them back.

262
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Thank you.

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wait.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Why is your shirt torn?

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let me help you.

266
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It is okay.

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You are doing business

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and I can do it myself.

269
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It is not hard.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It is here.

271
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Compared with before,

272
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we can earn money and eat well.

273
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It is better than many people.

274
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It is done.

275
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Thank you.

276
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If there is nothing else,

277
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I will go back first.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It is okay.

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It is okay.

280
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I will go first.

281
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Brother Luo.

282
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Brother Luo.

283
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Brother Luo.

284
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Brother Luo.

285
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Brother Luo.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Brother Luo.

287
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Brother Luo.

288
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Brother Luo.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Brother Luo.

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Brother Luo.

291
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Brother Luo.

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Brother Luo.

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Brother Luo.

294
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Brother Luo.

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Brother Luo.

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Brother Luo.

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Brother Luo.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Brother Luo.

299
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Brother Luo.

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Brother Luo.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Brother Luo.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Brother Luo.

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Brother Luo.

304
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Brother Luo.

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Brother Luo.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Brother Luo.

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Brother Luo.

308
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Brother Luo.

309
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Brother Luo.

310
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Brother Luo.
