1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
You gave my family much less money.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,680
Wear the head band and rosary the command.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:21,080
Grab pagan reverse clothes,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,800
We got four over differentiate Japanese and Chinese women.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Why is the money you sent to your family getting less and less?

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm your brother.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,000
What's wrong with you after eating a few bowls of wontons?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,600
Get lost!

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Whether you change your name or sell yourself,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
you're still my family.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,400
Wait and see!

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,000
If you're tired, just take the medicine.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
You don't have to wait for me every time.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
I have to settle accounts.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Go and sit down.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
I'll make you a bowl of wontons.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,600
Did something happen?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Nothing.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Everything is fine.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,600
I know you're strong.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
But it's for the outsiders, isn't it?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,400
My brother from my hometown

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
came to ask for money today.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I kicked him out.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,800
They treated me like that.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Now they're asking for money

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
just because I'm doing well.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
I really can't stand this.

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Did he bully you?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
I kicked him out long ago.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
If he dares to come again,

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
come to me at any time.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,800
I know.

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
I can handle him for now.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
It's getting late.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
leave.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Then you should eat something before you leave.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll do it now.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
It'll be quick.

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,600
Mr. Big, the wontons are ready.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Please eat some.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,800
The Untamed

45
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Episode 2

46
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
Isn't that the eldest son of Wen Family?

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
How did he become the eldest princess's face?

48
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,000
Didn't you go to see the boat on the fourth street?

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
So that's how it is.

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
He's really bold.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He dared to touch the eldest princess.

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
I can't blame him this time.

53
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
You wait outside.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
The Untamed

55
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
If you can convince the officials

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
to cooperate,

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
I won't hesitate to do it.

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't want to give you

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,000
a lot of money.

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Do you think our Qing Dynasty

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
needs you?

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Of course.

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,800
We know what the eldest princess wants.

64
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,400
If the eldest princess decides to take over,

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll try my best to help.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,200
I hope the eldest princess can make a big change.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
Why should I?

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I heard that you've

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
helped a lot of people in Qing Dynasty.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
If you're really sincere,

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
help me to get rid of the trouble

72
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
before you make any conditions.

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
What you mean is...

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
Crown Prince.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Crown Prince.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Little bastard.

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Fine.

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I knew it was you

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
who stole money last time.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
So what if it was me?

81
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,600
Your shop

82
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
is originally owned by my Chen family.

83
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,400
I'm the ninth generation of Chen family.

84
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a good thing to get some money.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
If you want money,

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
I won't be

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
bullied by your Chen family again.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
If you want money,

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
I can reward you if you want to fight.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Don't think that you're here to bully me.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
I dare not come again.

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
Chen Pan'er.

93
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,600
You know what you've done.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Stop talking nonsense.

95
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
I'll catch you to the police station.

96
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,800
Yes.

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,600
Go.

98
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm her brother.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
I can't just leave her alone.

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Chen Pan'er.

101
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

102
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
You and the head of the Princess's family

103
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,800
were kissing here.

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,600
What are you talking about?

105
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,800
What?

106
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Now you know it's embarrassing?

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I told you.

108
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
I even told you loudly.

109
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,600
I want everyone in Bianyang to know

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that you and the head of the Princess's family

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
are very close.

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Baoyin, do you need any help?

114
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
It's okay.

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
I've done nothing.

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,600
If you dare to talk nonsense,

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll rip your mouth off.

118
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,200
Don't blame me

119
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
for not recognizing you as my brother

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
and arresting you to the police station.

121
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
I don't care if you've done it or not.

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Go ahead and report it.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Go ahead and report it.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
If you go to the police station,

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
I'll tell the head of the Princess's family

126
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,240
Hey, guess what?

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
If the Princess knows

128
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,240
you're having an affair with her,

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,440
how long can you live?

130
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,080
How long can your lover live?

131
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,800
You'd better

132
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,440
prepare the pocket money for me.

133
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,480
I'll come back to get it.

134
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,360
You...

135
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,680
Baoyin,

136
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,360
does the government care about this?

137
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
He's your brother after all.

138
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,920
No.

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:14,120
The

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,040
grands definitively trapped

141
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
Now the news is spreading in Bianyang.

142
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,160
Even a three-year-old will be shocked.

143
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,600
Although there is no solid evidence,

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
the court will certainly criticize you.

145
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,680
It's a secret meeting with Xirong.

146
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,240
Who leaked the news?

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,960
event

148
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,960
Report.

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,760
Your Highness.

150
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
News are baik.

151
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
Xirong is qualified to have a discussion with us.

152
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,640
The Eagle Robe Command has ordered L 너ve to go to Beijing to negotiate.

153
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,160
Lord Fu is chosen by his reliable and exceptional opera.

154
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Awith the Crown Prince, it's inappropriate.

155
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,480
In this elderly thing,

156
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,480
Xirong just decided to spread the rumor

157
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,960
Hiding the truth should get to the blue

158
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,420
and stick out their must for the imperial court.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,120
Pass my orders.

160
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
Everyone affordable in the city

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480
who buys the chance,

162
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,460
catch them all.

163
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,980
Yes,으�

164
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,120
I'll go.

165
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,480
Your Grace.

166
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,840
You left me a signal with red silk.

167
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
Is there anything urgent?

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,400
My brother

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
found out

170
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,000
your relationship with the Princess Royal.

171
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,960
I was afraid that he would sue you

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,960
and asked you to discuss the solution.

173
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,840
Your brother sued me?

174
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
What evidence do you have?

175
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,080
He has no evidence.

176
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,760
He just saw you eating wontons

177
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
and talked nonsense

178
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,000
and made a mess.

179
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
If the whole city knows about it,

180
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm afraid it will upset the Princess Royal.

181
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
It's all your fault.

182
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm not afraid of these rumors.

183
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm just afraid that it will be bad for you

184
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,960
and ruin your reputation.

185
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm afraid that

186
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,040
it will affect your marriage.

187
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,680
I...

188
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,960
I don't want to get married.

189
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
The Wen family has ruined you.

190
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,720
You're old enough to get married.

191
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,640
Why don't you

192
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,240
find a good husband?

193
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,720
If you don't love me,

194
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,080
why don't you never marry me?

195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
You're so carefree.

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
I don't care

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,000
about rumors.

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm afraid that I'll ruin your reputation.

199
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,360
It's easy to make him shut up.

200
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,760
But it's all about the dream.

201
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,400
But he's your brother.

202
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
That idiot

203
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
is so stupid.

204
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,080
He doesn't need to get your hands dirty.

205
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,640
Wu Lai is not afraid of anything.

206
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
Not afraid of anything?

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
I have someone to choose from.

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,840
He's afraid of anything.

209
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,080
Your Majesty.
