00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
The White Dragon

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,900
Episode 19

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,900
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
Episode 16

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,900
I, Chen Pan'er,

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,900
was a poor and poor girl.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,900
The Magistrate has been a nun

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,900
and has been a nun for many years.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900
My father couldn't pay me,

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,900
so he had to set me up.

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,900
Can I

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
survive?

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,900
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Taoism Grandmaster

15
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Hurry, they are there.

16
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Grab the rope and don't let them run away.

17
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Hurry, this way.

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,900
When I thought I could escape successfully,

19
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,900
I never thought that

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,900
the trap was a lie.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,900
Taoism Grandmaster

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Watch them.

23
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,900
We'll get a ride.

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Everything is designed.

25
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
The Magistrate will set us up first,

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
then send someone to catch us.

27
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Good sister, don't cry.

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Anyway, we are going to be sold

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
to the Chungui Courtyard tonight.

30
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,900
What should we do?

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
This is our fate.

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
Just give up.

33
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
The Magistrate said

34
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
as long as the delivery is good,

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
our brothers' rewards will be enough.

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,900
We are going to be sold.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,900
There must be a way.

38
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
Don't think about it.

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
They are the officials

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,900
who have been selling people

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,900
for money.

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Whether they are sold to Chungui Courtyard

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
or run away like you,

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,900
they will be killed in the end.

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,900
Yes.

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Are you ready?

47
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
The maids will be here

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
in a few days.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Don't waste your energy.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
No matter what,

51
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
it's a dead end.

52
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
It's said to be dead.

53
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,900
I have to choose

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,900
how to die.

55
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Get the maids on the carriage.

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Yes.

57
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Yes.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
Yes.

59
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Yes.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Yes.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Yes.

62
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Yes.

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Yes.

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Yes.

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Yes.

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Yes.

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Yes.

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,900
Yes.

69
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Yes.

70
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Yes.

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Get the maids on the carriage.

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Yes.

73
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
The Magistrate is not only corrupt,

74
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
but also a priest

75
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
who is sold to women.

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,900
It's important to save people.

77
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I'll tell the Crown Prince later.

78
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,900
The delivery vehicle is coming.

79
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Get all maids on the carriage.

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
No need to resist.

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,900
Don't panic.

82
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
Yes.

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
What are you thinking?

84
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
You can't run away?

85
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
Do you want to die

86
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,900
or give yourself

87
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,900
another chance to choose?

88
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
We can choose

89
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
ourselves.

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
I don't want to do this.

91
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
I want to sleep for a while.

92
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
I want to try it too.

93
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I'll try it.

94
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,900
I'll do it too.

95
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Hurry up.

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
This is the way.

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
One, two, three.

98
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
One, two, three.

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
This is the way.

100
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
We can do it.

101
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
We can do it.

102
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Who is she?

103
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
Is she here to kill us?

104
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Run!

105
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Run!

106
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Let's go.

107
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Hurry up.

108
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Hurry up.

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Good job.

110
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
The delivery vehicle is coming.

111
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Get rid of it.

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Yes.

113
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
I'm late.

114
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
I couldn't save the others.

115
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
I can only ask you.

116
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Madam, what are you doing?

118
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Don't move.

119
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Don't move.

120
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm here to handle the case.

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Don't be afraid.

122
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I was too hasty

123
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
to do that.

124
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Please forgive me.

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
I was trying to avoid

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
your murder.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
So

128
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,900
you saved me.

129
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm so grateful to you.

130
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
I can't forget it.

131
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
If you think I'm too hasty

132
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
to see you,

133
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
you can go to the Bianyang Mansion

134
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
to find me.

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Don't misunderstand.

136
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
I won't hurt you.

137
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
I'll repay you

138
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
in my own way.

139
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

140
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

141
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

143
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

144
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

145
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

146
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

147
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

148
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

149
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

150
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

151
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

152
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

153
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

154
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

155
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

156
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

157
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

158
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

159
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
I'll repay you in my own way.

160
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Where is your home?

161
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
I'll send you back.

162
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Don't worry about the government.

163
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I'll go to the city and the city.

164
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Go home.

165
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
You.

166
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
This is your home?

167
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
I...

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Yes.

169
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
This is my home.

170
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Little lady.

176
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Do you know

177
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
where this is?

178
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
I know.

179
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm here

180
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,900
to sell myself.

181
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Sell yourself?

182
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Where are your parents?

183
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
I don't need parents.

184
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I can be my own master.

185
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
They all want me dead.

186
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
I have to choose a way to live for myself.

187
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
The bride of He's God this year

188
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
is you.

189
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
I'm not.

190
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
I'm not.

191
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
I'm not.

192
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
I raised you up.

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
What's the use?

194
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Do you think you're worth the money?

195
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Do I have to go because I'm a nanny?

196
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Is nanny not worthy of living?

197
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Little lady.

198
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Little lady.

199
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
You can't let Pan'er go.

200
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
Pan'er is your wife.

201
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
You're too fast.

202
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
The family has run out of food.

203
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
My son is starving to death.

204
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Mother.

205
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Don't beg him.

206
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
It's useless.

207
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
A father like this will only think for himself.

208
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
He will never really think for us.

209
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Go there.

210
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Let him go.

211
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
How dare you run away from us.

212
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
I know the name of our family.

213
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Do you want it?

214
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I only want this silver.

215
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
I'll let you go.

216
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Don't worry.

217
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
I'll give you four taels of silver.

218
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
This world.

219
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Where is this person?

220
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
I don't know.

221
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
I don't know.

222
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
I don't know.

223
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
I don't know.

224
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
I don't know.

225
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
I don't know.

226
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
I don't know.

227
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
I don't know.

228
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
I don't know.

229
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
I don't know.

230
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
I don't know.

231
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
This person

232
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
is not as good as the silver.

233
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Listen up.

234
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
This time,

235
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
we'll go to Bianyang Mansion

236
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
to find you a good place.

237
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Go.

238
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Pan'er.

239
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Pan'er.

240
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Pan'er.

241
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Pan'er.

242
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Mother.

243
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I have no way out.

244
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
I have to leave here.

245
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Pan'er.

246
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
Father can't let us go home.

247
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
He can buy himself

248
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
and pay you for the treatment.

249
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
By the way,

250
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
what's your name?

251
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
My name is Chen.

252
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
This person

253
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
is not as good as the silver.

254
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
My name is Bao Yin.

255
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Chen Bao Yin.

256
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Pan'er.

257
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
Mother, I'm sorry.

258
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
God gave me

259
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
the chance to escape from death.

260
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
I can't go back to the source.

261
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
The past Chen Pan'er is dead.

262
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
From now on,

263
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
I'm Chen Bao Yin.

264
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
It's not worth it.

265
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
I'll decide for myself.

266
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

267
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

268
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

269
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

270
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

271
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

272
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

273
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

274
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

275
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

276
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

277
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

278
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

279
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
I'll go to the capital with you.

280
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
I wish to see you forever.

281
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,080
My love is stronger than the

282
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,900
I wish to enjoy the night with you.

283
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
I want to follow you in this life.

284
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Every rain and wind

285
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
I want to follow you in this life.

286
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
I want to follow you in this life.

287
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
I want to follow you in this life.

288
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
I want to follow you in this life.

289
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
I want to follow you in this life.

290
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
I want to follow you in this life.

291
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,900
I wish to follow you in this life.

292
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
I want to follow you in this life.

293
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I wish to follow you in this life.

294
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
In my heart,

295
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
I will follow you to the end of heaven.

296
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,900
I want to follow you in this life.

297
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
I want to follow you in this life.

298
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
In my heart,

299
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I want to follow you to the end of heaven.
