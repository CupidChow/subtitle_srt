1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Even if I want your head,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you're willing to do it?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm willing to do it.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Get up.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm not wrong about this friend of mine.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't do that kind of thing

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wen Guan is dead because he was sent to the army.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't explain it to him.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But I know

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what Ru Chu has done for me these years.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He has lost many times.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know it.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So,

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you won't blame him anymore?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He made such a big mistake.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If I still protect him,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll hurt him.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do you understand the reason?

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I understand.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have my difficulties.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What can I do?

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know you're scolding people in Bianyang.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The words you've said

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
can be written in the book.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll give you a chance today.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll let you speak for Ru Chu.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If I don't want to say it,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you can just say it.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll obey.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The officials are here.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Long live Your Majesty.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Get up.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I heard that

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Lord Wen transferred the troops of the King of Ying without permission.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And he broke into the city.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's really bold.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I hope Your Majesty can see it.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your Majesty.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Lord Wen transferred the troops

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
because I was beaten.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He did it in a hurry.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you want to blame him,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
blame me.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Whose fault is this?

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We can't stop this little girl.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We don't know

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
her relationship with Wen Su yet.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If we want to save her,

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
we don't need to use the military armor.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In my opinion,

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
it's a crime to cover up for Wen Su.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wen Su has been in the dark

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
because of the officials' favor.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now she's in such a big trouble.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The reason behind it

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
will never be so simple.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Did Lord Zhang

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
say that His Majesty is a marquis?

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been from Qingzhou to the capital.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've been through the whole Qing Dynasty

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and met all kinds of people.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you know what they say

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
when they talk about His Majesty?

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Lord's dream has come true.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Qing Dynasty will be prosperous.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't mean that.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I just don't like Wen Su.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He was born as a face-to-face.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now he's been given credit

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and is being treated harshly.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm afraid he can do anything.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The law of Qing Dynasty

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
says that

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you can't be an official if you're a face-to-face.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He was born in the third year of the Lian Zhong.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He was a man of honor.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He was a man of honor.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He had to be a thief to save his parents.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's a joke.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He spent years of his life

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
to destroy the evil plan of the thief

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and return Qing Dynasty to its glory.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's his loyalty to His Majesty.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
As an official,

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
His Majesty gave you the right to speak.

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He didn't let you say whatever you wanted

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and say whatever you wanted.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Our people have a saying,

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
people's words are worth hearing.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Lord Zhang,

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
do you understand

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
this?

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You!

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What did you say?

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There's a bloodbath in the court

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but you refuse to give evidence.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now you've caught a target

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and you're acting on your own.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I know my words are worth hearing.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've also been bold and

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
retorted in front of my words.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now I understand

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
that the wrong person shouldn't be the one who was destroyed

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but the one who has the most people in the world

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and is evil.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I swear by my life

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
that I'm not guilty.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Your Majesty,

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
this woman is not different from the black and white.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She's always trying to help Wenzu.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can't listen to her.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll tell her myself.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Qing Zhou is rich and powerful.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The tax is too high and the law is too corrupt.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm here to take revenge on the court.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm here to borrow the troops from Prince Ying

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and arrest Feng Gui.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm guilty for the misconduct.

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Feng Gui is here to take revenge on the court

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and is corrupt.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The evidence is solid.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's sent to the Court of Judicial Review.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As for you...

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know I was wrong.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm willing to resign myself

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and never come back.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your Majesty.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Your Majesty.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Have you made up your mind?

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Your Majesty.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've sent troops to arrest the criminal.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I've been working for the Court for five years.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can make up for it.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've been strict with my job

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and I've been strict with my law.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've even been asked to take the test.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If I make a mistake

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and ask for forgiveness,

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll have no reason to ask anyone else

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to take the test.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's the best solution.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Then you can go.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Your Majesty is wise.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wen Su.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Wen Su?

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why did you call me by my name?

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Did you really decide to resign?

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's all my fault.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I insisted on leaving you.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I shouldn't have done that.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I shouldn't have done that.

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I thought that was the best solution for you.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now I understand

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that the one who made the mistake shouldn't be the one who was defamed.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you're the one who did it,

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
you shouldn't have cared about those defamation.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If I ask you again,

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
will you believe me?

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I believe you.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I just don't believe myself.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
for making you cry for five years

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and losing you.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've never blamed you.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't do it before.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I won't do it again.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm just afraid that you'll be disappointed in me.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm willing to wait for you.

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm willing to wait for you

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
for a day or a lifetime.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then,

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
can you still remember

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
what you said in the cave?

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What did I say?

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Great-grandma.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Great-grandma.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What's wrong?

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My husband drank too much outside today

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and came back to take a shower.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He doesn't usually get people to serve him.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's been more than half an hour now.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He didn't respond to my change.

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think he was drugged

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and didn't want to drink too much.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He kept saying that he couldn't get out of the coma.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He asked me to find you to help him.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Me?

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But his wound is bleeding.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm not sure.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Please go and see him.

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll go and see him.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Great-grandma.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Great-grandma.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What's wrong?

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Your Highness.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I feel so bad.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Great-grandma.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Your Highness.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Someone drugged me.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Stay away from me.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I can't stand it.

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Go.

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Go.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Who's going to hurt you?

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is it because of the court today?

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Chun Shui Demon is so vicious.

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There are so many people who drugged him.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He knows what he cares about the most.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But he destroyed him.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If he lost his temper outside today,

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
he would really end it

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
with his character.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Forget it.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm not going to do it again.

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I burn my snow boots to wish upon you.

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I get drunk my whole life,

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but it's been hard for me for ten years

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and this is the first time

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I've ever watered broken m Wyld.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,340
His Green-Eyes Teeth

269
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,500
A ghost lake林

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Let's go to sleep now.

271
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Five years ago,

272
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,640
I couldn't love him

273
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,540
and couldn't help myself.

274
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,560
Toleness was shameful

275
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,600
to me

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Even if I hate myself,

277
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
you're the only one who believes in me,

278
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
loves me,

279
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,480
waits for me, protects me.

280
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,080
You're more clear-cut,

281
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
more long-term,

282
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,000
and more transparent than I am.

283
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
These five years,

284
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I've been through many difficulties

285
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
with the power you gave me.

286
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,280
With you by my side,

287
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,840
I can overcome any obstacles

288
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and overcome any obstacles.

289
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
I have nothing else to ask for.

290
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,760
But this ending is still a pity.

291
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,000
If you change your identity

292
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
and re-join the Spring Festival,

293
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,800
it's not a promise, is it?

294
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,440
You're so talented

295
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
and you have nowhere to go.

296
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,320
I feel so bad for you.

297
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,800
There's nothing to be sad about.

298
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,640
Didn't you say

299
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
the full moon is a loss,

300
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,960
the water is full, it's a gain,

301
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
and the man is full, it's a loss.

302
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,800
This is a hard thing to do,

303
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,160
but it's worth it.

304
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
If you're not full, you're actually full.

305
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,640
Cherish everything

306
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,040
and never forget this life.

307
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Are you satisfied?

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,600
One must enjoy happiness.

309
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,240
One must have fun.

310
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,680
Life is perfect and satisfactory.

311
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,920
A life withoutanterity

312
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
is not for some crazy love.

313
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
It's for the love,

314
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
loyalty,

315
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
and the initial intention of accompanying each other.

316
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,920
As long as we walk together in the long years,

317
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
never leave each other,

318
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
and spend a difficult and happy time,

319
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
we are already content.

320
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I have been waiting for you for a long time,

321
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
only you do not know.

322
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I can go to the retribution,

323
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
and die,

324
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
with a clear heart.

325
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Every rain and wind,

326
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
I will accompany you,

327
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
and share my heart with you,

328
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
to the end of the world.

329
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
I will be with you forever,

330
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
and we will meet again.

331
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,920
As if we were not old friends.

332
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
This life and this life,

333
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
every rain and wind,

334
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
they are all the witness.

335
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
I can go to the retribution,

336
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
and die,

337
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
with a clear heart.

338
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
I can go to the retribution,

339
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
and share my heart with you,

340
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,920
to the end of the world.

341
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,920
I am used to this life,

342
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
The flowers fall into the brocade

343
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,920
and the love is still there.

344
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
We meet and part,

345
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
we are in love and we are apart.

346
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
We need to be in love for a lifetime.

347
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
In this moment of love,

348
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I want to hold your hand.

349
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
The wind and rain are entangled,

350
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
I can't understand.

351
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I want to be with you forever.

352
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
The prosecutor said you are not Ahorae.

353
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
I'm with you forever.

354
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
We are in love and we are apart.

355
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
The hair of his heart interview the Russia and your hair of destiny.

356
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I want you with me for a lifetime,

357
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I can't understand.

358
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
In this moment of love,

359
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
I want to hold your hand.

360
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
The wind and rain are entangled,

361
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
I can't understand.

362
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
I want to follow you forever,

363
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm with you,

364
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I call you by a brother.

365
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
I'll give you my whole life

366
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I'll give you my whole life

367
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
I'll give you my whole life

368
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
I'll give you my whole life

369
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I'll give you my whole life

370
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
I'll give you my whole life

371
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
I'll give you my whole life

372
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I'll give you my whole life

373
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
I'll give you my whole life

374
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
I'll give you my whole life

375
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
I'll give you my whole life

376
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
