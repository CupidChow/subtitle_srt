1
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:24,160
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,104
(I'm burning with fever,
you're burning with desire)

3
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:27,717
=Episode 14=

4
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:29,077
Lu Zhen'er,

5
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:30,437
refuse to kneel?

6
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:33,317
Guards! Make her kneel.

7
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:34,397
- Yes.
- Yes.

8
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,397
Let me go!

9
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,357
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,256
Greetings, Your Majesty.

11
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,397
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

12
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:53,397
Your Majesty,
Lu Zhen'er has shown me disrespect.

13
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:54,797
That's why

14
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,117
I ordered someone to lecture her.

15
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:00,357
Disrespect must be punished.

16
00:01:01,517 --> 00:01:03,437
Your Majesty, you have no idea

17
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,117
how arrogantly she treated me
moments ago.

18
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,237
She mocked me,
saying I'd end up like her.

19
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:10,677
When I demanded an apology,

20
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,117
she completely ignored my order.

21
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,597
Your Majesty, I'm a Noble Consort.

22
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,437
How dare she treat me like this?

23
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:18,597
Lu Zhen'er,

24
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:20,517
did you really treat her that way?

25
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:21,717
I've done nothing wrong.

26
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:23,157
Why should I kneel?

27
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:25,757
Does your innocence matter?

28
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:28,197
You're a slave.

29
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,237
She is your master.

30
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:32,117
You obey whatever she commands.

31
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,517
You have no right to judge.

32
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,037
You know who's boss here, right?

33
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:41,397
Lu Zhen'er,

34
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:43,077
apologize to Noble Consort now!

35
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:52,637
Yes.

36
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:54,477
I acknowledge my fault.

37
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,157
Punish me, Your Highness.

38
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:04,197
Forget it. I won't stoop to your level.

39
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:05,757
(Xiao Wenjing,)

40
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:09,277
(are you sure
we should torment each other?)

41
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,317
(So hungry.)

42
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,517
(Since Xiao Wenjing issued that decree,)

43
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,317
(the Laundry Service stopped
feeding me.)

44
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:40,877
Who did this?

45
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:51,197
You?

46
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,757
Don't disturb my sleep.

47
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:53,557
Are you insane?

48
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:56,157
Did you pour water on my blanket?

49
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:57,677
What blanket?

50
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,597
I know nothing.

51
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,197
What are you doing?

52
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,917
Throwing your weight around
in the Laundry Service?

53
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,837
Still imagine yourself as Consort Lu?

54
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:07,797
His Majesty decreed long ago

55
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:08,957
that everyone in the palace,

56
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,557
whether maid or eunuch,

57
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,877
may order you about.

58
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:14,117
If you dare disobey,

59
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:15,837
we'll report you to His Majesty

60
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,197
and he'll punish you.

61
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:36,997
What are you doing?

62
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,037
What are you doing?

63
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,317
What are you doing?

64
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:47,517
Won't let me sleep?

65
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:49,077
Then none of you will sleep.

66
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:50,597
His Majesty may punish me,

67
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,957
but if any of you bully me,

68
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,797
I'll fight you to the death.

69
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,397
I always repay grievances

70
00:03:57,397 --> 00:03:59,237
and settle scores.

71
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:00,917
Why the big attitude?

72
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,677
His Majesty abandoned you anyway.

73
00:04:03,717 --> 00:04:04,557
Exactly!

74
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,397
Why the big attitude?

75
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,357
(Xiao Wenjing,)

76
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:12,637
(you are so mean!)

77
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:15,077
(You're actually serious about this.)

78
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:22,797
Lu Zhen'er, get up now!

79
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,197
No slacking allowed!

80
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,357
Lu Zhen'er! Up!

81
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,237
What are you doing?

82
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,077
Your Highness.

83
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:30,997
How dare you!

84
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:33,357
What's wrong
with disciplining a lazy maid?

85
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,837
She's no longer a consort!

86
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:36,957
Quit acting like a consort here.

87
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,237
Showing mercy costs nothing.

88
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:39,877
She might

89
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,557
regain imperial favor someday.

90
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:47,997
Your Highness, are you alright?

91
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,237
You're burning up!

92
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:52,757
Your Highness, wait here.

93
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:54,557
I'll fetch the imperial physician.

94
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,197
Eunuch Fu, please wait.

95
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,237
Miss Yindan,

96
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:04,717
where are you rushing to?

97
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,877
Consort Lu has fallen ill.

98
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:08,637
The imperial physicians won't treat her,

99
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:11,077
claiming it's His Majesty's orders.

100
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,997
Please plead with His Majesty.

101
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,237
Consort Lu is ill?

102
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,877
I'll report to His Majesty at once.

103
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:16,437
Come with me.

104
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:17,437
Stop!

105
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,397
What are you doing?

106
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:22,237
Your Highness,

107
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,517
Consort Lu is ill.

108
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,397
I'll report to Your Majesty.

109
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:26,957
Consort Lu is ill?

110
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,637
She was full of vitality days ago.

111
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:32,397
How could she fall ill suddenly?

112
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,477
Could it be she's faking illness

113
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:35,877
just to skip work?

114
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,437
Her Highness would never do that.

115
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,557
How dare you!

116
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,077
What do you think you are?

117
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,477
How dare you speak to me like that!

118
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:43,997
You ill-mannered wretch!

119
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:45,637
Kneel here right now!

120
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:47,877
You'll rise only

121
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,557
when I permit it.

122
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,557
Without my order,

123
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:57,037
don't enter
or disturb His Majesty and me.

124
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,317
Don't worry, Miss Yindan.

125
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,797
His Majesty may come out shortly.

126
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:22,517
What's that outside?

127
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:25,037
Just a nobody. I've dismissed her.

128
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:26,677
Be quiet.

129
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:27,997
Don't laugh.

130
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:28,797
Yes.

131
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:33,197
Eunuch Fu, Consort Lu is gravely ill.

132
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:34,877
No more delays.

133
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:35,717
Don't panic.

134
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,477
I'll fetch the physician.

135
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:38,637
Thank you.

136
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:55,917
Your Highness,

137
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,717
thank you today.

138
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:00,717
No thanks needed between us.

139
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:13,557
Here.

140
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,477
Thank you.

141
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:24,597
No thanks between us.

142
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:26,677
If you thank me again,

143
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:27,957
I will be angry.

144
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:32,437
Zhen'er,

145
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:34,637
His Majesty is harsh to you.

146
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,357
Still wish to stay in the palace?

147
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,357
Do I have any other choices?

148
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:41,677
If you want,

149
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:42,997
I can take you out of the palace.

150
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:45,797
How?

151
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,037
I'll devise a way.

152
00:07:48,277 --> 00:07:50,117
I only ask if you want to.

153
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:54,077
Greetings, Your Highness.

154
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:55,557
Greetings, Your Highness.

155
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,077
Zhen'er is seriously ill.

156
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,757
His Majesty just summoned a physician.

157
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:01,397
How utterly heartless!

158
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:04,957
Fu An, who sent you here,

159
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:06,077
Yindan or His Majesty?

160
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:08,157
Your Highness,

161
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,157
His Majesty

162
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:09,997
is occupied.

163
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,357
So it wasn't His Majesty.

164
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:14,557
Zhen'er, look.

165
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,997
This is the man
you once trusted and relied on.

166
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,797
Your Highness, His Majesty is busy.

167
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,997
So I dare not disturb him.

168
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:23,957
If His Majesty knew
you were seriously ill,

169
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:24,397
he would...

170
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:25,557
Eunuch Fu,

171
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:26,637
thank you.

172
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:30,717
Prince Rui sent a physician.

173
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:32,437
Sorry to trouble you for nothing.

174
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,317
Also,

175
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:38,637
stop reporting my affairs
to His Majesty.

176
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:41,557
- Your Highness...
- You may withdraw.

177
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:43,877
I'll take my leave.

178
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:45,917
Please take care, Your Highness.

179
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,117
(Is this Lu Zhen'er,)

180
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:16,277
(my once domineering consort?)

181
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,717
Your Highness,

182
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:22,797
I want to leave the palace.

183
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:25,357
But I want Yindan with me.

184
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,357
Do you have a way?

185
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,237
Certainly.

186
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:27,997
Zhen'er,

187
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:29,077
wait for me.

188
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,157
Thank you, Your Highness.

189
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:36,117
From now on,

190
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:37,797
no more thanks from me.

191
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:39,677
