00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,956
If you want me to spare her,

5
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,240
then make Lu Zhen'er walk barefoot
across this path,

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,840
and I'll grant her one more day

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,036
to uncover the murderer.

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,632
(If I walk this,)

00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,392
(will I lose a limb?)

10
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,436
Too scared now?

11
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:02,720
I'll walk.

12
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:23,716
I'll walk for her.

13
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,596

if I walk across,

17
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:40,236
grant her a day to find the murderer,

18
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:41,516

I'm not deceiving you.

47
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:00,036
I didn't kill Consort Xi.

48
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,976
So last night,

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,376
what exactly happened?

50
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:18,816
Consort Xi summoned me to beat me.

51
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,192
I wouldn't stand there stupidly,

52
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,276
so I ran.

53
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,784
As for what happened later,

54
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,480
my memory is unclear.

55
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,716
Do you think

56
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,076
you killed her?

57
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,076
No way.

58
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,832
I don't kill you now,

59
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:38,496
but next time might be different.

60
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,480
If you push me further,

61
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:42,272
I'll do anything.

62
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:47,276
Your Highness.

63
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:48,352
Are you alright?

64
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:50,156
She is terrifying!

65
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:51,936
Of course, I wanted to kill her!

66
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,792
But given our upbringing,

67
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,276
I'll never commit murder.

68
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,696
I'll know once I investigate.

69
00:04:58,848 --> 00:04:59,872
So confident?

70
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:01,396
Of course!

71
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:02,400
Time-traveler's theorem!

72
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,160
Once I investigate,

73
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,600
it definitely won't be me.

74
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:07,316
I was knocked unconscious!

75
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,784
The one who knocked me out

76
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,316
is the murderer.

77
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,596
Let's go.

78
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:18,636
Where to?

79
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,516
Go to Consort Xi's maid.

80
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:21,536
Ask her and we'll know.

81
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,196
Let's go!

82
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,656
Lu Zhen'er,

83
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:35,676
you...

84
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,156
(Yanyu, Consort Xi's maid)
Don't kill me!

85
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,236
Don't kill me!

86
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:45,756
Don't kill me!

87
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,556
She seems completely mad.

88
00:05:49,196 --> 00:05:50,432
Try torturing her.

89
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:52,156
Forced confession?

90
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:53,196
Don't.

91
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,796
Let me try first.

92
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:57,664
Yanyu,

93
00:05:57,836 --> 00:05:59,808
you were there that night.

94
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:01,504
Can you tell me

95
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,104
what happened

96
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:04,516
after I left?

97
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:09,036
Don't kill me!

98
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,816
Help!

99
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,036
Don't kill me!

100
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,236
Apply torture.

101
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:15,712
Stop interfering.

102
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,356
Stop investigating.

103
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,756
She's insane. We can't go on.

104
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,680
Stop mentioning torture.

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,916
Forced confessions are forbidden
under my watch.

106
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,288
I'll try another way.

107
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,496
Your Highness, you just came in time.

108
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:37,916
The imperial physicians just finished
stitching the body.

109
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,396
Had you come earlier,

110
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,216
you may be too scared to look.

111
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,836
Your Highness, don't.

112
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,080
What's inside?

113
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,448
Some of her bones were shattered.

114
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:59,968
The physicians couldn't fix it,
so they stuffed cotton inside

115
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,920
to make it appear presentable.

116
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:09,664
This is

117
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:11,436
mercury.

118
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:13,436
This is mercury.

119
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:16,736
Make an incision here

120
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:19,296
and pour mercury in.

121
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,916
Then I'll get a complete human skin.

122
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,796
Your Highness,
would you like to give it a try?

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,796
Impossible!

124
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:28,672
Your Highness.

125
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:29,472
No way.

126
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:30,592
Are you alright?

127
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:34,752
Greetings, Your Highness.

128
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:36,608
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Both of you, leave.

129
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:37,836
- Yes.
- Yes.

130
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
(Why is he here again?)

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,344
Aren't you afraid?

132
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:44,316
Somewhat.

133
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,976
If there's nothing else,

134
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:47,936
I shall take my leave.

135
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,236
What are you doing?

136
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,956
Don't you recognize me?

137
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,956
I'm His Majesty's consorts.

138
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:01,088
Our relationship is above reproach.

139
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,196
Seems you've embraced this new identity.

140
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:06,816
(Did the original owner
have a relationship with him?)

141
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,512
(If I deny it now,)

142
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:10,176
(would it undermine my character?)

143
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,512
(Before I get the full picture,)

144
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:14,208
(I shall placate him.)

145
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:15,916
Your Highness,

146
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,720
I have no choice but to obey.

147
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,756
I am merely a powerless consort,

148
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:23,716
a woman who can't even harm a fly.

149
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:26,752
Yes, as a woman,

150
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,076
what could you do
against imperial power?

151
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,516
If that's all,

152
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,024
I'll take my leave.

153
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:33,796
Wait.

154
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:36,436
I'm quite curious about something.

155
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:37,248
What?

156
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,556
Ordinary women fear bodies.

157
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,716
Why do you show no fear,

158
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,596
but checked her body?

159
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,816
I happen to know medicine.

160
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,632
You must be remarkable at it.

161
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,264
You even know by injecting mercury,

162
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,568
you can get a complete human skin.

163
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,916
I happened to pass
by the palace last night.

164
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,716
Did you

165
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:01,836
see who killed her?

166
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:06,208
You killed her, did you?

167
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,436
I didn't kill anyone!

168
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:09,596
It wasn't me!

169
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,976
Then how would you know

170
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,756
such a vicious method of harming people?

171
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,436
It's like a poison maker

172
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,236
who knows how to make medicine.

173
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,516
Convicting me of murder
based on a single sentence

174
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,796
would be far too rash.

175
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:21,236
I was speaking casually.

176
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:22,836
Then watch your words and deeds.

177
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:24,556
If nothing else, I'll take my leave.

178
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:28,896
(Zhen'er, you never failed)

179
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,476
(to surprise me.)

180
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:36,960
The area has been searched once.

181
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:38,752
Apart from your golden hairpin,

182
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,000
nothing else was found.

183
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,356
Could I really have killed Consort Xi?

184
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,636
Impossible!

185
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,192
Worried?

186
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:50,716
In this era,

187
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:54,116
the imperial physicians,
with the highest medical authority,

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,504
can't even stitch
a piece of human skin perfectly,

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,688
let alone

190
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,736
flaying off a complete human skin.

191
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:02,432
I studied anatomy.

192
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,800
I can extract a complete spinal cord
from a rat,

193
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,156
so I can flay a complete human skin.

194
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:10,436
Xiao Wenjing,

195
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,756
If I did kill someone,

196
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:13,796
what would you do?

197
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,736
I'll act impartially.

198
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,104
You'll kill me?

199
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:20,384
I don't want to,

200
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,016
unless you can prove yourself.

201
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,680
After all, I'm just a puppet.

202
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:25,760
Lu Zhen'er,

203
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,248
I questioned that palace maid

204
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,944
when she wasn't that mad.

205
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,208
She said she saw
you got physical with Consort Xi.

206
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,916
I did, but I was just
trying to scare her.

207
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:42,784
I threatened her

208
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:43,636
and then let her go.

209
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:47,776
She said she saw you flay the skin
with her own eyes.

210
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,036
Where are you going?

211
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,488
I didn't kill anyone!

212
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,796
I'll go look for more evidence.

213
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,752
(Empress Regnant's Legend)

214
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,796
This book looks so modern.

215
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:32,192
(Empress Regnant's Legend)

216
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,184
(Episode 1: The Sorceress Rises)

217
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,264
(Best Fortune)

218
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,316
(Best Fortune)

219
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:45,636
The best fortune.

220
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,236
This person looks so much like me.

221
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:57,316
Make an incision here
and pour mercury in.

222
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,712
Then I'll get a complete human skin.

223
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,696
Your Highness,
would you like to give it a try?

224
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,536
(So,)

225
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,876
(I did all of this?)

226
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:20,756
Turns out,

227
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:23,072
I'm just a cardboard character

228
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:25,152
