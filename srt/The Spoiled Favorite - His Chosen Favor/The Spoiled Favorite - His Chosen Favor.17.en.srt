1
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:23,584
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,912
(Consort Xi returned reborn
to claim my life)

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,768
=Episode 17=
Xiao Yicheng,

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,960
I must save my child today.

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,560
Whether you are willing or not,

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,920
this is not up to you!

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,144
What's that on your chest?

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,352
Let me go!

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,080
This birthmark was unique
to the late emperor.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,320
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,560
it really is you.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,760
You didn't die.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,360
None of your concern.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,400
Your Majesty,

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,944
you admit it!

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,600
Then my unborn child

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,680
is yours.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,440
My child?

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,320
Chen Wanyi,

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
you couldn't have your own child.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
What?

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,400
The sterility potion.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,360
You

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,840
could never bear your child.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,760
A sterility

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,960
potion?

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,840
Why are you so cruel to me?

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,920
Why did you sleep with me

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,240
as you said you love the late emperor?

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,600
Chen Wanyi,

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,920
your love is utterly disgusting.

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
Your Majesty!

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Your Majesty!

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,200
Being playful again.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,760
Your Highness, this is the calming tea.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,960
Have a cup

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,920
and you'll sleep well.

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,120
This tea tastes strange.

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,440
It always tastes like this.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Rest now.

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Everything will be better
when you wake up.

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,040
Lu Zhen'er, you witch!

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,560
Give me back my life!

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,720
Return my life!

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,768
Your Highness.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,680
What's wrong?

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,880
Yindan, I...

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
I dreamed

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
of Consort Xi.

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
Consort Xi?

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,080
Your Highness,

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
what's wrong?

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,920
Your Highness!

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,720
Someone!

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
Come here!

56
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,520
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,160
Consort Lu isn't ill.

58
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,400
She's been poisoned.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Poisoned?

60
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
Yes.

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
The poison is Seven Days Doom.

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,680
It won't kill immediately,

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,720
but takes seven days.

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,880
Without taking the antidote
in seven days,

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,360
Her Highness will die.

66
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,120
Taking the antidote before then,

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,520
she'll be alright.

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you have the antidote?

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,240
I lack the skill.

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,040
Sir, you may leave.

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Yes.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,760
The Zichen Hall is sealed tight.

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,160
How could she be poisoned?

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,760
It was my oversight.

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,800
Please forgive me.

76
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,040
This has nothing to do with her.

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
Don't blame her!

78
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't think so.

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,864
Yindan,

80
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,000
stand up.

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,320
Yindan, please leave us.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,080
Yes.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,960
Stop suspecting Yindan.

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,720
Everyone in this hall answers to me,

85
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,960
except her.

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
It can't be her.

87
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
Lu Zhen'er,

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,280
you trust her that much?

89
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,640
If she harmed me,

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,120
I'd willingly accept it.

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
But I think it isn't her.

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
Because

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I had a strange dream last night

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,560
that Consort Xi demanded I pay
with my life.

95
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
She choked me.

96
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
Look,

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
strangulation marks on my neck!

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,800
The poisoner

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,520
is Consort Xi's spirit?

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
No.

101
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
I think

102
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,320
someone is using her name

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,760
to kill me.

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,120
Rest assured.
I'll get to the bottom of this.

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
It's so cold tonight.

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,960
This palace is so eerie.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,720
Consort Xi!

108
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,560
How dare you!

109
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,640
Bow before me!

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,480
- Ghost!
- Ghost!

111
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
A ghost!

112
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,680
(Lu Zhen'er, I'm back for revenge.)

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,440
The Zichen Hall is magnificent.

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,600
I wish to reside here.

115
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,520
I wish to be with His Majesty forever.

116
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,680
It's all your fault!

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
All your fault!

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,240
Pay with your life!

119
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,280
Are you alright?

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,680
Again I dreamed

121
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,320
of Consort Xi.

122
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,160
Your Majesty, word of ghosts
has been going around lately.

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,120
They claimed to have seen Consort Xi.

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,160
Could it really be...

125
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,000
I've never believed
in ghosts or spirits.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,208
But there are

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,440
only three days left.

128
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Have you heard?

129
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
Yes. Consort Xi has come back to life.

130
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,800
She's come for Consort Lu's life.

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Consort Lu was poisoned.

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,880
Won't live past seven days.

133
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
Won't live past seven days?

134
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,720
Don't spread rumors.

135
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,760
Stop it!

136
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,680
Let's go!

137
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,880
Tomorrow is the final day.

138
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,968
(Day Six)

139
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,640
(Your Majesty, come to Zhongcui Mountain
alone at this midnight.)

140
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,720
(Murder demands a life.)

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,480
(Otherwise,
Consort Lu won't survive this.)

142
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
With so many people around,
no one saw who shot.

143
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,760
I'll send men to search
Zhongcui Mountain now.

144
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,560
Halt!

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
Didn't you read the letter?

146
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
"Alone!"

147
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,960
Send so many men into the mountain

148
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,240
to get Lu Zhen'er killed?

149
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,640
Your Majesty wants to go alone?

150
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,480
This is not advisable!

151
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
My decision is final. Prepare my horse.

152
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,552
I'm here.

153
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Who is behind this charade?

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,000
(It really is Consort Xi.)

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,960
(Impossible. It can't be her.)

156
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,000
Who are you really?

157
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,360
Rest easy, Your Majesty.

158
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,440
As long as Your Majesty complies,

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,760
Consort Lu will be fine.

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
You'd better keep your word.

161
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,560
She is so nice.

162
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,040
I would never harm her.

163
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Then why this elaborate scheme

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,040
to lure me here?

165
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,480
To kill you.

166
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,000
To kill me?

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,760
If I'm your target,

168
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,400
why not strike in the palace?

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
Why disguise yourself

170
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,280
and lure me here?

171
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,160
Fear your true identity may be found?

172
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,280
Enough talk!

173
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,600
Today is the day you die!

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,304
You and I have no quarrel.

175
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Your hands are soaked in blood.

176
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,000
Can't remember how many you've killed?

177
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Whom did I kill?

178
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
My parents!

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
So this is why you schemed

180
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
to stick with Zhen'er.

181
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,560
Yindan.

182
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,264
You have some conscience,

184
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,120
not revealing your true identity to her.

185
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,280
In her heart,

186
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
you are still her dear sister.

187
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Don't talk nonsense!

188
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,960
I've never killed the innocent!

189
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,040
I heard those in black said
it was the late emperor's orders.

190
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,320
Can't be any misunderstanding.

191
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,480
The late emperor's doing has
nothing to do with me.

192
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,440
I advise you

193
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,920
to avoid the wrong target.

194
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Get the facts straight
before you strike.

195
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,120
Actually, you don't have to die.

196
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,840
Had you not come,

197
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,600
I could have taken Her Highness away

198
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
to live the life she desires.

199
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,880
Don't worry.

200
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,600
After we get out,

201
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
I'll open a clinic.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,040
My job's diagnosis,
and yours is payment.

203
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,800
We'll make a good living.

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,280
And we absolutely won't go hungry.

205
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,064
We'll open a clinic.

206
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,824
Her job's diagnosis,

207
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
and mine is payment.

208
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,120
I wouldn't have to kill you,

209
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,120
but you came.

210
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't worry.

211
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,080
As you are sincere to Her Highness,

212
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,640
I'll make your passing less painful.

213
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,760
(I won't let you have your way!)

214
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,352
If you refuse to take this,

215
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
Consort Lu won't survive.

216
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Take it or not?
