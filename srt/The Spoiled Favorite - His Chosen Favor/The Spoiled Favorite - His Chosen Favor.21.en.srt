1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,228
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,172
(In Your Belly is A Tumor)

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,504
=Episode 21=

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,750
I'm here to save you,

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,950
not to mock your misfortune.

6
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,390
Lu Zhen'er,

7
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,470
don't pretend to care.

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,870
Do you think I'll trust you again?

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,270
You're not pregnant.

10
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,510
In your belly

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,830
is a tumor.

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,390
Without an operation,

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,790
you'll die.

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,990
Seeing me like this now,

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,230
you're pleased, right?

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,350
Physicians have compassion.

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,150
That wasn't my intention.

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm no surgeon.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,390
Without sterile operating room

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,150
or any antibiotics,

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,510
if I do the operation on you,

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,910
the mortality rate

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,870
will be really high.

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,270
Lu Zhen'er,

25
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,710
you're back.

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,870
What?

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,430
I thought Lu Zhen'er had vanished.

28
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,390
Why have you returned?

29
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,670
You...

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,230
You know me?

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,710
You recognize me?

32
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,670
That bewitching consort knew
no medicine.

33
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,070
She'd never speak
of a physician's compassion.

34
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,470
(I'd never imagined)

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,110
(that in this world)

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,550
(the first one to recognize me)

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,856
(would be Empress Dowager Chen.)

38
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,790
Your Majesty,

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,150
do you know

40
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,830
what happened during this time?

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,230
The original Lu Zhen'er has returned.

42
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,670
She is His Majesty's

43
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,510
true love.

44
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,110
(The original owner reclaimed her body.)

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,110
So you knew we were two individuals?

46
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,910
She provoked me,

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,510
and asked

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,190
if I recalled who she was.

49
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,510
She claimed some useless fool stole
her body.

50
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,110
(Otherwise, she would've)

51
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,390
(ruined me long ago.)

52
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,350
What about Xiao Wenjing?

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,470
Why

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,390
is he like that now?

55
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,110
He seems not to recognize me.

56
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,590
I don't know.

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,790
Since she became the Empress,

58
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,750
she's confined me here,

59
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,110
banning me from stepping outside.

60
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,270
Perhaps he's drugged.

61
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,790
That bewitching woman

62
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,870
has alchemists concoct potions.

63
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,270
Then why

64
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,230
has Xiao Yicheng become
the late emperor?

65
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,110
He consumed an elixir of immortality.

66
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,910
He has always been the late emperor.

67
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,790
(That's why)

68
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,270
(Prince Rui was kind to me.)

69
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,670
(Not because the original owner
had ties to Prince Rui,)

70
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,790
(but Prince Rui)

71
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,830
(is the late emperor).

72
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,670
Lu Zhen'er,

73
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,670
I'm dying.

74
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,510
Could you do me a favor?

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,550
What is it?

76
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,270
I wish to see His Majesty.

77
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,070
Don't you want an operation?

78
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,270
Perhaps it can save you.

79
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,430
I'm exhausted.

80
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm truly too weary.

81
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,470
Very well.

82
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,150
I promise you.

83
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,270
Your timing is perfect.

84
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,270
The Imperial Household Bureau sent
the cherries.

85
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,270
Taste some.

86
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,070
Chen Wanyi wants to see you.

87
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,750
Ignore her.

88
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,030
She's dying.

89
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,430
Let her be.

90
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,350
She's dying,

91
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,630
and you won't see her?

92
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,830
People die every day in this world.

93
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,270
Must I see each of them?

94
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,430
She is your first wife!

95
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,070
Do you

96
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,270
have no heart?

97
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,670
My heart has always been yours.

98
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,670
You love me?

99
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,870
Indeed.

100
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,990
Since you love me,

101
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,870
give me all that's best.

102
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,470
Merely making me
the Empress isn't enough.

103
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,430
Make me the Emperor

104
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,950
and give me the entire empire!

105
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,310
No woman ever became the Emperor.

106
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,630
There wasn't one before.

107
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,030
But there can be now!

108
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:07,990
Stop it.

109
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,510
I feel sorry for Chen Wanyi.

110
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,710
She loved someone like you.

111
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,590
He refused to come.

112
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,790
Chen Wanyi,

113
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,470
let's do the operation.

114
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,310
Let's try it.

115
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,990
Perhaps

116
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,070
it can save you.

117
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,390
No need.

118
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,870
But...

119
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,550
Thank you.

120
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,270
Thank you.

121
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,470
Please leave.

122
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,230
Let me be alone

123
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,670
and depart with dignity.

124
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,230
Very well.

125
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,550
Lu Zhen'er,

126
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,030
I have nothing to do
with Yindan's death.

127
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,510
I see.

128
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,110
From now on,

129
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,230
we owe each other nothing.

130
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,750
(I, Chen Wanyi,)

131
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,390
(was trapped in the palace
my whole life,)

132
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,510
(and fought against heaven and earth)

133
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,510
(for a moment
of the late emperor's pity)

134
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,550
(and an illusion of peace.)

135
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,190
Like your father,

136
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,590
you're driven mad by this woman!

137
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,070
Drag her away!

138
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,510
Execute her by a thousand cuts.

139
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,790
Then make it 50 strokes!

140
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,910
(After all that scheming,)

141
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,510
(only at the end do I understand)

142
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,390
(the palace never imprisoned my body,)

143
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,070
(but my unwillingness
to wake from this delusion.)

144
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,710
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

145
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,710
You look exactly like His Majesty
in his youth.

146
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,590
Yicheng, stop!

147
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,110
Yicheng!

148
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,950
Your Majesty,

149
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,830
I truly love you!

150
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,470
(His favor was merely a bait,)

151
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,670
(yet I chased it my whole life.)

152
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,430
(In the end, only laughter remains,)

153
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,390
(laughing at myself for performing
a play no one watched.)

154
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,990
I'm pregnant.

155
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,070
I wish to personally make a pair

156
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,550
of tiger-head shoes for my kid.

157
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,790
Clearly, my belly

158
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,390
grows bigger each day.

159
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,070
How could I not be pregnant?

160
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,110
It was my first child
with the late emperor.

161
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,510
Help me.

162
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,590
Lu Zhen'er,

163
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,150
I'm about to die.

164
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,030
My life

165
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,150
is like a cruel joke.

166
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,870
Your Majesty!

167
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,510
Your Majesty, the Empress Dowager
has passed away.

168
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,070
What did you say?

169
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,630
The Empress Dowager has passed away.

170
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,350
Give her a grand burial.

171
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,110
Yes.

172
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:53,624
♪Moonlight beyond the pass sighs
for restless fluttering petals♪

173
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,064
♪Life is fleeting,
spring rivers turn cold♪

174
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:09,144
♪Clear boat, misty waters frost again,
shore willows hasten yellow♪

175
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:14,424
♪Sitting alone by the window,
watching the mournful sunset♪

176
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:21,190
♪In the courtyard's music room,
wind recounts the past♪

177
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,510
Xiao Yicheng,

178
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,790
do you know Chen Wanyi is dead?

179
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,630
I have ordered a grand burial for her.

180
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,430
Is that all?

181
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,390
What more do you expect?

182
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,470
Giving her a grand burial is my mercy.

183
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,390
I feel sorry for her.

184
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,510
She loved someone like you.

185
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,550
Stop making a scene, Zhen'er.

186
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,350
A scene?

187
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,790
Soon you'll know if I am making a scene.

188
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,190
Xiao Wenjing.

189
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,470
What brings you here?

190
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,470
Greetings, Your Majesty.

191
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,190
Do you truly

192

not remember me?

What are you saying?

194
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,230
Can you recall nothing at all?

Your Majesty.

196
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,350
Shut up!

197
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,670
Don't call me like that.

198
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,710
How dare you!

199
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,670
You're not him.

200
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,070
I wish you both

201
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,670
a lifetime of happiness together.
