1
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:24,311
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:26,825
(Emperor vs. Consort: Who Dies First?)

3
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:27,904
=Episode 7=

4
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,704
Aren't you revealing the Empress Dowager
and Prince Rui's affair?

5
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:32,544
Why are you disguised as Prince Rui?

6
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:33,744
I feared he wouldn't come.

7
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,024
So I made a backup plan.

8
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:36,864
I'd pretend to be him
and trick Chen Wanyi.

9
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,944
(Tonight is the night.)

10
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:40,264
(Chen Wanyi, time and again
you have sought my ruin.)

11
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,184
(This time, I'll leave you speechless.)

12
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,664
Who are you?

13
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:56,904
Aren't you Zhen'er's maid?

14
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,304
What brings you to me?

15
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:00,624
My lord, please save Her Highness.

16
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:03,264
Ever since that painting concerning you
appeared in the palace,

17
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,584
Her Highness has been
deeply worried for your safety.

18
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:08,424
Tonight, she rushed alone
to the Cold Palace,

19
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,784
saying she will help
uncover the mastermind for you.

20
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:13,544
Zhen'er is so concerned for me?

21
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:14,824
Her Highness says

22
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,544
you've saved her life multiple times.

23
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,744
Even considering past feelings,

24
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,304
she must ensure you remain unharmed.

25
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:24,584
Then why didn't you seek help
from Xiao Wenjing?

26
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,664
Her Highness went
to the Cold Palace for you.

27
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,424
I...

28
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:29,904
I dared not approach His Majesty.

29
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:32,064
She loves me so much?

30
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,024
She is so devoted to me.

31
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:36,064
I absolutely will not fail her.

32
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,504
Could I have guessed wrong?

33
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:54,384
Empress Dowager Chen
has no interest in Xiao Yicheng?

34
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:55,824
She doesn't care about her safety?

35
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:02,104
(Here she comes.)

36
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:08,464
Prince Rui?

37
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:10,584
Is that you?

38
00:02:13,544 --> 00:02:15,344
Why are you in the Cold Palace tonight?

39
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,784
Never mind. I won't press you on that.

40
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:22,984
Rest assured, the Cold Palace is safe.

41
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:26,064
Whether that painting is real or fake,

42
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,584
or whoever is behind that,

43
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,464
I absolutely forbid anyone
from harming you.

44
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:35,344
(I knew Empress Dowager Chen
definitely likes Prince Rui.)

45
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,264
Yicheng,

46
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,624
why won't you look at me?

47
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,704
Are you shy?

48
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,984
If you prefer it this way,

49
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:48,784
we can just talk like this.

50
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,224
(By my calculation, the people
I summoned should be arriving soon.)

51
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,504
(They'd better not
miss such a good show.)

52
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:58,144
Yicheng,

53
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:01,864
you look so very much
like the late emperor.

54
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:03,504
Every time I see you,

55
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,824
I feel like you are him.

56
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,104
I miss your father terribly.

57
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,904
So, Yicheng,

58
00:03:09,904 --> 00:03:11,624
would you be willing to take his place

59
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,384
and stay by my side?

60
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,904
(Such an explosive statement.)

61
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,024
(Open and blatant stand-in trope?)

62
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:19,064
Yicheng,

63
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,304
don't worry.

64
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:24,504
Only you and I will know of this.

65
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,304
If you please me,

66
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,384
even if you wanted the throne,
I'll give you that.

67
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:31,784
I will help you kill Xiao Wenjing.

68
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:32,784
Yicheng,

69
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:34,504
are you willing?

70
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:38,944
You're unwilling?

71
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,384
Yicheng,

72
00:03:41,384 --> 00:03:43,184
this isn't up to you.

73
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,624
(What's happening?)

74
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,864
(Why is it so hot?)

75
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,824
(And I feel so weak all over?)

76
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,224
(The incense?)

77
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:51,744
(Did Chen Wanyi drug me?)

78
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,624
Yicheng,

79
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,304
tonight,

80
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:58,224
I'll make us both happy.

81
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:00,584
(Empress Dowager Chen is insane.)

82
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,384
(I can't keep pretending.)

83
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:04,504
Why are you so quiet?

84
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:07,304
Yicheng?

85
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:10,384
Yicheng, don't run.

86
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:12,384
Yicheng.

87
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:14,904
Yicheng.

88
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:17,944
Yicheng.

89
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,744
You've gotten thinner.

90
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:22,424
Were you thinking of me?

91
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:24,584
Yicheng,

92
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,944
don't disdain my age.

93
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:29,784
I'm only a few years older than you.

94
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:31,264
Yicheng,

95
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:32,984
I want you tonight.

96
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:35,664
I absolutely won't let you escape.

97
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,344
What are you doing?

98
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:46,824
It's me.

99
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,864
Run. Empress Dowager Chen
has lost her mind.

100
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,184
Yicheng,

101
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,464
don't hide.

102
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:01,824
Zhen'er?

103
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:11,744
Prince Rui.

104
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:12,944
Zhen'er.

105
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:18,584
Stay calm.

106
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:20,464
It's so hot.

107
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:22,144
Stay calm.

108
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:22,944
I'm burning up.

109
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,224
Calm down, Lu Zhen'er.

110
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:34,824
Lu Zhen'er, what are you doing?

111
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:38,264
Empress Dowager Chen's drug
was too strong.

112
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,224
I feel awful.

113
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:41,064
Lu Zhen'er.

114
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:50,424
Stay here and don't move.

115
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:51,624
I'll find you the antidote.

116
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:56,384
Xiao Wenjing.

117
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,384
Xiao Wenjing.

118
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:16,104
Xiao Wenjing.

119
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,064
What are these?

120
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:25,904
Paintings.

121
00:07:26,824 --> 00:07:27,704
Who painted them?

122
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:40,704
And what are these?

123
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,744
Empress Regnant's Legend.

124
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,584
Why are they here?

125
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,144
You painted them?

126
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:49,424
Yes.

127
00:07:51,224 --> 00:07:52,464
Who exactly are you?

128
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,184
Who exactly are you?

129
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,944
I painted you.

130
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,424
Who do you think I am?

131
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,064
So

132
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:09,704
the person I've been
desperately trying to find

133
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:10,584
is you.

134
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,184
It's you controlling my fate all along.

135
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:16,744
It's you who has always wanted me dead.

136
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:17,704
Yes.

137
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,944
Weren't we friends?

138
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,584
Why would you do that to me?

139
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:27,424
Friends?

140
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,344
I never wanted to be friends with you.

141
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,424
Since the first day I saw you,

142
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,224
I've wanted to kill you.

143
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,384
I've wished
for your death every single day.

144
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:40,024
Why?

145
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:41,624
Only when you die

146
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,344
can I finally go home.

147
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,504
For every day you stay,

148
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:48,024
I have to spend another day
as this useless emperor.

149
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,024
Why won't you just die?

150
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,824
Why do you have to
become an Empress Regnant?

151
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:55,664
Why do you have to stay in this comic?

152
00:08:55,664 --> 00:08:58,304
Do you have any idea
how long I've been trapped here?

153
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,104
Ten lifetimes.

154
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,904
Ten whole lifetimes!

155
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:04,664
I have to deal
with you crazy women every day.

156
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:06,504
Harem schemes. Fighting for favor.

157
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,344
And I have to play along
with your stupid games.

158
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:11,224
I want to go home!

159
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,864
I want to return to real life!

160
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,144
Is it wrong for me
to want an ordinary life?

161
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:18,864
You could have told me.

162
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:20,584
I would have helped you.

163
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,584
It's all because of you
I'm trapped here.

164
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,904
In these ten lives,

165
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:29,584
do you know how many times
I've been killed by you?

166
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:33,744
How could you say that?

167
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,624
Do you think you're a good person?

168
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,424
I'm not claiming to be a good person,

169
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,824
but I wouldn't turn against you
and cross swords

170
00:09:42,824 --> 00:09:44,304
without a reason.

171
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:45,704
But that's exactly what you did.

172
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:47,864
I didn't do it.

173
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:50,144
I have no idea
about the things you said.

174
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,024
I considered you a friend.

175
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,144
I never harmed you.

176
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,664
Why would you deceive me and hurt me?

177
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,464
Consort Jing and Beauty Yu...

178
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,824
that was all your doing, right?

179
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:05,584
Yes.

180
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:09,264
Why did you frame me?

181
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:11,224
I did it to drive you mad.

182
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:17,144
Then why were you so kind to me?

183
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,744
To make you the target
of everyone's hatred.

184
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:23,304
To turn everyone against you.

185
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:27,144
And last time
with the charcoal fire, you...

186
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:28,504
The last charcoal fire thing

187
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,264
happened because you
were obsessively chasing power.

188
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:45,184
(Last life, Empress Dowager Chen
forced you to walk the coals.)

189
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:47,544
(You resented me for it.)

190
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:50,544
(You became a notorious empress
and had me cut into pieces.)

191
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,944
(This life,)

192
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,424
(I will change all of this.)

193
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,184
So

194
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,504
that's how it was.

195
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:07,224
Xiao Wenjing,

196
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:10,024
I genuinely considered you a friend.

197
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,104
I trusted you completely.

198
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:15,224
Why would you lie to me?

199
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,544
You've wronged me.

200
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,944
How can you talk about trust

201
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,744
at a time like this?

202
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,704
So childish.

203
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,064
I hate you.

204
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:32,944
Hate me if you must.

205
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:34,664
Guards!

206
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,184
Consort Lu has offended me.

207
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,304
Take her to the dungeon!

208
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,344
Take her away.

209
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:43,144
- Yes.
- Yes.

210
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,504
Your Highness,
His Majesty is furious right now.

211
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:02,184
Once His Majesty calms down,

212
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,664
he will surely release you.

213
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,664
He wants me dead right now.

214
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:07,304
How could he possibly let me out?

215
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:08,784
Please don't say that.

216
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,784
His Majesty's affection for you

217
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:11,944
is known to all.

218
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:17,624
I'll speak to the jailers.

219
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:19,104
Please rest easy here, Your Highness.

220
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:21,704
Within a few days,
His Majesty will come for you.

221
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:24,424
Thank you, Eunuch Fu.

222
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:26,944
You're too kind, Your Highness.

223
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,464
I will take my leave.

224
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:34,664
(Xiao Wenjing,)

225
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:38,664
(I never imagined
you were this kind of person.)

226
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:44,744
David,

227
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,184
tell me,

228
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:48,224
what kind of Xiao Wenjing am I really?

229
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,344
Am I wrong?

230
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:53,904
If I can't change the plot,

231
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,944
I'll be trapped here forever,

232
00:12:57,104 --> 00:13:00,104
turning into something
neither human nor ghost.

233
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,304
I'm doing this for myself.

234
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:04,344
There's nothing wrong with that.

235
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:06,184
But why do I feel so sad?

236
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,864
Since I'm the heroine,
you must be the hero.

237
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,104
In female-centric novels,

238
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,944
whoever the heroine chooses is the hero.

239
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,104
No arguments.

240
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:24,184
Look out!

241
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:32,304
She took the blade for me,

242
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,144
but that was her choice.

243
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,424
It has nothing to do with me.

244
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,464
She killed me so many times.

245
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,464
Why can't I deceive her just once?

246
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:42,704
Am I wrong?

247
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,224
Not at all.

248
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,344
If she wants to defy me, fine.

249
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:50,344
Let her rot in that cell

250
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,224
for the rest of her life.

251
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:55,104
Let's see how the plot unfolds then.

252
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,104
Your Highness,

253
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:07,824
it's time to eat.

254
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:10,344
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,064
His Majesty wants you dead.

256
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:24,224
Zhen'er!

257
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,344
Are you alright?

258
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:26,624
I'm here to save you.

259
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,744
(Xiao Wenjing,)

260
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,824
(do you really want me dead?)

261
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:32,664
Earthquake! It's an earthquake!

262
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,224
Let's go!

263
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:34,344
Hurry!

264
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:42,304
An earthquake?

265
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:44,464
No.

266
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:45,144
Lu Zhen'er!

267
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,304
Where is Lu Zhen'er?

268
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:01,584
Your Majesty,

269
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,024
Prince Rui stormed in
moments ago, killed the guards,

270
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:05,784
and took Consort Lu directly.

271
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:06,544
Prince Rui?

272
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:07,704
Yes.

273
00:15:15,984 --> 00:15:17,864
Are you sure it's safe here?

274
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:19,224
Of course, Zhen'er.

275
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:21,704
I will keep you safe.

276
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:23,704
I'm just afraid
it might exceed your power.

277
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,944
After all, you're only a prince.

278
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,104
The one who wants me dead
is the Emperor.

279
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,664
Even if he is the Emperor,

280
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,824
he will never take you from me.

281
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:34,504
What are you doing?

282
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:36,504
Xiao Wenjing wants you dead.

283
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:37,704
Yet you still trust him?

284
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,344
This isn't about trust.

285
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:41,744
I'm simply stating facts.

286
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,664
Do you expect me to say

287
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:47,384
you outrank the Emperor?

288
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:49,344
I could never utter
such insincere words.

289
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,024
Even though he's the Emperor now,

290
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,064
he won't hold that throne for long.

291
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:57,264
Zhen'er, I am the one
worthy of your lifelong trust.

292
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:00,264
Xiao Wenjing is up to no good.

293
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:01,304
You're not much better.

294
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,704
Prince Rui,

295
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,704
Consort Xi

296
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,584
was killed by you, right?

297
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,864
Prince Rui! Why do you want to kill me?

298
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:26,184
When I want someone dead,

299
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,584
they die.

300
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,424
Zhen'er, when did you know?

301
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,104
About the mercury skinning method,

302
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,264
other than me,

303
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:46,584
only you, Prince Rui,

304
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,824
who passed by the palace path
that very night, know.

305
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,904
Zhen'er, you're as clever as ever.

306
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,144
Why did you kill her?

307
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:57,504
And with such a cruel method?

308
00:16:58,264 --> 00:16:59,944
Why quarrel with me

309
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:01,384
over such a lowly life?

310
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:05,624
Wouldn't it be better
to serve me loyally?

311
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,824
Together, we could rule the realm.

312
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,744
(Xiao Wenjing wants to use me.)

313
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:12,384
(And you plan to use me too.)

314
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:14,824
(Truly, there's not a decent man
under heaven.)

315
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,624
(I'll make you fight like dogs.)

316
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:24,864
Prince Rui,

317
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:27,344
then I will stay here tonight.

318
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:31,064
You haven't disappointed me.

319
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:32,344
Set your mind at ease.

320
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,304
If I become emperor in the future,

321
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,984
you shall be my empress.

322
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:43,504
The palace has been uneasy lately.

323
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:45,584
Is something happening?

324
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:47,384
Your Grace,

325
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:49,504
a few days ago,
the imperial city quaked.

326
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:52,184
Rumors spread throughout the palace.

327
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:54,144
They claim Prince Rui
was to ascend the throne

328
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:55,984
according to the late emperor's decree.

329
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,824
His Majesty seized the throne unjustly

330
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,464
and flouts propriety.

331
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:01,104
He seized his father's favorite consort.

332
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:04,504
So heaven condemns Beizhao,
sending divine retribution,

333
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:05,544
causing the earthquake.

334
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:08,744
If His Majesty continues like this,

335
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:09,944
I fear

336
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:11,304
Beizhao will fall.

337
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:16,424
What divine retribution?

338
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:20,024
This is clearly the work of schemers.

339
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:23,864
If they want to fight, let them fight.

340
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,864
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

341
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:28,584
Let's go back to the palace.

342
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:29,384
Yes.

343
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:39,544
(Lu Zhen'er, are you truly planning)

344
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:41,304
