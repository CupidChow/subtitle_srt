1
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:12,096
Sister!

2
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,456
Please

3
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:14,416
(Lu Zhen'er, nursing graduate)
bless me

4
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,896
for passing tomorrow's exam

5
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:18,216
and becoming a qualified nurse.

6
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:19,096
(Best fortune)

7
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:20,136
The best fortune!

8
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:22,936
Someone is drowning!

9
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:24,416
Someone is drowning!

10
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,576
Who is it? Hurry!

11
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:27,376
- Save him!
- Save him!

12
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:30,816
Someone is drowning!

13
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:32,296
- Save him!
- Who can?

14
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:33,096
Move aside!

15
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,056
I'm a nursing student! I know CPR!

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,989
Save him.

17
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:04,696
(Oh my, where am I?)

18
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,400
(Why in ancient costumes?)

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,776
(Am I dreaming?)

20
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,744
No!

21
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:15,816
- (This must be a nightmare.)
- Now is the Shen hour.

22
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:17,976
By the late emperor's decree,

23
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:19,176
all consorts should

24
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:22,776
(Xiao Wenjing, the new emperor)
serve him on the road to the underworld.

25
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:25,336
- The auspicious hour has come.
- (This isn't right.)

26
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,936
(Isn't he Emperor Xiao Wenjing
from Harem Turmoil?)

27
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:29,536
(Why is he coming to me?)

28
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:40,896
So this isn't a dream.

29
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:42,056
I was just

30
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:44,096
saving someone at the beach.

31
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:47,016
How am I here now?

32
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:49,576
Consort Lu!

33
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,816
Save me!

34
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,056
I don't want to die!

35
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,856
Sister?

36
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:58,416
(Yindan, palace maid)
Consort Lu!

37
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,376
What are you saying?

38
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:01,896
(Sister,)

39
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:03,576
(I thought you were dead.)

40
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,016
(Am I dead too?)

41
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,176
So what people say online about seeing

42
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:10,856
one's loved ones after death is true.

43
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:13,256
Sister,

44
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:15,376
I've missed you so much!

45
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,256
Consort Lu, what are you talking about?

46
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:18,776
How could I be your sister?

47
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:21,216
What

48
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,576
did you just call me?

49
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,776
Consort Lu.

50
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,256
(This is insane.)

51
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,496
(In the prime of my youth,)

52
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,576
(I actually transmigrated
into Lu Zhen'er,)

53
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:31,616
(a bewitching consort)

54
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:32,776
(who is to be buried alive)

55
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:34,616
(with the late emperor.)

56
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:37,376
(What a disastrous start!)

57
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,496
(Lu Zhen'er, the late emperor's consort)
Oh,

58
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:39,496
my

59
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:42,016
God!

60
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,656
You want to escape?

61
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:55,816
(I mustn't die!)

62
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:57,456
Your Majesty!

63
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,376
I can divine fortunes!

64
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,296
I have clairvoyance!

65
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:01,616
I'll help handle Her Majesty
who rules behind the curtain

66
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,376
and help you reclaim power!

67
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:04,576
How dare you

68
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,936
sow discord between my mother and I!

69
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,136
Unforgivable!

70
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:11,136
Kill her!

71
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:12,696
I am sorry!

72
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:16,376
Sorry!

73
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:18,376
It wasn't intentional!

74
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,056
What did you say?

75
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,056
I

76
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:34,256
am

77
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,376
sorry!

78
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:38,976
It's okay!

79
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,856
♪When thunder roars♪

80
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:42,416
Your Majesty!

81
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:47,456
Nice to meet you!

82
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,896
Nice to meet you, too!

83
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,016
(Fellow travelers.)

84
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,176
(When fellow travelers meet,)

85
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,976
(tears fill their eyes.)

86
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,296
Take her back to the harem.

87
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,336
And clean this up.

88
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,816
(Is my life)

89
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:24,296
(going to be restarted like this?)

90
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,136
(Sister,)

91
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:26,336
(let's go.)

92
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:41,984
=His Chosen Favor=

93
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,928
(Nice to Meet You)

94
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,464
=Episode 1=

95
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:53,856
All gold!

96
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,936
A glowing peacock!

97
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:01,696
Solid gold toad!

98
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:02,936
It's solid!

99
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,456
No wonder the fortune-teller said

100
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:05,856
my luck peaks in middle age.

101
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,496
The older I get, the better my fortune!

102
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:09,376
I never thought I'd live

103
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,136
this lavish life

104
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:12,696
Gold's price is 980 now.

105
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:14,016
At this weight,

106
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:15,616
I'm being rich!

107
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:17,776
Pearl bracelets!

108
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:20,216
Jade bracelets!

109
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:21,816
What is this?

110
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,016
David.

111
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,176
Never thought you're an artist.

112
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:32,776
And a wealthy one.

113
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,816
This is Golden Phoebe Nanmu wood, right?

114
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:37,216
How much would this cost?

115
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:38,976
So great!

116
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:42,096
This is no different
from sitting on a gold mountain.

117
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,976
Stop staring. Let's talk.

118
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:44,616
Sure.

119
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:46,656
When did you travel through?

120
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:48,976
Just now.

121
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:50,416
So

122
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,256
that person in bed wasn't you, right?

123
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,456
Your Majesty, I adore you.

124
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,496
My heart yearns for you.

125
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,896
So I came naturally.

126
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:04,376
Of course not.

127
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,736
I have principles.

128
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,016
I was in a pit
as soon as I traveled through.

129
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,176
That's good.

130
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:13,016
When did you travel through?

131
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,376
Two years ago.

132
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:17,936
No wonder you seem

133
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:19,576
nothing like a modern person.

134
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,336
Have you read that comic?

135
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,296
I don't read comics.

136
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,296
Then let me tell you

137
00:06:29,296 --> 00:06:30,936
about this comic's story.

138
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:32,936
The heroine is your mother,
Empress Dowager Chen.

139
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,296
The hero is your father.

140
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,416
Your mother loved your father,

141
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,656
but he didn't love her.

142
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:39,496
Using her family's influence,
she forced him to marry her.

143
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:43,016
For decades, he unwillingly endured
physical and emotional torment.

144
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,016
But tragic heroines never die easily.

145
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,016
Later, your father died,

146
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:48,216
yet your mother survived.

147
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:50,656
Where we are now is the comic's ending.

148
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:52,056
Not long after,

149
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:53,656
you'll die suddenly.

150
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:55,296
Empress Dowager Chen

151
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,576
will be promoted, amass wealth
and outlive her husband,

152
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:59,536
then her son.

153
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,936
Just the cliche drama

154
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,456
of "I love you, but you don't".

155
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,336
That makes it entertaining!

156
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,456
We may show goodwill to Her Majesty.

157
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:09,336
Opposing the heroine

158
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,016
never ends well.

159
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,776
You are my father's consort,

160
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:15,016
who Her Majesty hates most.

161
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,176
You think she'd accept your goodwill?

162
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:20,056
Oh, right.

163
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:24,736
I'm her biggest thorn in the side.

164
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,936
Since we can't befriend her,

165
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,536
there's only one other option.

166
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,216
What?

167
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,216
Strike first.

168
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,536
Let's take her down.

169
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,496
Her Majesty is here.

170
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:56,816
(Chen Wanyi, Empress Dowager)
Mother, what has angered you?

171
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:58,896
Tell me, so I can enjoy it too.

172
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,416
Where is Lu Zhen'er?

173
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,056
Lu Zhen'er?

174
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,096
I don't understand.

175
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,216
The burial consort you rescued!

176
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:06,976
Don't play dumb with me!

177
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:09,416
No burial consorts here,

178
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,056
but the newly appointed Consort Lu.

179
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,856
She is my consort,

180
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:14,016
unrelated to Father.

181
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,776
You can appoint anyone as consort,

182
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,576
except Lu Zhen'er.

183
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:21,736
You want to select consorts for me.

184
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,016
So I chose Lu Zhen'er.

185
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,296
Why aren't you pleased?

186
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,776
She is your father's consort.

187
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:26,896
So what?

188
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:30,856
What?

189
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,976
Are you jealous of her

190
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:35,456
as she had Father's exclusive favor

191
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,376
and now mine?

192
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,256
Xiao Wenjing!

193
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:41,136
Mother,

194
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,816
Lu Zhen'er is my woman.

195
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:43,976
If you want to take her,

196
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,416
fine.

197
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,536
Eunuch Fu!

198
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:48,056
(Fu An, Head Eunuch)
Draft an edict now

199
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,056
by stating that the new emperor
has passed away.

200
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,616
The throne is passed to Her Majesty.

201
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,456
Once you become the empress,

202
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:54,976
you can take Lu Zhen'er away.

203
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:57,896
Your Majesty!

204
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,016
Xiao Wenjing,

205
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,136
do you truly think I won't kill you?

206
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:03,936
Go ahead!

207
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:06,696
I've waited so long for this day.

208
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,456
Sooner or later,

209
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,576
you'll pay the price for coveting

210
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:11,536
your father's things.

211
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:21,616
Is your face alright?

212
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:23,736
It's fine.

213
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,216
What did you do for work before?

214
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,616
You have great explosive power!

215
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:28,416
An actor?

216
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,136
I didn't work.

217
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,016
Where is your cool linen pants?

218
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:34,056
It's too hot here.

219
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:35,176
Without air conditioning,

220
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,856
I cut mine shorter.

221
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:37,896
Then what did you do?

222
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,056
Nothing much.

223
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,096
Just scheming against my dad's

224
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,376
illegitimate children

225
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:43,456
for the family fortune.

226
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,176
You just said

227
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,536
you want to take Her Majesty down.

228
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:52,816
Any viable plans?

229
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,856
It's 2025 now!

230
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:57,536
The legendary
Nine Purple Li Fire Luck has begun.

231
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,136
An era for heroines to dominate.

232
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:00,656
If we team up...

233
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,776
We can crush all obstacles.

234
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:12,616
Lu Zhen'er,

235
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:13,776
aren't you going home?

236
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:14,936
I've got everything here

237
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:15,576
and my sister.

238
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:16,696
Why would I go back?

239
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:18,256
Your sister?

240
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:19,416
Travel through time with you?

241
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:20,976
No.

242
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,856
She just looks exactly like my sister.

243
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,776
Why won't you go back
to find your real sister,

244
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:28,096
instead of calling this imposter?

245
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,616
Because

246
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:36,016
she died.

247
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:38,576
I can't find her in the modern era.

248
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:41,416
Maybe

249
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,896
Heaven sent me here

250
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:44,896
to reunite with her.

251
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,176
I'll assign Yindan to you

252
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:53,496
as your personal maid.

253
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,736
(I never dreamed
of wearing such a gorgeous robe.)

254
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,216
(So beautiful!)

255
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,936
(So many girls yearn to become)

256
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,856
(the empress or noble consort.)

257
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,736
(It seems I'm almost there!)

258
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,856
(I'm about to reach
the peak of my life!)

259
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,896
Truly a bewitching consort!

260
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,696
A femme fatale!

261
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:22,656
Indeed!

262
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,816
Washing feet in the imperial court?

263
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:28,856
Is that even allowed?

264
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,296
Why wouldn't it be?

265
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:32,216
Here, what I say goes.

266
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:33,816
Alright then!

267
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,776
- Soaking feet in the Throne Room!
- Awesome!

268
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,376
Utterly disgraceful!

269
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:41,736
- A femme fatale!
- Did my phone come with me?

270
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,336
I want to take a photo
and post it on Moments.

271
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:45,816
Posting on Moments now?

272
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:50,416
Comfortable!

273
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,696
I'm the Foot Soak King!

274
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:56,496
Soon this entire city

275
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:57,376
could be yours.

276
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,456
That would be amazing!

277
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,376
Tomorrow, I'll help you
deal with the harem.

278
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,848
(Noble Consort Qing,
the new emperor's consort)

279
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,296
Consort Xi is here.

280
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:36,576
I'm late.

281
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:37,536
Please forgive me.

282
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:41,136
You're always late,

283
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,656
keeping everyone waiting.

284
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:46,256
(Beauty Yu, the new emperor's consort)
You think as Her Majesty's niece,

285
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:49,376
you can break the palace rules?

286
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,736
Rules?

287
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:57,296
You...

288
00:12:57,296 --> 00:12:58,656
A mere Beauty

289
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,736
dares to lecture me on rules?

290
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,896
I heard His Majesty

291
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,816
brought back Consort Lu
from the sacrificial pit yesterday.

292
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:10,456
Step forward and let me see

293
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,856
if you're a peerless beauty.

294
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,376
Greetings, all the beautiful sisters.

295
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:27,456
Don't you dare dodge!

296
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:28,336
Instinctive reaction.

297
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:30,416
Guards!

298
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,056
Consort Lu

299
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:33,736
has publicly affronted me.

300
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:34,496
Slap her.

301
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:37,496
I didn't dodge intentionally,

302
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:38,656
but I

303
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:41,136
was momentarily dazzled by your beauty.

304
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:44,416
I've long heard
of your celestial grace and beauty.

305
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,096
Seeing you today, I find
you live up to your reputation.

306
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:50,576
I beg

307
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,136
for Your Highness's forgiveness.

308
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,736
What a silver tongue you have.

309
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,736
No wonder both the late emperor
and His Majesty favor you.

310
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:02,096
Consort Xi,

311
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:03,176
enough.

312
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,336
We're sisters here.

313
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:06,336
Don't make such an ugly scene.

314
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,936
This bewitching consort isn't my sister.

315
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,456
By your looks,

316
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:12,776
you're nothing special.

317
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:17,336
Why did both emperors treat you
so exceptionally?

318
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:18,936
So

319
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:20,696
are you exceptionally

320
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:21,976
gifted in bed?

321
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:24,536
Consort Xi,

322
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,856
- you...
- Since when do you dictate to me?

323
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,096
Emperors' mind is unfathomable.

324
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,016
I don't know

325
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:36,016
why they favored me alone.

326
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:36,856
Consort Xi,

327
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,136
if you're so curious,

328
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,296
go ask them yourself.

329
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,016
You wretch!

330
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:43,376
Guards!

331
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:44,656
Seize her!

332
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,136
I'll tear up her mouth!

333
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:46,656
- Yes!
- Yes!

334
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,336
Let go of me!

335
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,216
Let go of me!

336
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,576
Truly a seductress!

337
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:06,176
Parading around
in such shameless clothing!

338
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:07,576
She is dressed like this

339
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:08,696
to please men.

340
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,616
Zisu! Yanyu!

341
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:11,376
Strip her!

342
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,656
Drag her out of the Yonghe Palace
to let the people there witness

343
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:15,856
how shameless she is.

344
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:16,656
- Yes!
- Yes!

345
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:17,896
Let go of me!

346
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:19,256
What are you doing?

347
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,136
I'll do it myself!

348
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,376
What's happening at the Yonghe Palace?

349
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,416
Your Majesty,

350
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,656
word came from the Yonghe Palace.

351
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:35,656
Consort Lu was stripped by Consort Xi.

352
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,256
Will Your Majesty go see?

353
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:39,456
After today's ordeal,

354
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:41,416
Consort Lu will likely become
a laughingstock.

355
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,816
That means nothing.

356
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:45,416
I want her dead.

357
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,192
