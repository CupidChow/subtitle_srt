Sister,

21
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:40,326
I miss you so much.

22
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,086
Don't worry.

23
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:43,686
After we go out,

24
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,646
I'll open a clinic.

25
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:48,366
My job's diagnosis
and yours is receiving payment.

26
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,806
We'll make a good living.

27
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:53,886
(Now I have a sister again.)

28
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:56,726
(In this life, I'll protect you.)

29
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,366
Sister.

30
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,766
(I'm sorry, Sister.)

31
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:11,966
(Why did I fail to protect you
this life?)

32
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:32,926
Fu An said you haven't eaten all day.

33
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:34,846
I had
the imperial kitchen prepare pastries.

34
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:35,846
Have some.

35
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:40,646
Found the killer?

36
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,686
Not yet.

37
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:55,766
Lu Zhen'er,

38
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:57,766
I know Yindan's death

39
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,886
has devastated you.

40
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,446
But you must eat.

41
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:04,246
Or else you'll wear yourself out.

42
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:11,966
Zhen'er,

43
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,726
those who are still alive

44
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,566
must live well.

45
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:21,326
Xiao Wenjing,

46
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,166
I remember you told me

47
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,886
that if I die,

48
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:27,086
the world's storyline will be reset

49
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:28,406
and you can go home.

50
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,446
What are you planning?

51
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:34,046
I want

52
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,166
to exchange my life

53
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,006
for yours.

54
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:40,206
I'm begging

55
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:42,486
for one more lifetime.

56
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,166
You want me to die?

57
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,046
Once you die,

58
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,286
the world's storyline will be reset

59
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:52,406
and everything returns to the beginning.

60
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,086
My sister

61
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:56,926
can return safely then.

62
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,126
Impossible.

63
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:00,446
I won't let your death be in vain.

64
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:03,166
After we recognize each other next time,

65
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,126
tell me the truth immediately.

66
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:07,126
Once I see my sister's face,

67
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:08,326
I'll believe you.

68
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:11,126
After I send her
out of the palace safely,

69
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,046
I'll die for you.

70
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,726
I'll take you away from this world.

71
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,846
Consider it my repayment to you.

72
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,526
Absolutely not.

73
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:23,726
Why?

74
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:25,606
If you die,

75
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:28,606
the world's storyline will be reset.

76
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:30,326
All your memories will vanish.

77
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:30,966
Next time,

78
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,526
you won't remember me at all.

79
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,246
So what?

80
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,366
I'll trust you.

81
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,086
I need more than that.

82
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:38,446
Lu Zhen'er,

83
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,286
you have someone to protect.

84
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,166
I also have mine to protect.

85
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,046
Don't be so selfish

86
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:46,246
as to make me abandon the one I protect.

87
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,286
But we're from different worlds.

88
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:50,526
We're destined to part.

89
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:53,446
We're in the same world now.

90
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,366
Xiao Wenjing, don't you want to go home?

91
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:06,326
There's someone I cherish here.

92
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,366
Next time, I'll still be the same.

93
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,126
What are you afraid of?

94
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,566
I'm afraid of that hearts change easily

95
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,406
and life is unpredictable.

96
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:24,726
But

97
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,446
I promised my sister

98
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:31,406
I'd protect her.

99
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:35,166
I promised her,

100
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,646
yet I let her die.

101
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,366
Next time,

102
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,046
do we have a recognition code?

103
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,126
You responded perfectly this time.

104
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:17,126

105
