00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:24,096
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,880
(Xiao Wenjing,
have you considered making bombs?)

3
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,216
=Episode 6=

4
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:30,976
(Empress Regnant Lu Zhen'er)

5
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:37,408
(Empress Regnant Lu Zhen'er)

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,220
Consort Lu saved His Majesty,

7
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,248
so specially rewarded
with 100,000 taels of gold,

8
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:46,620
100 bolts of silk,

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,380
ten Southern luminous pearls,

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,900
two pairs of gold buyao hairpins,

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,220
ten pairs of gold earrings,

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,020
one pure gold longevity lock,

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,180
and a box of Dongzhu pearls.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,500
Tone it down.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,740
Your eyes are practically glued
to these gold ornaments.

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,340
Do they look good?

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,620
Yes.

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,220
Fu An, you may leave us now.

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,820
Yes.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,980
Who sent those assassins?

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,940
Have you found anything?

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,340
They're all dead.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,060
No survivors.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,592
I suspect

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,700
it was likely Prince Rui.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,940
I think so too.

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,100
Don't worry.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,736
Once I've recovered,

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,180
I'll test him out.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,672
I don't buy the plot nonsense.

31
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,260
Recent events

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,420
are mostly man-made.

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,020
Plus,

34
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,340
we don't know the relationship

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,000
between the original owner
and Prince Rui.

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,496
He's definitely involved.

37
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,500
After you recover,

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,380
let me take you out.

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,180
Sounds great!

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,060
Where to?

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,140
Have a beach barbecue.

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,500
Yes! Perfect!

43
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,580
Haven't been to the beach

44
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,944
in ages.

45
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,260
Are you okay?

46
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,024
Xiao Wenjing,

47
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,140
why does this beach look so familiar?

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,740
All beaches look pretty much the same.

49
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,340
Grilling meat and drinking beer
by the sea

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,460
is pure bliss.

51
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,660
What are you smiling at?

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,220
There's something

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,620
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

54
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,620
What?

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,420
This.

56
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,627
(Empress Regnant Lu Zhen'er)

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260
Where did you get this?

58
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,020
Under a shelf in your study.

59
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,980
Come inside.

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,580
Look!

61
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,940
A glowing peacock.

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,540
- It's so unique!
- Keep your voice down.

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,600
What books do you want?

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,220
All of...

65
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,540
What is this?

66
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:56,992
(Empress Regnant Lu Zhen'er)

67
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,860
(Empress Regnant?
I'm actually going to be empress?)

68
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,500
If that's the case,

69
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,620
then I must be the heroine.

70
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,060
Are you that sure you're the heroine?

71
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,660
Absolutely!

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,624
I'll be Empress Regnant.

73
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,096
Doesn't it mean I'm the heroine?

74
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,740
From now on,

75
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,704
I officially have the heroine aura.

76
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,420
Prince Rui? Empress Dowager Chen?

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,288
They're nothing!

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,340
If you become Empress Regnant,

79
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,500
what about me?

80
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,660
Does that mean I'll die?

81
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,980
Since I'm the heroine,

82
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,220
you must be the hero.

83
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,620
In female-centric novels,

84
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,340
whoever the heroine chooses
becomes hero.

85
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,500
No arguments.

86
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,700
Is that so?

87
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,940
Yes.

88
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,340
But you said before

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
you'd defy fate.

90
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,616
Life's easier with less meddling.

91
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:04,544
♪When thunder roars♪

92
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,264
Xiao Wenjing, have you considered

93
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,860
making bombs?

94
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,260
Bombs?

95
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,580
As long as we succeed,

96
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,580
the military power of Beizhao

97
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,980
will skyrocket several levels.

98
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,220
Not seeking fame in history books,

99
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,540
just aiming for global domination.

100
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,700
What?

101
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,100
It just struck me

102
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,380
how perfectly you fit this role.

103
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,060
I agree.

104
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,940
Rise.

105
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,220
Xiao Wenjing.

106
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,980
Do you think after I
become Empress Regnant,

107
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,860
I can start

108
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,140
a harem?

109
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,660
Just imagining crowds of handsome men

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,620
fighting over my favor

111
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,180
makes me so happy!

112
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,140
But I'll be benevolent.

113
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,060
Not only

114
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,020
can palace maids leave at 25,

115
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,220
male consorts over 25 can leave too.

116
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,140
Thus,

117
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,460
my harem will always be filled

118
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,220
with men in their early twenties.

119
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,792
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

120
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,500
You two reek of alcohol.

121
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,700
Where have you been?

122
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,580
It's not late yet.

123
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,060
We were handling important matters.

124
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,060
Prince Rui,

125
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,220
why are you here?

126
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,940
I return to the palace
whenever I please.

127
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,420
What's it to you?

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,460
Zhen'er, I told you

129
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,260
Xiao Wenjing has treacherous ambitions.

130
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,060
He's no good.

131
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,100
How shameless of you

132
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,020
to sow discord between us

133
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,900
right to my face!

134
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,020
Xiao Wenjing,

135
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,140
dare you swear the assassination
had nothing to do with you?

136
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,380
What does he mean?

137
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,460
Xiao Wenjing,

138
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,340
you don't dare.

139
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,020
Why wouldn't I dare?

140
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,420
I swear right now!

141
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,020
If I had anything
to do with the attempt,

142
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,740
may my father

143
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,500
never be reincarnated.

144
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
You unfilial wretch! What did you say?

145
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,272
You asked me to swear,

146
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:10,940
and I swore it.

147
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,820
Why are you angry?

148
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Xiao Wenjing,

149
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:15,060
you're defying your elder.

150
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,940
You're being defying.

151
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,380
Xiao Yicheng,

152
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,840
don't think all that mansplaining

153
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,180
makes you my father!

154
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,700
How dare you,

155
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,100
a prince, speak to me like this?

156
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,312
I'll exterminate your clan!

157
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,816
Were you shot in the head by a gun?

158
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:27,780
A gun?

159
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,460
What's a gun?

160
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,580
- This
- This

161
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,080
- is a gun!
- is a gun!

162
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,180
(Are they insane?)

163
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,700
Xiao Wenjing,

164
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,580
how dare you!

165
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,420
You hit me!

166
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,300
Stop fighting!

167
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,340
Stop fighting!

168
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,580
Stop it!

169
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,260
I'll kill you!

170
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,580
That wench Lu Zhen'er

171
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,580
first seduced the late emperor.

172
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,340
Now, she's bewitched Prince Rui

173
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,900
and Xiao Wenjing!

174
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,020
An emperor and a prince

175
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,660
brawling in the palace! Unbelievable!

176
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,220
I will not allow her to live!

177
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,700
Jingxi,

178
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,460
come here.

179
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,180
Yes.

180
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,740
Understood.

181
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,820
I'll see to it immediately.

182
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,700
Lu Zhen'er,

183
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,180
I'll not tolerate you!

184
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
What are you doing here?

185
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,780
By Empress Dowager's decree,

186
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,220
I've come to purge the evil spirit.

187
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,860
What evil spirit?

188
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,460
All the koi in the imperial garden died.

189
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,340
Empress Dowager dreams nightly
of an evil spirit,

190
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,740
so Master Wu was summoned
to perform rites.

191
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,020
He detected the spirit resides
in Zhaohua Hall.

192
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,380
I request your permission to search.

193
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,100
Don't make this difficult for me.

194
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,860
Fine.

195
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,340
Go ahead.

196
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,220
Tear the place apart.

197
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,060
If you find nothing,

198
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,620
it'll prove my innocence.

199
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,580
Good.

200
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,380
Search it!

201
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,100
Jingxi,

202
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,860
I've found it!

203
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,660
You two.

204
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,620
Please escort Consort Lu
to Wanchun Hall.

205
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,980
Wait.

206
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
I can walk on my own.

207
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,700
Stars of the Great Zenith,
ceaselessly adapting.

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,980
Banish evil spirits, bind the demons,
protect life, guard the body.

209
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,140
Wisdom clear and bright,
heart and mind tranquil.

210
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,100
Three souls eternal,
seven spirits intact and steadfast.

211
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,660
Empress Dowager,

212
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,700
I found this

213
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
in Consort Lu's palace.

214
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,580
This is

215
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,620
a sorcery doll!

216
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,220
Lu Zhen'er,

217
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,140
you practice sorcery
within the palace walls.

218
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,180
You shall be punished.

219
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,580
Guards!

220
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,180
Drag this sorceress away.

221
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,780
Beat her to death immediately!

222
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,900
Empress Dowager,

223
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,500
this is not sorcery.

224
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
It's merely a common

225
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,540
prayer doll!

226
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,820
Master.

227
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,760
I accompany His Highness daily.

228
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,140
Seeing him exhaust himself for Beizhao,

229
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,140
my heart truly aches for him.

230
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,480
I suddenly recalled

231
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,260
a prayer method I heard of.

232
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,460
As long as

233
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,940
I sincerely offer myself in exchange,

234
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,740
I can protect those I wish to safeguard,

235
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,140
ensuring their peace and health.

236
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,420
Nonsense!

237
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,820
If Your Highness doubts my words,

238
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,620
have Master Wu open this doll

239
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,580
to see whose name is inside.

240
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,312
Then the truth will be revealed.

241
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:02,820
Fine! Open it then!

242
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,020
Master Wu, open it now!

243
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,700
Master Wu,

244
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,020
what are you waiting for?

245
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,860
Must I do it myself?

246
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,740
I dare not. I'll open it now.

247
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,060
Master,

248
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,940
whose name is on the slip?

249
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,544
(Lu Zhen'er, 9th day of the 8th month
in the year of Gengyin at the Si hour)

250
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,180
It's Lu Zhen'er.

251
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,580
Even if it's a prayer doll,

252
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,540
practicing sorcery within the palace

253
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,820
violates palace rules.

254
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,460
So punishment cannot be avoided.

255
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,096
Drag her out
and give her 30 strokes of the cane.

256
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:44,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

257
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Empress Dowager, I...

258
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,820
Empress Dowager,

259
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,660
I'm innocent!

260
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,112
If you act so arbitrarily,

261
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,780
that may sow discontent in the consorts.

262
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,980
Who would be discontented?

263
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,340
For a vile consort like you,

264
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,152
I'm not taking your life here

265
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:59,140
and that's immense mercy.

266
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,780
Thirty strokes seem too lenient.

267
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,380
She has a sharp tongue.

268
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,860
Thirty strokes won't humble her.

269
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,312
Then make it 50 strokes!

270
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,980
Oh!

271
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,140
Darn it!

272
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,300
(Without power or status,)

273
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,620
(I'm at the mercy of others.)

274
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,900
(No.)

275
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,540
(I can't just do nothing.)

276
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,448
(I must save myself.)

277
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,500
Your Highness, what are you doing?

278
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,820
I did nothing wrong!

279
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,020
I won't submit to this!

280
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,300
Zhen'er, what happened?

281
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,540
It's you.

282
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,700
Prince Rui.

283
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,820
Lu Zhen'er practiced sorcery
within the palace.

284
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,984
I punish her according to palace rules.

285
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,700
If you take her away,

286
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,380
do you hold me in any regard?

287
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,944
Following palace rules

288
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:25,380
or fabricating charges
where none existed?

289
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,340
Fine.

290
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,020
Even if I spared her for this,

291
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,900
she caused the fight

292
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,740
between you and His Majesty
out of jealousy!

293
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Does such a bewitching consort

294
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,540
not deserve death?

295
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
You

296
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,780
envy her.

297
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,020
I act only to rid Beizhao of her.

298
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,020
Xiao Yicheng,

299
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,100
she isn't the innocent girl you imagine.

300
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,340
Do be fooled.

301
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,900
I know well

302
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,580
who she is.

303
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,380
Don't you worry about it.

304
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,500
Fine! As you wish.

305
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,020
She'll be the death of you one day.

306
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

307
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,580
Zhen'er,

308
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,860
Chen Wanyi is vicious
and consumed by jealousy.

309
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,380
You must be extra cautious.

310
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,220
Thanks for the repeated warnings.

311
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
I have things to do. See you.

312
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Your Majesty,

313
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,620
Prince Rui rescued Consort Lu.

314
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Please set your mind at ease.

315
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,260
So what if he saved her?

316
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,020
Her business is none of my concern.

317
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,220
But I fear Empress Dowager

318
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,300
may harm Consort Lu again.

319
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,824
Not everything in my life is about her.

320
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,260
I'm quite busy myself.

321
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,280
Don't bother telling me about her.

322
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,340
Understood, Your Majesty.

323
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,020
Why does

324
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,060
the tea taste different from before?

325
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,980
This is Mengding Ganlu tea
prepared by Consort Lu.

326
00:13:57,312 --> 00:13:59,940
Change it! I don't like it anymore.

327
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,700
Yes.

328
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,540
Empress Dowager was too cruel.

329
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,820
It's bleeding.

330
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,740
She was clearly
trying to beat me to death.

331
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,540
She couldn't win
the late emperor's favor.

332
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,580
She should examine her own flaws,

333
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,288
instead of tormenting you.

334
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,980
Now look at this.

335
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,500
Is she determined to kill you?

336
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,260
It's nothing.

337
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,180
I've thought of a way to deal with her.

338
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,500
You're here.

339
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,448
I'll take my leave.

340
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,220
How's your injury?

341
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,380
It's nothing.

342
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,020
Only a couple of strikes.

343
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,460
Prince Rui saved you again today.

344
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,820
He hovers around you constantly.

345
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,660
I suspect he has ill intentions
toward me.

346
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,300
Moreover,

347
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,620
today I uncovered an explosive secrete.

348
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,820
Aren't you going to ask?

349
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,780
Out with it.

350
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,260
I found

351
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,700
Prince Rui and Empress Dowager Chen

352
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,620
are having an affair.

353
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,460
Nonsense!

354
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,340
I'm not making it up.

355
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,580
I swear on my honor, it's true.

356
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,460
Even if Prince Rui isn't interested,

357
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,940
Empress Dowager Chen absolutely is.

358
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,020
Impossible.

359
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,220
Are you that certain?

360
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,620
Though Prince Rui
isn't her biological son,

361
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,060
their relationship is established.

362
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,740
They're mother and son in name and law.

363
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,656
I have no interest in such perverse acts

364
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:36,540
that defile the imperial harem.

365
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,900
What does your interest
have to do with it?

366
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,140
They're

367
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,980
definitely involved.

368
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,460
Ouch!

369
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
Their relationship isn't your concern.

370
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,580
Focus on

371
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,740
why Prince Rui treats you this way.

372
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,580
Who knows the connection between him
and the original owner?

373
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,620
If only he is banished from the capital.

374
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,340
(If I catch those two)

375
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,220
(red-handed,)

376
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,740
(I can use public opinion)

377
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,580
(to ruin Empress Dowager's reputation)

378
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,900
(and expel Prince Rui from the capital.)

379
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,860
(Then she couldn't control me anymore.)

380
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,940
(I won't fear acting out of character
around Prince Rui.)

381
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,180
(I need to plan this carefully.)

382
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,940
You don't want Prince Rui to stay?

383
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,700
Of course not.

384
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,060
Every time I'm near him,

385
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,592
I fear breaking character.

386
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,460
Don't just sit there.

387
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,900
Help me

388
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,740
apply this medicine.

389
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,980
Lu Zhen'er,

390
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,900
there are boundaries.

391
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,020
How can you undress before me?

392
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,700
I'm still clothed.

393
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,460
Wishful thinking.

394
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,860
This spoiled heir

395
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,020
is oddly naive.

396
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:54,816
(The 3rd day of the 12th month, Hai hour,
Xiao Yicheng will die in the Cold Palace)

397
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
Who put up these posters?

398
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,700
What's the meaning?

399
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,940
What do you think?

400
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,340
Someone wants Prince Rui dead.

401
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,660
These posters have spread
throughout the palace.

402
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,580
Who'd be this brazen

403
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,900
and openly threaten a prince?

404
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,220
Go! Hurry!

405
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,448
It has been unsettled lately.

406
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
Empress Dowager,

407
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
rumors have been spreading
in the palace recently

408
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,340
with posters everywhere saying

409
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,300
Prince Rui will die.

410
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,340
Prince Rui?

411
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,104
(The 3rd day of the 12th month, Hai hour,
Xiao Yicheng will die in the Cold Palace)

412
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,420
Now everyone in the palace
must've seen this poster.

413
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,780
Empress Dowager Chen too.

414
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

415
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,980
What are you hiding?

416
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,740
Nothing. You are mistaken.

417
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,420
Take it out!

418
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,900
Hand it over.

419
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,300
(See how he reacts.)

420
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,500
What is this?

421
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,940
The latest Empress Regnant's Legend?

422
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,620
I don't know either.

423
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,700
It just appeared out of nowhere
like that drawing

424
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
of the Empress Regnant.

425
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:11,072
(The 3rd day of the 12th month, Hai hour,
Xiao Yicheng will die in the Cold Palace)

426
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,140
What's wrong with you?

427
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,540
It's nothing.

428
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,020
Just surprised that the next victim

429
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,060
is actually Prince Rui.

430
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,820
His dying will be no big deal.

431
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,300
Anyway, it has nothing to do with me.

432
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,860
Only this one?

433
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,740
No others?

434
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,380
Just this one.

435
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:32,544

436
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:35,648

Xiao Yicheng will die in the Cold Palace)

437
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,500
I have never drawn this picture.

438
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,220
Could it be someone like me

439
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,180
standing at a higher dimension

440
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,140
