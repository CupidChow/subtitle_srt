1
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,350
(Heaven's Dao is in turmoil.)

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,470
(As Empress Dowager Chen passed away,)

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,150
(the late emperor Xiao Nandu reclaims
the throne,)

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,430
(making Lu Zhen'er the Empress,)

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,270
(and imprisoning
the new emperor Xiao Wenjing.)

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,030
(Lu Zhen'er suddenly awaked)

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,230
(and resolved to end
the turmoil herself.)

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,150
Come on. If you want to leave, hurry up.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,950
If you don't, you can't stay.

10
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,630
Don't force me to act.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,470
I don't want to see any of you
in this palace.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,590
Take blank imperial edicts.
Write whatever you want.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,990
May you rise above all others.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,110
Okay.

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,510
- May you success.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,030
- May you be beautiful and wealthy.
- I will.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,150
May your wishes come true.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,550
Come on.

20
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,710
Long life Your Majesty.

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,070
Stop fanning.

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,310
Just go, all of you.

24
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,830
Yes.

25
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,590
Just go.

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,510
All of you, leave.

27
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,750
Everyone, leave now.

28
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,990
If you want to leave, hurry up.

29
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,864
I can't control you.

30
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,630
You're disgraceful!

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,510
Get out!

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,830
My father will be sad
to see you like this.

33
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,750
I don't want to see you.

34
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,230
Stop this.

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,790
Lu,

36
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,510
look, I'm also a deer.

37
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,710
I made it myself.

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,630
I sneaked a bite.

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,470
Shall I feed you?

40
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,032
I'm not sweet-talking you.

41
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,270
I want to reconcile.

42
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,830
Don't speak to me with that face.

43
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,590
He never speaks to me that way.

44
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,510
(Why am I sad again?)

45
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,710
Will Lu Zhen'er come today?

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,190
Ever since Empress Dowager Chen died,

47
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,590
Lu Zhen'er has gone mad!

48
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,750
This chaos has been lasting for a month.

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,790
When will it end?

50
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,270
She's here.

51
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,350
Here she comes again.

52
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,390
How dare she behave in court!

53
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,830
Utterly disgraceful!

54
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,430
You!

55
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,350
Horse!

56
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,310
How dare you!

57
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,430
Your Majesty fall in love with me,
a wild horse.

58
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,070
Then I'll gallop across your palaces

59
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,910
like a green pasture!

60
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,430
You overstep!

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,950
If you continue like this,

62
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,110
do not blame me for being ruthless.

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,190
I'd like to see how ruthless you can be.

64
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,590
Don't think I'll indulge you forever.

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,630
So I intend to see

66
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,910
where your limit lies.

67
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,710
Absurd!

68
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,950
I know you care for Xiao Wenjing.

69
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,110
If you dare act recklessly again,

70
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,470
then Xiao Wenjing's life

71
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,150
won't be saved.

72
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,670
Zhen'er,

73
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,510
choose wisely.

74
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,420
=His Chosen Favor=

75
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:25,364
(You! Horse)

76
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:28,224
=Episode 22=

77
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,990
Why?

78
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,910
Why is everything gone?

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,710
Where is the real Xiao Wenjing?

80
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,830
Has his past

81
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,510
been erased?

82
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,910
Xiao Wenjing,

83
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,550
can you come back?

84
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,470
(Lu Zhen'er, I know this isn't you.)

85
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,630
What is this?

86
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,790
(Lu Zhen'er, late emperor's consort)
Don't sleep.

87
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,550
Kneel!

88
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,950
I told you to kneel!

89
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,190
If you refuse,

90
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,390
fine,

91
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,150
I'll destroy my face.

92
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,070
Let's see how that useless one reacts

93
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,550
when she comes back.

94
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,870
Don't think I won't kill you.

95
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,230
Go ahead, kill me.

96
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,150
If you kill me,

97
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,070
she'll never return.

98
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,430
Don't harm her.

99
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,350
I'll kneel.

100
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,870
(I don't know where you are,)

101
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,230
(but I know)

102
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,630
(you don't want to see this.)

103
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,110
(So I've decided)

104
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,950
(to trade myself for your return.)

105
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,710
Where is the former Lu Zhen'er?

106
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,350
If you don't answer me,

107
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,150
I'll kill myself right now.

108
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,430
(Her will is weak.)

109
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,510
(She's lost her qualification
as the heroine.)

110
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,070
(The main world believes
the original Lu Zhen'er)

111
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,550
(is a better choice for the heroine.)

112
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,510
How is her will weak?

113
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,190
(She's too emotional)

114
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,190
(and indecisive,)

115
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,870
(so unfit to be the heroine.)

116
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,070
So your definition of a heroine

117
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,550
is the heartless,

118
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,590
and cold-blooded woman,

119
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,870
who is alone

120
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,710
and only cares about herself,

121
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,030
just like current Lu Zhen'er

122
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,310
who treats lives like dirt?

123
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,670
(This isn't my judgment,)

124
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,750
(but the comments captured by big data.)

125
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,710
A heroine must first be a living person.

126
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,510
This is my comic.

127
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,670
She's my absolute protagonist.

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,430
No matter who you are,

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,830
give her back to me.

130
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,230
(If the host wants Lu Zhen'er
back to this world,)

131
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,470
(fine.)

132
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,590
(As long as the host makes a deal,)

133
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,790
(she will return.)

134
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,510
What is it?

135
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,750
(Because the host interfered
with the main storyline,)

136
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,710
(making Lu Zhen'er fall in love
with you,)

137
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,910
(she was erased by the main world.)

138
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,510
(Trade your soul,)

139
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,390
(and she'll return.)

140
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,990
My soul?

141
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,390
(After losing your original soul,)

142
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,430
(you'll be lost in this world forever,)

143
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,550
(becoming the real Xiao Wenjing.)

144
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,830
Then will she come back?

145
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,150
(Yes.)

146
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:21,110
I want her back.

147
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,830
So,

148
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,270
I can return

149
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,430
because of Xiao Wenjing.

150
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,870
Xiao Wenjing,

151
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,790
(Xiao Wenjing,)

152
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,670
(even if you've forgotten me,)

153
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,030
(I won't give up.)

154
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,070
(I will awaken you.)

155
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,070
Greetings, Your Majesty.

156
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,870
Your Majesty, what can I do for you?

157
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,030
I need to speak with you.

158
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,550
Speak your mind, Your Majesty.

159
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,350
Qing'er isn't an outsider.

160
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,750
Your Majesty,

161
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,870
I shall take my leave now.

162
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,630
(So obedient.)

163
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,870
(Seems the bewitching consort taught her
a harsh lesson.)

164
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,870
Your Majesty,

165
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,710
what do you wish to say?

166
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,790
You're afraid of me?

167
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,350
Just speak plainly, Your Majesty.

168
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,150
In broad daylight,

169
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,150
we are alone together,

170
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,310
which is improper.

171
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,350
Do you not remember me?

172
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,550
You are my father's wife.

173
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,990
Physical contact with me

174
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,910
is inappropriate.

175
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,350
Xiao Wenjing,

176
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,670
I'm your beloved.

177
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,470
Do you remember?

178
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,790
Please watch your words.

179
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,310
It's alright.

180
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,630
Fine if you can't remember.

181
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,870
He'll remember eventually.

182
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,510
(So what if he forgets?)

183
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,230
(Instinct reveals the truth.)

184
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,270
(He still cares for me.)

185
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,350
Why do you obey
your father unquestioningly?

186
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,150
Naturally, a son obeys his father.

187
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,670
I'm your mother,

188
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,350
so you should obey me.

189
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,550
What do you want me to do?

190
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,150
What did he order you to do?

191
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,070
I'm speaking to you.

192
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,390
Why aren't you answering?

193
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,950
He ordered me to conceive
a child with Qing'er.

194
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,710
Why would he make the order?

195
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,350
For elixir.

196
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,430
For elixir?

197
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,670
What kind of elixir?

198
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,150
The elixir of immortality.

199
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,950
He needs umbilical blood
from a close relative.

200
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,830
Why doesn't he father one?

201
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,710
He can't?

202
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,350
I don't know.

203
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,870
Don't go yet.

204
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,510
You love my father, right?

205
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,510
I don't love him.

206
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,510
I love you.

207
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,750
So from now on,

208
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,910
you will only listen to me.

209
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,910
You'll do whatever I tell you to do.

210
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,750
Do you understand?

211
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,550
This is improper.

212
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,550
From this moment forward,

213
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,430
you will only love me, cherish me,

214
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,230
and obey me.

215
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,070
Don't bully me

216
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,830
and make me mad.

217
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,430
If others bully me, defend me.

218
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,310
If others insult me, argue for me.

219
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,070
Your heart and eyes must hold only me.

220
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,590
