1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:24,244
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,188
(If You Dare Touch My Person,
You're Dead)

3
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:29,472
=Episode 8=

4
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,776
Xiao Yicheng.

5
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,176
What brings you here?

6
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,496
Xiao Wenjing,

7
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:57,536
how dare you!

8
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:00,776
Tell me. Where is Lu Zhen'er?

9
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:04,216
You want her dead.

10
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:06,496
Why do you even care about her life?

11
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,656
Hand over Lu Zhen'er.

12
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:11,616
Or I'll castrate you, a depraved prince
who slept with an imperial consort.

13
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:15,616
Xiao Wenjing, I've guarded
the frontier for ten years.

14
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,336
Would you execute
a meritorious minister so casually?

15
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:23,856
Where is Lu Zhen'er?

16
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,016
If you kill me,

17
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:28,896
the frontier will descend into chaos.

18
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,656
Beizhao has more than one general.

19
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,696
We don't need you
to safeguard Beizhao's peace.

20
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,456
Go ahead and kill me if you dare.

21
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:39,656
Guards!

22
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,496
- Yes!
- Yes!

23
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,176
Take Prince Rui to the dungeon.

24
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:42,896
- Yes!
- Yes!

25
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:44,856
Do you know who I am?

26
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,016
This is utterly defiant!

27
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,816
Lu Zhen'er,

28
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,456
I give you three days.

29
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:53,456
After three days, if I don't see you,

30
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,976
prepare to collect
Xiao Yicheng's corpse.

31
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,456
Absurd! Utterly absurd!

32
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:01,616
Take him away.

33
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:17,056
Fu An,

34
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,296
still no news of Lu Zhen'er?

35
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:21,256
Your Majesty, not yet.

36
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:24,456
I forgot.

37
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,576
Lu Zhen'er would rejoice
if Xiao Yicheng died.

38
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,016
She wouldn't risk her life for him.

39
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:32,816
Go find Yindan.

40
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:33,656
Yes.

41
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:46,856
Greetings, Your Majesty.

42
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:47,576
Rise.

43
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:49,936
Yindan,

44
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:53,336
do you know Empress Dowager Chen
is seeking Lu Zhen'er

45
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:54,976
due to the Cold Palace incident?

46
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:57,016
She will come out for you.

47
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:58,096
Your Majesty,

48
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,936
I don't know where Her Highness is.

49
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:04,416
Will you help me find Lu Zhen'er?

50
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,256
I won't kill her.

51
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:07,776
I sought you out

52
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,336
only to find her
before Empress Dowager Chen does.

53
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:13,456
If she falls into
Empress Dowager Chen's hands first,

54
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:14,736
she will certainly die.

55
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,856
Without your help,

56
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,696
she can't escape the imperial city.

57
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,336
She'll be found eventually.

58
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,536
Will Your Majesty truly
spare Her Highness?

59
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:22,656
I will.

60
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:24,776
At least this time,

61
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,456
I won't kill her.

62
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,776
What should I do, Your Majesty?

63
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,536
Let me go!

64
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:45,736
- (Xiao Wenjing,)
- Let me go!

65
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:46,976
(you threaten me with Yindan?)

66
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:50,616
(How treacherous!)

67
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,776
Please announce me. I seek His Majesty.

68
00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:08,016
Consort Lu?

69
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,096
Your Highness, I've been expecting you.

70
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,256
Please follow me inside.

71
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,296
Maybe she hasn't seen you today.

72
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:41,976
Her Highness may not come out for me.

73
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:43,536
She will.

74
00:04:47,216 --> 00:04:48,656
You go first.

75
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,416
Continue tomorrow.

76
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:50,336
Yes.

77
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,176
Where are you, Lu Zhen'er?

78
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:15,736
Lu Zhen'er,
does this place look familiar?

79
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:20,296
What do you want?

80
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:24,096
You schemed against me
and sent people to catch me in adultery.

81
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:26,696
I'll repay you in kind.

82
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:29,296
Lu Zhen'er,

83
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:32,016
who do you think sent me to harm you?

84
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:35,736
Enjoy yourself here.

85
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,016
I'll finally sleep
with the emperor's woman.

86
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:46,656
Your Highness,

87
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:49,936
let us brothers serve you well tonight.

88
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:50,456
Go away!

89
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,016
Go away!

90
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:29,936
Lu Zhen'er,

91
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:31,096
what's wrong?

92
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:33,376
You coward!

93
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:35,056
I'll kill you!

94
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,496
Lu Zhen'er? Lu Zhen'er?

95
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:41,056
Lu Zhen'er?

96
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:49,256
You're awake.

97
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:56,536
Lu Zhen'er, you...

98
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:00,936
Lu Zhen'er, what are you doing?

99
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,136
I'll kill you!

100
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,536
You? Kill me?

101
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:08,936
Lu Zhen'er!

102
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:09,696
Let go!

103
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:12,456
What are you, a dog?

104
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:13,336
Like heck I am!

105
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:16,776
Lu Zhen'er, what's with you?

106
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,256
I never imagined you'd collude
with the Empress Dowager

107
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:23,776
to do something this vile.

108
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,776
Listen to me.

109
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:25,936
The nonsense about chastity?

110
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:26,896
I couldn't care less.

111
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:28,616
It's just a flesh vessel.

112
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,776
You think that can break me?

113
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:31,936
Dream on!

114
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,016
What nonsense are you spouting?

115
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,536
I won't trust you anymore.

116
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:38,656
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

117
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,016
Whether you did it or not,

118
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,576
show me your remaining tricks!

119
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:43,936
I want to see

120
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,176
how low you'll sink.

121
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,176
Apart from using Yindan to lure you out,

122
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,616
I've done nothing else.

123
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:51,856
Have you or haven't you?

124
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,256
It's just your words.

125
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:55,936
I'll never trust a snake like you again.

126
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:57,496
Believe what you want.

127
00:07:58,656 --> 00:07:59,456
Where is Yindan?

128
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:00,776
I want to see her.

129
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,296
Your Majesty, it's bad.

130
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,416
Miss Yindan has gone missing.

131
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:05,256
What?

132
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:08,256
Didn't I order you to protect her?

133
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:08,856
What happened?

134
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,096
I did assign guards
to protect her, Your Majesty.

135
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:13,616
But Miss Yindan
said she needed the privy,

136
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:14,976
and then she vanished.

137
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:15,936
Meaning what?

138
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:17,096
What do you mean 'vanished'?

139
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,616
We searched the privy

140
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:19,336
and nearby.

141
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:20,176
No trace of her.

142
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,936
Where are you going?

143
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,456
It must be Chen Wanyi.
I'm confronting her.

144
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:27,896
I'll take you.

145
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:31,536
Let's go.

146
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:42,096
Where is Yindan?

147
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,896
How dare you barge
into Wanchun Hall unannounced!

148
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:46,416
Have you no respect for order?

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,576
I am the order!

150
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:49,056
Where is Yindan?

151
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:50,656
Ridiculous!

152
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,776
You lose your maid
and demand answers from me?

153
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:54,096
How should I know?

154
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:54,616
You!

155
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,216
Mother, hand her over.

156
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:02,216
I've never met any 'Yindan.'

157
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,656
If you refuse,

158
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:07,536
I'll exhume Father's coffin
from the imperial mausoleum

159
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:09,456
and feed his bones to dogs.

160
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:11,216
Xiao Wenjing, you wouldn't dare!

161
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,576
I dare anything.

162
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:15,296
I'll count to three.

163
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,656
If you won't free Yindan,

164
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,136
I'll dig the grave myself.

165
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:19,616
One.

166
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:20,336
You're bluffing.

167
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:22,456
Three.

168
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,056
Halt!

169
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,016
You wretch!

170
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,256
My patience wears thin, Mother.

171
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:35,256
Any more nonsense,

172
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,616
and regardless of your choice,

173
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,256
I guarantee

174
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:40,936
Father's corpse gets desecrated.

175
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:42,616
Lu Zhen'er escaped.

176
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,016
Someone had to replace her.

177
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,656
What did you say?

178
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,456
Lu Zhen'er,

179
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:55,456
everything that happened
to your maid today

180
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:57,216
is your fault.

181
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:05,416
Lu Zhen'er!

182
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,976
No!

183
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,656
Go away! Go!

184
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,856
Help!

185
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:18,216
No!

186
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,296
No!

187
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,176
Help!

188
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:23,856
Stop!

189
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,616
