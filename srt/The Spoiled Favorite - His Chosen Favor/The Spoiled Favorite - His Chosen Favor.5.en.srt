00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,096
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:26,496
(I Took Knives for You, Yet You Stab Me)

3
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:29,152
=Episode 5=

4
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:31,832
(Is this world)

5
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,312
(real or illusory?)

6
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:35,832
What are you doing out there?

7
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,552
Has the case been cleared up?

8
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:39,712
No.

9
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:42,112
Then investigate!

10
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,112
You came just in time.

11
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:44,472
I have something to tell you.

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,424
(Fortune Falls From Heaven)

13
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:55,832
Look.

14
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:57,952
(Consort Xi, I'm the Queen, Xiao Wenjing, Fu An)
The complex relationship of the harem.

15
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:58,784
(Xiao Wenjing: Time Traveler,
Puppet, Comic? New Emperor, Aloof)

16
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,032
(Chen Wanyi, Late Emperor, Xiao Yicheng)

17
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:03,232
Especially this part.

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,112
(Chen Wanyi, Rival, I'm the Queen)
This is the key point.

19
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,568
(Empress Regnant's Legend)

20
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,712
Where did you get this comic book?

21
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:13,552
I was knocked out
and don't remember anything.

22
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:15,032
I thought I was poisoned.

23
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,672
So I went to the Imperial Library

24
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,432
for any books about the symptoms.

25
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:19,672
Found this comic

26
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:21,872
on the shelf in the Imperial Library.

27
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,112
Are you saying

28
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:26,032
we were all created

29
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,352
and we're NPCs in this comic?

30
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:29,392
Exactly.

31
00:01:29,392 --> 00:01:32,072
I read the comic Harem Turmoil

32
00:01:32,072 --> 00:01:33,472
and transmigrated into it,

33
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:35,272
becoming the vicious Lu Zhen'er.

34
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:37,272
After entering the comic world,

35
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:38,952
I rewrote my own storyline,

36
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:41,632
thus creating this new comic.

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,272
Empress Regnant's Legend

38
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:44,752
is like in transmigration novels.

39
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:46,192
We, from beginning to end,

40
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,832
are fictional cardboard characters.

41
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:50,912
Seems a higher-dimensional
author created us.

42
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:52,392
Everything that happens to us

43
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:53,952
is drawn by that author.

44
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:56,872
What's wrong?

45
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:58,712
Don't understand?

46
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:00,152
I understand.

47
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,032
So you mean

48
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:04,192
you're the murderer in this comic?

49
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,992
It's fake.

50
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,192
Impossible.

51
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,312
I would not do that.

52
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,032
But you're just a cardboard character.

53
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,672
Everything is predetermined.

54
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:15,008
I am a real person!

55
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:15,808
I have a father,

56
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:16,712
a mother,

57
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:17,912
a sister who loves me,

58
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:19,272
and so many friends.

59
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,192
I've read so many books.

60
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:23,112
Though I ended up
becoming a mere workhorse,

61
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:24,592
all my experiences

62
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:25,712
are real.

63
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,032
I'm not a fictional cardboard character.

64
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:30,032
We were all created by someone else.

65
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:33,672
(In the sacrificial pit, Lu Zhen'er awakens abruptly)
All your experiences

66
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,712
were written in the comic.

67
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:37,592
So what?

68
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:39,592
Can't I control my own life?

69
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,512
Destined fate?

70
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:42,672
I'll tear this comic to shreds!

71
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:44,872
I'll write

72
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,872
my fate.

73
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,832
Your Majesty! Trouble!

74
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:03,872
♪It's all over revolution♪

75
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:06,512
Your Majesty! Trouble!

76
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:07,552
Empress Dowager is here!

77
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,152
She insists Consort Lu faces justice.

78
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:22,232
The day's grace period is up.

79
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:24,032
Has Consort Lu found the murderer?

80
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:26,952
Yes.

81
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:29,352
Where is the murderer?

82
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:31,712
The murderer

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,112
will appear during the Chou hour.

84
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:35,032
Lu Zhen'er,

85
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,112
don't try to stall for time again.

86
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,592
Guards! Drag her away!

87
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,512
Execute her by a thousand cuts.

88
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:43,792
I'm not stalling.

89
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,632
I also want to hand
over the murderer to you.

90
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,672
But the murderer only appears
during the Chou hour.

91
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:48,632
Your Grace,

92
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:49,912
you've waited an extra day.

93
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:51,712
Isn't it fine to wait another half day?

94
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:53,992
Why will the murderer appear
during the Chou hour?

95
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,352
When a person dies,

96
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,552
his eyes retain the last image he saw.

97
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,152
With a ritual at the Chou hour,

98
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:00,752
we can see the murderer's reflection

99
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:02,072
in the pupil of the body.

100
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:04,592
Fine.

101
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:06,912
For Xi's sake,

102
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,472
I'll grant you another half day.

103
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:11,312
If you can't catch the murderer tonight,

104
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:13,472
even if His Majesty shields you,

105
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,392
I'll see you dead.

106
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,512
Then half a day it is.

107
00:04:19,512 --> 00:04:20,672
I vouch for her.

108
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,512
Don't trouble yourself.

109
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:28,224
Go.

110
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:13,472
Yanyu.

111
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,752
I knew the murderer would appear
during the Chou hour

112
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:16,872
to destroy the body.

113
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:17,952
Surprisingly, it's you.

114
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,312
Yanyu, why did you kill Consort Xi

115
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:21,872
in such a cruel method?

116
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:24,552
No, I didn't!

117
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:25,792
If you're innocent,

118
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,312
why are you here tonight?

119
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:29,152
I came to see Consort Xi.

120
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:31,632
How dare you lie! Fu An!

121
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,712
Torture her.

122
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:33,232
Yes.

123
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,312
So what if I killed her?

124
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,712
Didn't she deserve to die?

125
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:45,472
Three years ago,

126
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:46,912
because she was in a bad mood,

127
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:48,632
she had my sister beaten to death.

128
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:52,192
All these years,
relying on the Empress Dowager,

129
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,152
she became reckless,

130
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,712
beating or killing countless maids.

131
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:56,392
She should've died long ago.

132
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:57,512
You wretch!

133
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:59,392
How dare you harm your mistress!

134
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,872
I'll have you torn limb from limb!

135
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,232
Don't bother yourself.

136
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:04,632
No!

137
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,512
Since the truth is uncovered,

138
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,832
I shall take my leave.

139
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:12,872
Lu Zhen'er,

140
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,992
today I'll spare you.

141
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:17,512
Mind your words and actions from now on.

142
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,072
If you repeat this offense,

143
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:20,992
you won't be so fortunate.

144
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:31,712
What?

145
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:33,512
We caught the murderer,
yet you're unhappy?

146
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:35,432
Xiao Wenjing,

147
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:37,672
don't you feel everything

148
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:38,832
was too convenient?

149
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:40,752
What do you mean?

150
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,512
Yanyu showed up easily.

151
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:45,552
Empress Dowager Chen
shifted conveniently.

152
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,312
Now that you're cleared,

153
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,432
why question it further?

154
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:57,392
I fear this matter

155
00:06:57,392 --> 00:06:58,672
is far from over.

156
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,752
Prince Rui, is here.

157
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:12,112
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

158
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:12,752
Sit.

159
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:15,632
Thank you.

160
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,992
What can I

161
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,392
do for you?

162
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,552
I helped you.

163
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,152
Is this how you respond?

164
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:52,952
Had you not intervened,

165
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:54,872
it wouldn't have mattered much.

166
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:56,832
Merely a woman's death.

167
00:07:57,272 --> 00:07:59,032
So you killed Xi?

168
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:00,432
Why did you kill her?

169
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,072
She's dead.

170
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,192
Rehashing it now is pointless.

171
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,392
If you wish to arrest me,

172
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:07,752
do it now.

173
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:13,192
Why arrest you?
Blame falls on her ill fortune.

174
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:16,112
I've heard you're a connoisseur,

175
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,712
savoring food expertly.

176
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:19,072
Today I ordered the kitchen

177
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,672
to prepare pastries

178
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,312
for you to taste.

179
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,912
Any suggestions for improvement?

180
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:41,912
Sweet but not cloying.

181
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,352
Fluffy and delicious.

182
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:44,472
Excellent.

183
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:47,072
(So he isn't the late emperor)

184
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,872
(who was allergic to mung bean cakes?)

185
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:50,432
Your Grace,

186
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:51,952
I've eaten the cake.

187
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,272
Questions were asked.

188
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:54,792
Is there anything else?

189
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,432
(I'll find out)

190
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,792
(whether you're pretending.)

191
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,312
No.

192
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,432
As the empire's maternal exemplar,

193
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:11,592
is this physical contact appropriate?

194
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:16,112
Leave. I don't wish to see you.

195
00:09:24,392 --> 00:09:25,352
(Your Majesty,)

196
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,592
(I miss you terribly.)

197
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,472
(So Chen Wanyi is testing me.)

198
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,432
(I must be more cautious.)

199
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:52,072
Ancient times are boring without phones.

200
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,352
Let me check if the comic updated.

201
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:58,592
New chapters.

202
00:09:58,952 --> 00:09:59,672
Really?

203
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:00,992
It updates in real time!

204
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:04,952
Here.

205
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:08,592
(Consort Jing was poisoned, causing chaos)
Consort Jing drank your pear soup

206
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,032
and died bleeding from all orifices.

207
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,792
It must be a joke.

208
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:13,992
Why would I send her any soup?

209
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,032
Your Highness, I've sent the pear soup

210
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,792
to Consort Jing.

211
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:18,432
What?

212
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,512
When did I order you to send it?

213
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:22,752
Your Highness.

214
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:23,632
Yindan,

215
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:25,392
I've prepared some pear soup these days.

216
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,032
Deliver it to all the consorts.

217
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:27,552
Yes.

218
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,912
A receiver never bites

219
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,552
the hand that feeds.

220
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,152
That nap made me groggy.

221
00:10:39,968 --> 00:10:44,272
(Empress Regnant's Legend)

222
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:46,432
Seems I really did it.

223
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:48,592
Let's take a look.

224
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,592
Consort Jing!

225
00:10:53,592 --> 00:10:54,392
What's wrong?

226
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,112
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

227
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,432
How is Consort Jing?

228
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,552
Her Highness was poisoned by arsenic.

229
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:05,432
Extremely potent.

230
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,232
I'm afraid

231
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,992
she's beyond saving now.

232
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,992
It's arsenic.

233
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,992
Your Majesty, her sudden death

234
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,512
is no small matter.

235
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,032
What happened?

236
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:20,392
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

237
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:23,672
she drank the pear soup sent
by Consort Lu

238
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:25,592
and died bleeding from all orifices!

239
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,712
I did send the pear soup,

240
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:35,952
but I didn't put arsenic in it!

241
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:47,352
Issue orders,

242
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:48,712
increase security at every palace.

243
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,792
I'll see for myself

244
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,752
who's stirring up trouble
behind the scenes.

245
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,320
Let's go.

246
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:58,912
Did that comic book

247
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,632
state Consort Jing's cause of death?

248
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,832
Poisoned by arsenic,
bleeding from all orifices.

249
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,672
Rest assured, I won't believe

250
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:08,952
you'd be manipulated by a comic.

251
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:11,432
Consort Lu is truly evil.

252
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:12,512
Since she came,

253
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:14,872
Consort Xi was turned
into human skin drums

254
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,872
and then Consort Jing died bleeding.

255
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,432
It's absolutely terrifying!

256
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:19,752
Indeed.

257
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:22,232
Everyone here literally pales
at mentioning her name.

258
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:23,912
We all avoid her path,

259
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,352
fearing being killed by her.

260
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:27,272
Who knows what His Majesty sees in her?

261
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,392
If I were His Majesty,

262
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,632
I'd kill her first.

263
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:34,832
They said you're evil.

264
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,872
Aren't you going to do something?

265
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:39,632
Take things as they come.

266
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:41,832
Reputation means nothing to me anyway.

267
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:42,832
Besides,

268
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,592
you are always on my side.

269
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:45,832
They wouldn't dare act rashly.

270
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,352
In the update of that comic,

271
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,352
besides Consort Jing,

272
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,192
will someone else suffer?

273
00:12:57,912 --> 00:12:59,072
Why does her face

274
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,152
look like this?

275
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:01,952
(Beauty Yu fell
in the hall, face in blood)

276
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:05,888
I totally forgot.

277
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,952
It says Beauty Yu

278
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,512
will be disfigured

279
00:13:10,632 --> 00:13:11,792
in my Zhaohua Hall.

280
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:16,752
Yindan, put away all celadon vases.

281
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,280
Yes.

282
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,312
Yindan, remember.

283
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:23,832
Never let Beauty Yu

284
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:24,912
touch any sharp objects.

285
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:27,392
Replace this teacup

286
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:28,432
with a cork cup.

287
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,392
Yes, Your Highness.

288
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:38,832
Your palace

289
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,792
looks like a cotton workshop!

290
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:47,112
This must be heavy.

291
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:48,632
Tiring to wear, huh?

292
00:13:48,632 --> 00:13:49,872
Yindan, come.

293
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,992
Change Beauty Yu's hairpin
to a jade one.

294
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:52,992
Yes, Your Highness.

295
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:54,472
But that's pure gold.

296
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,352
You should wear jade hairpins.

297
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:58,832
This one is very expensive.

298
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,392
It looks lovely.

299
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,392
Really?

300
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:13,672
The eyebrow ink looks beautiful.

301
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:15,632
No wonder you're the favored consort.

302
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:19,072
Why is here the eyebrow ink?

303
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:20,912
It wasn't here before.

304
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:24,592
Just the eyebrow ink.

305
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:25,992
Don't be so stingy.

306
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:34,152
My face!

307
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:36,992
My face!

308
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,512
The physician said that eyebrow ink

309
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:54,792
was made from powder of pearls

310
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,112
that were cultivated
for 10 years with arsenic water.

311
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,512
Where could it have come from?

312
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:05,272
I shouldn't have let her in.

313
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,352
I overestimated myself.

314
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:09,352
Xiao Wenjing,

315
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:12,352
do you think no matter how hard I try,

316
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,352
there's no way for me to change

317
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:15,752
the comic's plot?

318
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,152
If that's really the case,

319
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:20,912
what would you do?

320
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,112
Obviously,

321
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,432
try every possible way

322
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,552
to defy fate.

323
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,792
You really are one tough cookie.

324
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:35,832
Thank me for this character setup.

325
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:36,992
If I die,

326
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:37,992
you won't survive either.

327
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:41,952
If you don't, I won't survive.

328
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,512
What did you say?

329
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:44,112
Nothing.

330
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:46,512
Rest assured.

331
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,832
As long as I'm the emperor,

332
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,352
I'll always favor you.

333
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:54,032
Better take it easy.

334
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:56,312
You've drawn enough hatred onto me.

335
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:58,672
Fine.

336
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,912
Then just go ahead and die.

337
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:03,672
I've thought it.

338
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:06,552
Since the comic updates in real-time,

339
00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:08,832
I need to know its plot.

340
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:09,552
Thus,

341
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,432
I can find a way to defy fate.

342
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:26,352
Now,

343
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,512
I'm treated as a venomous snake.

344
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:29,672
Everyone avoids me.

345
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,392
I really want to see

346
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,272
what insane acts

347
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:36,752
I'm capable of next.

348
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:39,952
You will kill me.

349
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:41,344
(Lu Zhen'er stabs Xiao Wenjing
in the chest)

350
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,312
I would never kill you.

351
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:45,792
Do you really mean that?

352
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:48,432
Of course.

353
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:50,208
(Xiao Wenjing looks at her in disbelief)

354
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,152
But

355
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,992
I fear I might lose control.

356
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:58,312
So I have to strike first.

357
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,352
What are you doing?

358
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:06,552
Poke you.

359
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:12,992
Will this work?

360
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,832
It can break a bloody disaster,

361
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,872
so it should break the assassination

362
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:18,912
in the comic.

363
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,312
Look out!

364
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:46,032
You know martial arts?

365
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,112
Learned some sanda out of boredom.

366
00:17:48,112 --> 00:17:49,352
You're good.

367
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:51,912
Look out!

368
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,552
(Oh, that hurts!)

369
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:05,752
Lu Zhen'er!

370
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:07,032
Lu Zhen'er!

371
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,872
Why did you block it for me?

372
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:11,872
I refuse to believe

373
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:14,872
I can't change this ending.

374
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,352
Whoever tries to assassinate you,

375
00:18:18,392 --> 00:18:20,112
I won't let you die.

376
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,992
Lu Zhen'er.

377
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,832
Lu Zhen'er, will you really
not kill me this time?

378
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,832
(When I drew this book,)

379
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:33,952
(I never imagined one day)

380
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:35,912
(I'd transmigrate into my own book.)

381
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,512
(I thought that according to the setup,)

382
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:39,232
(you'll kill me)

383
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:40,672
(and I'll return to reality.)

384
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:42,432
(But unexpectedly,)

385
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:44,312
(I was trapped in an endless loop.)

386
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,992
(Life after life, you killed me,)

387
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,072
(keeping me imprisoned here
with no escape.)

388
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,472
(So this lifetime, I resolved)

389
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:53,432
(to kill you and change the ending.)

390
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:58,032
(But why did you take that for me?)

391
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,672
(Why?)

392
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,592
(Is this Lu Zhen'er even you?)

393
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:05,192
(Will the ending change this time?)

394
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,632
Your Majesty, shall we execute her?

395
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:10,672
Get out!

396
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:11,992
- Yes!
- Yes!

397
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,072
Go.
