1
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:24,160
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,040
(I thrive through massage
in the Cold Palace)

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,080
=Episode 13=

4
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:41,373
(Here is the essential plot
for harem dramas.)

5
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:43,133
(Every woman ends up
in the Laundry Service.)

6
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,333
Finish washing these clothes,

7
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,053
or no meals for you today.

8
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,253
(This is so NPC-like.)

9
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:52,733
What are you waiting for?

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,693
Get washing now!

11
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:55,573
Yes.

12
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:09,293
Fu An,

13
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,493
has Consort Lu arrived
at the Laundry Service?

14
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,893
Yes, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:21,493
Would Your Majesty care to visit?

16
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:22,853
I won't bother.

17
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:25,493
She boasts about her capabilities,

18
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:26,973
so let her stay there.

19
00:01:27,573 --> 00:01:28,813
I heard

20
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:30,293
the head matron there

21
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:31,173
often torments others.

22
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:32,893
Your Majesty could observe

23
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,133
how Consort Lu is being tormented.

24
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,104
Good.

25
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:40,653
Let's go then.

26
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:44,493
Set off for the Laundry Service!

27
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:50,893
(Clear obstacles as I go.)

28
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:51,933
(Across all eras,)

29
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,053
(a beast of burden)

30
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:55,584
(is doomed to suffer backaches
and stiff shoulders).

31
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:56,416
(In ancient times,)

32
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,693
(I'm back on the grind again).

33
00:01:57,693 --> 00:01:58,533
Let's begin.

34
00:01:59,173 --> 00:01:59,813
Come on.

35
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:03,173
(Resuming my old trade is easier
than doing laundry).

36
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:04,093
Relax.

37
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:08,413
Comfortable.

38
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,773
Lu Zhen'er, what are you doing?

39
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,173
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

40
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,373
Get out!

41
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:17,693
- Yes!
- Yes!

42
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,813
Why are you here?

43
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,293
Checking if you're dead yet.

44
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,613
Thanks to you,

45
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:29,773
I'm not dead

46
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,293
and doing quite well.

47
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,413
You only know cheap tricks.

48
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:36,653
True,

49
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,093
I lack your grand wisdom,

50
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:40,373
but small tricks are not

51
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,253
always inferior to grand wisdom.

52
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:51,893
What are you doing?

53
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:53,973
Lu,

54
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,613
I've been exhausted reviewing memorials.

55
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:57,973
Massage me.

56
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:00,773
Don't call me Lu.

57
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,013
I'm the Emperor.

58
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,413
Reasonable for me to call you Lu.

59
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:05,733
But

60
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:08,173
is this how a maid
addresses the Emperor?

61
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:10,773
Shall I order your head chopped off?

62
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,613
(You once said you were miserable
and wanted to go home.)

63
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,813
(Seems you're enjoying being emperor.)

64
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,333
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:20,453
Please lie down.

66
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:23,773
I'll give you a comfortable massage.

67
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,933
(I'll make sure you feel it.)

68
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:29,933
Ouch! It hurts.

69
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:41,173
Your Majesty,

70
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:43,293
comfortable?

71
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,693
Is my massage satisfactory?

72
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,493
Your hands must ache.

73
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,453
Let me massage them for you.

74
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:53,813
What are you doing?

75
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:54,613
Let go!

76
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,133
Helping you relax. Come on.

77
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,093
Release me!

78
00:03:57,493 --> 00:03:59,173
Xiao Wenjing, stop!

79
00:03:59,173 --> 00:03:59,813
Beg me.

80
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:01,293
I won't!

81
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:03,293
So courageous?

82
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,653
I beg you! Please!

83
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,773
Look at yourself!
Is this how a heroine should be?

84
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,253
What should a heroine be like?

85
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,373
Do you have a standard?

86
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:22,093
Can't a sensible person be the heroine?

87
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,173
You truly are...

88
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,133
Truly are what?

89
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,893
(Truly the heroine I created.)

90
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,453
(The atmosphere's strangely nice.)

91
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:42,093
(I'll make you pay for this.)

92
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:47,053
♪Wandering the streets,
the story unfinished♪

93
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,053
What are you doing?

94
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:52,493
Why are you here?

95
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,733
I came to see Zhen'er.

96
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:54,973
What did you say?

97
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,413
I heard she was demoted
to the Laundry Service

98
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,784
and feared she may be suffering.

99
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:00,053
Furthermore,

100
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:02,413
she is no longer your consort.

101
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,893
Has nothing to do with you.

102
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:05,453
She isn't now,

103
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:07,133
but she once was.

104
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:10,293
Even if I strip her title now,

105
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,213
she remains mine.

106
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,333
If you need attendants,

107
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,213
I'll select some for you.

108
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:19,573
The women I choose

109
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,093
will surely satisfy you.

110
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,253
(What nonsense is he talking?)

111
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:24,733
(So greasy.)

112
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,373
Lu Zhen'er belonged to the late emperor.

113
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:27,853
The late emperor is dead,

114
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,133
so I inherit what belonged to him,

115
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,333
including his women.

116
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,853
How dare you! Hands off!

117
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:34,373
You're overstepping!

118
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,533
Stop arguing!

119
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:39,853
I don't belong to anyone.

120
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:40,853
I belong to myself.

121
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,853
If you two want to argue,

122
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:43,773
go outside.

123
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:45,373
Out! Get out!

124
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,573
Zhen'er, I...

125
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:47,613
My gift for you

126
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,293
has been sent to your room.

127
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:50,413
Got it.

128
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:51,773
I'll come see you again.

129
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:52,693
Understood.

130
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:53,853
Get out.

131
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,333
(So annoying.
Can't find peace anywhere.)

132
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:05,293
Paid consultation today.

133
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,853
One pulse reading
equals one basin of laundry.

134
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:12,093
Whether it's spleen deficiency
or blood deficiency,

135
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:13,933
(Massage, Bone Setting)
I can treat any ailment.

136
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,253
First come, first served!

137
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:18,253
Here! Here!

138
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:19,453
Check me out.

139
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:21,173
Been feeling dizzy and lightheaded.

140
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:23,613
Can't seem to get full whatever I eat.

141
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:24,693
Take a look for me.

142
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:25,813
Check me out.

143
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,453
Shoo! Back to work!

144
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,373
- Yes.
- Yes.

145
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,293
- Move.
- Move.

146
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:32,973
Matron!

147
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,653
Lu Zhen'er,

148
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:37,653
if you don't finish laundering today,

149
00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,453
no dinner for you.

150
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,813
Anyone who helps her

151
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:43,693
will be punished with her.

152
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,293
Matron Liu, what's wrong today?

153
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:48,693
Why so harsh all of a sudden?

154
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:51,733
Get washing as I told you.

155
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,173
Matron, I have

156
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,493
a complexion-enhancing prescription.

157
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:56,893
Really?

158
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:58,688
Better than that
of Imperial Medical Academy.

159
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,413
His Majesty has decreed

160
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,213
anyone who makes things easier for you

161
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,813
will be punished with you.

162
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,293
Apologies, Consort Lu.

163
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:11,173
Not your fault.

164
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,813
No one opposes His Majesty.

165
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,333
(Xiao Wenjing,)

166
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,733
(let's see what you want to do.)

167
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:30,373
Xiao Wenjing,

168
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:31,424
what are you doing here?

169
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,213
Finest white jade.

170
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,013
Not a single flaw visible.

171
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,973
This tea set is worth a fortune.

172
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,533
Xiao Yicheng treats you so well.

173
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,733
Don't touch my things.

174
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,053
Discard the things he gave you.

175
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:52,493
Why?

176
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:54,173
What he gave me

177
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,413
is now mine.

178
00:07:58,053 --> 00:07:59,573
I can give you something better.

179
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,533
No.

180
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:03,493
I dare not accept anything
from Your Majesty.

181
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:04,813
If I accept it,

182
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:06,093
Your Majesty will say again

183
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:07,053
that I rely on you.

184
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,293
But I'll say you rely on Xiao Yicheng.

185
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,293
He is genuinely good to me.

186
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,613
What's wrong with relying on him?

187
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:18,493
Your Majesty,

188
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:20,213
it's late.

189
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,253
If that's all, please return.

190
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,013
If anyone sees us like this,

191
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:25,373
it'll be hard to explain.

192
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,253
What to explain?

193
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,813
Being alone together at night
is hard to explain.

194
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,493
Lu Zhen'er,

195
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,573
don't forget who you are!

196
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,133
I haven't forgotten.

197
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,693
I'm a maid in the Laundry Service now.

198
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,533
Lu Zhen'er!

199
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,093
Don't shout in the dead of night.

200
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,453
You're disturbing the peace!

201
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,613
Must you keep provoking me?

202
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,493
I just don't understand you.

203
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,493
You demoted me here as a maid,

204
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,573
making me the most lowly maid

205
00:08:57,573 --> 00:08:59,213
to get no advantage from you.

206
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,613
Why are you throwing yourself

207
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:01,813
on me like this?

208
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:03,293
I'm not.

209
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,173
No?

210
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:05,093
What's this all about?

211
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:08,693
Also, you wanted to eliminate me,

212
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:09,813
wishing I'd just die.

213
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,733
So why put on this act,

214
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,333
pretending you're lost without me?

215
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,453
Why insist on reconciling?

216
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:17,013
I'm not.

217
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:17,973
You'd better not be.

218
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:19,653
Remember this.

219
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:21,093
We stopped being friends long ago.

220
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:27,213
I've always been nice

221
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,133
to my friends.

222
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:33,133
You're not my friend,

223
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,413
so are you Xiao Yicheng's?

224
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:35,613
Yes.

225
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,093
I would never

226
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,253
be friends with a liar.

227
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:58,173
Your Highness, this way.
Lu Zhen'er is inside.

228
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:06,613
Consort Lu.

229
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,173
What brings you here so suddenly?

230
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,733
I heard

231
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:15,053
you're demoted to the Laundry Service,

232
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:16,413
so I came to see you.

233
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:19,933
Poor Consort Lu,

234
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,973
you were once a favored consort,

235
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,493
yet end up in such a state.

236
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:26,813
Good times don't last long.

237
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,133
You'll understand one day.

238
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,413
How dare you,

239
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,373
a lowly maid,

240
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:32,853
speak to me like this?

241
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,493
Kneel before me and apologize!

242
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:41,213
Lu Zhen'er, I said kneel!

243
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:42,653
So

244
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,733
you dare defy my order?

245
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:49,693
Do you still believe

246
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:52,493
His Majesty will come to save you?

247
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,253
His Majesty has decreed

248
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:59,813
you are the lowest maid in the harem.

249
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,933
No one shall show you favor.

250
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,093
Even if His Majesty were here today,

251
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,093
seeing me teach you manners,

252
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:08,133
he would only clap in approval.

253
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:11,173
His Majesty again.

254
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:12,933
Lu Zhen'er,

255
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:14,813
refuse to kneel?

256
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:17,693
Guards! Make her kneel!

257
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:18,853
- Yes!
- Yes!

258
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,853
Let me go!

259
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,693
What are you doing?

00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:52,573
