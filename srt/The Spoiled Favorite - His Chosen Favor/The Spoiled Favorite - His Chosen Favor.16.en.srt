1
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:23,904
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:26,592
(Seven Lu Zhen'ers)

3
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,600
=Episode 16=

4
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,536
Let go of me!

5
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:32,896
Hit me again,

6
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,432
and I'll kiss you before Xiao Yicheng.

7
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:36,136
I dare you!

8
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:38,472
Do you think I dare?

9
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:40,352
Stop it!

10
00:00:40,712 --> 00:00:41,792
You know me.

11
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,040
I'll do anything.

12
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:44,872
You

13
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:46,472
are

14
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:47,312
shameless.

15
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:49,552
I don't care.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,272
Zhen'er!

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,232
Zhen'er!

18
00:00:56,224 --> 00:00:57,712
Zhen'er.

19
00:00:58,552 --> 00:00:59,072
Zhen'er!

20
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:00,472
Your Highness, don't barge in!

21
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:04,312
Zhen'er isn't here.

22
00:01:04,592 --> 00:01:05,872
I clearly just heard it.

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,032
Do you wish to marry Lu Zhen'er?

24
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:09,992
Yes.

25
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:11,512
That can be arranged.

26
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,672
Fu An!

27
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:14,432
Invite Lu Zhen'er over.

28
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:16,032
Yes.

29
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:23,592
Choose.

30
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,352
Introduce yourselves.

31
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:28,952
I'm Lu Zhen'er No. one.

32
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:30,072
I'm Lu Zhen'er No. two.

33
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,992
- I'm Lu Zhen'er No. three.
- What do you mean?

34
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,272
- I'm Lu Zhen'er...
- Stop.

35
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:35,952
Xiao Wenjing!

36
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,312
You want to marry Lu Zhen'er.

37
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:39,392
Their name is Lu Zhen'er.

38
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,552
Take whoever pleases you

39
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:42,672
to your mansion for the wedding today.

40
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:44,312
Xiao Wenjing,

41
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,272
you dare mock me!

42
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:48,432
What gives you such audacity

43
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:51,072
to boss me around repeatedly

44
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,152
and shout disrespectfully?

45
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,032
By your behavior,

46
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:54,784
anyone will think

47
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,992
you were the late emperor reborn!

48
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,232
Nonsense! Utterly absurd!

49
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,512
You're not the late emperor,

50
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,352
so remember your place.

51
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:07,872
Yes.

52
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:09,712
Enough.

53
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,472
Pick a Lu Zhen'er to go with you.

54
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,632
Keep them for yourself,

55
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:17,872
Your Majesty.

56
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:19,832
I'll take my leave.

57
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,712
- If unsatisfied,
- (Xiao Wenjing is utterly shameless,)

58
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:25,032
- (resorting to such a trick.)
- I'll select more for you.

59
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,905
(I give up.)

60
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,032
Why not eat?

61
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:31,312
Let me out!

62
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:32,512
No.

63
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:33,312
Why?

64
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:34,352
It's dangerous outside.

65
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:35,752
It's comfortable here.

66
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,192
Yindan will keep you company.

67
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,352
Is locking me up fun?

68
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,192
Of course, it is.

69
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:42,672
Don't know your motives.

70
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,152
I made this myself.

71
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,072
I sneaked a bite.

72
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:50,656
Feed you?

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,952
Want me to pressure you?

74
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:03,672
How will you pressure me?

75
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:05,552
By threatening Yindan?

76
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,872
Or the imperial chef's life?

77
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:08,160
You said

78
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:09,632
you want to go home,

79
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:11,312
but can you?

80
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:14,232
You relish power
and act without restraint.

81
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,472
Will you adjust to the modern world's

82
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,072
rules and constraints?

83
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:23,192
Eat it or don't.

84
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:26,672
Your Highness!

85
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:27,432
Yindan!

86
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:29,952
Did he threaten you?

87
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:30,472
No.

88
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,792
Good.

89
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:33,592
Your Highness,

90
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,752
do you wish to marry Prince Rui?

91
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,392
Marrying him

92
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,472
means leaving the palace.

93
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:41,152
Marriage isn't child's play,

94
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,472
especially for us women.

95
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,432
Marry the wrong person

96
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,712
and your life will be ruined.

97
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,392
Don't think that way.

98
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:52,672
Gender doesn't matter.

99
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,592
If you're unhappy in marriage,

100
00:03:55,592 --> 00:03:57,024
be brave to leave anytime.

101
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:58,496
And in your life,

102
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
no matter when you start anew,

103
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,232
you must never wrong yourself.

104
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:13,672
This nightgown

105
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,904
was sewed by my mother

106
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,824
when I married the late emperor.

107
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,112
She hoped

108
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,392
we would be in perfect harmony

109
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:23,552
and united as one.

110
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:26,672
His Majesty loved me wearing
this nightgown the most.

111
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,480
- Indeed.
- So many years have passed.

112
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:32,192
Your Majesty looks so beautiful in it.

113
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:33,592
I'm old now.

114
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,112
Not at all.

115
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:39,192
I'm a mother now,

116
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,192
so I'm old.

117
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,632
When my child grows up,

118
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,992
I'll have become an old woman.

119
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:46,712
No.

120
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:48,752
When the young prince grows up,

121
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,392
marries, and has his children,

122
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:51,776
Your Majesty will still be young.

123
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:54,352
You always know how to cheer me up.

124
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:55,832
By the way,

125
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,552
teach me to make shoes tomorrow.

126
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,960
I wish to personally make a pair

127
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:02,792
of tiger-head shoes for my kid.

128
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,752
Also, clothes, toys.

129
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:07,936
I want

130
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,672
to make them myself.

131
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:11,192
- Your Majesty!
- What's wrong?

132
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:12,632
Fire!

133
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,952
Fire!

134
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,072
Fire!

135
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:30,752
Fire.

136
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:40,832
Lu,

137
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,552
look, I'm also a deer.

138
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:43,952
Eat something.

139
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,072
How can I get you to eat?

140
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:50,152
Let me marry Prince Rui.

141
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:50,880
Never!

142
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,352
Let me leave the palace!

143
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,632
Choose another.

144
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:54,752
Xiao Wenjing,

145
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:56,096
are you amusing yourself?

146
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:57,912
You have beauties in your harem

147
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,392
and Noble Consort Qing.

148
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:01,112
Stop stringing me along!

149
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:02,832
What Noble Consort Qing?

150
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,192
That day when I was ill,

151
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,232
you were being lovey-dovey with her.

152
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:10,032
When were you ill?

153
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,752
Two days ago!

154
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,672
Why didn't you send Fu An to me?

155
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,792
Yindan went with him to you!

156
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,912
But you focus on Noble Consort Qing!

157
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,632
What are you grinning about?

158
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,312
I am simply overjoyed.

159
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:31,392
Be quiet.

160
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:33,472
Yes.

161
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,552
I didn't know you were ill that day.

162
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,632
Nothing happened between us.

163
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:45,472
Never mind.

164
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,432
None of that matters.

165
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:47,472
I would

166
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,752
never fall for an ancient person!

167
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,072
Then you like me?

168
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,872
Nonsense!

169
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:04,232
Why don't you let me go?

170
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,312
Because I must watch you

171
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:12,232
at all times closely to prevent you

172
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,512
from suddenly killing me.

173
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:14,872
Is that so?

174
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:16,752
Of course.

175
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:18,432
Why imprison me

176
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:19,952
in your chamber?

177
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:21,392
Throw me straight into the jail.

178
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:22,912
Take the hint,

179
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,432
or suffer the consequences!

180
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,552
The consequences.

181
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:29,872
Suit yourself.

182
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:30,952
Starve for all I care!

183
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:47,952
What are you doing?

184
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:49,072
Are you insane?

185
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:52,512
Your Majesty! Trouble!

186
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:54,752
Something happened to Her Majesty.

187
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,672
What happened?

188
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:00,872
She caught fire.

189
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:01,992
What?

190
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:04,072
Her Majesty caught fire!

191
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:07,632
- Spontaneous human combustion!
- Spontaneous human combustion!

192
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:10,512
They said she suddenly caught fire!

193
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:11,832
Is she dead?

194
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:12,712
No.

195
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,432
Physician Wang is treating her.

196
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:17,056
White phosphorus.

197
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:21,752
Your Highness, what is white phosphorus?

198
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,192
White phosphorus is flammable.

199
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:24,792
The heat from clothing friction

200
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,032
can ignite it.

201
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,672
But how do you know this?

202
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,432
She read it in a book.

203
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,820
Hmm.

204
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:38,992
My child...

205
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,712
How is my child?

206
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:44,512
Say something!

207
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:46,872
I...

208
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:47,752
I dare not say.

209
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:49,472
Speak!

210
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:50,912
I'll absolve you of guilt.

211
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:54,592
Your Majesty was never pregnant.

212
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,192
Nonsense!

213
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,072
Clearly, my belly

214
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,632
growing bigger each day.

215
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,832
How could I not be pregnant?

216
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:06,992
- No signs of pregnancy, but...
- Nonsense!

217
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:07,992
Utter nonsense!

218
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:10,032
Guards! Drag him out!

219
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:10,792
Beat him to death.

220
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:12,312
Please spare me!

221
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,392
Please spare me!

222
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:16,232
Show mercy.

223
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:17,888
I must be pregnant!

224
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:20,592
How could I not be pregnant?

225
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:23,752
Your Majesty,

226
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:25,408
Physician Wang is highly skilled.

227
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:26,944
He shouldn't

228
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:28,472
have misdiagnosed.

229
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,720
Where did my child go?

230
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,552
Someone must've cursed me

231
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:35,192
and stole my child!

232
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,544
I'll go to Master Wu.

233
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,592
He'll surely have a solution.

234
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:44,752
Your Majesty, watch your step.

235
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,392
Your Highness.

236
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:58,720
Stop sighing.

237
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,992
Sighing harms your health.

238
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:04,472
Understood.

239
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,352
How do you regard His Majesty now?

240
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:12,352
Still wish to be his consort?

241
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:13,832
No.

242
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:16,992
If you marry Prince Rui,

243
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,672
would you truly be happy?

244
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:21,632
Yindan,

245
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:22,952
why do you ask?

246
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:26,552
I wish for your happiness.

247
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:30,232
As long as you're by my side,

248
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll be happy.

249
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,272
Come with us.

250
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:38,192
Who are you?

251
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:39,952
- What are you doing?
- Your Highness!

252
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,712
Chen Wanyi,

253
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,552
why arrest me again?

254
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:00,512
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

255
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:02,312
Lu Zhen'er,

256
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,272
please save my child!

257
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,472
What child?

258
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,312
I said you weren't pregnant.

259
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:11,832
No, I had a child!

260
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,792
I could feel he is there.

261
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:14,792
Lu Zhen'er,

262
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,232
if only you forgive me...

263
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:16,872
And Yindan.

264
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:18,232
If you'd both forgive me,

265
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:19,552
write me a letter of pardon

266
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:20,672
to cleanse my karma,

267
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,432
my child will return!

268
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,512
I don't understand.

269
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:26,352
Master Wu said

270
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,952
my accumulated negative karma

271
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:30,400
made my child vanish.

272
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,992
If you forgive me...

273
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:35,152
Lu Zhen'er,

274
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,432
if only you forgive me,

275
00:11:37,752 --> 00:11:39,352
I'll do anything you ask.

276
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,912
Chen Wanyi,

277
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:42,992
no ghosts or gods in this world.

278
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:45,792
- You never even had...
- Yes, I did!

279
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,552
I did have a child!

280
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:50,232
Lu Zhen'er,

281
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,512
forgive me!

282
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,632
It was my first child
with the late emperor.

283
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,592
Help me!

284
00:11:58,712 --> 00:11:59,552
But...

285
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,232
Your Highness,

286
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,432
write it for her.

287
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:04,752
Consider it

288
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:06,672
pity for a mother.

289
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:32,355
(Settling the score with Chen Wanyi,
by Lu Zhen'er)

290
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:38,152
Thank you both!

291
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:41,432
Yindan,

292
00:12:42,272 --> 00:12:43,272
I'm sorry.

293
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:44,512
No need, Your Majesty.

294
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:45,992
Not doing this for you.

295
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,592
Mothers endure enough hardship.

296
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,112
My child is saved!

297
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:56,672
My child is saved!

298
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,992
She's ill,

299
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:04,392
not pregnant.

300
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:05,992
Yet she

301
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:07,752
believes she became a mother.

302
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:11,552
Pitiable, yet not blameless.

303
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,472
Yindan,

304
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,072
were you thinking of you mother?

305
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,512
My mother

306
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,312
was very nice to me.

307
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:22,592
She...

308
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:24,552
She

309
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,192
passed away

310
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,232
to protect me.

311
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:32,632
Don't worry.

312
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,792
In the future, I'll protect you.

313
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,872
Amitabha.

314
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,072
Bless my child.

315
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:54,832
Amitabha.

316
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:55,672
Your Majesty.

317
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,872
What can I do for you?

318
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,112
Yicheng,

319
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:02,152
our child is gone.

320
00:14:04,592 --> 00:14:05,696
What happened to your face?

321
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,312
I said our child is gone!

322
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:10,272
That's for the best.

323
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,152
Yicheng,

324
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,792
that was your child!

325
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,512
Your flesh and blood!

326
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,312
Preposterous!

327
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:22,032
Do you not believe that child was yours?

328
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:23,992
Besides the late emperor,

329
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:25,712
I have ever had you as a man.

330
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,272
Who knew that?

331
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:28,552
Fine!

332
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:30,832
Believe it or not,

333
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,912
drip your heart's blood into the bowl,

334
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,432
- and my child will be back!
- Chen Wanyi.

335
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,472
Stop this madness.

336
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:39,432
I have no time for your antics.

337
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:41,088
Xiao Yicheng,

338
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,552
I must save my child today!

339
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,152
Whether you are willing or not,

340
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,512
this is not up to you!

341
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:54,552
What's that on your chest?

342
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:57,024
Let go!

343
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,712
This birthmark was unique
to the late emperor.

344
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:02,912
Your Majesty,

345
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:05,112
it really is you.

346
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,312
