1
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:11,472
At the tenth year of Beizhao,

2
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:14,232
(Xiao Nandu, the late emperor)
(Emperor Xiao Nandu passed away.)

3
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:16,952
(Xiao Wenjing, the new emperor)
(Xiao Wenjing ascends the throne.)

4
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:20,312
(Chen Wanyi, Empress Dowager)
(Consort Xi was ordered to trap Lu.)

5
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,232
(Consort Xi, the new emperor's consort)
(Yet Lu Zhen'er wasn't meant to die,)

6
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:26,752
(Lu Zhen'er, the late emperor's consort)
(making Consort Xi hate her.)

7
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:37,672
(I can't just do nothing.)

8
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:40,592
(Only by winning over
the new emperor Xiao Wenjing)

9
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:42,712
(can I stand a chance of survival.)

10
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,440
(Xiao Wenjing, the new emperor)

11
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:50,232
Lu Zhen'er,

12
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:51,952
when my father was alive,

13
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,992
I addressed you respectfully as Mother.

14
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:55,872
With such behavior,

15
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,632
how can you face him?

16
00:00:58,072 --> 00:01:00,192
As he passed away,

17
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,832
you rightfully

18
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:04,472
inherits everything that was his,

19
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:05,832
Including his women.

20
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,032
Isn't that so?

21
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:12,072
If Your Majesty wants to call me Mother,

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,792
I wouldn't object.

23
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:17,632
As long as Your Majesty

24
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:21,632
is willing to save me.

25
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:26,752
Get out!

26
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:28,448
I'm not waiting for you.

27
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:31,112
Send Lu Zhen'er
to the imperial mausoleum

28
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:33,192
to be buried alive with my father.

29
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:37,112
(Is my life)

30
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:39,312
(going to be restarted like this?)

31
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:55,072
=His Chosen Favor=

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,952
(What A Palace Scheme)

33
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,592
=Episode 2=
Strip her.

34
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:02,272
Drag her out of the Yonghe Palace
to let the people there witness

35
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,872
how shameless she is.

36
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:04,632
- Yes.
- Yes.

37
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:05,432
Let go of me!

38
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:06,552
Let go of me!

39
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:07,472
I'll do it myself.

40
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:24,672
Much cooler like this.

41
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,792
Consort Xi, what else
do you want to see?

42
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:29,872
You are shameless.

43
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,512
If taking off a piece of clothing

44
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:34,872
makes one shameless,

45
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,592
then humans are shameless

46
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:37,992
as we all born naked.

47
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:40,032
You survived from the imperial mausoleum

48
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,272
by stripping fast, right?

49
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:42,592
I was forced by you!

50
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,192
Stop spouting nonsense

51
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:45,432
- and blaming me!
- You wretch!

52
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,312
Drag her out!

53
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:48,032
Beat her to death!

54
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:48,992
Yes.

55
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:53,152
Who dares

56
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:55,272
shoot arrows within the Yonghe Palace?

57
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,072
I'll have him sliced to pieces!

58
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:04,512
What does Consort Xi intend to do to me?

59
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:12,832
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

60
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:15,792
Are you alright?

61
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,112
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:24,872
Look at me like that again,

63
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,672
and I'll strip you of your consort rank.

64
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:28,992
I know my fault.

65
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:31,712
Consort Lu is my woman.

66
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,552
Laying a hand on her

67
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:34,712
means laying a hand on me.

68
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:38,952
If you can't handle them,

69
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,552
hand over the empress seal.

70
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:41,912
Someone capable will take it.

71
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:43,512
I've failed in my duties.

72
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:45,032
Punish me, Your Majesty.

73
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:48,432
How do you wish to punish them?

74
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,232
How about...

75
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:55,832
Consort Xi,

76
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:57,272
do you think

77
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:59,432
if I might have someone
strip you as well?

78
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:00,352
Lu Zhen'er,

79
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:01,032
I dare you!

80
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:02,952
His Majesty is here!
Why wouldn't I dare?

81
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:05,352
We'll do as you say.

82
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,512
Your Majesty!

83
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:08,712
Consort Xi,

84
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,472
you should be begging me now.

85
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:11,512
You...

86
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,752
If you dare touch me,

87
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,232
I'll never forgive you in the future!

88
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:24,552
Don't impose

89
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:27,352
on others what you dislike.

90
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,832
Beware, fortunes change.

91
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:30,712
Retribution

92
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:33,432
might just fall upon you someday.

93
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:34,512
Fate

94
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:37,152
is hard to predict.

95
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,232
Your Majesty, let's go.

96
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,632
Consort Xi, slap yourself 30 times.

97
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,032
Yes.

98
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,632
Noble Consort Qing failed in her duties.

99
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,992
One year's salary withheld,
and three days' house arrest.

100
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,032
- Farewell, Your Majesty.
- Farewell, Your Majesty.

101
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,472
Yes. Your Majesty, thank you.

102
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:58,792
(Lu Zhen'er,)

103
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:03,112
(I'll have you sliced into pieces.)

104
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,072
Lu Zhen'er,

105
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,472
as I stand up for you,

106
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,712
doesn't it feel great?

107
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,552
The feeling of bullying with power

108
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:10,632
feels great!

109
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,552
But I think it's not worth the cost.

110
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:16,112
Now, I've become the target.

111
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,352
I've got your back.

112
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:20,992
Don't be afraid.

113
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,592
But...

114
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,672
You are used to slaving away
and keeping quiet?

115
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,912
Such powerful killing intent.

116
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:38,592
If you don't want my help,

117
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:40,312
I won't interfere anymore.

118
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,312
Of course, I do!

119
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,152
Xiao Wenjing,

120
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,672
to tell you the truth,

121
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:47,432
apart from my sister,

122
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:50,632
you're the first one
who will stand up for me.

123
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,752
I think,

124
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,672
instead of suppressing my anger,

125
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:56,392
it's better

126
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:57,952
to just go crazy.

127
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,472
So, what do you plan to do next?

128
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,792
Since Consort Xi can't be our ally,

129
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:07,992
she can only be our enemy.

130
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:08,912
I'll fight her

131
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:09,832
if she wants to fight.

132
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:13,192
She has Empress Dowager Chen,
but I have you.

133
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:14,152
From now on,

134
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:16,232
Consort Xi will surely lose.

135
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:17,432
Then I'll

136
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,912
be waiting to celebrate your victory.

137
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:25,232
(Lu Zhen'er,)

138
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,672
(I trusted you so much back then,)

139
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,312
(yet you slit my throat,)

140
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:33,872
(poisoned me)

141
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:38,512
(and killed me lifetime after lifetime.)

142
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,792
(This time, what you owe me,)

143
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,072
(I'll make you pay back a hundredfold.)

144
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:48,096
(Beizhao Imperial Mausoleum)

145
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,472
(Xiao Nandu, the late emperor)

146
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:10,832
Who are you?

147
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:14,432
Yicheng,

148
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,992
don't you even recognize me?

149
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,512
Father?

150
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:21,232
But you already...

151
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:24,432
I've returned from death.

152
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:26,352
Aren't you happy?

153
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:30,792
Of course, I'm happy!

154
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,992
- But...
- But you can't understand

155
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:35,832
why I can return from death
and become younger

156
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:37,792
and why I

157
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,312
would suddenly come to you.

158
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:43,232
With your wisdom,

159
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,112
you've guessed my mind.

160
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,632
I came to you

161
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,952
for your face.

162
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,072
Yicheng, your face

163
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,552
is identical to mine in youth.

164
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:02,792
Blame the people

165
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,592
for seeing the art of immortality
as sorcery.

166
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,472
I can only use your identity

167
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:10,152
to reclaim the throne
that is rightfully mine.

168
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,832
To die for me

169
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:14,272
is a worthy death for you.

170
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:18,072
Go in peace.

171
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,312
I'm back.

172
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:27,232
Yindan,

173
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:28,512
take any of my stuff

174
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:30,392
you fancy and put it on.

175
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:33,552
Your Highness, I cannot accept these.

176
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:35,152
Why not?

177
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:36,712
From now on, what's mine is yours,

178
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,512
and what's yours remains yours.

179
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:39,672
Don't be polite with me.

180
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:40,552
Sit.

181
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,312
Thank you.

182
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:47,712
One more gold bracelet to go!

183
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,152
Thanks, Your Highness.

184
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,072
Here you go again.

185
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:56,512
I told you

186
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:57,792
in private,

187
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:58,952
you are not my maid.

188
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,072
Just call me sister.

189
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:04,832
Her Majesty is here.

190
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,712
Greetings, Your Majesty.

191
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:11,552
Consort Xi.

192
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,232
Lu Zhen'er, I never expected
you to be so tenacious,

193
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:15,632
managing to survive until now.

194
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:16,872
It's all been luck.

195
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:20,392
When the late emperor lived,
you were full of deep affection

196
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,312
and skillfully charmed him.

197
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,512
Since he passed away,

198
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,552
you immediately shared
His Majesty's bed.

199
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,672
How can you face the late emperor?

200
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,632
Your Majesty,

201
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:32,032
I yearned to join
the late emperor in death.

202
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,552
But His Majesty wouldn't permit it.

203
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:35,912
Are you flaunting before me

204
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:38,152
how favored you are?

205
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:39,352
That wasn't my intention!

206
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,352
Aunt,

207
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,592
why waste words on her?

208
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,112
Don't go easy

209
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,072
on a woman like her.

210
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:48,432
She'll just get close to
those men again,

211
00:09:48,432 --> 00:09:49,552
flaunt herself,

212
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:50,672
and get them

213
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,832
to make our lives miserable.

214
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,792
Punishment is all she deserves.

215
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,632
You're right.

216
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,272
I'm too soft-hearted.

217
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,512
Xi is the clever one.

218
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:01,552
Do it.

219
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,832
What are you doing?! Let me go!

220
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:06,872
Your Highness,

221
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,632
if Consort Lu has done wrong,

222
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,152
you may petition His Majesty

223
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,472
to let him decide.

224
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:13,592
I am concerned that resorting

225
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,432
to private punishment in the harem

226
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:16,752
might violate the palace rules.

227
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:17,752
What are you doing?

228
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,272
- You lowly maid!
- Yindan!

229
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:20,552
What are you doing?

230
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,432
You dare interfere with me?

231
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:23,632
I dare not.

232
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:25,792
But His Majesty holds
Consort Lu in great favor.

233
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,512
I fear His Majesty might blame
you for this.

234
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,232
Are you implying

235
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,312
that in His Majesty's heart,

236
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,192
Lu Zhen'er is more important than I am?

237
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:36,912
That's not what I meant!

238
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:41,072
Yindan!

239
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:41,872
Consort Xi!

240
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,072
Let Yindan go!

241
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,672
Let her go!

242
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:46,112
What are you doing?

243
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,232
Let her go!

244
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:50,512
- Let her go!
- I'm disciplining a lowly maid.

245
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:52,352
When do you get to tell me what to do?

246
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,272
Don't bully my people!

247
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:55,592
Come at me!

248
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:57,632
Lu Zhen'er,

249
00:10:57,632 --> 00:11:00,392
- you seem very attached to her.
- Let her go!

250
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,432
Fine. I can let her go.

251
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:04,632
Beg me.

252
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,272
I'm begging you.

253
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:11,472
Please let her go.

254
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:20,952
Yindan!

255
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,072
Consort Xi, let her go!

256
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:23,832
Let her go!

257
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,752
I seduced His Majesty!

258
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:29,152
Take it out on me!

259
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:29,752
Let her go!

260
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,072
She knows nothing!

261
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:32,872
Take it out on me!

262
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,432
Let her go!

263
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:35,952
I'm begging you!

264
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,952
I'm begging you!

265
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,872
Want her to live?

266
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:46,352
Fine.

267
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:48,472
Let's see how far you'll take this.

268
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:54,952
Let her go!

269
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:01,352
(Now I have a sister again.)

270
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,712
(In this life, I'll protect you.)

271
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,432
Lu Zhen'er,

272
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:08,272
I promise you this.

273
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:11,032
If you pierce all your fingers...

274
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:11,832
No!

275
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,232
I'll let her leave.

276
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:20,992
Wishing tree,

277
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:23,472
please bless me and Lu Zhen'er

278
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:24,832
for being together forever.

279
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:29,192
(Now I have a sister again.)

280
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:31,632
(In this life, I'll protect you.)

281
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,072
No, Your Highness.

282
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:47,112
Please don't.

283
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:49,512
Sister,

284
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:51,992
this time,

285
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:55,152
I will protect you.

286
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:57,272
How beautiful!

287
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:00,392
Your Highness.

288
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:03,392
No!

289
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:12,712
Your Highness.

290
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:16,952
Now,

291
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:20,912
can she go?

292
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,592
Aren't you afraid His Majesty

293
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:27,272
will kill you?

294
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,352
I'm afraid

295
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,152
you won't live
to see His Majesty arrive.

296
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:46,312
Your Highness!

297
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:48,392
Sister!

298
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,992
Prince Rui is here.

299
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:53,832
Your Highness.

300
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:01,192
Your Highness.

301
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:07,592
Aunt,

302
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:08,592
what's wrong with you?

303
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:10,712
It's His Majesty.

304
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:12,952
Aunt,

305
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,312
this is Prince Rui,

306
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,632
not His Majesty.

307
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:17,632
He's been guarding
the frontier for ten years

308
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:18,832
since his mother passed away.

309
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:20,672
Greetings, Your Majesty.

310
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:26,032
Are you

311
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,672
Prince Rui?

312
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:30,192
Yes. What's wrong?

313
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:35,112
You look exactly
like His Majesty in his youth.

314
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:36,872
Your Highness,

315
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,112
I'm not His Majesty.

316
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,112
Aunt, are you alright?

317
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,672
What brings you here today?

318
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,672
I returned from the frontier

319
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:47,872
and happened to pass by here.

320
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:49,912
Hearing Your Majesty is here,

321
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,192
I came to pay my respects.

322
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:52,432
Is that so?

323
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:53,072
Yes.

324
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:55,952
This is...

325
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:58,352
Disciplining an unruly consort.

326
00:14:58,352 --> 00:14:59,752
No need to concern.

327
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:01,592
Save me!

328
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:04,992
- Save me!
- Put away your hands!

329
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,712
His Highness is born in the purple.

330
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:09,152
How dare you lay hands on him!

331
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:11,592
Consort Xi,

332
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,712
I heard private punishment
is forbidden in harem.

333
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:17,512
How dare you treat a consort

334
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:18,512
like this!

335
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,192
What did you say?

336
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:22,752
(Even his speaking manner)

337
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:24,592
(Is identical to the late emperor's.)

338
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:39,424
- Your Highness, what are you doing?
- His Majesty is here!

339
00:15:39,424 --> 00:15:40,472
Xiao Yicheng,

340
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,472
