1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,064
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,464
(Give me a foothold,
and I could move the entire harem)

3
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,904
=Episode 3=

4
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,148
Prince Rui, halt!

5
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:31,348
Xiao Yicheng,

6
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:33,348
why are you holding my consort?

7
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:36,748
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:40,228
You returned from the frontier.

9
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:41,948
Instead of reporting to me,

10
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:43,668
you held my consort.

11
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,668
How utterly improper!

12
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:46,628
Your consort?

13
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,988
I recall she was
the late emperor's consort.

14
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:51,108
Father is long dead.

15
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,268
You're truly audacious!

16
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,268
As the emperor,

17
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:57,028
I act as I see fit!

18
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,468
What do you think you are?

19
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:00,708
Daring to lecture me!

20
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:05,548
(My son is lecturing me!)

21
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:10,348
Enough!

22
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,108
Stop arguing!

23
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:13,388
Put me down!

24
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:19,948
My apologies.

25
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:20,708
I'm late.

26
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,468
Not late.

27
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:23,628
Nice of you to come.

28
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,548
You're hurt. What do you want to do?

29
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,268
I'm going to teach

30
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,748
the one who deserves a lesson.

31
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,628
Consort Xi, apologies.

32
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:42,548
I was waiting for His Majesty to come.

33
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,096
What do you want to do?

34
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:44,908
What do I want?

35
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,028
Of course

36
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,308
to abuse the power and bully you.

37
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:52,428
I dare you!

38
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:53,668
Right now!

39
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,424
Kneel and apologize to me!

40
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:56,148
Outrageous!

41
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,868
Your Majesty,

42
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:02,788
she just used private punishment

43
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,992
and forced me prick my hands
with silver needles.

44
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:06,976
My hands are almost ruined!

45
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,188
Look!

46
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:10,788
Your Majesty, I was only just...

47
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:13,668
You've suffered.

48
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:18,432
Your Majesty, avenge me!

49
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,448
And Yindan!

50
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,108
She protected me

51
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:24,320
and was nearly tortured to death.

52
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,188
Your Majesty,

53
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,748
Lu Zhen'er was disrespectful to my aunt.

54
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:31,028
- I just tried to warn her.
- You lie!

55
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,228
Would I invite you to torture me?

56
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:36,228
The consorts were just
fighting over favor.

57
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,348
Xiao Wenjing,

58
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,668
take Lu Zhen'er and her maid back

59
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:41,508
and this matter is over.

60
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,168
Zhen'er may do

61
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:44,148
as she pleases.

62
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,348
Xiao Wenjing.

63
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:48,628
Let it go.

64
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:52,588
Come.

65
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,028
Are you alright?

66
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:03,628
(So many old scars.)

67
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:11,988
Guards!

68
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,588
Guards, quickly!

69
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,032
Lu Zhen'er!

70
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:18,828
Save me, Aunt!

71
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,548
Guards!

72
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:22,628
Aunt!

73
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:23,628
Stop!

74
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:28,748
I also have a powerful backing!

75
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:30,528
As Her Majesty said,

76
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,736
it was just fighting for favor.

77
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:34,388
Can't be considered audacious.

78
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:37,388
Yindan,

79
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:38,868
let's go.

80
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:40,388
Go!

81
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,640
Place your hands on my shoulders

82
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,144
and it hurts less now?

83
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,388
Give me a foothold,

84
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:07,068
and I could move the entire harem.

85
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:14,428
Consort Xi knew I would be inspecting
the military camp today,

86
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,388
so she seized the chance
to act against you.

87
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:18,912
That isn't your fault.

88
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,428
You can't be by my side day and night.

89
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,028
Blame myself.

90
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:24,828
I have no power

91
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,108
or influence,

92
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,588
so I'm at the mercy of others.

93
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:31,788
What should we do?

94
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,908
Get me a Bodhisattva statue.

95
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:40,628
What?

96
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,592
My luck has been terrible lately.

97
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,788
I desperately need to pray.

98
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:46,908
Will that help?

99
00:04:46,908 --> 00:04:47,840
Of course!

100
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
When all else fails,

101
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:50,592
trust in metaphysics!

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,016
Go to Chenghua Temple.

103
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,788
Go to Chenghua Temple.

104
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,308
Its Bodhisattva is very efficacious.

105
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,432
Really?

106
00:04:58,628 --> 00:04:59,908
Then I'll go tomorrow.

107
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,508
Your Majesty!

108
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:15,616
Your Majesty!

109
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,272
Lu Zhen'er has gone too far!

110
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:20,988
Look what she's done to me.

111
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:24,148
You weren't ruthless enough,

112
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:25,668
so you couldn't defeat her.

113
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,908
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,588
you shielded her at every turn,

115
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:31,148
so I have ended up like this.

116
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:32,480
When have I ever shielded her?

117
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:34,028
Earlier at Yonghe Palace,

118
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,668
and again today in her palace,

119
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,268
you always shielded her.

120
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:38,828
I've never shielded her.

121
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,428
You're soft-hearted

122
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:42,108
and let her escape every time.

123
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:45,028
Then,

124
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:47,388
what should I do?

125
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:53,228
She's going to Chenghua Temple tomorrow.

126
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:55,708
I want her to never see

127
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,228
the sun the day after tomorrow.

128
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,628
Yindan, what are they doing?

129
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:06,588
Your Highness,

130
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:08,384
they probably found out in advance

131
00:06:08,384 --> 00:06:09,708
that His Majesty would pass by,

132
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,264
so they're dancing here,

133
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:12,508
waiting for His Majesty.

134
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,188
If they can gain His Majesty's favor,

135
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:15,948
they can rise up.

136
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,988
Seems the people under Consort Xi

137
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,348
aren't all that loyal after all.

138
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:21,788
Let's go.

139
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,108
Bodhisattva,

140
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:30,624
I ask not for a shred of true love,

141
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:33,308
only for great wealth, honor,
peace and safety.

142
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:38,720
And bless my sister

143
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:41,828
to be happy every day,

144
00:06:42,508 --> 00:06:44,064
safe and free from worry.

145
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,792
Why did you stop?

146
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,708
Zisu,

147
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,188
you were dancing happily
in the imperial garden.

148
00:06:58,188 --> 00:06:59,988
Why aren't you dancing now?

149
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:03,360
Your Highness,
the snow is falling heavily.

150
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,388
Perhaps you should return to the palace.

151
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,308
Or it may harm your health.

152
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:10,368
No rush. The person I'm waiting for

153
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:11,988
hasn't arrived yet.

154
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:12,788
Yes.

155
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,468
Sis, the snow is really heavy today.

156
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:17,628
Your Highness.

157
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:21,788
Guards!

158
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,268
Summon Consort Lu.

159
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:26,068
- Yes.
- Yes.

160
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:27,488
Go to His Majesty.

161
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,448
Get him to save me!

162
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:29,268
Okay.

163
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:31,808
Let go of me!

164
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,112
L-Let go of me!

165
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,748
Who is this?

166
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:38,628
Let me have a good look.

167
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,832
Oh, His Majesty's
most beloved Consort Lu.

168
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:47,468
Why are you in such a sorry state today?

169
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,928
Your Highness,

170
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:50,148
aren't you afraid

171
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,708
His Majesty will be furious?

172
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:57,908
Do you think gaining His Majesty's favor

173
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:00,028
means you can challenge me?

174
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:03,228
Don't know the rules, huh?

175
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:05,792
Today, I'll teach you

176
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:07,468
what rules mean.

177
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:08,508
Kneel!

178
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:09,468
What are you doing?

179
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:10,548
Let go of me!

180
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:11,828
If you kill me,

181
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:13,068
His Majesty won't forgive you.

182
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,468
Seems she is out of her mind.

183
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,736
Guards.

184
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,104
Help her clear her mind.

185
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:27,456
You all saw it.

186
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:30,028
She plunged into the vat herself.

187
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:32,512
I had nothing to do with it.

188
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,188
Your eyes

189
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,048
are indeed very beautiful.

190
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,376
But I simply can't stand
beautiful things.

191
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:48,028
Yanyu,

192
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,348
dig out her eyes

193
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:51,468
and feed them to the dogs.

194
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:52,864
Yes.

195
00:08:59,188 --> 00:08:59,988
Get off!

196
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,472
What are you doing?

197
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:02,816
Release Her Highness.

198
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:05,228
So you fear too?

199
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:06,188
Lu Zhen'er!

200
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:08,628
If you dare lay a finger on me,

201
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,144
my aunt will have your skin flayed!

202
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:11,552
I can flay your skin right now.

203
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:14,268
Make an incision here

204
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:15,508
and pour mercury in.

205
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,752
Then I'll get a complete human skin.

206
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:20,736
Your Highness,

207
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:22,148
would you like to give it a try?

208
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,988
Y-You wouldn't dare!

209
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,568
You even dared to dig out my eyes.

210
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:26,868
What wouldn't I dare?

211
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:29,308
Lu Zhen'er, calm down.

212
00:09:29,308 --> 00:09:31,148
I was just trying to scare you.

213
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,268
I can give you whatever you want.

214
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,072
Don't kill me.

215
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:44,908
In the dead of winter,

216
00:09:44,908 --> 00:09:47,680
why are they dancing by the palace path?

217
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:50,668
Maybe a consort

218
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,268
hearing that His Majesty would pass by,

219
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:54,188
so she deliberately waited here,

220
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:55,188
trying to win some favor.

221
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:55,708
Let's go

222
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,248
take a look.

223
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:58,028
Go.

224
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,108
Which palace are they from?

225
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,508
This isn't about winning favor.

226
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,668
Clearly, they've offended that one.

227
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:17,668
You mean

228
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:18,752
Consort Xi?

229
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:19,392
Stop.

230
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:21,268
Asking for death?

231
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:25,948
Do you think

232
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:28,428
this drum looks strange?

233
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:31,360
It's Consort Xi!

234
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:32,992
Consort Xi.

235
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:34,976
Consort Xi.

236
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:36,800
Consort Xi.

237
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:49,988
You're awake.

238
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,348
What happened to me?

239
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,688
Yindan asked me to save you.

240
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:55,788
When I rushed over,

241
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,028
I saw you passed out
in the imperial garden.

242
00:10:58,028 --> 00:10:59,232
What exactly happened?

243
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:05,504
You were beaten.

244
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:07,776
Consort Xi again.

245
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,912
Her Majesty is here.

246
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,388
You wretch!

247
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:23,948
You actually killed Xi'er.

248
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:28,256
So you did kill her.

249
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:32,708
I didn't kill anyone.

250
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,868
How dare you argue!

251
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:36,108
Jingxi, slap her mouth
until it's broken!

252
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:39,828
Wait!

253
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,388
Listen to me.

254
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:43,264
I swear I did not kill Consort Xi.

255
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:44,268
Don't wrong me.

256
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,472
Mother,

257
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,028
don't pin such a charge casually!

258
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:49,588
Any evidence?

259
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:51,748
You want evidence?

260
00:11:51,748 --> 00:11:53,344
Then I'll show you.

261
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,588
So that you won't say I wronged her.

262
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:58,908
Consort Lu, if you didn't kill Xi'er,

263
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,748
why was your gold hairpin

264
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,464
found on her body?

265
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:06,208
Your Majesty,

266
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:09,188
I did see her yesterday.

267
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,108
But

268
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,704
she called me over to beat me.

269
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,068
I swear I didn't kill her.

270
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,200
If you wrong me,

271
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,028
the murderer will escape justice.

272
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:18,348
So,

273
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:19,748
give me one day.

274
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:20,908
I can prove my innocence.

275
00:12:20,988 --> 00:12:22,468
What if you can't?

276
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:25,428
I'll personally slice her 3,000 times

277
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:27,788
to give you justice.

278
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:28,868
It's all your fault.

279
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:30,988
If you hadn't shielded her,

280
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,428
Xi'er wouldn't have died.

281
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:33,788
She's dead, so what?

282
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,308
She killed so many people.

283
00:12:35,308 --> 00:12:37,628
Now it's just retribution.

284
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:38,468
Insolent!

285
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,188
Lu Zhen'er must die today.

286
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:48,256
Guards!

287
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:48,768
Yes.

288
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,468
Xiao Wenjing,

289
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,468
help me. I didn't kill anyone.

290
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:54,272
I have to take care of my sister.

291
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:55,584
I finally found her.

292
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:58,148
I can't die for no reason.

293
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,828
Xiao Wenjing, I didn't kill anyone.

294
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:04,192
Halt!

295
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:07,968
(Lu Zhen'er,)

296
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,428
(I do want to kill you,)

297
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:10,828
(but not today.)

298
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:13,908
Mother,

299
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,468
you can't kill her today.

300
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,628
What if I insist?

301
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:31,268
I said no,

302
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,788
so you can't.

303
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:34,948
Xiao Wenjing,

304
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,468
are you defying me to the bitter end?

305
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,628
If you wish to protect her,

306
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:42,868
there will be a price.
