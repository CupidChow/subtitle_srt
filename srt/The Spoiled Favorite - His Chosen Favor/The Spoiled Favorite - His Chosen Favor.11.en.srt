00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:24,276
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:27,220
(I'll Take Someone Down With Me)

3
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,464
=Episode 11=
(The palace abounds with rumors.)

4
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,664
(Qiansichan has everyone on edge.)

5
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,864
(Both the Emperor and Empress Dowager
have fallen ill.)

6
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:37,064
(Lu Zhen'er became the only lifeline.)

7
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,344
I told you to lie down.

8
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:42,464
Why lie on the ground?

9
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:43,464
Get up.

10
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:44,704
Do you know you're dying?

11
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,224
Consort Lu,

12
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:48,664
receive the decree.

13
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:51,264
What is this?

14
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:58,024
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor commands.

15
00:00:58,704 --> 00:00:59,704
Wow, ancient style prose.

16
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:00,744
Upon my death,

17
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:02,384
I decree you the honor of shared burial.

18
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:04,184
You may be entombed
by the Zhao Mausoleum

19
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:06,864
to uphold our lifelong bond

20
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:08,224
and eternalize our marital ties.

21
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:09,864
Shared burial?

22
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:12,064
By the Zhao Mausoleum?

23
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:14,104
What is this?

24
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,304
You want me to die too?

25
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,064
If I'm dead,

26
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:19,624
what good are you alive?

27
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:21,544
Xiao Wenjing,

28
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:22,744
do you hear yourself?

29
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,664
If you don't want to be buried with me,

30
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,264
find a way to cure me.

31
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,464
Then neither of us has to die.

32
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,744
Wouldn't that please everyone?

33
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,704
Believe it or not, I'll kill you again.

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,064
Why stop here?

35
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:40,784
Can't bear to lose me?

36
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:42,664
You punk.

37
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:44,824
You're afraid I can't cure you,

38
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:47,144
so you want me entombed with you.

39
00:01:47,144 --> 00:01:48,304
How can you be so shameless?

40
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:51,224
When facing death, dignity is optional.

41
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,384
But if we're buried together,

42
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,024
dying would be acceptable.

43
00:01:59,264 --> 00:01:59,864
Fine.

44
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:04,144
So you just want me to cure you?

45
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:05,384
I'll make it.

46
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:06,104
Just you wait.

47
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:08,584
Then I entrust my life

48
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,424
to you, Consort Lu.

49
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,144
Do your best, please.

50
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:16,704
Or don't,

51
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,264
so we'll keep each other company
in the underworld.

52
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:22,104
I won't let you die!

53
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,184
Angry?

54
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:28,784
Not

55
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:29,384
at all.

56
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:33,784
Then decoct the medicine.

57
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,064
I want to recover soon.

58
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,424
Don't spit in my medicine.

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,744
I'm not as disgusting

60
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,744
as you are.

61
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,264
I know.

62
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,664
You're the beautiful,
kind-hearted Consort Lu.

63
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:50,544
Let go!

64
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,424
(Think you can)

65
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,424
(lord it over me
just because you're sick?)

66
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:02,184
What are you doing?

67
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:28,944
Is your prescription correct?

68
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,984
Of course.

69
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:33,584
We're practically

70
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:35,024
in this together now.

71
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,984
The whole world wants you dead,

72
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,624
but I want you alive.

73
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,344
The prescription certainly is correct.

74
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,704
Drink the first bowl.

75
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:45,264
Why?

76
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:47,464
You may have poisoned it.

77
00:03:47,464 --> 00:03:47,984
Take it.

78
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:49,544
Drink it or don't.

79
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:50,344
Die all you want.

80
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:52,144
Fine.

81
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:54,024
Then I'll die.

82
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:56,264
Seriously?

83
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:58,824
Test it for poison

84
00:03:58,824 --> 00:03:59,344
or

85
00:03:59,344 --> 00:03:59,824
I won't

86
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,304
drink it.

87
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:08,224
(This punk is really impossible.)

88
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:16,264
Come on, just drink it.

89
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:18,864
If you don't,

90
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,304
you won't recover.

91
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:21,904
Do you really want to die?

92
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,584
I don't care.

93
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,504
What do you mean?

94
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,344
Your life doesn't matter,

95
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:28,704
but I'm just supposed to die?

96
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:30,024
I...

97
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:39,504
What are you doing?

98
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:04,736
♪Spring comes late after the snow♪

99
00:05:04,736 --> 00:05:08,794
♪Having endured sorrow and joy♪

00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,762
♪Wandering the streets,

101
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,024
What was that for?

102
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:16,864
So bitter!

103
00:05:18,424 --> 00:05:19,776
As expected with all the coptis!

104
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:22,584
What do you think?

105
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:23,464
I'm feeding you.

106
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:25,584
Your life doesn't matter,

107
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:26,744
but I must survive.

108
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:28,704
You may get sick.

109
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,264
I took preventive medicine.

110
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:32,984
It's fine.

111
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:34,904
Besides, if you die,

112
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:35,904
I'll be doomed for sure.

113
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,344
If you ever

114
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,864
refuse to take medicine again,

115
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,304
I'll feed you like this

116
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:45,664
and make sure you take it.

117
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:49,144
Truly a bewitching consort!

118
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:49,944
Shameless.

119
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,584
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

120
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,024
If you had taken the medicine,

121
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:55,304
I'd not have resorted to this.

122
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:58,344
If you hadn't tampered with it,

123
00:05:58,344 --> 00:05:59,144
I'd have drunk it.

124
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:05,934
♪Will I kiss your face♪

125
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,544
The physicians
have examined her recently,

126
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,424
but Her Majesty hasn't got better.

127
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,944
Get out! I don't need you!

128
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:28,544
Your Highness!

129
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:30,144
Your Highness.

130
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,984
The late emperor tasked you
with curing the poisoned.

131
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,264
Don't abandon Her Majesty.

132
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,624
Or how will you answer
to the late emperor?

133
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,384
Even the people of Beizhao

134
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,784
will condemn you
for refusing to save a life.

135
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,704
Get out! I don't want you.

136
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,864
Your Majesty, you need help!

137
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:56,664
His Majesty blamed me.

138
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,464
I'd rather die to accompany him.

139
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,304
This isn't Qiansichan.

140
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:05,344
Then what is it?

141
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:08,424
Her pulse is strange.

142
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:11,864
You don't know any medicine at all.

143
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,104
What could you diagnose?

144
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,224
How has her appetite been lately?

145
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,944
Any dizziness? Vomiting?

146
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,704
She has poor appetite recently,

147
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:20,784
barely eating anything.

148
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,504
Occasional dizziness and coughing,
but not frequent,

149
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:24,064
with phlegm.

150
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:29,584
Lu Zhen'er, how dare you!

151
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,424
Stagnant qi and blood,
excessive phlegm and accumulated toxins.

152
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,024
In that case,

153
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:37,544
I can only alleviate symptoms.

154
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:40,024
You should

155
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,264
take her to a major hospital.

156
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:43,184
W-What?

157
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,104
(That slipped out.)

158
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:48,264
I'm not skilled enough to save her.

159
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:49,784
Turn to someone else.

160
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:54,184
(I swore oaths of impartial compassion,
and benevolence above all,)

161
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:55,544
(but it clearly requires)

162
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,744
(modern medical equipment)

163
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,104
(to find out what's wrong with her.)

164
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,264
(There's nothing I can do.)

165
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:05,104
Your Highness!

166
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:05,984
Matron Wang,

167
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,464
don't beg her. Come back.

168
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:12,024
Even in death,

169
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,944
I'll never spare Lu Zhen'er.

170
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,664
You intend to...

171
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,464
Come here.

172
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:42,424
What are you doing?

173
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:43,504
Trying to poison the well?

174
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:45,024
No! Let me go!

175
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,744
- It's you!
- It's you!

176
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:47,664
Guards!

177
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:49,464
Someone's poisoning the well!

178
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:50,744
Not me!

179
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:51,904
Consort Lu told me to do it!

180
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:52,744
Not my doing!

181
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,584
Go see Her Majesty with me! Move!

182
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:55,744
Consort Lu! Save me!

183
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,464
You called for me, Your Majesty?

184
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:09,584
Such a grand display.

185
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:12,784
Lu Zhen'er, you poisoned me.

186
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,384
You must be punished.

187
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,384
What?

188
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,864
You sent him, right?

189
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:22,104
I don't know him.

190
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:25,424
But he knows you,

191
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:27,744
and identified you as the mastermind.

192
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,624
(Another clichéd framing trick now.)

193
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,704
Your Majesty,

194
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,864
you've recovered enough

195
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,104
to mess with me again?

196
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:36,864
How insolent!

197
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:38,704
Don't talk to me like that.

198
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:41,104
I never ordered anyone to poison you.

199
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,184
Your Majesty,

200
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:44,224
make your lies plausible.

201
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,744
Why would I try to cure you

202
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:46,904
while poisoning you?

203
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:47,904
What gain is there?

204
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,144
More work for myself?

205
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,064
Or to be more tired?

206
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:53,144
You're seeking to be a savior.

207
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:55,624
As long as Qiansichan
remains in this harem,

208
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,024
no one will call you a demon.

209
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,384
Some might even worship you
like a living goddess.

210
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,264
So you don't want it eliminated.

211
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:03,584
But Lu Zhen'er,

212
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,064
for your own skin,

213
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,544
you've disregarded those in the harem.

214
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,704
How vicious you are!

215
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:10,784
Consort Lu,

216
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,024
we've served you with utmost devotion.

217
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:14,464
How could you treat us like this?

218
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:15,584
Don't our lives

219
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:16,624
matter at all?

220
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:17,824
Exactly!

221
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:18,984
Consort Lu,

222
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:20,744
can't believe you're so cruel.

223
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:21,784
I actually thought

224
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:24,104
you were like an angel
saving us from peril!

225
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:25,024
I didn't do it.

226
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:27,504
I would never do such a thing.

227
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,104
Who put you up to this?

228
00:10:31,984 --> 00:10:32,904
The Empress Dowager?

229
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:34,944
Tell us!

230
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:47,424
How dare you, Lu Zhen'er!

231
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:49,904
You killed the witness

232
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:50,984
right before my eyes.

233
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,704
If you wish me dead,

234
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:53,944
just do it directly.

235
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,504
What's the point of these schemes?

236
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:57,384
Resign yourself, Lu Zhen'er.

237
00:10:59,304 --> 00:10:59,944
Everyone.

238
00:11:02,184 --> 00:11:05,544
Qiansichan is not divine retribution.

239
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:06,664
Someone spread it.

240
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:08,984
Who is it?

241
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,744
The real poisoner...

242
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:18,544
Is Your Majesty.

243
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:20,904
Facing death,

244
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:22,904
you still try to throw mud on me.

245
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,184
No rush. I have proof.

246
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:30,984
Jingxi?

247
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:33,584
Jingxi,

248
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,464
with everyone here today,

249
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,744
tell us clearly

250
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:39,264
how Qiansichan

251
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,464
came to the Wanchun Hall.

252
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:44,504
Her Majesty

253
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,344
poisoned the Wanchun Hall's well

254
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,504
to create bad omens

255
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:50,024
to frame Consort Lu
as a demon ruining the nation.

256
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:51,024
Nonsense!

257
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,344
You traitorous wretch!

258
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:55,024
Whether it's nonsense or fact,

259
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:57,104
Your Majesty knows perfectly well.

260
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,704
If Your Majesty didn't order
the poisoning,

261
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:02,864
why did the poison incident begin
at the Wanchun Hall?

262
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:03,944
Just coincidence?

263
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:05,584
It is.

264
00:12:06,064 --> 00:12:07,144
Right.

265
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,784
As Your Majesty says it's coincidence,

266
00:12:08,784 --> 00:12:09,864
no one dares to deny it.

267
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:12,544
What a sharp tongue you have!

268
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,744
You can twist anything in your favor.

269
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,024
Even if you have a sharp tongue,

270
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,304
you're going to die today.

271
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,864
Not just you.

272
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:21,904
Everyone here today

273
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:22,984
must die!

274
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:29,624
Your Majesty!

275
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,984
Spare us, Your Majesty!

276
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,824
We'll never tell anyone!

277
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,584
We beg for mercy.

278
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,904
- Show mercy.
- Mercy!

279
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:39,104
Only the dead keep secrets.

280
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:40,984
Blame Lu Zhen'er if you must.

281
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:42,144
If not for her,

282
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:44,264
you wouldn't need to die today.

283
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:46,904
Now you drop the act?

284
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:49,184
To cover up your crime,

285
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:50,904
you'll silence everyone?

286
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,664
My greatest sin

287
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,424
is not killing you sooner!

288
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:55,664
Guards.

289
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,464
Seize Lu Zhen'er.

290
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:58,344
- Yes!
- Yes!

291
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:12,984
How dare you!

292
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,424
I told you to seize Lu Zhen'er,

293
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:15,664
not me!

294
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,824
So you are the poisoner.

295
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:23,944
How vicious!

296
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,064
You planned this!

297
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:27,344
Qiansichan's impact was severe.

298
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,864
Neither His Majesty nor I believed
it was coincidence.

299
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:32,104
So we had to find the poisoner.

300
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:33,504
Witch!

301
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,584
You schemed against me with Lu Zhen'er.

302
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:44,144
I wished to restore peace to the harem.

303
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:45,424
I never poisoned anyone!

304
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,264
But even if I did,

305
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,584
what could you do about it?

306
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,464
You're unwell.

307
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,704
Seems you must retire
to the Changle Temple.

308
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:54,624
Outrageous!

309
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:56,504
You dare curse me?

310
00:13:56,864 --> 00:13:59,344
I'll never go to the Changle Temple.

311
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:01,344
Don't even think about driving me away.

312
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:04,984
Your Majesty.

313
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,464
What's wrong?

314
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:08,744
Don't touch me!

315
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:15,264
Summon the physician!

316
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,424
(My period hasn't come this month.)

317
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:26,304
(Lately, I can't eat and feel nauseous.)

318
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:27,184
(Could it be...)

319
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:31,424
