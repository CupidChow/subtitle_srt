1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,776
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,976
(The nest of tenderness,
not the path of thorns, will trap us)

3
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:29,856
=Episode 18=

4
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,048
Yindan.

5
00:00:33,048 --> 00:00:34,448
Your Highness, you're awake.

6
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,488
Fu An, where's Yindan?

7
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,408
I don't know. Please save His Majesty!

8
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,008
His Majesty might be in grave danger.

9
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,328
Where is His Majesty?

10
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:45,088
He went to Zhongcui Mountain
to save you.

11
00:00:46,288 --> 00:00:47,488
Zhongcui Mountain?

12
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:48,208
Yes.

13
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:50,248
How long has he been gone?

14
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:51,248
Two hours.

15
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:54,968
Fu An, prepare a boat for me.

16
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:55,808
Yes.

17
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,144
Xiao Wenjing.

18
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,608
Where are you, Xiao Wenjing?

19
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,328
Xiao Wenjing!

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,808
Xiao Wenjing!

21
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,408
How are you, Xiao Wenjing?

22
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:47,408
Xiao Wenjing!

23
00:01:58,488 --> 00:01:59,688
Your poison was cured?

24
00:02:01,568 --> 00:02:03,208
I don't know what happened.

25
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,448
Soon after you left the palace,

26
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:06,048
my poison cured.

27
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,168
(Before leaving the palace,)

28
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:09,824
(Yindan gave Zhen'er the antidote).

29
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:12,968
(She just tricked me
into taking the poison).

30
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:14,648
Well.

31
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:15,648
Take a rest.

32
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:16,688
I'll find the antidote.

33
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,128
Don't take him away!

34
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,088
Consort Xi!

35
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,008
Put him down

36
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,248
and I'll let you go.

37
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,888
Whether you are human or ghost,

38
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,128
Xiao Wenjing did not kill you.

39
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:33,608
Why seeking revenge on him?

40
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,808
I'm letting you go.

41
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:36,088
Don't kill the wrong target.

42
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,208
If I kill him,

43
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,688
you can marry Prince Rui

44
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:43,008
and leave the palace with Yindan.

45
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:44,448
Why are you helping him?

46
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:45,488
What did you say?

47
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:49,888
This

48
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:52,008
is the bracelet I gave Yindan.

49
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:54,728
Yindan?

50
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:55,568
Don't call me that.

51
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm not Yindan!

52
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,248
Yindan,

53
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,048
why do you want to kill him?

54
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,648
I said I'm not Yindan!

55
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,088
Fine, you're not Yindan.

56
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,128
You are Consort Xi.

57
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,088
But why do you want to kill him?

58
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,288
Naturally,

59
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:11,288
blood must be paid with blood.

60
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,888
She said the late emperor caused
her parents' wrongful deaths.

61
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:17,048
She infiltrated the palace

62
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:18,728
to seek revenge on me.

63
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:19,648
What?

64
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,248
I don't want to be your enemy.

65
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:21,968
Yindan,

66
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,608
Xiao Wenjing didn't kill your parents.

67
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,048
I vouch for it with my honor.

68
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:27,328
There must be misunderstanding.

69
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,128
I heard it with my own ears.

70
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,928
The murderer said it himself

71
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:35,968
the late emperor ordered him
to eliminate us.

72
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,568
Xiao Wenjing,

73
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,408
did you know it or not?

74
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:44,768
No.

75
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,608
I had no knowledge of it.

76
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,008
Of course you wouldn't know me.

77
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,928
My parents and I

78
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,168
were nothing but ants to you,

79
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,808
so you don't know us.

80
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:54,608
Yindan.

81
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:56,168
He wouldn't.

82
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,728
He, he wouldn't.

83
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,848
If you don't leave now,

84
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:03,888
I'll kill you too!

85
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:05,928
Go!

86
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:07,928
Go!

87
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,368
If you don't let him go,

88
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:11,648
kill me as well.

89
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:14,208
Why?

90
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:18,328
Why are you helping him?

91
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:19,888
Yindan,

92
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,168
I'm not helping him.

93
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,368
He is certainly not a good man,

94
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:26,768
but he does not lie.

95
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:30,808
I don't want you to kill
the wrong target.

96
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:33,408
Yindan,

97
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,088
believe me.

98
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:36,896
Please

99
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:40,048
believe me one more time.

100
00:04:43,328 --> 00:04:44,568
Stop suspecting Yindan.

101
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,608
Everyone in this hall answers to me,

102
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:48,488
except her.

103
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:50,888
It absolutely couldn't be her.

104
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:52,416
I've investigated it thoroughly.

105
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,656
Yindan's father, Lou An,
a Medical Pavilion academician,

106
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,800
offended the late emperor
and got his family executed.

107
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,888
She is here for revenge.

108
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:01,208
She has gone mad.

109
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,488
To avenge, she harmed you.

110
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,208
Even if she hurt me,

111
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,688
don't harm her.

112
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,504
Here's the antidote. Take it.

113
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,808
I'll help you

114
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,288
uncover the truth.

115
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:00,368
So Her Majesty's fire
was also your doing?

116
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:01,168
Yes.

117
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:02,488
For my revenge,

118
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,328
all royals must die.

119
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,848
Why didn't you kill Prince Rui too?

120
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:13,368
He just returned from the frontier.

121
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,288
He's clean, not like you.

122
00:06:17,248 --> 00:06:18,328
Alright.

123
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:19,208
Skip Prince Rui.

124
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:20,368
Yindan,

125
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:23,048
how did your parents die?

126
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,128
My father, Lou An, concocted elixirs
for the late emperor.

127
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:28,448
That morning,

128
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:30,488
he told me and my mother,

129
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:32,288
his elixir would be completed that day.

130
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:34,128
Once the elixir was finished,

131
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:37,088
he would take me and my mother away

132
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,088
from the capital, a troublesome place.

133
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:42,368
But that day, my father

134
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,688
didn't return even until the Zi hour.

135
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,808
My mother and I
couldn't wait any longer,

136
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:48,688
so we decided to sleep.

137
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:54,088
We had just lain down
when we heard noises.

138
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:57,408
My mother pushed me into the cellar.

139
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,608
The next day,

140
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:01,768
when I crawled out of the cellar,

141
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:03,808
I

142
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,928
only found her corpse.

143
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,208
So,

144
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,608
you infiltrated the imperial selection

145
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,608
to assassinate Xiao Wenjing?

146
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,848
Yes.

147
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,568
But I never expected that selection

148
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,088
wasn't for the new emperor's consorts,

149
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,488
but for burial consorts.

150
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:25,128
I never expected to meet you.

151
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:27,008
You saved me.

152
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:29,808
This wasn't my doing.

153
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:33,088
Seems more like
Empress Dowager Chen's doing.

154
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,928
But the guards in black clearly said
"His Majesty".

155
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,288
I heard it very clearly.

156
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:39,848
You mean

157
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,328
I sent them to kill you,

158
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,408
and asked them to tell you it's my order

159
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:46,208
and let you go,

160
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,248
so that eighteen years later,

161
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,208
you'd come back to kill my family?

162
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,608
I'm not that stupid.

163
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,048
Wait.

164
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,408
I feel it is

165
00:07:57,648 --> 00:07:58,688
a bit strange.

166
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,088
What's strange?

167
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:01,888
It's hard to explain.

168
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,208
Yindan,

169
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,888
did your father

170
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,808
succeed in making the elixir?

171
00:08:06,808 --> 00:08:07,688
I don't know.

172
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:10,008
He rarely spoke

173
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:11,408
of the elixir-making.

174
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:13,728
If he had made it,

175
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,048
the late emperor wouldn't have died.

176
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:18,808
True.

177
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,408
Yindan, don't cry.

178
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,448
I'll help you uncover the truth.

179
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:25,688
Your Highness,

180
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:28,248
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:30,328
Why are you apologizing?

182
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,208
I used you.

183
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:34,728
But you didn't harm me.

184
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:40,768
Are you alright?

185
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,848
From now on, let's live well together.

186
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,488
Tell me whatever troubles you.

187
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,608
I'll help you.

188
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,168
Okay.

189
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:01,808
Lu Zhen'er,

190
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,728
I've lifted your house arrest.

191
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,288
Why don't bake back at the Zhaohua Hall

192
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,248
instead of here?

193
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:08,328
Yindan's birthday is coming.

194
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:09,648
I'm preparing a surprise for her,

195
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:10,968
so can't bake at the Zhaohua Hall.

196
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,608
You really treat her well.

197
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:14,848
Of course.

198
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:17,168
She's my own sister.

199
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:19,088
After I celebrate her birthday,

200
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,528
I'll help her find the murderer.

201
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,448
She is indeed your own sister.

202
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,688
Scheming meticulously and playing tricks

203
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:27,568
to preserve that image

204
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,048
of the perfect sister in your mind.

205
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:32,128
It means she genuinely cares for me.

206
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,448
What are you doing?

207
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,568
I'm hungry. Getting a snack.

208
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,448
Go to the imperial kitchen for food.

209
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,888
I have no food for you.

210
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:54,648
Lu Zhen'er,

211
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,088
I came alone to save you.

212
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,048
Aren't you touched?

213
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,248
Well, I saved you too.

214
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,328
If it weren't for me,

215
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:02,288
you'd have died.

216
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,568
I'm very grateful for that.

217
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:09,248
And you?

218
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,488
You dragged me into this!

219
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,088
You charging to your death to save me

220
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,328
is just what you owed me!

221
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:15,568
Why should I be touched?

222
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,768
Lu Zhen'er,

223
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:25,808
you're heartless.

224
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,288
No, I'm not.

225
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:30,208
But your petty favors

226
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,968
can't erase the pain you caused me.

227
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:36,488
Now leave.

228
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,688
I need to finish this cake.

229
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:03,688
Greetings, Your Majesty.

230
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:05,968
Rise.

231
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,008
Your Majesty,

232
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:12,008
I've long wished to tell you something.

233
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,288
Do not fail Her Highness.

234
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:19,168
I understand.

235
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,088
Why summon me again?

236
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,248
My cake isn't finished!

237
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:51,248
Look.

238
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,367
(Succession to Lu Zhen'er)

239
00:11:58,688 --> 00:11:59,888
An edict of succession?

240
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:00,808
Yes.

241
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:02,168
Passing the throne to me?

242
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,088
Are you insane? Or dying?

243
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,888
I've thought it over.

244
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:07,768
You were right.

245
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,432
Even if I return to the real world now,

246
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,608
I probably won't adjust
to the modern life.

247
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,728
Better to live well here.

248
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:18,448
Cherish the present.

249
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,792
But that doesn't mean abdicating to me!

250
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:24,256
Don't you want to be Empress Regnant?

251
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,608
I don't.

252
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:29,328
That's bitter toil.

253
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:31,608
Can't beat

254
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,488
the joy of being a lazy slacker.

255
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:35,808
But previously...

256
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:38,648
I wanted to be Empress Regnant,

257
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,648
because you made me the target of all.

258
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,248
You made me realize

259
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:43,528
that in this harem,

260
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,696
without power, survival is impossible.

261
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,688
The nest of tenderness,
not the path of thorns,

262
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,008
will trap us.

263
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,032
Xiao Wenjing,

264
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,408
if you sincerely love me

265
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:55,008
and protect me,

266
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,168
perhaps I'll remain Consort Lu,

267
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,928
indulging in pleasure under your wing.

268
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:03,200
But even if I spare you

269
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,848
and treat you with sincerity,

270
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:08,640
you'd fight for justice for the people,

271
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:11,208
because of the world's unfairness.

272
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,008
You pity the weak,

273
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,368
yearn for universal harmony.

274
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,288
You seek power, not for yourself.

275
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,088
Even immersing in tenderness,

276
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,328
you'd rage against those who abuse power

277
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:27,264
and moved by the wretched

278
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:28,648
clinging to life.

279
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,648
Xiao Wenjing,

280
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,288
what's wrong with you?

281
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,728
Don't put a heavy filter on me.

282
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:39,424
Truthfully,

283
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,208
you're a good person.

284
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,848
Stop sweet-talking me!

285
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:52,888
I'm not sweet-talking you.

286
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,088
I want to reconcile.

287
00:13:58,488 --> 00:13:59,688
Reconcile?

288
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,088
It's not that simple!

289
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,288
I need to observe you longer.

290
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:06,728
How long?

291
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:10,368
Depends on my mood.

292
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:19,808
Come on.

293
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,328
