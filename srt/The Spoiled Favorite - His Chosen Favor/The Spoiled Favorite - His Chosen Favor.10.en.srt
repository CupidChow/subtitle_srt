1
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:24,330
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,274
(What? You're Enjoying This?)

3
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,942
=Episode 10=

4
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:34,982
Chen Wanyi, when will you return
Beizhao's throne to the Xiao family?

5
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:38,822
Your Majesty, I've never coveted
the Xiao family's throne.

6
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:40,342
Beizhao always belongs to the Xiaos.

7
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:41,182
Halt!

8
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,982
I no longer belong to your world.

9
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:46,182
I must never meet the living.

10
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:48,582
Otherwise, I'll vanish instantly.

11
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,582
That sounds strange.

12
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:52,462
Wait, Lu Zhen'er,

13
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:54,702
did you hire a man to impersonate
the late emperor?

14
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:56,462
Your Majesty,

15
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,702
can't you recognize your late husband?

16
00:00:58,702 --> 00:00:59,822
Take a closer look!

17
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:02,462
The one behind the curtain
is exactly the late emperor.

18
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,062
I must see for myself

19
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,942
what trick you're playing now!

20
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:23,702
Your Majesty!

21
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,462
Your Majesty!

22
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:33,542
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

23
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:36,142
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

24
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:40,662
- Greetings, Your Majesty!
- Greetings, Your Majesty!

25
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,862
Chen Wanyi,

26
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:45,222
your treacherous ambition

27
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:47,142
has disrupted Beizhao's balance.

28
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:49,542
Heaven has condemned you.

29
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,982
Beizhao has no place for you now.

30
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,622
Wenjing,

31
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:54,822
reclaim Beizhao's throne!

32
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,462
Yes, Father!

33
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:58,462
Eradicate the evil forces.

34
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:01,062
Heaven will protect Beizhao.

35
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:02,262
Yes,

36
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:05,302
I'll cleanse Beizhao of evil!

37
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:08,142
Zhen'er, you're a skilled healer.

38
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:10,222
Cure the poisoned

39
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,902
and guard Beizhao.

40
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,182
Yes, Your Majesty.

41
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:15,502
I'll ensure Beizhao's safety.

42
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,942
Your Majesty, I've never sought power.

43
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,262
Everything I've done is for Beizhao

44
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:22,462
and for you!

45
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:23,982
Your Majesty,

46
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:26,822
I've wished every day and night
that you'd come to my dreams.

47
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:29,662
Why have you never come?

48
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:32,502
Yet you appear
in that vile consort's dreams?

49
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:35,742
Oh, no! Hurry up!

50
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:37,302
Reflect on your actions!

51
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:39,462
Your Majesty!

52
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:42,422
Mother, return Beizhao's throne!

53
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:45,742
- Your Majesty, return the throne!
- Your Majesty, return the throne!

54
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:48,582
Your Majesty!

55
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,262
Your Majesty!

56
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:04,782
Release me, Xiao Wenjing!

57
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:05,302
Let go!

58
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,342
What is this?

59
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:11,622
Wanna force me?

60
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:13,702
Back off! I'm not playing.

61
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:14,822
Listen up.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,662
We're only good at hurting each other.

63
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:19,382
I saved your life.

64
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:20,422
Is this your gratitude?

65
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:21,542
What do you want then?

66
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:24,342
What are you doing?

67
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:25,542
Attempting murder?

68
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,222
Listen to me.

69
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,222
Only I can cure those poisoned

70
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:30,062
by Qiansichan.

71
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,822
Kill me now

72
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,622
and we'll perish together!

73
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,064
How did Qiansichan get in the palace?

74
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:38,240
What?

75
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't understand.

76
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:40,942
Stop pretending.

77
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:42,542
None of your business!

78
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,342
All that matters is I can cure it.

79
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:47,462
The late emperor was
Prince Rui in disguise.

80
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:49,182
You visited him in the imperial prison.

81
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,382
Lu Zhen'er, listen.

82
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,622
Prince Rui is treacherous.

83
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:53,862
Don't trust him lightly.

84
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:56,102
Unless you wish
to be devoured completely.

85
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:01,262
Who should I trust if not him?

86
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:01,942
You?

87
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:03,622
Now you listen to me.

88
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:04,942
I did trust you,

89
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:06,102
but how did you repay me?

90
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:07,462
You schemed against me,

91
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:08,782
inventing ways to kill me.

92
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:09,782
Without Prince Rui,

93
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,182
I'd have been bones in a grave.

94
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:12,502
Anyone else could say that,

95
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,382
but not you.

96
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,062
You simply

97
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:15,462
do

98
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:15,782
not

99
00:04:15,782 --> 00:04:16,182
deserve

100
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:16,502
to

101
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:16,942
say

102
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:17,342
that

103
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:17,742
to

104
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,062
me!

105
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:26,662
What is it?

106
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,702
What? Stop staring.

107
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:34,742
You deserve that.

108
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,382
You betrayed my trust.

109
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:37,582
Get off me.

110
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:38,502
What?

111
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:39,582
Get off me!

112
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:54,022
What?

113
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:55,382
You're enjoying this?

114
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:58,062
Shut up.

115
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:01,062
I'm leaving.

116
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:02,022
Stay here alone.

117
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:07,782
Xiao Wenjing,

118
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,102
there's something

119
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,382
I've long wanted to tell you.

120
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:13,382
You know,

121
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,662
I may be petty,

122
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,382
but you hadn't struck first

123
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:18,702
and tried to take my life,

124
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,142
I'd never want to kill you.

125
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:22,462
Because

126
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:25,182
you are

127
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:26,782
my first

128
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,462
and only true friend

129
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:31,382
in this world.

130
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,102
I've always been

131
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:36,982
really nice

132
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:41,302
to my friends.

133
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,782
(Xiao Wenjing, what are you doing?)

134
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:58,102
(Don't treat your archenemy
for ten lifetimes like this.)

135
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:05,440
♪I am the lotus in the pond,
suffering day and night♪

136
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:10,214
♪I only pray for snowfall♪

137
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:16,862
We can crush all obstacles.

138
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:22,342
This is a gun.

139
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:27,238
♪I don't regret our fate,
at least we brushed shoulders♪

140
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:33,782
(What on earth is this feeling?)

141
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,782
(What should I do?)

142
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,062
Bring in all the mugwort.

143
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,142
Fumigate every corner
of the Wanchun Hall

144
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:49,382
to help neutralize the poison.

145
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,502
Yes.

146
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,822
Your Highness, the Empress Dowager
has also been poisoned.

147
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,462
Imperial physicians are with her.

148
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:05,422
Good if she dies.

149
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,302
Saves me the trouble.

150
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,782
To prevent Qiansichan from spreading,

151
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,342
His Majesty told me
to pass out this remedy

152
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,942
and let everyone take a few doses.

153
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:18,102
Only the Wanchun Hall
is contaminated now.

154
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,662
But it could spread any day.

155
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,822
Didn't Your Majesty say

156
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:36,102
we are no longer friends?

157
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,782
Just passing by. Wanted to check on you.

158
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,022
Get back to work.

159
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,542
If you can't cure them,

160
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,382
I won't need to act

161
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,182
and you'll have done yourself in.

162
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:45,862
Nonsense!

163
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,142
I'll live a hundred years.

164
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:48,262
Definitely outlive you.

165
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,982
How annoying! I'm leaving.

166
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:05,862
Wait!

167
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:07,342
What?

168
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,462
Be careful. Don't die.

169
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:23,215
(Prescription)

170
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,702
(Empress Dowager Chen plunged
the harem into chaos,)

171
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:29,702
(causing endless disasters in Beizhao.)

172
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:32,702
(As of today,
she's locked up in the Cold Palace.)

173
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:42,742
The Imperial Medical Academy
sent this medicine, Your Majesty.

174
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,782
Said to be brewed according to

175
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:46,822
Consort Lu's prescription
for Qiansichan.

176
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:47,862
Drink this

177
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,462
and you won't contract Qiansichan.

178
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,862
I won't contract Qiansichan?

179
00:08:56,862 --> 00:08:58,422
I bet Lu Zhen'er

180
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,222
is trying to poison me.

181
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:02,702
Throw away anything she sends over.

182
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,742
Understood.

183
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:10,422
Your Majesty,

184
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:14,782
why do you trust Lu Zhen'er over me?

185
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:17,542
Your Majesty,

186
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:21,062
I'm the one who truly loves you.

187
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,182
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

188
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,862
Someone! Fetch an imperial physician!

189
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:34,942
Help! Someone!

190
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,302
Your Majesty! What's wrong?

191
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,822
Someone! Fetch an imperial physician!

192
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:56,702
Your Majesty.

193
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:03,062
How could he collapse so suddenly?

194
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:06,062
He never visited the Wanchun Hall.

195
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:07,662
And he took the medicine.

196
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:09,702
This shouldn't be possible.

197
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,182
I don't understand either.

198
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:12,302
After bathing,

199
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:13,582
His Majesty suddenly collapsed.

200
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:15,382
Physicians confirm it's Qiansichan,

201
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,382
so I sent for Your Highness immediately.

202
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,902
Your Highness, how is he?

203
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:23,622
It's smallpox.

204
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,622
Quick! Seal the Zichen Hall at once!

205
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,302
Xiao Wenjing has smallpox.

206
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:31,262
All eunuchs and maids near him

207
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:32,142
must be quarantined.

208
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:32,742
Yes.

209
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,542
(This era is backward.)

210
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:36,342
