1
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:24,128
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:27,104
(The tyrant invites me to cuckold him)

3
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:27,845
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:28,765
Your Highness.

5
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:30,365
Yindan.

6
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:32,685
Yindan,

7
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,925
what brings you here?

8
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,245
I brought some food for you

9
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,285
and to see if you get better.

10
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:40,325
Yindan,

11
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:42,445
you're so kind.

12
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:45,325
Your fever's gone.

13
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,325
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

14
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,405
Thank goodness you came.

15
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:56,805
They gave me no food.

16
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,245
If you hadn't come,

17
00:00:58,245 --> 00:00:59,485
I'd have gone hungry again.

18
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:02,085
His Majesty's so heartless.

19
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:05,485
I'm fine.

20
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:06,765
What did Xiao Wenjing do to you?

21
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:08,765
Did he bully you?

22
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:09,725
I'm alright.

23
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,365
I'm still serving in the Zhaohua Palace.

24
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:12,805
Good to hear that.

25
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:14,205
Yindan,

26
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,445
have you considered

27
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:18,965
leaving the palace with me?

28
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:21,685
Leave the palace?

29
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:24,365
Prince Rui said

30
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,005
he has a way to get me out.

31
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,205
Will you come with me?

32
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:29,965
We can leave this wretched place.

33
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:30,685
When?

34
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,965
Prince Rui didn't say when.

35
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:36,005
He just told me to wait.

36
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,525
I want to think it over.

37
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:40,005
Of course.

38
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:41,405
Think it through.

39
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:43,445
Don't worry.

40
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,125
After we get out,

41
00:01:45,445 --> 00:01:47,285
I'll open a clinic.

42
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,440
My job's diagnosis,
and yours is payment.

43
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:51,405
We'll make a good living.

44
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:52,965
And we absolutely

45
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,085
won't go hungry.

46
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,005
Then...

47
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,645
Do you no longer love His Majesty?

48
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:02,965
No.

49
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,405
He's not worthy of my love.

50
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:06,325
Yes,

51
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,165
he's not worthy.

52
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,405
You know today His Majesty...

53
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:11,765
What did he do?

54
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:14,965
Please tell me.

55
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,005
He's treated me badly.

56
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:17,645
Why shield him anymore?

57
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,485
Today, I went to His Majesty

58
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,565
to tell him you were ill.

59
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:24,965
But he spent the day in the Zichen Hall

60
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,085
with Noble Consort Qing.

61
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:28,725
Eunuch Fu just mentioned
the Laundry Service,

62
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:30,925
when he dismissed him.

63
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:33,365
You're right.

64
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,445
He's not worth your love.

65
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:40,965
Yes.

66
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,085
He's not worth loving.

67
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:09,485
This horse carving is adorable.

68
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,085
It's a deer.

69
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,845
An adorable deer.

70
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:16,485
I mistook it for a horse.

71
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,285
Has Lu Zhen'er

72
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:21,085
caused any trouble?

73
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,605
No news

74
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:25,845
of Ms. Lu.

75
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:27,725
Nothing at all?

76
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,685
What does she do all day then?

77
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:36,125
Seems to do the laundry.

78
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:37,885
Seems?

79
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,725
You didn't send men to watch her?

80
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:44,125
Your Majesty didn't order that.

81
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:47,925
Without

82
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,885
my order, you won't do anything.

83
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:50,925
Should I order everything?

84
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,245
What's the point of you?

85
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:53,925
I neglected my duty.

86
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,445
I'll send someone to watch her now.

87
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,925
And have someone tell her

88
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,645
I'm waiting for her to beg for mercy.

89
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:00,885
Understood.

90
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,045
Forget it.

91
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:04,685
I'll go myself

92
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,085
to see how miserable she is.

93
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:08,525
Let's go.

94
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:18,725
Wash these.

95
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,405
Stop!

96
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,485
What do you want?

97
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,845
These were assigned to you.

98
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,325
Why are you dumping them on me?

99
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,125
Noble Consort Qing has decreed

100
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,925
you'll do all her palace laundry.

101
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:30,765
I refuse.

102
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,445
You think you can refuse?

103
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,125
Still playing the consort, huh?

104
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,125
Lu Zhen'er, nowadays,

105
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,405
Noble Consort Qing

106
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,565
is the most favored consort.

107
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,445
Yesterday His Majesty bestowed upon her

108
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,125
a lot of gold, silver, and jewels.

109
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,725
To oppose Her Highness?

110
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,125
Are you qualified?

111
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,405
You've only been favored for a few days.

112
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,845
Don't think you're special!

113
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:57,925
What are you doing?

114
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:00,645
My apologies.

115
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,285
I used too much force.

116
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:06,685
This is Her Highness' ceremonial robe!

117
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:08,685
She won't let you get away with this!

118
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,965
Go ahead and tell her!

119
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:12,765
Lu Zhen'er! How dare you!

120
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,045
Am I being too lenient?

121
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,485
I'll report this to Her Highness.

122
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,565
Go ahead!

123
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,365
If you don't, you're spineless!

124
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:24,525
Push your luck again,

125
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,685
and I'll beat you up when I see you!

126
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,245
Such a madwoman.

127
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:35,445
Seems you're having a great time here.

128
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:37,765
What are you here for?

129
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:38,765
To mock me?

130
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,125
If you beg for mercy now,

131
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,045
I'll restore you as Consort Lu.

132
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,365
No need.

133
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,605
Is it that hard to apologize?

134
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:56,445
You know what you look like now?

135
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:57,925
You're exactly like a schoolboy

136
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,565
who bullies girls to get attention!

137
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:01,845
Nonsense!

138
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,885
You know whether it's nonsense or not.

139
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:04,845
I just want to tell you

140
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,005
I despise such a man.

141
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:08,325
Utterly childish.

142
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,405
I have a temper too!

143
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,885
(Xiao Wenjing,)

144
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:36,205
(I might like you a little,)

145
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,965
(but you're unworthy of my love.)

146
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:42,805
Speak if you have business.

147
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,125
Leave if you don't.

148
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,285
Your Majesty, I have urgent matters
to report.

149
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,925
Prince Rui, what is it?

150
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:55,685
Five years ago,
I earned merit defending the frontier.

151
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:59,205
The late emperor awarded me
a blank imperial decree.

152
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,485
Today, I came with it

153
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,125
to make a request.

154
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:05,285
What do you want?

155
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:14,845
Your Majesty, please grant me marriage
to Lu Zhen'er.

156
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,005
He is outrageously bold!

157
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:22,525
Indeed!

158
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,045
This will throw the court into chaos!

159
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:26,205
What blank imperial decree?

160
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,205
I've never heard of it.

161
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,285
Fu An, bring it to me.

162
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,600
(Blank Imperial Decree)

163
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:47,365
Such imperial favors are rare.

164
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:50,085
You should reconsider carefully.

165
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,205
I want nothing else,

166
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,645
just Lu Zhen'er.

167
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,565
Please grant this marriage.

168
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:56,845
Lu Zhen'er is my consort!

169
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,685
She is merely a laundry maid!

170
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:00,765
We'll discuss this later.

171
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:01,845
Your Majesty,

172
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:04,765
the blank decree was granted
by the late emperor.

173
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,045
Are you going to defy
the late emperor's order?

174
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,325
Marriage is a grave matter
for any woman.

175
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,565
I refuse to pressure her
with imperial power.

176
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:20,365
Your Majesty could summon Ms. Lu.

177
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,365
If she refuses to marry me,

178
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,245
I'll respect her decision!

179
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,485
Fu An, fetch Lu Zhen'er.

180
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:31,965
Yes!

181
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,765
Greetings, Your Majesty.

182
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,085
Long live Your Majesty.

183
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:55,765
Rise.

184
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:56,925
Thank you.

185
00:08:57,845 --> 00:08:59,245
Zhen'er, today

186
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:01,845
with the blank decree granted
by the late emperor,

187
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,365
I petition His Majesty for our marriage.

188
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,645
Would you marry me

189
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,085
and become my wife?

190
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:09,525
Lu Zhen'er,

191
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:11,165
think carefully!

192
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,165
This is Prince Rui!

193
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:13,485
His scandal recently

194
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:14,605
set the whole city abuzz!

195
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,445
All misunderstandings!

196
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:18,885
There are witnesses!

197
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:20,325
It's fabricated!

198
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:20,885
You...

199
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:21,725
I trust His Highness.

200
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:24,845
Lu Zhen'er!

201
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:26,445
Your Majesty,

202
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,645
I'm willing to marry Prince Rui.

203
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:30,765
Please grant this marriage.

204
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:41,565
Please grant this marriage.

205
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,805
We'll discuss this later.

206
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:47,885
Your Majesty, I have a decree granted
by the late emperor.

207
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:49,885
This is a place
for handling state affairs,

208
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,605
not for personal romantic matters.

209
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:52,845
Dismissed!

210
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,765
I'll take Lu Zhen'er as my wife.

211
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:09,085
Greetings, Your Majesty.

212
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,685
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

213
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,125
You tried to kill me once.

214
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,125
What do you mean?

215
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,245
What do I mean?

216
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,965
I don't understand.

217
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,125
Do you wish to marry Prince Rui?

218
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:30,485
Why shouldn't I?

219
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,165
Lu Zhen'er,

220
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,645
as a modern person,

221
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:34,845
will you love an ancient man?

222
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,165
Why wouldn't I?

223
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,485
Prince Rui isn't as good as you imagine.

224
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:40,605
Can't you see he has ulterior motives?

225
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:42,125
Whether ulterior motives

226
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,165
or other hidden agendas,

227
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,245
as long as the outcome benefits me,

228
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,165
the process won't matter.

229
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:48,965
You won't benefit forever.

230
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,725
Before figuring out what he wants,

231
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,605
you want to marry him.

232
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:53,165
Utterly foolish!

233
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:53,965
Xiao Wenjing,

234
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:56,085
between people,

235
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:57,405
it's all about mutual benefit.

236
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:59,765
If he treats me well out of love,

237
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,445
I won't dare even glance his way.

238
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:02,805
Just because he seeks benefits,

239
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:04,445
I find him worthy of my trust.

240
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,525
Because I can ensure,

241
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:07,008
he'll always want something from me.

242
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:13,405
True love is fleeting,

243
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,045
just like fireworks.

244
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:17,405
Only mutual benefit

245
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,085
can endure.

246
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,765
Lu Zhen'er, have you gone mad?

247
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:21,645
I'm not mad.

248
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,085
I've been like this.

249
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,005
Yes, you've been like this.

250
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,645
Lu Zhen'er,

251
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,445
I forgot

252
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:31,005
you crave power, chase benefits

253
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:32,805
and stop at nothing
to achieve your goals.

254
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,965
You're an out-and-out schemer.

255
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,725
I'll take that as a compliment.
