1
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:24,276
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:27,220
(Oh, No! I've Revived the Late Emperor)

3
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:28,756
=Episode 9=

4
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,816
How...

5
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:53,136
How

6
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,216
is Yindan?

7
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:56,856
The imperial physician said

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,816
it's nothing serious.

9
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:01,496
But deep down...

10
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,456
She belongs here.

11
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:07,696
There will be psychological trauma.

12
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:12,736
I failed to protect her.

13
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,976
I hurt her.

14
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:18,736
This isn't your fault.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,296
It's the Empress Dowager.

16
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:22,456
But Yindan got hurt because of me!

17
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,496
She might not blame you.

18
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,296
But I'll blame myself.

19
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:31,416
But she's not your real sister.

20
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,016
She's different.

21
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,336
You said it.

22
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:42,976
She belongs here.

23
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,336
She's not like us.

24
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,616
Then make her one of us.

25
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:50,536
This world

26
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:52,376
lacks people like us,

27
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,576
so it has become like this.

28
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,776
You did nothing wrong.

29
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:57,696
She neither.

30
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:03,736
If you blame yourself
for others' mistakes,

31
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,216
that's exactly what they want.

32
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:14,296
You're right.

33
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,576
I shouldn't blame myself.

34
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:22,136
Where are you going?

35
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:23,696
To confront Chen Wanyi.

36
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:31,696
What is it this time?

37
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:34,816
You're jealous of me, huh?

38
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,856
You never outshine me
before the late emperor.

39
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:40,976
Now you can't outshine me
before Prince Rui.

40
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:42,816
The late emperor adored me deeply.

41
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,896
Prince Rui pledges eternal vows for me.

42
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:50,456
Yet they avoid you like the plague.

43
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,696
They act as if you don't exist.

44
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:52,856
Are you crazy?

45
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:54,416
I'm not crazy.

46
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:55,736
You're crazy.

47
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,736
You harm innocents over a man.

48
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:59,256
You boast of your immense power,

49
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:00,496
yet treat lives as weeds.

50
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,536
You mop over your pathetic romance.

51
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,616
If someone like you rules as empress,

52
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:06,496
it'll be Beizhao's misfortune

53
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,936
and the people's tragedy.

54
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:09,336
Why are you two waiting for?

55
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,056
Kick her out now!

56
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,136
I dare you!

57
00:03:12,136 --> 00:03:12,776
Let me go!

58
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,576
You think ruining my reputation
will destroy me?

59
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:20,256
Keep dreaming!

60
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,576
As long as I draw breath,

61
00:03:23,376 --> 00:03:25,456
I'll live well,

62
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,176
freely, joyfully

63
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,256
and to the fullest.

64
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:34,976
Innocence isn't defined

65
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:37,416
by what lies beneath a woman's skirt.

66
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,976
You came to tarnish your own name

67
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,376
to become the center of gossip?

68
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,256
Thus,

69
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:52,416
no one will care about Yindan.

70
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:54,616
Aren't you afraid of slander?

71
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,016
My heart is pure and I fear no rumors.

72
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,216
Yindan,

73
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,456
are you alright?

74
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:27,176
Your Highness.

75
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:33,296
Don't worry, I'm fine.

76
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:34,056
Yindan,

77
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:36,816
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:38,456
Empress Dowager

79
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:42,296
did it to get back at me.

80
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:44,136
She should be blamed.

81
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,776
It's not your fault.

82
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,536
Don't blame yourself.

83
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:52,856
You saved me from the sacrificial pit.

84
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,456
Without you,

85
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,936
I would've died long ago.

86
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,296
Therefore,

87
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:02,056
I'll do anything for you,

88
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,696
even at the cost of my life.

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
Stop!

90
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:08,176
Yindan,

91
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,096
I want you to live.

92
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:14,136
I want you to live well.

93
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,416
Lu Zhen'er, you vile woman!

94
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,416
I'll have her killed today.

95
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:35,536
Jingxi,

96
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,896
bring Lu Zhen'er to me.

97
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:39,576
Yes.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,585
(Consort Lu caused the earthquake.
Execute her!)

99
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,616
Your Majesty,
these are today's memorials.

100
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,536
They all condemn Consort Lu.

101
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,136
Empress Dowager orchestrated this.

102
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:56,776
These rumors have spread
among the people.

103
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,096
Consort Lu is seen as a thorn

104
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:01,016
in their flesh by the people.

105
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,376
They all say...

106
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:03,216
What?

107
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:06,536
They say since
the late emperor passed away,

108
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:08,976
a demon must have been
haunting the harem.

109
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,536
Otherwise, there won't be
so many absurd things.

110
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,016
Everyone says

111
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,816
Consort Lu is that demon.

112
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,176
Order the Imperial Astronomers
to prepare

113
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,536
for a prayer ceremony to Heaven
in three days.

114
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,456
Yes.

115
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:35,536
Consort Lu, will you not bow to me?

116
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,696
Let's speak frankly.

117
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:39,936
You brought ruin to the nation!

118
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:41,216
Who said that?

119
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,376
Rumor has it

120
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:45,296
that you ruin the nation
and that Beizhao will fall.

121
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:47,056
Today, I will act for Beizhao

122
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,616
and kill you.

123
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,936
His Majesty is here.

124
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:53,856
Mother, what mischief are you up to now?

125
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,816
Your Majesty can't protect
this nation-ruining demon.

126
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,336
Whether she is a demon or not

127
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,056
will be decided in three days.

128
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,416
What do you mean?

129
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,376
In three days, we'll pray
to Heaven at the Qinian Hall.

130
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:10,736
Heaven will show Beizhao the way.

131
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:12,456
I cannot wait three days!

132
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:15,016
Mother, do you want her

133
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,736
to take the blame for you,
the usurping demon?

134
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,256
Nonsense.

135
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:21,056
How could I be a demon?

136
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,776
Then let Heaven decide.

137
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,096
Are you so desperate to save her?

138
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,096
Mother,

139
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,336
in three days,

140
00:07:27,336 --> 00:07:30,096
if the Imperial Astronomers divine
she is a demon,

141
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,736
with all the officials present,

142
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,696
even if I want to protect her,

143
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,056
I'll hardly silence them.

144
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,616
Do you fear, Your Majesty?

145
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,336
Ridiculous! Would I fear you?

146
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:44,096
Three days it is, then.

147
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,176
In three days,

148
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:48,416
I'll surely sacrifice you to Heaven.

149
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,616
I feel like someone's following me.

150
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:58,056
Everything in the palace
is getting stranger lately.

151
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:10,856
Why is the water so heavy today?

152
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:13,376
- Blood!
- It's blood! Run!

153
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,576
There's blood!

154
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:26,416
What's wrong today?

155
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,296
Have no strength in your hands.

156
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:28,936
Haven't eaten?

157
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,656
Please calm your anger.

158
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:33,896
I'm not feeling well today.

159
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,376
Since you're unwell,

160
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:37,656
why did you come to work?

161
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:38,976
Get out now!

162
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,176
Yes, I'm leaving.

163
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,016
Your Majesty, I...

164
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,576
Stop stammering.

165
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,856
Tell me directly,

166
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,256
what is wrong with Jingxi?

167
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,016
She has served me for many years.

168
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,016
If she is truly ill,

169
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,856
I'll grant her a favor

170
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:13,096
and let her return home early.

171
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,296
Your Majesty,

172
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,016
the imperial physician said

173
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,616
she's been poisoned.

174
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,896
It's Qiansichan.

175
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:20,416
What?

176
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:24,856
Isn't Lu Zhen'er the bewitching consort?

177
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,416
Why did the strange incidents
happen in Her Majesty's palace?

178
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,856
Exactly!

179
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:31,016
Jingxi, who's been serving Her Majesty,

180
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:31,936
is said to be poisoned

181
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,376
by the rare Qiansichan.

182
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:35,296
Qiansichan?

183
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:40,056
Is the so-called demon someone else?

184
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,136
Stop talking. Let's go!

185
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:45,024
(Wanchun Hall)

186
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,296
Your Majesty,

187
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:06,496
the divination shows

188
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,856
imbalanced yin and yang
with yin overwhelming yang.

189
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:12,056
It is an omen of female usurpation
of power and demonic descent.

190
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:15,496
This Qiansichan outbreak
in the harem, like last time,

191
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:16,856
may be a sign of Heaven's wrath.

192
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:23,056
Your Majesty, execute
the bewitching consort Lu Zhen'er

193
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,696
and restore peace
and prosperity to Beizhao.

194
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:31,296
Your Majesty, execute
the bewitching consort Lu Zhen'er!

195
00:10:32,096 --> 00:10:34,456
The demon ruining Beizhao is not me.

196
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,416
It's you, Empress Dowager Chen.

197
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:41,576
Your Majesty,

198
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:42,776
I'm merely

199
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,976
a woman who couldn't hurt a fly,

200
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,816
with no real power whatsoever.

201
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,736
Yet you hold immense power
and rule behind the curtain.

202
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,456
Who is practicing

203
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:53,136
female tyranny

204
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,936
and ruining the nation, you or me?

205
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:57,736
Do you think your mere words

206
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:00,096
can pin the blame on me?

207
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:00,936
Ridiculous!

208
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,816
Ever since the earthquake,

209
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,656
the late emperor visited me in dreams.

210
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,096
He said as you hold power,

211
00:11:06,096 --> 00:11:08,216
yin overwhelms yang,
violating all natural laws.

212
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:11,056
He commanded me
to reclaim the Xiao family's empire!

213
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:12,336
Utter nonsense!

214
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,776
Why would he visit a demon in dreams?

215
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,136
I have proof!

216
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:16,856
What?

217
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:18,776
My lords,

218
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:21,336
the late emperor will appear shortly

219
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,616
to clarify everything for you.

220
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:24,976
But he passed away.

221
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,256
- Yes!
- She's spreading heresy!

222
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,896
Your Majesty,

223
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:31,216
appear now!

224
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,376
Your Majesty!

225
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:42,656
Is that the late emperor?

226
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:46,616
When will you return Beizhao's throne
to the Xiao family?

227
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,696
That's the late emperor's voice!

228
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,576
Your Majesty!

229
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:54,536
I'm here.
