1
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:24,244
=His Chosen Favor=

2
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,188
(Empress Dowager Chen is Pregnant)

3
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:29,920
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:34,142
(Lately, I can't eat and feel nauseous.)

5
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:35,222
(Could it be...)

6
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:37,662
I'm pregnant!

7
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:38,942
Impossible!

8
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,502
Why is it impossible?

9
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:42,902
I just took your pulse days ago.

10
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:44,422
You're just jealous.

11
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:45,862
And your skills are poor.

12
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,982
So whose child are you carrying?

13
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:56,022
Prince Rui.

14
00:00:59,222 --> 00:00:59,902
- Prince Rui?
- Prince Rui?

15
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:01,222
- That one night?
- That one night?

16
00:01:01,622 --> 00:01:04,102
It's the late emperor's child.

17
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:06,782
But he is dead.

18
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:09,822
He returned to
the Qinian Hall days ago, no?

19
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,022
So?

20
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:14,382
That very night, I dreamed of him.

21
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:17,022
We spent a passionate night
in the dream,

22
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,582
thus the child.

23
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,502
You dreamed of him too.

24
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:25,622
The imperial physician is here!

25
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:29,622
Greetings, Your Majesties.

26
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,022
Physician Wang, take my pulse.

27
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:33,902
I must be with child.

28
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:38,062
Lately, I can't eat a bite.

29
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,382
The slightest whiff of meat
makes me nauseous.

30
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,182
I carried children before.

31
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:45,342
Only...

32
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:49,062
But this time, my symptoms

33
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,142
are identical to those before.

34
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:53,502
I'm definitely carrying
the late emperor's child.

35
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:57,142
I've been waiting long for this day.

36
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:59,062
Your pulse...

37
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:04,062
Examine carefully, Physician Wang.

38
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:08,862
If the child suffers the slightest harm,

39
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,382
your entire family will pay
with their lives.

40
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:15,502
Your Majesty

41
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,142
is indeed pregnant.

42
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:19,182
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

43
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:20,142
What?

44
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,142
Your Majesty,

45
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:26,262
we finally have a child.

46
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,504
Snap out of it.

47
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:52,902
It's fake.

48
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:54,742
She can't be pregnant.

49
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,942
I took her pulse just days ago.

50
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,902
She's moved back to the Wanchun Hall,

51
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,662
announcing that she's

52
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,102
with the late emperor's child.

53
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,822
She even issued an edict
to grant amnesty

54
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,782
to pray for blessings
for her unborn child.

55
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,142
Has she lost her mind?

56
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:10,262
She lost it long ago.

57
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,182
Come on.

58
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:14,422
I have a plan.

59
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:16,262
What do you intend to do?

60
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,742
Infiltrate the harem,

61
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,302
gain firsthand intelligence,

62
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,382
and sow discord between
Her Majesty and Prince Rui

63
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:23,942
to turn him to our side.

64
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,342
Come on, they even have a baby.

65
00:03:25,342 --> 00:03:27,062
Are you sure he can be turned?

66
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:28,422
Of course.

67
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,262
He may have a bad temper,

68
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:31,502
but he likes me.

69
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,622
So I'll just sacrifice

70
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:33,742
a little charm.

71
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:36,142
Your Majesty,

72
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:38,502
for the sake of our plan,

73
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:39,862
I'll make the sacrifice.

74
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:42,222
No,

75
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:42,742
you

76
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:43,542
can't.

77
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:46,822
(By decree of the Empress Dowager,)

78
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,302
(amnesty is granted nationwide)

79
00:03:48,302 --> 00:03:50,102
(to honor Heaven's grace.)

80
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,982
(Prince Rui Xiao Yicheng)

81
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,662
(is hereby specially pardoned)

82
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:55,862
(and shall be released home
immediately.)

83
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:59,822
Your Majesty, Prince Rui is here.

84
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:01,422
Yes.

85
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:07,502
What can I do for you?

86
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:09,582
(Finally managed to sneak in.)

87
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:12,342
Yicheng, do you know?

88
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:14,782
You're a father now.

89
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,822
(What? Is she really pregnant?)

90
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:20,982
I'm a father?

91
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,502
Ridiculous!

92
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:24,662
Whose child are you carrying?

93
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,022
(So violent!)

94
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,302
It's yours, Yicheng.

95
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,022
I'm carrying your child.

96
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,102
Nothing happened that night.

97
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:35,902
How could you be pregnant?

98
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,102
Everything happened that night.

99
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,302
Yicheng,

100
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:41,062
since the late emperor passed away,

101
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,902
I've only slept with you.

102
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:44,702
Yicheng,

103
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:47,382
I'll rid us of Xiao Wenjing

104
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:49,542
and let our child inherit the throne.

105
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,902
(It really is Harem Turmoil.)

106
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:54,902
I hope this child looks like you.

107
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:57,942
Madwoman!

108
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:00,582
Madwoman!

109
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:02,782
Your Majesty,

110
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:04,862
I must bear a child

111
00:05:04,862 --> 00:05:07,102
who looks exactly like you.

112
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,902
(What a bombshell!)

113
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:13,742
(Need time to process this.)

114
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,422
(They are the real lunatics,)

115
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,182
(utterly disregarding the gossip.)

116
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:21,022
Zhen'er.

117
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:22,462
- Greetings, Prince Rui.
- Greetings, Prince Rui.

118
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:23,782
I'm out. Are you alright?

119
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:26,102
I'm fine, truly.

120
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:27,342
Thank you for your concern.

121
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,902
Noble Consort Qing,

122
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,742
I need a word with Zhen'er, so...

123
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,502
Understood.

124
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:37,502
Take your time speaking with Prince Rui.

125
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:40,102
No need to rush to greet Her Majesty.

126
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,182
I'll cover for you

127
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:44,422
before Her Majesty.

128
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:45,422
Don't worry.

129
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:49,822
Zhen'er.

130
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:54,462
Zhen'er,

131
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:56,702
that crazy Empress Dowager dragged me

132
00:05:56,702 --> 00:05:57,942
to the Wanchun Hall.

133
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,422
The child she is carrying

134
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:01,942
is absolutely not mine.

135
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:05,062
I don't care about it, actually.

136
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:05,982
Zhen'er.

137
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:10,782
Prince Rui,

138
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:12,582
I'm still His Majesty's consort.

139
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,542
And this is the Wanchun Hall.

140
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,262
If you keep crossing the boundaries,

141
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:16,982
it's improper.

142
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,782
We should keep our distance.

143
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:21,222
Fair enough.

144
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:23,582
Go ahead, Zhen'er.

145
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:24,942
Alright. Take care, Your Highness.

146
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:28,662
(Zhen'er,)

147
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,142
(why are you so fickle?)

148
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,022
Greetings, Your Majesty.

149
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:39,702
Why are you here?

150
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,022
Your Majesty,

151
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,182
I came today

152
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:44,062
to tell you about a big secret

153
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,182
I uncovered.

154
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,382
Go ahead.

155
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,502
Stay right there.

156
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,142
Your Majesty, I just

157
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:54,382
saw Prince Rui.

158
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,862
Her Majesty granted amnesty,

159
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,222
freeing him after all.

160
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:00,942
He wasn't alone.

161
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,142
Spill it or get out.

162
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,462
He met Lu Zhen'er

163
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:07,702
secretly in the palace.

164
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:09,582
What did you say?

165
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,342
I saw it myself.

166
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,502
They were even holding hands.

167
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:15,662
I see.

168
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:18,662
Your Majesty, Lu Zhen'er
is just a wanton.

169
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,022
You must punish her.

170
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,582
That bewitching consort lacks virtue

171
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,022
and deserves torture

172
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:23,782
and death...

173
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:25,262
Out.

174
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:26,022
What?

175
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:26,862
Out!

176
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:36,982
(Things are spiraling out of control.)

177
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:38,622
(I must strike first.)

178
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:55,822
Using so much coptis?

179
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:56,782
Who's this for?

180
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:57,622
Me?

181
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,902
It's the new medicine.

182
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:00,902
This much coptis is necessary.

183
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,142
From now on,

184
00:08:03,142 --> 00:08:04,662
taste my medicine before I drink it.

185
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:07,782
Are you even human?

186
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,342
Then are you even human?

187
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:12,982
Moreover,

188
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:14,902
I haven't settled
Xiao Yicheng's matter with you.

189
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:15,942
How dare you object?

190
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,782
What about him?

191
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:22,862
You had him impersonate
the late emperor.

192
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:24,702
Because he resembled him,

193
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:25,982
and well you knew

194
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:27,222
I drugged him.

195
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:28,142
Besides,

196
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,462
what did I do wrong with that?

197
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,022
And what about Fu An?

198
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,302
You chose him to do impressions
of the late emperor

199
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:35,422
rather than me!

200
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:38,862
Are you jealous?

201
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:41,302
He imitated it well.

202
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,222
Can you?

203
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:46,422
What's wrong with you today?

204
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,342
You've almost recovered.

205
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:49,302
Could a simple fever

206
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:50,462
have fried your brain?

207
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:08,742
Don't touch me.

208
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,342
I'm very busy.

209
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:13,182
Leave if that's all.

210
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:15,622
Lu Zhen'er.

211
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:18,102
I told you not to meet Xiao Yicheng.

212
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:19,542
Why?

213
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:21,982
What did you do today?

214
00:09:21,982 --> 00:09:23,222
Fetched herbs and decoct them.

215
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:24,942
What else?

216
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:26,062
What are you trying to say?

217
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,422
Xiao Yicheng is out.

218
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,902
I saw him. So what?

219
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:32,782
You should have
told me about this first.

220
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:33,902
Tell you what?

221
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:38,902
Prince Rui is out

222
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,462
and I met him without telling you,

223
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:42,942
so you're lecturing me now?

224
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:44,502
Of course not.

225
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:46,542
Xiao Wenjing.

226
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,502
Aren't you reaching too far?

227
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,702
Now you wanna control
who I meet and talk to?

228
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,462
Aren't you too possessive of me?

229
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,542
Possessive?

230
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,462
I'm never possessive of you.

231
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,222
I wish you'd die right now.

232
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,222
I'm never possessive of you.

233
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:01,022
Besides,

234
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:03,262
do you think Prince Rui truly likes you?

235
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:04,462
He cares for you

236
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,782
solely because you're my consort.

237
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,462
Don't belittle me to elevate yourself.

238
00:10:08,462 --> 00:10:09,502
Whether he seeks favors

239
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,822
or admires me,

240
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,262
it's because of my charm.

241
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,462
It has nothing to do with you.

242
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,062
Nothing to do with me?

243
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,222
I gave you everything you have now.

244
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:18,862
If you weren't Consort Lu,

245
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:20,262
but a lowly palace maid,

246
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,502
would he spare you a second glance?

247
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,702
So what?

248
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:24,502
Even without him,

249
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:26,062
there would be others.

250
00:10:26,062 --> 00:10:28,902
Prince Tom, Dick, and Harry...

251
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:29,862
Utterly absurd.

252
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:33,902
From this moment forward,

253
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:35,102
you are no longer Consort Lu.

254
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,422
I'd like to see

255
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:38,622
whether he'll spare you a glance.

256
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:42,622
I was a fool
to expect anything from you.
