00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,356
How will you fix this?

188
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,816
You're no investor.

189
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,653
I knew something was off
when you went on about it.

190
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,781
You know nothing about investment.

191
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,949
How could you invest that much money?

192
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,242
You moron!

193
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,535
-I swear to God...
-I know.

194
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,120
Is it really that important?

195
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,205
I'll do what I can.

196
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,915
-Just wait.
-So tell me!

197
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,249
What will you do?

198
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,876
-Honey--
-Tell me!

199
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,628
Can we hang up? I have to work.

200
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,296
-I'll call you right back.
-No...

201
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,422
-Hey! Hello?
-[beep]

202
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,882
Don't... He hung up!

203
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,966
He hung up.

204
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,803
Why would she sell the cello? Damn it.

205
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,265
-It's not possible?
-No, sir.

206
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,769
I'm a police officer. A public official.

207
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,853
LOAN COUNSELING

208
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,981
I even have a salary account here.
What do you mean, "no"?

209
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,192
You've already maxed out
your mortgage loan.

210
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,779
-There's a history of defaults...
-Yeah, I know that.

211
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,616
But there's no country where a government
official can't get a loan, no?

212
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,286
It's not us but the country
that's preventing the loan.

213
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,830
We do want to give you one.

214
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,290
Then just give me one.

215
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,794
Hello, good day.

216
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,256
This is Lieutenant Baek Joongsik
from Team 2.

217
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,882
-[woman] Yes?
-Hello.

218
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,926
I'd like to check someone's
immigration records.

219
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,010
May I have the name?

220
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,637
His name is...

221
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,764
Lim Yanggyeong.

222
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,641
His last name's Lim.

223
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,184
Is he on the No Fly List?

224
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,561
No, he's probably not.

225
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,771
Goodness.

226
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,106
Malaysia?

227
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,190
When?

228
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,071
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

229
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,574
Yes, okay. Thank you.

230
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,496
What the hell are you doing?

231
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,498
Excuse me?

232
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,669
What the hell did you do all day?

233
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,297
I did some investigating
and went to the bank.

234
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,090
I did some work here and there.

235
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,844
Why can't police officers
get a loan in this country?

236
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,928
Investigating?

237
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,598
What are you investigating?

238
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,766
Well? Let's hear it.

239
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,436
You know it's strictly confidential.

240
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,563
Hey! Can't you see everyone's working hard

241
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,398
-at crime scenes?
-Sir, I...

242
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,402
Can you lend me five million won? Please?

243
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,029
Or can you take out a loan for me?

244
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,363
I don't have any money.

245
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,698
I can't take out a loan.

246
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,075
Well, good job.

247
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,454
Joongsik...

248
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,706
Did you ask Team 1 to lend you money too?

249
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,750
Is something going on at home?

250
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,169
No, nothing's going on.

251
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,379
You can tell me.

252
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,882
I need to know so I can
consider lending you the money.

253
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,802
You said you were broke.
You can't even get me a loan.

254
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,679
-That's right.
-[Joongsik sighs]

255
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,556
Why can't I get a loan?

256
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,725
-You punk, seriously...
-[phone ringing]

257
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,314
[sighs wearily] Thank you for calling
Hosan Police Station.

258
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,233
This is Lieutenant Baek Joongsik speaking.

259
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,652
[Eunjeong] It's a report
from Hosan Jeil Hospital.

260
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,196
-Hosan Jeil Hospital?
-Yes.

261
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,282
-Is it an emergency?
-Yes.

262
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,076
This is Park Eunjeong from Precinct 2.

263
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,203
-Officer Park Eunjeong.
-Yes.

264
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,040
Yes, I understand. Okay.

265
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,417
Joongsik,

266
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,878
I'm just worried about you.

267
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,297
Tell me if something's wrong
and let me help you.

268
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,715
What if you get into trouble?

269
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,717
How can I cover for you
if I'm in the dark?

270
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,678
I'm going to step out.

271
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,513
Where are you going?

272
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,181
It was an emergency call.

273
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,766
Have a good day.

274
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,979
[sighs]

275
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,648
I'll pay you right back. I promise.

276
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,234
-I just need five million won.
-[man] Let me think about it.

277
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,236
Yeah, I'm sure you need to think.

278
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,404
-Try to think positively--
-[beep]

279
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,410
This is ridiculous.

280
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,039
[phone vibrates]

281
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,085
OUTSTANDING PAYMENT REMINDER

282
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,336
[sighs]

283
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,340
Whatever.

284
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,927
[sighs wearily]

285
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,224
What the hell?

286
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,935
What?

287
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,604
Are you Lieutenant Baek Joongsik?

288
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,230
Officer Park Eunjeong?

289
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,315
Yes!

290
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
Let's go.

291
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,984
Yes, sir!

292
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,612
[Joongsik grunts]

293
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,238
By the way,

294
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,656
you can't sneak up like that.

295
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,035
My left atrium is enlarged and weak.

296
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,580
HOSAN JEIL HOSPITAL

297
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,876
I, too, had an arrhythmia
when I was young.

298
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,794
The doctor said I needed surgery.

299
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,088
But my grandmother said
it was too dangerous.

300
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,715
She made me tomato juice with kale,

301
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,675
and I drank it twice a day.

302
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,719
It was really hard to get kale back then,

303
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,472
so we grew our own in the yard.

304
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,807
It tastes terrible,

305
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,101
-but it was so effective.
-[elevator dings]

306
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,145
I'm careful with my heart even now,

307
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,231
but my medical check-up results say
there's no problem.

308
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,692
So I think it's really effective!

309
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,737
Just to be safe,
I still drink it once a day--

310
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,614
So, Officer Park,

311
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,908
you're quite sociable, aren't you?

312
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,619
You're right! My mom has seven siblings.

313
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,621
So, for generations, my mom--

314
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,247
-Are we there yet?
-She... What?

315
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,832
Which room is it? Go ahead.

316
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,085
Right. Yes, sir! It's this way!

317
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,588
[Eunjeong] The anesthesia
should wear off in an hour,

318
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,716
but he lost a lot of blood,
so it could take longer.

319
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,678
Other than losing an ear,
he's fine, right?

320
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,555
A man piggybacked him here.

321
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,349
They said he was covered in blood.

322
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,602
But he left without filing a report?

323
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,855
[doctor] Yes, we performed emergency
treatment because he bled a lot.

324
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,192
However, the cut off wound
seemed abnormal.

325
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,902
How so?

326
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,571
If it were an accident,
it would've been torn

327
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,700
or ripped from being crushed
by a heavy object, usually.

328
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,868
But this patient's case is different.

329
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,954
I think his ear was cut off intentionally.

330
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,164
As if it were cut like meat by a butcher.

331
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,374
It was a clean cut.

332
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,750
Cut meat?

333
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,839
[keyboard clacking]

334
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,550
[security personnel] Here.

335
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,760
Let's see.

336
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,181
Stop!

337
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,308
What's that?

338
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,601
Right there!

339
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,813
Right there!
There's something in his hand.

340
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,606
Can you zoom in on that?

341
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,025
[laughs] He can't.

342
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,277
You can't zoom in on security footage.

343
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,653
You can.

344
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,781
You can?

345
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,992
[Joongsik] Oh, you can.

346
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
[Eunjeong] It's an ear!

347
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,537
Let's see.

348
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,748
Officer Park.

349
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,125
The man who cut the ear off...

350
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,545
piggybacked the victim here,
showing he did it.

351
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,881
Does that make sense to you?

352
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,591
Does it? And another thing...

353
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,261
He should've left it to sew it back on.
Why would he take it?

354
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,097
Right? Don't you find it odd too?

355
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,933
Do you have security cameras
in the parking lot?

356
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,560
Yes, we do.

357
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,895
That's enough.

358
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,313
-Just a moment.
-Stop it.

359
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,647
[Eunjeong chuckles]

360
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,067
-There!
-Here it is.

361
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,235
[Eunjeong] There he is. Lieutenant, look!

362
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,447
[Eunjeong exclaims]

363
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,159
[Eunjeong gasps]

364
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,214

I mean, what's the point of going there?

370
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,707
You know that even if we file the report,

371
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,960
the assault will only end in fines.

372
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,504
It's already been reported,

You already checked the vehicle details,
so what are you saying?

Wait, who did the vehicle check?
I'm at the scene. Who filed the report?

What if he wakes up?

389
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,459
We'll need someone here to investigate.

510

and he dropped this.

511
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,081

00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,619
No, it's not that.

902
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,414
What's the Wi-Fi password?

903
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,375
I have to watch something,

904
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,544
but all the networks are secured. Damn.

905
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,213
This one.

906
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:42,427
Wait...

907
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,515
What's his deal?
He just left without telling me.

908
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,476
[man 1] My shoulder hurts so bad.

909
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,810
[man 2] Let us go home.

910
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,021
[woman 1] I have to go home
and make dinner.

911
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,316
[man 3] Are we done? Can I go?

912
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,693
-[man 4] I didn't take any money!
-[Joongsik] Just wait!

913
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,030
[Juho] You're all done.

914
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,533
Sign here. Yeah.

915
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,661
All I did was broadcast.

916
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,995
-Yes.
-I didn't take any money.

917
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,080
You may go.

918
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,164
-I can?
-Yes.

919
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,796
Goodbye.

922
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,227
[woman 2] I can't stay.

923
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,436
[man 6] I can't.

924
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,523
Joongsik, there's another video!

925
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,441
It's out!

926
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,693
It's out!

928
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,906
-[man 7] He's streaming!
-[woman 3] What is it this time?

929
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,950
-[man 8] Turn it up.
-[woman 3] Turn the volume up!

930
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,493
[Dongjin] Wait a second.

931
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,080
[Masked Man] Guys.

932
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,291
-It's me.
-Excuse me.

933
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,334
The news said
it was a hundred million won.

934
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,253
Those who saw it in person must know.

935
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,381
I gave away exactly one billion won.

936
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,550
So to all the idiots
posting stupid comments,

937
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,968
I hope you stop.

938
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,429

Kim Gukho?

943
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,034
[woman 4] What?
Is he already being released?

944
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,829
[Masked Man] There. The next target is
Kim Gukho, age 49.

945
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,456
I'm sure everyone knows.

946
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,374
The younger kids can look him up.

947
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,335
He's currently in jail.

948
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,171
He's scheduled to be released
in three days.

949
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,631
Then what are the stakes?

950
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,307
Drum roll, please.

It's 20 billion won?

954
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,359
[woman 5] Seriously? Are you joking?

955
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,778
[man 9] What?
Did a billion won make sense then?

956
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,112
[indistinct chatter]

957
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:10,450
[Masked Man] Wait, are you all arguing
about whether or not I'll really pay you?

958
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,036
Fuck, believe me if you want or don't.

There it is. Kill Kim Gukho,
and I'll give you 20 billion won.

968
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:53,076
I don't care how you kill him,
but I'd wish you do it in style.

I'll give you the money

Just in case,

tell him not to kill himself.

I'll double it on the next round.
