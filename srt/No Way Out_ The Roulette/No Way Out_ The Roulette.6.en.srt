00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,526
Kim Gukho's been kidnapped.

363
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,736
Control the entrance!

364
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,904
[shouts] We have to catch him!

365
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,865
[Juho] Hey, Joongsik!

366
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,950
Joongsik!

367
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,495
[Juho exclaims]

368
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,372
[Suchang] When's it coming down?

369
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,749
Follow me! Let's use the stairs!

370
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,168
[Juho] This isn't it!

371
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,253
It's here!

372
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,672

373
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,882
[people clamoring]

374
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,429
[Suchang] Move, please move.

375
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,474
[Juho] Let's go!

376
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,940
What's going on?

377
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,900
The basement... The parking lot! Radio it!

378
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,902
It's the basement parking lot!

379
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,946
-[Juho] This way!
-[Suchang yells] The basement parking lot!

380
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,674
[engine starts]

381
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,845
-It's that car!
-There!

382
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,138
Juho, hurry up!

383
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,556
[tires screeching]

384
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,351
[tires screeching]

385
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,686

-Hey!

388
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,298
-[air hissing]

[tires screech]

390
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,220
-What's wrong with this?
-What?

391
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,346
Damn it!

392
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,934
What's going on? Damn it!

393
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,393
[Gukho moans]

394
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,068
[sirens blaring]

395
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,162
Hey! That's not it!

396
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,413
Hey, over there!

397
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,583
[Juho] Shit!

398
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,635
It's over there!

399
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,886
Over there!

400
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,763
Damn it! Stop right there, asshole!

401
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,268
[Juho panting]

402
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,564
I mean, that's why...

403
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,732
That's why...

404
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,318
you should find the car,
not the car owner!

405
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,321
What idiot would shoot a gun
in broad daylight,

406
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,156
and drive his own car, you punk?

407
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,702
You punk!

408
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,287
I told you not to touch that!

409
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,002
Yeah, go out now.
From hospitals to the City Hall.

410
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,086
Yeah.

411
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,423
Check security footage
of the traffic control, buildings, banks.

412
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,592
That's how we'll find his route!

413
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,228
[Suchang] He went in but didn't come out?

414
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,563
Yes, sir.

415
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,481
Any other exits for vehicles?

416
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,858
No, sir.

417
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,192
The rest area here.

418
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,611
Are there any exits there?

419
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,654
There's one for employees who commute,

420
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,031
but it's a walking path.

421
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,074
So you're saying there's no footage

422
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,743
-of him leaving there?
-Yes, sir.

423
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,536
Let's go.

424
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,622
-Why?
-Come on.

425
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,794
[reporter on radio] Let's hear
from the scene. Reporter Hwang Jangmi?

426
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,173
Yes, the shooting incident
around 5:00 p.m. today

427
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,966
resembled a battlefield

428
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,470
and was chaotic and hellish
according to the witnesses.

429
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:14,182
Fortunately, the area around the hospital
is settling under police control.

430
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,645
What the hell is going on?

431
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,682
[Suchang] Joongsik, there.

432
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,215
[Suchang] This is the car, right?

433
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,767
Fuck!

434
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,062
He didn't kill Kim Gukho.

435
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,440
He just took him, right?

436
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,150
Joongsik, let's split up.

437
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,403
I'll wrap things up here.
You go search the outskirts.

438
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,571
Okay.

439
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,367
Shit.

440
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,539
[Sangbong grunting]

441
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,681
[Mr. Smile] You know,

442
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:23,227
it's tough enough to cut your wrist,
so don't do that.

443
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,729
[Sangbong speaking unintelligibly]

444
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,068

[Byeongmin and Myeongja gasp]

447
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,245
[in English] Hey! Whoa!

448
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,372
Please don't do this.
Put the gun down, man!

449
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,876
She's a client! Client.

450
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,296
[Byeongmin sighs in relief]

451
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,380
Thank you.

452
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,927
-[exclaims] You are fucking impressive.
-[Byeongmin chuckles]

453
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,097
You took him out amidst the chaos?
[chuckles]

454
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,431
[Byeongmin in Korean] Very impressive.

455
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,977
What's your name again? Mr. Smile?

456
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,314
Hmm.

457
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,734
[Myeongja in English] Good job!
Good fucking job!

458
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,279
Money first. Sorry.

459
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,699
[chuckles]

460
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,451
[in Korean] This asshole's difficult.

461
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,954
[Myeongja in English] Okay.

462
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,872
[in Korean] Sure, this is business too.

463
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,668
Byeongmin, check the goods and pay him.

464
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,921
[in English] Hey, did you bring it?

465
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,675
All right.

466
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,270
[voice recording] You'll receive
200 million won every year.

467
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,272
A total of one billion in five years.

468
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,860
It'll be untraceable cash.
So don't worry about taxes.

469
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,695
There are no other conditions.

470
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,198
Don't come near Hosan City for five years.

471
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,284
[Byeongmin in Korean] I've checked it.

472
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,333
[Gukho speaking unintelligibly]

473
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,466
You socially maladjusted piece of shit.
You were so disrespectful.

474
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,385
You should've known your place.

475
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,637
Right? [yells] Hey!

476
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:25,057
Someone who's as filthy as you
should just be executed!

477
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,436
Using taxpayers' money to send you
to prison won't fix you at all!

478
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,107
[Myeongja sighs]

479
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,903
[Sangbong gasps]

480
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,656
Poor thing. You seem to be so scared.

481
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,950
-Yes.
-So you should've chosen

482
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,161
your enemies wisely, asshole.

483
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,954
-Yes, ma'am.
-Any copies?

484
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,831
There are none.

485
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,750
That's everything.

486
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,503
I swear, Mayor Ahn.

487
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,422
I swear...

488
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,674
I deleted all of the messages too.

489
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:04,096
This is all because of this socially
maladjusted psycho piece of shit.

490
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,807
-[Myeongja laughs]
-I put you through so much, Mayor Ahn.

491
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,727
Now! Tell him to shoot!

492
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,895
What? Right now?

493
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,813
[in English] Shoot him!

494
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,815
-[in Korean] Shoot!
-[in English] Don't shoot!

495
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,234
-Shoot him!
-[Sangbong] Don't!

496
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,194
[laughs maniacally]

497
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,862
[shouts in Korean] I have proof!

498
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,531
I have proof! I do.

499
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,824
I have a backup file!

500
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,534
Are you going to kill me?

501
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,579
If you do, everything will be exposed
to the world!

502
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,872
-Got it?
-[in English] Shut the mouth!

503
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,624
Shoot him!

504
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,252
[in English] Don't! Hey! Don't shoot!

505
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,504
I have ten million. Okay?

506
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,673
-I'll give you double!
-Shut the mouth!

507
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,383
-What's she giving you?
-[Myeongja] Shoot him!

508
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,509
Don't shoot...

509
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,760
[gun fires]

510
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,888
Whoa...

[breath trembling]

513
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,239
[Myeongja] Wait! Stop.

514
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,324
[in Korean] Give me the gun.

515
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,909
[in English] Give me the gun.

516
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,577
Okay? Give me the gun.

517
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,747
[in Korean] Give the gun to me.
I'm going to shoot him.

518
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,332
Okay? Come on.

519
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,167
I mean, if you shoot him...

520
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,961
-Hey, hey!
-Whoa!

521
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,045
[in English] Hey.

522
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,265
[Byeongmin sighs] Thank you. Okay.

523
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
Whoa!

Wow... This is heavy.

00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,855
[Byeongmin in Korean] Yeah.

526
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,778
Mr. Kim Gukho,

527
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,489
I was professional.

528
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,491
You know that, right?

529
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,952
You brought this upon yourself.

-Byeongmin, we secured the final payment.
-[Byeongmin] Right.

535
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,721
Either way, we were uncertain
about him anyway.

536
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,223
-Keeping him alive won't do any good.
-You're right.
