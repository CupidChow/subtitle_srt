So did you find him or not?

110

to the fullest extent possible.

how do you view this, Ms. Han?

That's not how the law works, does it?

160
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,577
Even if they consider it
an act of terrorism,

161
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,995
will the prosecutor say,

162
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,247
"Sure, go ahead"?

163
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,333
Even if they spoke with the prosecution,

00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,459
what about the courts?

the prosecution and the courts,

169
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,013

Wouldn't that be a bigger problem?

A chief of a police station

173
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,564
would say something like that
for two reasons.

174
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,567
One is to instill fear in the public

175
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,194
to prevent any crime attempts beforehand.

176
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,404
What about the second?

177
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,282
They want to show the higher-ups

178
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,909

in religious activities.

184
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,915
He even did volunteer work.

185
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,462
And he's quite amiable, so he got along
well with the prison staff.

186
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,964
Due to the nature of our prison,

187
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,800
there are many violent offenders
and issues to consider.

188
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,387
But inmates like Kim Gukho...

189
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,015
How should I put it? He was cooperative.

190
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,643
He didn't give us a reason to worry.

191
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,228
He made things easy for us.

192
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,483
Aren't you sad
we can't play baduk anymore?

193
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,739
What? Are you crying?

194
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,659
Call me when you're out, okay?

195
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,827
I'll buy you a drink.

Sir,

199
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,152
is this how you detach?

200
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,446
Why is everyone so cold to me?

201
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,865
You're upset, aren't you?

202
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,992
Sign it.

203
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,453
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,262
Let's go.

206
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,233
Warden, hello.

207
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,461
I'm Detective Jang Suchang.

208
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,837
I'm Kim Gukho.

209
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,009
My team will escort you home, Mr. Kim.

210
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,511
And I'm in charge.

211
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
Escort me?

212
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,849
It means we're going
to take you home safely.

213
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,935
Safely?

214
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,853
I can go by myself. Thank you.

215
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,063
[Joongsik scoffs]

216
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,399
Just do as we say.

217
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,486
We'll explain later.

218
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,071
[Joongsik] Look.

219
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,074
There are a lot of people outside

220
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,284
who came to see you. Do you know why?

221
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,704
They're here to kill you.

222
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,456
So,

223
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,750
don't mess around and get in the car.

224
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
With your head down. Got it?

225
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,550
Detective...

226
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,762
I served my time.

227
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,098
That doesn't get rid of your crimes!

228
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,225
Moron.

229
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,355
Don't...

230
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,898
Don't smirk, you bastard.

231
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,650
[Suchang] That's enough!

232
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
Hey.

00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,070
[Gwangil] Mister...

234
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,656
Wear this.

235
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,368
Put this hat on.

236
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,953
The mask too.

237
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,037
Put this on.

238
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,207
-I'm fine.
-Hey!

239
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,626
Just put it on, you son of a bitch!

What's going on?

243
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,973
[Juho] Where are you?

244
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,516
[Dongjin] I'm sorry,
I'm at the front gate.

245
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,727
There are too many people. I can't get in.

246
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,063
He can't get in because of the people.

247
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,817
Forget it. Tell him we're coming.

248
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,361
[Juho] Wait there, we're coming down.
Okay.

249
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,169
[Joogsik] Hey,

250
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,505
put your head down.
Look at my heels and follow me.

251
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,758
Don't talk to anyone else.

Hey, Joongsik!

-Crap.

-I can't see anything.
-[Suchang] What are they doing!

265
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,574
A hell of a welcome party.

266
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,118
-Hey, let's go.
-Yes, sir.

[siren blaring]

268
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,052
We briefly watched the tense scene
at Kim Gukho's release.

269
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:37,473
Citizens demand that he be prevented
from entering society, and kept isolated.

270
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,016
Would that be possible?

271
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,810
Currently, there's no legal basis
to enforce that.

272
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,606
Further coercive measures
aren't possible even for offenders

273
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,776
who commit heinous crimes
once their sentence has been served.

274
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,653
Institutionally, it's disappointing.

275
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,824
Think about our children having to live

276
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,160
in the same area
as these violent offenders.

277
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,205
Ms. Han, did you just say
it is a disappointing aspect?

278
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,372
It is.

279
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,707
[sighs]

280
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,711
The problem isn't
the law or the system right now.

281
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,589
Of course, the citizens are allowed
to speak up.

282
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,257
But on the other hand,

283
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,176
the bigger problem is those

284
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,804
who hire killers, offer money,
and post requests

285
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,348
resembling murder threats on the internet.

286
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,226
Do you know what the Internet
is calling Kim Gukho now?

287
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,520
"A walking bonus"!

288
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,230
"A twenty-billion-won bank account"!

289
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,358
No matter how notorious this criminal is,

290
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,526
shouldn't we avoid

291
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,986
legitimizing threats
to an individual's life

292
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,280
beyond legal punishment?

293
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,032
[anchor] Yes, well...

294
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,451
Please note that the opinions expressed

295
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,038
are those of the individual guests
and do not reflect SBY's official stance.

296
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,458
[reporter on TV] Kim Gukho has been
released after serving 13 years in prison.

297
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,876
Here's the recap.

298
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,923
When Kim appeared in front of the facility
under police protection,

299
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,843
the citizens' protest
against his release became

300
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,469
even more intense.

301
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:01,348
As Kim tried to reach the escort vehicle,

302
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,642
some protestors attempted to block him

303
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,436
and engaged in a fierce confrontation
with the police.

304
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,149
Despite an unusual press conference
by the chief of police,

305
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,152
an attempt to kill him
occurred upon Kim's release.

306
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,530
Kim is currently
in a special escort vehicle

307
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,323
-and have left the scene.
-How much?

308
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
It's 11,000 won.

309
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,994
[reporter on TV]
Despite the attempted attack,

310
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,121
-Here you go.
-the atmosphere at the scene

311
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,749
still reflects a strong voice of anger
against Kim's return to society.

312
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,210
Let me repeat myself...

313
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,297
Kim Gukho was released
at around 10:00 this morning,

314
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,632
and is on his way to his home
in Hosan City.

315
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,563
"I deeply reflected
on all of my past crimes

316
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,816

00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,528
"I sincerely apologize
to the citizens of Hosan

"who feel uneasy and anxious
about my release."

[laughs]

320
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,951
But who wrote this?

321
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,998
He wrote it, didn't he? Right?

322
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,209
[chuckles]

323
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,962
What's so funny, you bastard?

324
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,090
What did I do wrong?

325
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,510
Why is everyone on my back?

326
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,305
There's a twenty-billion bounty
on your head.

327
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,182
Don't you get it?

328
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,226
What, 20 billion?

329
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,436
Twenty billion won?

330
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,525
That's ridiculous. Stop messing around.
[laughing]

331
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,406
What is it?

332
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,826
What's with this vibe?

333
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,955
It must be true.

334
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:55,420
Is that why the welcome party
was a mess? [laughing]

335
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,924
[Gukho continues laughing]

336
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,343
But why? Who?

337
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
Oh.

338
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,558
It's been so long that you forgot?

339
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,228
Do you want me to remind you?

340
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,233
-I bet you were bad at school.
-What?

341
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,568
There are laws in our society.

342
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,280
The court made a ruling,

343
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,116
and I served 13 years
in accordance with it.

344
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,494
I did what I was told.

345
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,955
What did I do wrong?

346
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,374
-You piece of shit.
-[Gukho] Come on.

347
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,627
Let's not curse at one another.

348
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,714
According to the law, I'm a free man.

349
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,798
The police...

350
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,427
probably don't have the right
to restrict my freedom.

351
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,220
The right?

352
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,848
Did I hear you correctly?

00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,190
-Hey, wait! Stop!
-That's enough!

356
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,442
-You little...
-Joongsik.

00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,818

I swear to God!

359

[Suchang] Mr. Kim Gukho,

360
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,656
stop complaining and memorize it.

361
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,950
Don't get a single word wrong.

362
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,539
[Gukho] Sushi!

363
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,791
Let's eat some sushi.

364
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't remember how it tastes.

365
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:20,213
Let's get sushi for dinner.
I'll read all of this. [laughs]

366
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,715
[sighs in disbelief]

367
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,801
[indistinct chatter]

368
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,636
KIM GUKHO, LEAVE!

369
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,555
[protestor] He's not a criminal!
He's the devil!

370
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,265
Kim Gukho is likely to kill again!

371
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,225
We don't want him in Hosan!

372
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,269
How could they release a devil?

373
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,570
What are you doing?

374
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,949
What the hell?

375
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,202
Watch the feathers.

376
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,668
Why are there so many people here

377
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,004
creating a fuss in the neighborhood?

378
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,050
[reporter] I think the vehicle
transporting Kim Gukho is approaching.

379
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,845
I will continue to report
the details at the scene.

380
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,767
[man 2] You evil bastard!

381
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,477
Damn you! Hey!

382
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,561
[crowd clamoring]

383
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,993
[man 3] You piece of shit!

384
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,328
You're no human!

385
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,746
How dare you come here?

386
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,040
[woman 1] You're no better
than a beast! Die!

387
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,667
-[officer] Hey!
-[woman 2 gasping]

388
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,003
[man 4] What kind of country
protects rapists?

389
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,172
[man 5] Kick him out of this neighborhood!

390
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,674
GUKHO, WE'RE WATCHING YOU

391
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,093
[woman 3] Execute Kim Gukho!

392
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,137
[man 6] Kim Gukho, kill yourself!

393
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,098
[Joongsik] Hey, wait...

394
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,351
SEND KIM GUKHO TO HELL

395
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,230
Standing here...

396
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,403
has made me realize that I never
had a chance to apologize like this.

397
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,573
I wish I had had...

398
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,909
this opportunity sooner.

399
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,994
[man 7] Yeah, right!

400
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,623
[Gukho] I know it's too late,

401
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,168
but I would like...

402
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,213
to apologize to the victims

403
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,383
and their families who have suffered

404
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,136
because of me...

405
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,474
for many years.

406
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,517
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,565
[Gukho exhales]

408
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,317
[Gukho sobbing]

409
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,526
[camera shutters clicking]

410
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,820
[Gukho] I was told...

411
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,699
that people can't be fixed.

412
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,036
I know...

413
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,333
that a mere 13 years
can't wash away all my sins.

414
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,086
[crying]

415
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,677
I don't know how much time I have left,

416
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,430
but I promise...

417
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,016
to live the rest of my life

418
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,143
in this painful hell!

419
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,854
I sincerely apologize!

420
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:23,980
[wailing]

421
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,107
[Gwangil] Hey.

422
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,442
-Get up.
-[Gukho] I'm sorry!

423
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,444
I'm sorry!

424
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,112
-I'm sorry.
-Let's go.

425
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,948
[indistinct chatter]

426
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,080
[inspector] In accordance with the Act
on the Attachment of Electronic Devices,

427
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:43,750
tampering, removal, or any damage will
be punished accordingly.

428
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,961
Your location will be tracked 24/7,

429
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,797
and personnel will accompany you
when you go out.

430
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,925
Here. Read the notice.

431
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,802
I've been thinking,

432
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,388
isn't it me who needs protection?

433
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,057
-Excuse me?
-Think about it.

434
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,685
If there's a bounty of 20 billion won
on my head,

435
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,312
aren't I in more danger than those kids?

436
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,022
I mean,

437
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,649
why are you keeping a watch on me?

438
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,360
You should be protecting me.
Aren't I right?

439
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,238
Well?

440
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,739
[Joongsik] Good grief.

441
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,452
I should do what I'm told.

442
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,996
-Just write my name?
-[inspector] Yes.

443
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,124
Nothing will happen
as long as you cooperate with the police.

444
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,501
Officers will be on standby
around the clock.

445
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,795
There are troops deployed around the area.

446
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,756
Don't cops need money too?

447
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,258
Excuse me?

448
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,594
I just think...

449
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,096
cops will be the most dangerous.

450
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,056
-[Juho] Damn it.
-Especially, him.

451
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,808
-What are you looking at?
-Hey.

452
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,352
How can you swallow that right now?

453
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,354
-That asshole.
-[Juho] Hey, let's go. Don't.

454
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,023
-Ignore him.
-[Joongsik] How could he eat that?

455
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,107
[Juho] Hey, let's just go.

456
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,276
[Suchang] Mr. Kim Gukho,

457
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,320
I understand,

458
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,365
but if you can't trust us,
you'll be in even more danger.

459
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,118
This will die down in a few months

460
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,495
or even in a few weeks.

461
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,080
You know that.

462
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,250
People's interests don't last long.

463
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,835
But this situation...

464
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,464
The situation doesn't seem good.

465
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,779
[reporter on radio] Today's next story...

466
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,531
A masked man picks targets
and spins a roulette wheel

467
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,200
to pick the act and the reward.

468
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,995
He has put a hit out on Kim Gukho
as the next target

469
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,289
on his personal broadcast channel.

470
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:50,168
Amidst that, Kim Gukho has been released
from prison after 13 years.

471
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,588
There was an incident
involving protestors and assailants

472
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,964
during the police escort,

473
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,218
but Kim has returned to his home
in Hosan City

474
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,970
and is currently wearing
an electronic ankle monitor.

475
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,809
As negative public opinion grows
regarding Kim's early release,

476
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,436
a group of protestors continue
to demonstrate

477
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,771
and maintain their sit-in

478
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,606
near Kim's house.

479
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,317
The protestors claim

480
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,945
that the police are overprotecting Kim.

481
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,783
Hosan City police announced
that they'll consider any harmful actions

482
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,161
caused by the anonymous murder request
against Kim

483
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,706
as acts of terrorism,
and stated they will spare no efforts

484
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,999
to respond on their honor.

485
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,752
They also announced

486
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,173
that they will have police forces
guard Kim's residence around the clock

487
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,969
to protect Kim's safety
and prioritize the safety of the citizens.

488
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,807
According to internal sources,
Hosan City police

489
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,810
are making efforts to prevent
private broadcast transmissions

490
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,813
and exerting full efforts
to apprehend the suspect...

491
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,148
"FROM: KIM GUKHO"

492
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,692

remains unidentified.

00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,692
Why didn't you take your medicine?

497
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,944
I did earlier.

498
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,821
No, you didn't.

499
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,032
It's still there.

500
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,494
I'll put the chocolate beside your pills.

501
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,245
Just eat one.

502
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,956
After you take your medicine.

[Donggyu sobs]

504
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,589
If I...

505
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,468
don't come home,

506
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,430
you have to call the social worker.

507
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,349
Okay?

508
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,142
I'm not a fool.

509
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,061
Of course not.

510
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,356
My husband is so smart.

[♪intense music playing]

516
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,689
I'm out here on this cold day

517
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,441
because of Kim Gukho.

518
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,695
Come on, guys.
I'm not out here to make money.

519
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,364
I'm doing this for justice!

520
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,411
What? Such an expensive car
in this neighborhood?

521
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,252
Let's go.

522
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,892
-Hi.
-[Juho] You called this morning, right?

523
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,393
Yes, I'm Seo Yeonju's attorney.

00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,477
Yes, hello.

525
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,147
Just to be safe, I'll be with you.
Let's go in.

526
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,265
What?

527
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,267

It's been a while.

[Gukho chuckles]

530
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,194
-Come on. Let me hug you.
-Mr. Kim, you can't do this.

531
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,614
-Who are you?
-I'm Seo Yeonju's attorney.

532
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,658
Attorney?

533
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,499
Who gave you permission
to come into my home?

534
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,960
I sent this to you in prison,
but there was no reply.

535
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,503
I asked the prison about it,

536
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,255
they said you refused
letters and visitation.

537
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,549
-Yeah, well. It just happened that way.

-What about the kid?
-These are divorce papers.

539
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,056
No alimony or other conditions,
only custody rights.

540
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,392
His father comes home after years,

541
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,894
and he doesn't even show up.
What an ingrate.

542
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,980
You know you'll be at a disadvantage

543
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,898
-if you take this to court.
-You fucker!

544
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,526
The adults are talking right now!

545
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,695
How dare you interrupt? You piece of shit!

546
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,154
-Stop it.
-Hey.

547
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,948
You think I won't stab an attorney?

548
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,449
Are you bulletproof?

549
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,951
-[Juho] Don't do it.
-[Gukho] Well?

550
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,411
You should watch what you say.

551
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,454
It could be used against you in court.

552
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,539
What?

553
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,918
You fucking asshole.
You don't think I'll do it?

554
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,004
Do you want me to prove it?

555
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,089
-How dare you?
-Don't worry.

556
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,758
-I knew it!
-[Gukho] Come here!

557
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,343
Come here, fucker!

558
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,303
-You piece of shit! Come here!
-[Juho] Stop it!

559
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,931
Let go of me! Why should I stop?
You asshole!

560
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,599
He's drunk. Come back later.

561
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,685
-[Juho] Stop it!
-Okay, fine.

562
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
[Yeonju] Dongha...

563
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,564
said he doesn't need a father.

564
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,482
So don't look for him.

565
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,067
I came to tell you that.

566
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,610
-You little...
-Hey!

567
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,571
Hey, that's enough. Stop!

568
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,655

Fuck.

572
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,172
Did you only think about running away
while I was in jail?

573
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,760
Did you meet another man
and spread your legs for him?

574
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,429
[Gukho laughs] It must've been
fucking nice.

575
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,308
Damn it.

576
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,810
Hey!

577
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,481
Running away with my kid?

578
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,566
Fuck you, bitch.

579
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,612
That bitch.

580
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,697
[Juho] That's enough now.

581
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,491
[Gukho] Come and have a drink.

Yes, that's right.

00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,377
Murder?

589
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,837
She killed herself...

590
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,175

Excuse me. What are you doing?

596
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,132
What?

Why can't you keep him under control?

He keeps saying he'll go outside.
He's drunk.

661
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,529
Go where? Where do you want to go?
It's late.

00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,994
Do I need to tell you
every little thing, Detective?

Don't you know about privacy?

But you're drunk.
So just go to bed. Don't make a scene.

We don't have that here.

Okay, fine.

you have three minutes to shop and pay,
got it?

00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,422

-Gwangil, stay by him.
-Okay.

714
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,924
Don't worry.

-[crowd clamoring]
-[man yelling indistinctly]

716
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,989
Ma'am, you can't go inside right now.

717
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,199
-Wait three minutes.
-No.

718
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,117
I have diabetes.

719
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,161
My blood sugar is low. I need chocolate.

720
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,580
-I need to buy chocolate!
-Buy it quickly!

721
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,458
[streamer] The police are ignoring
our right to know!

722
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,220
Pay before you eat it!

723
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,846
Mister!

724
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,534
You have two minutes left.

725
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,912
Fuck, you're so detached.

726
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,211
[Joongsik] What...

727
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,299
Is this new?

728
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,093
Damn.

729
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,567
Hometown Dumplings.

730
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,865
-[gun fires]
-What? [gasps]

731
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,452
[Joongsik] What the hell was that? Hey!

732
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,578
[Gukho yelping]

733
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,787
What the fuck was that?

734
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,539
-[gun fires]
-[Gukho gasps]

735
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
Ma'am?

736
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,544
[Gukho] Get her!

737
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,589
-[Joongsik grunts]
-[Gukho groans]

738
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,424
[gun fires]

739
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,635
[Gukho groans] What the hell was that?

740
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,304
-[officers grunting]
-[Gukho] Fuck! What was that?

741
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,388
[Gwangil groans]

742
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,765
-[Miok straining]
-[Joongsik] Don't move.

743
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,600

-[Miok screams]

744
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,059
[Miok grunts]

745
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,311
What is this!

746
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,856
Don't move. Kid, are you okay?

747
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,483
It grazed me. I'm fine.

748
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,609
[Gukho grunts]

749
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:19,902
Fuck you.

750
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:20,986
Hey, officer!

751
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,449
Fuck!

752
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,909

753
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,702
-[officer] Yes, sir.
-Take her.

754
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,662
[Miok breathing heavily]

755
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,164
Let's go.

756
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,665
Hey, hold her.

757
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,251
You deserve to die!

758
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,920
[Gwangil] Take her out of here!

759
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,214
[crying] Please, just die!

760
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,298
[Gwangil] Goodness!

761
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,175
[Gukho straining]

762
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,510
Hey!

763
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,094
What's wrong with you?

764
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,305
What the... What's wrong with you?

765
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,098
Hey! Kid!

766
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,725
What's wrong with you?

767
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,685
Call an ambulance! Now!

768
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,771
Hey, look at me.

769
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,023
-Keep your eyes on me.
-[Dongjin grunts]

770
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,358
Call them now!

771
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,902
[strained breathing]

772
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,532
[man 1] He's hurt?

773
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,741
[man 2] He's out!

774
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,618
[man 3] What's going on? He's fine.

775
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,745
[woman] Oh, no.
I think a detective's hurt!

776
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,581
[crowd clamoring]

777
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,089
Kid, I'll see you soon!

778
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,147
Tell me.

779
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,067
Was there something on the arrows?

780
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,027
Come on, tell me.

781
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,158
Why didn't you say anything after?
The kid got hurt!

782
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,578
Hey!

783
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,169
Stop fucking filming!

784
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,921
You think this is fun?

785
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,428
She's the family of victim Lee Minjin,

786
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,722
who was killed by Kim Gukho 13 years ago.

787
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,182
Damn it.

788
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,145
She's in the late stage of liver cancer.

789
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,441
Her husband collapsed
after losing their daughter

790
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,526
and has been mentally ill.

791
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,486
[Joongsik] I mean...

792
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,654
Well...

793
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,158
There's no grave without a sad story.
Damn it... What am I saying?

794
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,577
[Joongsik] What do we do?

795
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,497
[Suchang sighs] Let's go inside.

796
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,190
Ma'am,

797
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,109
we understand how you feel,

798
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,111
but what can we do?

799
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,322
The law is the law.

800
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,910
The officer who was hurt...

801
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,580
Is he okay?

802
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,750
[Suchang exhales]

803
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,087
The pufferfish poison's spread.

804
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,255
He's still unconscious.

805
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,840
Listen, ma'am...

806
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,927
What will your husband do without you?

807
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,513
I hear he's mentally ill.

808
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,306
The living must go on living.

809
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,436
[Joongsik sighs]

810
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,683
Honey, is that you?

811
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,827
TO MS. YOON MIOK

812
