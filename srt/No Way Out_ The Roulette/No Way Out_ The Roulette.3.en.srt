00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,905
I'm sure you already know this,
but there's no set price for Rh-negative.

182
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,450
The price is decent.
Half a billion won isn't expensive.

183
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,911
And you might not get another chance.

184
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,288
I'll pay you within this week.

185
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,375
[commuter 1] Just go! Come on!

186
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,920
-[commuter 2] Let's go! Drive!
-[commuter 3] Come on!

187
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,172
-[commuter 2] God damn it!
-[commuter 1] Let's go!

188
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,300
-[commuter 3] What the hell are you doing?
-[Sangbong] Damn it.

189
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,551
[commuter 4] What are you doing?

190
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,887
[indistinct chatter]

191
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,331
[commuter 2] What's going on?

192
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,415
[commuter 1] What is this?

193
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,708
[commuter 3] What's going on here?

194
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,377
[commuter 1] Move your car!

195
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,674
-[commuter 5] Let's go!
-[commuter 6] Move!

196
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,050
[commuter 4] Why are you doing this?

197
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,427
[Joongsik] Excuse me.

198
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,137
-Keep up the good work.
-Yes, sir.

199
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,473
[crowd protesting loudly]

200
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,141
GUKHO, WE'RE WATCHING YOU

201
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,810
[protestor] Get rid of those
protecting Kim Gukho!

202
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,894
[Joongsik] Juho.

203
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,979
-[Juho] Hey.
-[crowd chanting]

204
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,897
-Did anything happen?
-No.

205
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,067
Hey, I heard you bought an electric car.
Is it nice?

206
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,570
It's so nice. It's so quiet and stable.

207
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,154
Why? Are you in the market?

208
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,491
Maybe I'll get one if I like it
after trying yours for a few days.

209
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,119
Are you crazy? I just bought it. No way.

210
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,914
I'll only know if I drive it.
You can introduce me to your dealer.

211
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,709
[sighs] I haven't even peeled
the plastic yet. Don't be ridiculous.

212
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,294
Show me your keys.

213
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,463
Mine look like this. It's leather...
Did you buy a leather case?

214
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,631
Come on.

215
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,174
-Are there a lot of buttons?
-See.

216
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,509
-Let me see.
-See? Cool, right?

217
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,261
-Neat, right?
-That's what it looks like.

218
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,804
-Hey!
-Just three days.

219
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
I won't be messy.

220
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,141
[Juho] Hey! Don't eat anything in the car!

221
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,225
[Joongsik] Got it!

222

[♪ intense music playing]

223
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,953

outside Kim's house.

[protestors yelling]

225
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,623
As you can see behind me,

226
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,167
security appears to be much tighter

227
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,002

228
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,379

[Joongsik] What's going on?

335
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,252
[Juho] I don't know. He's some attorney.

I'm going to report all of you! Got it?

340
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,306
Here we go again with the bullshit.

341
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,642
Did you just say "bullshit"?

Put him on.

-The attorney guy.

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,616
Why?

349
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,202
Just put him on.
Talking to him isn't illegal.

00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,756
Yes, I'm Kim Gukho.

354
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,591
You say you can help me?

355
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:44,970
Yes, it's about the situation
you are currently in.

356
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,014
Your human rights

357
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,974
are being severely violated.

358
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,309
I don't care about that.

359
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,561
I want to take something from someone.

360
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,645
Is it possible?

361
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,980
I'll make it possible.

362
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,773
What can I help you with, Mr. Kim?

363
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,650
Let's talk inside. Put the detective on.

364
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,735
Okay.

365
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,530
-Send him up.
-What do you mean--

366
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,656
For God's sake.

367
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,283
Why cause trouble? Why?

368
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,285
May I go inside now?

369
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,829
Mister, listen.

370
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,166
I understand why you're doing this,

371
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,626
but think about it again. It's dangerous.

372
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,879
Not him but you. You'll be in danger.

373
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,298
Thank you for your concern.

374
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,883
But I'll take care of myself.

375
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,843
-So must you go in?
-Yes.

376
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,928
Fine, show me your ID.

377
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,305
Search him.

378
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,307
Since we need to be prepared.

379
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,600
-[Gwangil] I'll search you.
-Your ID.

380
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,852
Let's strictly adhere to the law.

381
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,187
Accurately.

382
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,984
[Joongsik] Follow me.

383
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,069
Damn it!

384
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,822
Why cause unnecessary trouble? Why?

385
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,620
[Sangbong clears throat]

386
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,374
[Sangbong exhales]

387
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,799
[Joongsik] Hey.

388
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,594
[Gukho] Hello. Welcome.

389
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,555
I'm Lee Sangbong.

390
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,973
-Go inside quickly now.
-Wait.

391
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,018
Detective, that's far enough. You can go.

392
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,603
What...

393
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,938
It's on me if you die.

394
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,025
Who knows if this man's here to kill you?

395
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,236
[laughs dryly] Come on.

396
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,320
Are you...

397
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,864
here to kill me?

398
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,659
I'm here to save you.

399
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,743
Okay.

400
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,372
Isn't the detective more dangerous?

401
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,041
-Excuse me?
-A detective can't kill?

402
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,251
-What?
-Furthermore,

403
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,836
under the Criminal Procedure Act,

404
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,297
you're violating his right
to legal representation right now.

405
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,300
-[Joongsik sighs in exasperation]
-It's a basic right, isn't it?

406
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,136
-An attorney can--
-Okay, fine.

407
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,096
Make it quick. Got it?

408
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,347
End it quickly!

409
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,434
I like your spirit, Mr. Lee.

410
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,102
All right. Let's get in.

411
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,186
Okay.

412
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,272
Damn it.

413
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,774
[Joongsik] Let's have the meeting later.

414
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,985
Such bullshit.

415
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,069
[Juho] We're fucked.

416
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,904
-What?
-The head of Security

417
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,281
wants to see you tomorrow.

418
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,782
Why?

419
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,992
[Juho] Why do you think?

420
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,827
He had to go to the damn mart!

421
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,911
Hey, where is it?

422
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,037
What are you doing?

423
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,123
My keys. I have to go home tomorrow.

424
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,374
The car? Why?

425
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,917
Why are you being so cheap?

426
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,420
-I'm always cheap. Give it!
-Okay, fine.

427
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,754
-I have to go home.
-Okay.

428
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,131
-Hold this.
-What is it?

429
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,799
-I'll give it tomorrow.
-My keys!

430
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,342
Give me my keys, you jerk!

431
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,303
I can't believe that bastard.

432
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,389
Just go! Damn it.

433
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,159
Is origami your hobby?

434
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,621
My kid used to love the zoo.

435
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,165
I see!

436
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,959
Do attorneys drink instant coffee too?

437
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,544
Of course.

438
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,421
-Thank you.
-Have a seat.

439
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,506
Okay.

440
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm letting you know ahead of time,

441
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,384
I don't have much.

442
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,596
I don't have money to pay you.

443
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,557
[chuckles] I don't need money.

444
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,103
Tell me now if you want something from me.

445
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,607
No, it's not like that.

446
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,651
You came because you want something.

447
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
Nothing in life is free.

448
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,112
[laughs]

449
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,659
Well, I don't want anything right now.

450
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,578
Not right now?

451
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,706
That means you might later.

452
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,174
If there's something I need,

453
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,637
I'll let you know then.

454
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,890
POWER OF ATTORNEY

455
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,562
Okay.

456
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,106
I don't like free stuff either.

457
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,445
Review it carefully and call me.

Who said you could take him outside?

466
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,484
-I'm sorry.
-Fuck that.

467
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,444
Sorry won't fix the damn mess you made.

468
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,196
We played it by the book.

469
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,989
-What did you say?
-I mean,

470
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,741
there's no rule that he can't go out.

471
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,118
You little fucker.

472
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,328
You should've reported it to me!

473
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,372
Does the law say you can do as you want?

474
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,542
Then you can come to the scene
and mark it yourself, Ms. Heo.

475
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,836
We're risking our lives at the scene.

476
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,964
But all you do is send over some officers.

477

What did you say?

478
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,216

00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,583
You got a new car?

536
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,667
With my money?

537
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,340
You son of a bitch. Where are you?

538
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,717
-Where are you?
-You have 48 hours.

539
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,927
Bring all of my money.

540
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,220
-I'm watching you, so no funny business.
-Hey...

541
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,783
Hey, Officer Park.

542
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,493
About Yoon Changjae...

543
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,078
How's his investigation going?

544
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,305
DELINQUENCY NOTICE
TO YOON CHANGJAE

545
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,668
Damn it.

546
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,757
Shit. This place reeks.

547
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,100
Fuck, what the hell?

548
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,811
Who's there?

549
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,482
Fuck. Why won't they move?

550
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,525
What is that?

551
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,528
What is that?

552
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,656
Shit.

553
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,369
27E 1210

554
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,248
[car lock beeps]

555
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,270
[sighs]

556
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,065
PRESSURE COOKER BOMB BLUEPRINT

557
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,608
[streamer on tablet]
Kim Gukho lives to see

558
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,278
another day under police protection.

559
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,113
What did I tell you?

560
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,950
Those bastards who said they'd kill him
are all hiding like cowards!

561
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,913
They said the 20 billion won was theirs
and warned others not to dream of it.

562
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,040
Those attention seekers!

563
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,792
Where are they?

564
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,460
Behind their monitors?

565
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,005
Come on out!

566
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,676
Kim Gukho is still alive at his home
in Hosan City ordering delivery food!

567
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,610
-Is that for Sanga-dong?
-Yes.

568
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,031
Please deliver it before 6:00 p.m.

569
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,240
Okay.

570
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,372
[Gukho] I thought about it
for the past few days.

571
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,374
I'll be honest.

572
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,753
There's no reason for me to lie to you.

573
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,965
So be honest with me too.

574
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,302
That's how we develop trust.

575
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,970
Of course.

576
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,436
As you probably know,

577
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,689
I have a son.

578
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,527
I want to take him back from my wife.

579
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,657
And I need a weapon too.

580
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,244
Is there a way?

581
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,248
Well...

582
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,251
A way... Weapon...

583
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,380
It's not a lawsuit yet, right?

584
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,884
She said she'd sue if I don't sign it.

585
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,845
Fuck.

586
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,475
Her husband comes out
after suffering in prison,

587
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,061
and the first thing
she says to him is "sign it."

588
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,397
[laughing] Fuck.

589
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,275
What a shitty life, right?

590
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,610
Yes, it is.

591
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,861
-Right?
-Yes.

592
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,988
[Gukho laughs]

593
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:05,866
[Gukho] Mmm...

594
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,952
You said you had no money.

595
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,122
You don't have a job.

596
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,332
Having a criminal record

597
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
can be detrimental to a child's education.

598
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,878
That's how the court will see it.

599
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,382
Let' see...

600
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,094
Usually, in cases like this,

601
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,472
you have no chance of winning
if you go to court.

602
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,142
Naturally, you'll lose custody,

603
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,478
and will also
have to pay alimony, usually.

604
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,314
What? Then it's over.

605
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,567
That's why you should avoid court

606
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,861
and try to stall for time.

607
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,447
There's no need
to willingly enter a losing fight

608
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,656
-for us.
-So, what?

609
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,700
Do I sign it or not?

610
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,619
I'm saying we should find the right timing
to enter the fight

611
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,746
so that we can win.

612
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,789
-The right timing?
-Yes.

613
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,250
We need to stall as much as we can,

614
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,128
and we have to find her weakness.

615
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,922
We need to find something
we can use to win.

616
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,508
Did you get a chance

617
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,510
to speak with her attorney?

618
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,387
Did you record it?

619
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,142
Let me explain. [clears throat]

620
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,686
When it comes to civil cases,

621
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,438
there are three ways to win.

622
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,647
The first is a recording.

623
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,815
The second is a recording.

624
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,233
And the third is a recording.

625
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,110
Recordings are very important.

626
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,780
Right...

627
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,533
I don't record anything.

628
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,618
Yeah.

629
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,329
I mean it.

630
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,959
When I come by next time,

631
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,544
I'll bring you a device.

632
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,590
And by nature,
humans are creatures prone to errors.

633
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,550
We always make mistakes.

634
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,471
Everyone makes mistakes.

635
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,475
But what if they don't make any?

636
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,727
We have to make one.

637
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,354
Make it?

638
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,149
Wow.

639
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,652
My attorney...

640
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,696
sure is impressive, eh.

641
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,533
-[chuckles]
-[Gukho laughs]

642
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,996
Everyone has the right
to love their child, right?

643
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,915
"Love"?

644
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,756
You see, the best way to make a baby cry

645
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,677
is to take their favorite toy away.

646
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,431
I can't live when mine's taken away.

647
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,933
It's never happened to me either.

648
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,855
[stutters] Shall we go out?

649
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,356
Where?

650
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,817
No, I mean... Well...

651
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,277
You're in jail.

652
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,820
Don't you feel suffocated?

653
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,196
Let's go out.

654
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
We can get some fresh air.

655
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,867
We can get a drink too.

656
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,326
-Drinks?
-Yes.

657
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,203
[Gukho laughing]

658
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,581
-You like to drink?
-Yes, let's go.

659
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,999
Wait a second.

660
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,421
Can you hear me? Over.

661
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,964
[Juho] What is it now? What?

662
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,133
We're going out. Clear the path.

663
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,470
You're prohibited from leaving.
Orders from above.

664
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,724
Do I have to obey
orders from your superiors? I don't.

665
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,893
-You're prohibited from leaving!
-Let me.

666
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,478
I'll take care of it.

667
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,356
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

668
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,200
He's crazy.

669
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,659
[clears throat]

670
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,665
[Sangbong] Excuse me.

671
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,292
[clears throat]

672
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,337
As of now,

673
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,340
I'm Mr. Kim Gukho's legal representative.

674
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,925
I am Lee Sangbong.

675
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,220
I will strongly respond
to anyone who infringes

676
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,638
upon Kim Gukho's legal rights

677
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,181
-as a citizen.
-Excuse me.

678
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,974
Coming through.

679
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,059
Excuse me.

680
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,019
[Sangbong] Well... Look.

681
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,438
Who was just on the radio?

682
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,233
It was me. What? Why?

683
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,653
You are illegally detaining
and imprisoning my client right now.

684
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,779
[Gukho chuckling]

685
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,489
Mr. Lee,

686
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,825
we're protecting him, not detaining him.

687
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,369
Yes, keep up the good work.

688
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,289
Now, according to Article 12
of Korea's Constitution,

689
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,583
"All citizens
shall enjoy personal liberty."

690
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,752
"No person shall be arrested,

691
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,504
detained, searched,

692
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,674
seized or interrogated
except as provided by law!"

693
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,384
Shall I keep going?

694
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,053
-What the fuck?
-"Fuck"?

695
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,347
[Sangbong] Did you just say "fuck"?

696
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,934
How dare you curse at me?

697
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,561
Did you...

698
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,312
-Look here!
-[Juho] Can't you see

699
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,022
-the shit we're in?
-[Sangbong] "Shit"?

700
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,107
Did you curse again?

701
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,858
-[Juho] Fuck!
-[Sangbong] What do you think

702
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,902
-you're doing?
-[Juho] Hey, stop!

703
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,696
[Sangbong] How dare you curse at me?

704
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,780
What the hell, man?

705
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,949
[Juho] Attorney or whatever,
you follow me!

706
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:02,580
CHECKPOINT

707
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,542
[officer] Stop!

708
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,461
-What is it?
-A delivery.

709
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,672
-Go around. You can't pass through here.
-[woman screams]

710
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,923
[woman] Don't touch me!

711
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,008
[officer] What's going on?

712
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,844
[woman] He keeps touching my body!

713
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,685
[Yeeun on phone] Yes. So, what money?

714
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,521
-The 100 million won I gave you.
-I used it to repay the loan.

715
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,981
You told me to.

716
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,399
It wasn't even that much.

717
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,026
You used it all?

718
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,110
Yes.

719
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,239
What's wrong?
Did you get into trouble again?

720
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,365
No, what trouble?

721
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,450
It's not that.

722
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,410
Joongsik, be straight with me.

723
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,953
It's nothing. I got to go.

724
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,163
-I got it.
-Hey!

725
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,206
What? Did he hang up on me again?

726
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,167
[exhales]

727
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,378
-[commotion in distance]
-[officer] Now!

728
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,466
[Sangbong] What's your name
and department?

729
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,509
[Juho] What if you're an attorney?
Come here!

730
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,720
-[Sangbong] You call yourself a cop?
-[Juho] What will you do?

731
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,430
[Sangbong] What kind
of police officer is this?

732
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,974
[Juho] God damn it.

733
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,019
-[protestor 1] Damn it.
-[protestor 2] What the hell?

734
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,399
[Sangbong] Why are you cursing at me?

735
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,651
[Juho] Hey, you! Wait!

736
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,735
[Juho] Hey, wait!

737
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,445
[delivery person] Yes?

738
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:18,739
[Juho] I'm a police officer. What is this?

739
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,741
-[delivery person] A delivery.
-A delivery?

740
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,451
Why didn't you stop him?

741
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,869
Unbelievable.

742
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,621
We can't have a single easy day.

743
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,875
-Where are you going?
-Sanga-dong 68...

744
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,503
This house? What's inside?

745
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,837
Books.

746
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,923
Books? May I deliver it?

747
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,425
[delivery person] Yes.

748
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,846
[Juho] This is so ridiculous.

749
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,181
-Hey.
-Stop!

750
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,101
-[Sangbong] What are you doing?
-[Juho] What?

751
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,978
When an officially appointed attorney
tried to come in,

752
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:53,023
you thoroughly searched me
and my belongings, didn't you?

753
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,276
Do you know what's in that box?
No, you don't.

754
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,445
What are you people doing?

755
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,240
-Go and bring a metal detector.
-[clicking]

756
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,617
[Sangbong] You should do
what needs to be done!

757
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,702
[Juho] Look here.

758
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,787
Where will I get a metal detector now?

759
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,414
[Sangbong] Then how could you bring this?

760
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,041
-Who knows what's in there?
-[Juho angrily] He said they were books!

761
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,377
[Sangbong] Did you check
to see if they were books?

762
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,170
Are you sure they're books?

763
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,631
So bring the metal detector!

764
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,383
Let's find out!

765
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,969
[Juho] Hey! Bring the metal detector!
Right now!

766
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,846
[Gwangil] Where will I get
a metal detector?

767
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,639
[Juho] Just bring one now!

768
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,516
-[crowd clamoring]
-[clicking]

769
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,775
[crowd clamoring, yelling in distance]

770
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,239
[officer] Clear the path!

771
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,699
Please, clear the path!

772
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,783
Yes, make way!

773
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,584
That's him. That damn attorney.
He keeps making trouble, doesn't he?

774
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,003
God damn it.

775
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,464
[Sangbong] Where is it? Bring it quickly.

776
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,882
I'll check it for you.

777
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,884
[Joongsik] Why does he
keep causing trouble?

778
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,386
Damn it. What's going on? Hey.

779
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,138
What is it?

780
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,349
Why are you out here?

781
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,268
-[Joongsik] Go inside!
-[Gwangil] Hey.

782
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,853
[Joongsik] Why do you keep
causing trouble?

783
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,813
-[Juho] God... This is insane.
-[Joongsik] What is it?

784
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,775
[Juho] He got a package. He wants
to check it with a metal detector.

785
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,109
It needs to be checked!

786
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,527
Go back inside. Block it.

787
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,112
Block it here. Put it back.

788
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,238
Go inside quickly.

789
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,323
Give it here.

790
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,909
Go inside! Don't cause trouble.

791
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,993
Quickly!

792
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,662
[Joongsik] Why do you have to
cause trouble?

793
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,830
[Juho] Go back inside.

794
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,627
Why the... Attorney!

795
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,711
Attorney!

796
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,546
Why would you cause trouble?

797
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,423
Go inside now!

798
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,890
[man] What was that?

799
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,099

802
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,831
[Joongsik] What was that?

803
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,915
[Juho] Hey, are you okay?

804
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,542
Be careful.

805
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,503
It's dangerous.

806
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,713
-Gwangil.
-[Juho] What?

807
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:03,881
-It's dangerous!
-Gwangil!
