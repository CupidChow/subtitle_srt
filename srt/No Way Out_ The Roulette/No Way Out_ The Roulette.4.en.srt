1
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:31,239
THE PLACES, CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

2
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,409
[protestors chanting in distance]

3
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,370
[reporter] Mayor Ahn of Hosan City
has been summoned by the prosecution.

4
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,706
Mayor Ahn Myeongja
established a partnership

5
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,916
with an asset management company
based in Hong Kong

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,877
and created a startup investment fund

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,920
with 280 billion won
of Hosan City's finances.

8
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,006
Multiple civic groups based in Hosan City

9
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,799
have reported to the prosecution

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,470
that the asset management company,
operating the fund, is a shell company.

11
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,181
A representative claimed
the asset management company

12
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,017
is owned under a borrowed name
by the eldest son

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,811
of an assemblyman
who's been elected seven times.

14
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,189
The prosecution has already summoned...

15
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,732
-[crowd clamoring]
-[camera shutters clicking]

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,234
I'll fully cooperate
with the investigation.

17
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,904
[protestors yelling]

18
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,408
OUT WITH THIEF AHN MYEONGJA

19
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,619
TRACK AHN MYEONGJA'S ACCOUNTS

20
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,871
[protestors yelling in distance]

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,590
So the prosecution is saying

22
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,092
that I embezzled funds

23
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,595
intended for investments
in our youth startups.

24
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,763
Is that correct?

25
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,182
Yes, that's right.

26
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,018
Sir,

27
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,229
there are young people dreaming

28
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,232
of becoming the next Bill Gates
or Elon Musk in Hosan City.

29
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,150
Do you know how many?

30
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,152
I'm sure there are a lot.

31
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,239
You've only been
working for the prosecution.

32
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,200
So you wouldn't know
what's going on in the world.

33
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,828
But it really is sad and old-fashioned.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,164
Isn't it our generation's duty
to pave the way

35
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,333
for the young people who dream?

36
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,545
It would help if you thought bigger
as a prosecutor.

37
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,629
[scoffs]

38
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,343
You're right, I don't know
what's going on in the world these days,

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,929
but I am fully aware

40
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:22,725
that the overseas investment institution
is a shell company based in The Bahamas,

41
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,435
which passed through Hong Kong.

42
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,105
Thinking big is a good thing,
but isn't it...

43
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,023
too complicated?

44
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,159
You can't smoke in here.

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,461
I wondered where the media
got their sources.

46
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,755
It was from the prosecution.

47
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,135
Seokhwan, we're alumni.
What year did you graduate?

48
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,555
-Excuse me?
-[Myeongja laughs]

49
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,223
What?

50
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,308
Did I upset you?

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,603
There's no need for formalities here.

52
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,229
You can just call me Myeongja.

53
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,273
Myeongja,

54
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,028
given that 280 billion won
of the city's budget is involved,

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,821
shouldn't it be monitored?

56
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,908
Assuming 20%
is the broker's commissioning fee

57
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,035
and 10% for operating the shell company,

58
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,580
they might pretend to execute
a few projects to show the media

59
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,457
that they're performing well.

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,167
After a little promotion,

61
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,753
they'll end up with 80 billion won
in profit.

62
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,504
Or maybe 90 billion won?

63
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,760
Seokhwan,

64
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,471
I'm destined to be the future president.

65
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,557
Privatizing the youth startup fund?

66
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,644
I'm someone who invests in public image.

67
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,813
My DNA is fundamentally different
from other politicians'.

68
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,275
All of those young people
will become my voters.

69
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,613
God... I know our country
is a kingdom of prosecutors,

70
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,159
but I'm a mayor of over a million people.
It seems like you underestimate me.

71
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,286
Ms. Ahn Myeongja,

72
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,207
don't underestimate the re-election.

73
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,793
[exhales]

74
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,140
Chief Prosecutor Koo Seokhwan,

75
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,228
you've been smirking while I was talking.
You shouldn't do that.

76
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,648
I'm the type to spit on a smiling face.

77
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,696
Oh, right...

78
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,117
I've been curious about this.
Did you vote for me?

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,201
[Seokhwan chuckles]

80
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,204
I can hardly remember now.

81
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,916
But I don't think I voted for you.

83
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,879
I knew it...

[theme music playing]

NO WAY OUT: THE ROULETTE

MASKED MAN'S TARGET, KIM GUKHO

88
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,673
WHO'S THE MASKED MAN BEHIND THE HIT?

89
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,220
Look at the prosecutors
who have developed a taste for politics.

90
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,390
They try to oppress opposing factions

91
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,143
for their own political purposes,
and it's appalling.

92
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,146
The citizens aren't fools.

93
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,940
They can try to embellish themselves,

94
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:03,321
but historically, they are nothing more
than a gang of power-hungry thugs.

95
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,699
I, Ahn Myeongja, will not lose.

96
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,329
I won't allow the vile mindset
of these predatory wolves,

97
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,415
driven by a delusional sense
of superiority and elitism,

98
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,251
to destroy the few remaining opportunities

99
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,128
that are left for our youth.

100
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,380
I, Ahn Myeongja,

101
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,590
will overcome this, not for my future...

103
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,676
...but for the future of our young people.

[protestor 2] Just step down!

00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,100
[protestor 3] Have you no pride?

[protestor 4] You look down on the people!
You thief!

109

[protestor 5] Ahn Myeongja's a thief!

111
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,331
Sir, are you busy?

00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,458
[assistant] Mr. Lee's
at an event right now,

113
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,001
so he can't get on the phone.

114
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,670
Didn't you tell him I called?

115
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,214
I let him know.

116
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,841
The event is running over.

117
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,470
Tell him it's urgent
and that I'll wait until he answers!

118
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,055
I'll tell him to call.

119
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,640
I said, I'll wait!

120
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,058
Go inside and tell him!

121
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,643
I'm sorry.

What? I'm busy.

126
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,990
[Myeongja's husband]
You make the prosecution

127
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,074
raid the school now?

128
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,201
-What?
-These punks

129
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,620
are taking everything
including irrelevant things!

130
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,913
What did they say?

131
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,457
Put the person in charge on!

132
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,959
Why would you take that?
It's just a clock.

133
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,794
-Put them on!
-Fucking hell.

134
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,087
You bastards...

135
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,804
This is Koo Seokhwan.
Do you have any questions?

136
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,889
Hi, Seokhwan.

137
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,559
Should I go to your wife's place of work
and cause a fuss?

138
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,852
You don't think I will?

139
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,063
Myeongja, that's not what we're doing.

140
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,107
We have a warrant.
What are we supposed to do?

141
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,067
We have to pretend at least.
That's the law.

142
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,861
[scoffs] The law?

143
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,154
Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,407
Do what you do best. Search my parents,
siblings, and relatives.

145
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,285
I wouldn't be in politics
if that scared me.

146
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,703
Mayor Ahn,

147
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,079
we're busy too.

148
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,956
But,

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,584
there are too many bad people
in the world.

150
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,753
We're short on time, so cooperate

151
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,255
or bitch about it to the judge.

152
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,340
[beeping]

153
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,803
So he really wants to do this?

154
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Okay.

155
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,891
Fucking okay! Fuck...

156
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,645
[host] Next, we'll present
the appreciation plaques.

157
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,981
Please welcome Mr. Lee Bongsu,
the representative of Gukmin Party.

60TH ANNIVERSARY CEREMONY OF
THE COUNCIL OF KOREAN INDUSTRIES

160
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,292
On behalf of our council,
this plaque is presented to recognize

161
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,670
your outstanding political leadership
and insight

162
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,380
that contributed
to Korea's economic development...

00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,512
[applause in distance]

00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,350

00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,768
Mayor Ahn.

Hey,

167
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
I'm in no mood to dance around with you.

168
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,731
I'm not fucking around, so move.

00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,941
-Mayor Ahn!
-Hey!

170
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,277
Are you insane? How dare you touch me?

171
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,528
Move.

172
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,156
[Bongsu] I would like to congratulate

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,702
the Council of Korean Industries
on their 60th anniversary.

174
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,121
Isn't it true

175
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,790
that companies are the backbone
of a country?

176
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,542
Every country has companies.

177
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,794
Companies must do well...

178
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,344
Yes, companies must do well

Stop talking about job responsibilities,
departments, and the person in charge!

359
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,491
[all] Yes, ma'am.

360
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,410
All you do is say yes.

361
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,498
Everyone, get out there.

362
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,458
Do you not understand me?

363
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,377
Fuck! Get out!

364
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,257

365
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,804
[reporter on TV] Breaking news.

366
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,514
[Masked Man] Guys,
I'm about to get pissed.

367
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,641
Do you think this is right? Do you?

368
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,476
I told you to kill Kim Gukho.

369
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,354
Did I tell you to set off a bomb
where people were gathered?

370
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,691
Is this a war?
Someone will fire missiles at this rate.

371
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,484
Damn it!

372
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,863
Starting now,

373
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,075
any injuries to civilians
will be considered a foul, got it?

374
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,871
Even the Masked Man himself
has expressed anger over situations,

375
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,081
such as the bombing incident,

376
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,375
-where civilians are harmed.
-Are you having fun?

377
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,794
-[reporter] On the other hand...
-Do you want some popcorn?

378
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,463
[reporter] ...there are negative comments
about how the Masked Man

379
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,549
is skillfully avoiding responsibility.

380
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,968
The families of the deceased

381
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,554
and those who were injured
by this explosion...

382
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,306
-Byeongmin?
-Yes?

383
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,893
When one door closes, another one opens.

384
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,811

How's that sound?

395
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,844
Yes, well, procedurally,
there are no issues. However...

396
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,972
if the opposing party mentions
human rights or the Constitution,

397
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,349
it could become controversial.

398
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,102
Byeongmin,

399
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,232
politics is all about timing and sense.

400
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,901
We must jump into the fire
if there's an issue.

401
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,695
I'm in no position to be picky.

402
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,573
I have a knife to my throat.

403
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,408
Okay? The Constitution? Human rights?

404
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,452
Fuck all of that.

405
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,621
Hey,

406
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,041
one false move, and we have to live
with our tail between our legs forever.

407
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,628
You and I jumped through hoops
to get here. We can't turn back now.

408
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,797
There's no turning back. No way.

409
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
Never!

410
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,339
He'll go straight into surgery
once he becomes stable.

411
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,674
Don't worry too much.

412
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,011
What if he dies?

413
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,095
No.

414
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,055
That won't happen.

415
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,599
[chuckles] Look at Gwangil's body.

416
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,396
He'll overcome this.

417
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,399
By the way, here.

418
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,527

-No, it's fine.

-Yes?

-Thank you.
-Good job.

-Tell your mom to buy you something yummy.
-Okay.

Please, you can accept this.

424
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,006

425
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,549
Why would you feel that way?

426
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,218
We're sorry.

00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,046

Get the Criminal Division

Still, we have to be the ones

00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,548
By the way,

508
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,050
did Kim Gukho say he'd leave?

509
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,053
You don't have to worry about that.
He'll leave.

510
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,806
We're going to move him tonight,

511
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,767
so you just need to help
transport him safely.

512
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,395
[sighs] But...

513
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,939
what if something happens
during transport?

514
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,610
I'll take responsibility. Don't worry.

515
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,030
Responsibility is one thing,

516
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,073
but the citizens are watching.

517
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,788
Don't we have the same goal?

518
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,668
You, too, don't want any trouble
happening on your turf, do you?

519
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,463
We might catch the culprit soon.

520
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,716
Then there's no reason to move him.
It only increases the risk.

521
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,176
Then catch him!

522
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:17,761
Catch the culprit.

523
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,806
Just delay the announcement
to the media a little bit.

524
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,725
It's a win-win situation for us both.

525
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,395
I become a hardworking mayor
who only thinks of the citizens.

00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,989

00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,131
Reporters these days have no power.

536
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,676
Hire anyone who can make
the biggest impact.

537
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,260
Tell them we'll pay handsomely.

538
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,221
Okay. Mayor Ahn, I was wondering,

539
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,847
can we push it back two hours?

540
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,599
Why?

541
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,477
Wouldn't it be better to sync it
with the evening news?

542
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,897
You get there first
and do some strategic maneuvering.

543
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,607
It'll be more dramatic.

544
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,361
Okay, not bad.

545
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,445
Good idea!

546
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,199
[lead protestor] Let's drive Kim Gukho
out of Hosan City!

547

00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,121
[lead protestor] Let's drive Kim Gukho
out of Hosan City!

549
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,248
[protestors] Drive him out! Drive him out!

550
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,376
[lead protestor] Let's drive Kim Gukho
out of Hosan City!

551
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,503
[protestors] Drive him out! Drive him out!

552
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,588
[lead protestor] Send Kim Gukho to hell!

553
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,632
[protestors] Go to hell! Go to hell!

554
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,884
[lead protestor] Send Kim Gukho to hell!

555
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,970
[protestors] Go to hell! Go to hell!

556
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,055
[lead protestor] Send Kim Gukho to hell!

557
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,974
[protestors] Go to hell! Go to hell!

558
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,560
[lead protestor] Send Kim Gukho to hell!

559
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,270
[protestors] Go to hell! Go to hell!

560
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,397
[lead protestor] The government
should take responsibility

561
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,274
and protect the citizens!

562
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,443
[protestors] Protect the citizens!
Protect the citizens!

563
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,195
Mister! Is someone coming today?

564
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,739
[lead protestor] Protect the citizens!

565
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,741
[protestors] Protect the citizens!
Protect the citizens!

566
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,042
-[Myeongja] Is it ready?
-Ma'am.

567
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,212
HBS is still on their way.
There's a lot of traffic.

568
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,048
How are those reporters slower
than YouTV streamers?

569
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,676
-What about the others?
-They're all ready.

570
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,138
Then let's just start.
Their news starts at 9:00 p.m. anyway.

571
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,389
Yes, let's go.

572
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,640
[sighs]

573
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,102
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
FROM MAYOR AHN MYEONGJA

574
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,228
[protestors clamoring]

575
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,022
-[man 1] The mayor's here?
-[man 2] You're right.

576
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,106
[man 3] What are you doing?

577
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,609
[man 4] You should be ashamed!

578
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,070
[man 5] What do you think you're doing?

579
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,575
[woman 1] Just get out of here.

580
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,036
-[man 3] What took you so long to come?
-[woman 2] How could a mayor...

581
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,788
[indistinct chatter]

582
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,762
-Lee Sangho was 21 years old.
-[chatter stops]

583
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,307
He was scheduled to be discharged
from the military police next month.

584
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,602
Park Inhye was 32 years old.

585
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,190
She had quit her job last month...

586
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,236
[crying] ...and was preparing
for her trip to Spain.

587
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,618
-[Myeongja sniffs]
-[camera shutters clicking]

588
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,496
Last night,

589
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,209
our friends and family
died or were hurt here.

590
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,963
People we never should've lost.

591
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,593
I think

592
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,512
this could've been prevented!

593
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,597
If only Kim Gukho wasn't here!

594
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,391
[man 7] What's she saying?

595
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,934
[indistinct chatter]

596
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,021
Right now,

597
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm not here as the mayor of Hosan City.

598
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,988
I'm here as a friend and family member
of Lee Sangho and Park Inhye.

599
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,533
I promise you all.

600
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,202
I will send Kim Gukho

601
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,454
out of Hosan City!

602
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,789
[protestors clapping, cheering]

603
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,708
A criminal's human rights!

604
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,710
Constitutional rights!

605
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,003
[crowd continues to cheer, applaud]

606
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:26,009
How many more friends and family members
must we lose over such trivial reasons?

607
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,887
Why should we make these sacrifices?

608
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,180
[protestors] Hear, hear!

609
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,352
[protestors] Hear, hear!

610
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,647
Kim Gukho!

611
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,441
Let's talk!

612
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,818
Please, talk to me!

613
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,863
I will not leave this place

614
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,241
until you have a talk with me!

615
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,452
[protestors clapping, cheering]

Ahn Myeongja! Ahn Myeongja!

619
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,963
Wow, this politician is incredible.

620
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,716
[scoffs] It's just crocodile tears.

621
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,762
[Gukho] She knows how to put on a show.

622
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,723
[assistant] Mayor Ahn, here's a cushion.

623
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,391
[protestors chanting]
Ahn Myeongja! Ahn Myeongja!

FACES OFF WITH NOTORIOUS DEMON

627
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,494
Okay.

AVAILABLE 24/7 NATIONWIDE
FOR ALL TYPES OF EVENTS

629
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,381
-Hello.
-Hey.

630
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,802
Where's the kid?

631
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,346
She'll be here soon. She had to pee.

632
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,224
-She'll be here soon.
-The kid is the key here.

633
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,643
Make her rehearse again.

634
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,103
-Yes, sir.
-[Byeongmin] Where's the letter?

635
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,188
Uh, right here.

636
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,191
MAYOR AHN, YOU CAN DO IT. THANK YOU!

637
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,277
Okay. Everyone, focus.

638
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,572
Don't come at once. It'll be obvious.

639
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,991
Don't ask the mayor questions.

640
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,368
Don't take pictures even if someone asks.

641
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,869
Got it?

642
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,079
[all] Yes, sir.

643
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,707
Don't worry.
They're all professionals. [chuckles]

644
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,208
[Byeongmin] Is that so?

645
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,043
And the kid's mom?

646
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,629
Lady? That's you.

647
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,674
Yes, that's me.

648
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,426
It's cold, isn't it?

649
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,220
It's only going to get colder,
so bring the blanket.

650
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,598
Make sure to remind the kid
to cover the mayor with it. Hmm?

651
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,975
-Answer.
-Yes, sir.

652
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,728
Good luck!

653
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,981
[man 1] Why won't he come out?

654
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,776
Who do you think you are?
How could you make the mayor wait?

655
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,570
Come out!

656
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,573
[officer] You can't come this way.

657
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,284

demanding a meeting with Kim Gukho.

Let's connect to the reporter
who's at the scene now.

672
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,467
Has Kim Gukho responded yet?

673
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,805
Yes, there have been
no signs of response so far.

674
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,849
According to her staff,
Mayor Ahn's determination is strong,

675
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,602
and she plans to continue all night
if she has to.

Yes, first...

Ah, my knees! Ow!

00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,801
my body isn't what it used to be.

707
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,139
Back in the day, I'd be fine
after rolling around over asphalt all day.

708
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,183
It's -14°C, and for hours you've been...

709
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,936
Even people in high positions
have a hard life.

710
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,522
[sighs] Life itself is a workout.

711
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,608
-Sorry?
-A workout.

712
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,692
Exercise.

713
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,402
-[Gukho laughing] Ah!
-[Sangbong laughs]

714
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:44,118
Just take what you need.
You'll have everything there.

715
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,038
I know it's Gangwon-do,
but it's not that rural.

716
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,540
A lady will come regularly to clean too.

717
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,710
I know because I lived there a few months.

718
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,547
The air's nice.
Once the flowers start to bloom in spring,

719
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,550
you can go fishing and hiking.
You can do it all.

720
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,302
Do you like fishing?

721
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,929
Fishing's nice.

722
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,473
But shouldn't we talk about the money?

723
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,020
I thought that was settled
with your attorney?

724
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:15,483
I've learned that having a middleman
makes things run less smoothly.

725
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,068
Right, of course.

726
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,738
[sighs]

727
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,823
[grunts]

728
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,452
You'll receive 200 million won every year.

729
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,412
A total of one billion won in five years.

730
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,957
It'll be untraceable cash.

731
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,375
So don't worry about taxes.

732
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,752
There are no other conditions.

733
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,339
Don't come near Hosan City for five years.

734
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,680
That's free money for me.
But let me ask you something.

735
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,224
What do you get in return?

736
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,269
I get their favor.

737
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,478
Whose?

738
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,857
[sighs] When I was elected Mayor,

739
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,777
I spent a little over two billion won.

740
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,823
At the time, I received 177,000 votes...

741
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,617
Wait, it was 177,531 votes.

742
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,495
It was 11,000 won per vote.

743
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,664
That's what you call "cost per vote."

744
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,709
How many people will be happy
to see you out of Hosan City?

745
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,168
Everyone, probably.

746
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,295
[Myeongja chuckles]

747
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,796
If you calculate it,

748
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,966
I can recoup the billion won I spent
with just 100,000 people.

749
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,719
But I'm betting that it'll exceed 100,000.

750
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,512
That's such a good deal.

751
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,056
You're good.

752
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,141
But...

753
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,518
shouldn't I play
a little more hard to get?

754
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,978
-Well?
-You're right.

755
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,481
-[Sangbong] Shall we play hard to get?
-[Gukho] What do you think, ma'am?

756
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,066
[all laughing]

757
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,735
[Myeongja] Funny.

758
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,612
I don't think it'll end here.

759
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,867
Once we've established a relationship,
we'll continue to work together.

760
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,036
Do you think I'll be the mayor forever?

761
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,538
I'm not that half-hearted.

762
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,290
I plan to go all the way.

763
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,625
-All the way.
-[Sangbong snickers]

764
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,047
Let's do this.

765
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,342
[chuckles dryly]

766
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,593
No need to shake hands.

767

[Myeongja grunts]

768
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,056

[woman] Here comes the mayor!

772
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,438
-[man] What happened?
-[reporter] Mayor Ahn has just

773
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,148
come out of the house.

774
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,442
But we don't see Kim Gukho right now.

775
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,694
[voice recording] You'll receive
200 million won every year.

776
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,863
A total of one billion won in five years.

777
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,366
It'll be untraceable cash.

778
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,825
So don't worry about taxes.

There are no other conditions.

Don't come near Hosan City for five...

781
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,334
My client

782
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,504
would like to change
the terms of the agreement.

783
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,926
[reporter] She's speaking
with the attorney now.

784
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:59,397
[Gukho] I mean,
who knows when I'll die, right?

785
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,858
One billion in five years
seems like a bit of a loss for me.

786
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,860
Think about it.

787
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,240
There's a 20-billion-won bounty
on my head.

788
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,408
You bastard!

789
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,535
-You piece of shit!
-[Sangbong] Stop.

790
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,245
-No, no! Don't! [exclaims]
-[Myeongja groans]

791
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,914
How can someone as educated as you
curse like that?

792
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,290
[Gukho] What the fuck was that?

793
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,126
-[Myeongja] Damn it!
-Come on.

794
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,086
[Sangbong] Now, calm down.

795
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,713
Mayor Ahn?

796
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,424
Mayor Ahn?

797
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,801
Let's do ten billion won in five years.

798
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,344
[Myeongja laughing]

799
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,390
I know that amount won't even be a burden
for someone like you.

800
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,142
-Damn it!
-By the way,

801
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,019
-[Myeongja grunts]
-I did my military service in Gangwon.

802
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,397
I would feel very frustrated
going back there.

803
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,190
I know I'll have to try to make do.

804
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,484
Do you know the eastern mountain regions?

805
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,612
I mean...
Where did you do your military service?

806
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,407
-That's not important.
-Where?

807
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,577
-Near Hyangnobong, Gangwon.
-Hyangnobong?

808
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,911
Yes.

809
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,371
I was near the toughest pass.

810
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,873
Which division? The 12th division?

811
00:40:58,956 --> 00:40:59,999
Yes.

812
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,461

-[Myeongja grunts]

That's not South Korea! It's North Korea!
It's Siberia!

00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,715
It is very cold.

00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,051
it may look shabby with the broken heater,

817
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,845
but I like my house.

to screw me over right now? Huh?

823
