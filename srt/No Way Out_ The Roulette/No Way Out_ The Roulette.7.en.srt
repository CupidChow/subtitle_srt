Wait.

Wasn't it a hospital?

00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,474
[Suchang] Did you put in
the right address?

148
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,351
I entered what you told me.

149
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,062
Maybe you gave me the wrong address again.

150
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,023
[Suchang] When did I ever do that? Hey!

151
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,451
[Suchang] Is this the place?

Senior Inspector Jang?

153
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,336
[Suchang] Was this the only hospital?

154
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,380
[officer 1] There are other
big hospitals, of course.

155
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,049
But hospitals are businesses too.

156
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,593
Nothing good will come
from getting involved with him.

157
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,054
It's not that
the other hospitals refused him,

158
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,266
but the doctor here was on television
and quite famous back in the day.

159
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,518
[officer 1] So what if he's famous?

160
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,354
He can't even see well now.

161
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,231
Still, he worked at a big hospital
in Seoul for a long time.

162
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,900
Is his room this way?

163
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,032
[officer 1] Yeah, to the left.

164
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,742
The room at the end of the hall.

165
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,412

166
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,581
Go and get the director.

00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,865
is he okay?

175
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,243
He won't die.

176
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,327
[officer 1] So...

177
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,163

Where's Somi?

544
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,801
Somi?

545
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,511
Somi...

546
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,595
[shouts] Somi!

547
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,764
- Somi!
- Joongsik!

548
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,559
Somi? Somi!

549
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,352
Somi?

550
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,229
Somi?

551
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,981
Somi...

552
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,065
Somi...

553
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,191
Suchang,

554
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,609
where's Somi?

555
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,069
- [Suchang] Joongsik.
- [Juho] Calm down.

556
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,529
Somi...

557
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,532
Somi! Somi!

558
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,284
[Suchang] No, man! You can't!

559
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,953
- [Joongsik] Somi!
- [Suchang] Just wait!

560
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,746
- Let me see her!
- [Juho] Stop it!

561
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,373
Are you Baek Somi's guardian?

562
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,624
Yes.

563
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,920
Thankfully, her pulse and breathing
have returned to normal for now.

564
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,964
But she's still unconscious.

565
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,841
She's still unconscious...

566
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,343
Let's keep an eye on her for now.

567
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,929
- Okay.
- She needs to remain stable.

568
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,014
Okay.

569
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,601
Also, sir?

570
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,227
Just a moment.

571
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:30,980
Yes?

572
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,360
- It's about the patient.
- Yes.

573
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,988
We'll know for sure
once we get her lab results,

574
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,034
but based on the injuries on her body,

575
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,494
I think we should conduct
a gynecological exam.

576
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,705
A gynecological...

577
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,457
It's too early to tell,

578
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,418
but she may need
psychiatric treatment as well.

579
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,129
- Okay...
- Hmm?

580
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,049

583
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,032
[Joongsik] Hey, I have to catch
Kim Gukho, you bastard!

584
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,784
[shouting] So just let me go!

585
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,619
Damn it, Joongsik!

586
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,912
What's wrong with you?

587
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,581
- Do you really want to get fired?
- I'll be back in no time!

588
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,708
Fuck! Cut the shit!

589
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,710
I get how you feel,

590
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,046
but let's focus
on getting better for now, okay?

591
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,298
I'm begging you! Please!

592
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,510
Come on...

593
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,804
You can't ask me to do that.

594
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,015
How could you ask me to do that? Damn it.

595
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,479
Thank you.

596
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,356
I appreciate it.

597
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,903
Keep a close eye on this place.

598
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,154
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

599
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,699
I'm going to kill him.

600
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,536
I swear I'll kill that bastard.

601
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,469
[breathing heavily]

602
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,984
Hey...

603
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,361
Give me a cigarette and a lighter.

604
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,989
We can't. You can't leave the room.

605
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,907
Give me a break, you punk.

606
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,869
I'll step out for a second to smoke.
It's stuffy in there.

607
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,037
Lieutenant Baek,

608
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,788
didn't you quit smoking?

609
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,416
Just give it to me, punk.

610
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,877
Just smoke it inside.

611
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,174
You're so inflexible.

612
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,800
Fine.

613

618
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,874

- I don't know. I'm so sick of hospitals.

Is he out of his mind?

635
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,171
Search on your way up!

636
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,923
- Juho, the basement!
- What about it?

637
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,758
- [Suchang] Come on!
- [Juho] Why?

638
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,147
Radio it in as soon
as you find him, got it?

639
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,942
[Juho] He's not here.

640
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,861
I'll check the security footage.
Search the lower floors.

641
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,696
Lower floors...

Can you zoom in here?

645
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,579
Hey, he took an ambulance.

00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,789
It's 18PA5219.

647
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,332
Yeah, bring the car around.

Mom...

656
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,230
Why do we live like this?

657
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,283
We just live.

Listen to me, okay?

660
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,124
It had to be...

661
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,376
resolved eventually.

662
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,714
Everything will be fine
once you come back from studying abroad.

663
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,173
So just go, okay?
