00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,056
What wrong did Dongha do?

183
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,978
You fucking bitch, are you crazy?

184
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,062

[Wooyoung] What should we write
on her face?

187
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,528
Who's good at drawing?

189

Hey, write "bitch" for me.

[bully 1] What the fuck are you doing?

201
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,896
Let's all die here.

202
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,647
Stop bluffing, you bastard.

203
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,232
What?

204
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,110
[screaming] You don't think I'll do it?

205
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,031

210
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,097
From now on,

Stop it.

219
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,269
I have to erase this.

220
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,189
Erasing it won't change anything.

221
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,983
People will see it.

222
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm okay, Mom. You can stop.

223
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,074
Let go of me. I have to erase this.

I'm fine.

[Masked Man] Guys,
I'm about to be pissed.

234
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,879
Do you think this is right? Do you?

235
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,714
I told you to kill Kim Gukho.

236
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,508
Did I tell you to set off a bomb
where people were gathered?

237
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,593
Is this a war?

238
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,054
Someone will fire missiles at this rate.

239
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,847
Starting now,

240
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,560
any injuries to civilians
will be considered a foul, got it?

241
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,437
Come on, guys.

242
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,522
I'm not asking you for much, am I?

243
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,035
Let's keep it clean and straightforward.

244
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,247
Lieutenant Baek, you need to see this.

245
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,874
What is it? I'm busy right now.

246
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,213
[Eunjeong] Now, the Masked Man

247
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,758

and each person was mentioned here before.

248
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,885
That goes for Yoon Changjae too.

249
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,888
Among the petitions submitted

250
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,390
to Open Newspaper,

251
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,684
they're criminals
who weren't properly punished.

252
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,936
Do you know who the last person is?

253
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,188
[whispers] It's Kim Gukho.

254
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,779
[Joongsik] Wait.

255
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,205
I did this, but it gets cut off here.

256
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,290
What's wrong with this?

257
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,128
[Eunjeong making whooshing noise]

258
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,671

260
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,107
It looks like Midian Church.

261
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,526
-Midian Church?
-Yeah.

262
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,445
This church is really famous.

263
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,784

264
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,496
-[Yeonju chuckles]
-Thank you so much.

265

This is Professor Rebecca.

University Royal Conservatoire of Music.

-I see.
-Say hello.

268
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,427
[in English] It's so nice
to meet you, Dongha.

269
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,596
The concours was amazing.

270
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,932
Your gorgeous and dynamic music
always inspires me.

271
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,352
I hope you can find your dreams fulfilled
in our school.

272
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,396
I can provide all that you need.

273
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,690
[in English] Thank you, but...

274
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,985
I need some time to think about it.

275
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,655
Oh, what are your concerns? I can help.

276
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,324
What are you saying?

277
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,951
Dongha will go.

278
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,828
-[Rebecca chuckles]
-[Yeonju] Dongha will go.

279
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,538
Tell her that he'll go.

280
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,874
[in English] There's no problem here.

281
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:04,958
Let me talk to him.

282
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,043
[Yeonju in English] No problem.

283
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,628
[Rebecca] Okay. Good.

284
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,838

00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,855
I talked it over with your teacher.

289
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,565
Go abroad.

290
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,358
What about you?

291
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,651
Well...

292
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,570
I need to take care of some things.

293
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,905
I'll be there soon.

294
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,910
I won't go without you.

295
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,580
Dongha,

296
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,249
just go first. I'll be there soon.

297
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,294
You know I can't be persuaded.

298
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,463
Please.

299
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,592
Let's eat.

300
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,554
MIDIAN CHURCH

301
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,847
[pastor] Members of the congregation,

302
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,807
during a counseling session yesterday,

303
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,768
a deacon came to me and said,

304
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,979
"Pastor."

305
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,231
"I pray every day and every night."

306
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,275
"I even attend early morning prayers."

307
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,237
"So why does my son
play video games instead of studying?"

308
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,573
"It's hard raising a child."

309
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,992
So I asked her this.

310
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,872
"Deacon, did you only study
when you were in school?"

311
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,416
[laughter]

312
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,171
If prayers could send
our children to college,

313
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,756
then our presbyter's children

314
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,467
would've gone to Harvard.

315
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,593

[pastor chuckles]

318
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,726
Now, beloved members
of the congregation...

319
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,354
You shouldn't pray alone.

320
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,566
Teach them God's words so they can
take responsibility for their lives.

321
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,652
Let's bet on it

322
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,195
with our lives.

323
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,531
-Hallelujah.
-[all] Amen.

[children playing, screaming]

325
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,448

Yes?

331
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,469
[pastor] Ah.

332
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,055
Yes, hello.

333
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,932
Thank you.

334
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,644
Elder,

335
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,022
please give the pastor a meal.

336
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,690
Thank you. I appreciate it.

337
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,657
There's a system where
we can post petitions?

338
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,701
I had no idea.

339
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,958
I know people don't trust the law
these days... [sighs]

340
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,836
...but wouldn't it be safer to stay

341
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,172
within the boundaries of the law?

342
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,718
That's what God would want.

343
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,636
I'm just curious.

344
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,597
Do you watch YouTV?

345
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,182
Of course, I do.

346
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,809
I love mukbangs. [laughs]

347
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,394
Ohh. Yes, I see.

348

This is made at the church. Try it.

Yes, thank you.

350
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,194
So how can we help you, Detective?

351
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,822
No, I just came to check some things.

352
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,907
[chuckles]

353
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,035
Okay.

Somi!

Give this to your dad on your way.

I have to go straight to the library.

Your dad hasn't changed
his underwear for days. Look.

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,675
[announcer] This stop
is Hosan Police Station.

364
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,261
[in English] This stop
is Hosan Police Station.

365
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,596
-[buzzing]
-Hosan Police Station.

366
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,655
[humming]

367
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,627
Damn it. Where is she?

368
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,087
[ringing tone]

369
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,301
Hello? Hey.

370
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,428
Did Somi leave?

371
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,015
But I didn't ask you to send me underwear.

372
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,934
[Yeeun] That's strange.
She left a while ago.

373
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,436
Okay.

374
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,896
Okay.

375
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,287
[phone vibrating]

376
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,253
YEEUN

377
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,214
-Yeah...
-[Yeeun] There's...

378
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,632
-Yeeun, what...
-There's...

379
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,716
Wait...

380
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
[Yeeun yelps]

381
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,010
Honey!

382
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,094
Honey?

383
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,096
Yeeun? Yeeun!

384
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,391
Yeeun!

385
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,436
-[Yeeun] Honey.
-Yeeun.

386
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,562
[Changjae] Hello, Detective!

387
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,564
-[Joongsik] What's this?
-I'm here for my money.

388
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,982
You little...

389
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,485
[Joongsik] Honey, go inside.

390
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,362
-I'll...
-Lady, stay right there.

391
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,905
She should hear this too.

392
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,990
Your daughter's life is at stake.

393
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,785
What? Somi's not home?

394
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,328
What? She's not here.

395
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,914
You asshole.

396
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,666
-You son of a bitch!
-[clattering]

397
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,459
-Where's Somi?
-Let go of me.

398
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,835
Where is she, fucker?

399
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,087
She's very smart.

400
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,089
-You asshole.
-You raised her well.

401
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,174
-Motherfucker.
-[Yeeun screams]

402
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,551
I'll kill you.

403
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,554
So why did you steal
my precious money? Huh?

404
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,138
Look at what happened.

405
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,807
You brought this upon yourself!

406
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,142
-I said I'd return it.
-Do you even have it?

407
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,811
I'll come up with it at all costs!

408
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,563
Fuck, do you think I'm stupid?

409
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,274
I told you I was watching.

410
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,735
Detective, I gave it some thought.

411
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,280
You're protecting Kim Gukho.

412
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,158
I have 20 billion won in front of me.
Why settle for a billion?

413
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,703
Bring Kim Gukho to me.

414
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,998
We can make an exchange.

415
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,584
Him for your daughter.

416
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,877
A clean swap. I swear.

417
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,796
Don't you know

418
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,340
-the police force is there?
-Bring him alive.

419
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,425
Got it?

420
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,927
I have to kill him. That's the rule.

421
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,637
How can I bring him now? Damn it.

422
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,139
That's your problem.

423
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,559
I feel kind of sorry for Somi.

424
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,644
[Changjae] Oh, right.

425
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,147
If the cops come after me first,

426
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,233
-you'll get a can of her fingers.
-You piece of shit!

427
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,485
I'm going to kill you today! Just die!

428
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,698
[Changjae] Can she play the cello

429
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,242
-without fingers?
-[Yeeun wails]

430
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,329
-How will she play?
-If you touch a single hair,

431
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,415
I swear I'll kill you then. Got it?

432
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,499
Yeah.

433
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,418
I'll get going now.

434
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,545
I'll call with her phone.

435
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,131
[Joongsik shuddering]

436
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,467
Don't follow me out.

437
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,888
Honey?

438
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,181
-Honey...
-Honey.

439
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,807
It'll be okay.

440
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,601
Nothing will happen to Somi. I'll...

441
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,769
I'll take care of this.

442
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,687
-[Yeeun sobbing] What do we do?
-Don't worry. It's fine.

443
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,356
[crying] Our Somi...

444
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,024
What about Somi?

445
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,318
Somi. What do we do?

446
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,195
-Somi...
-[sobbing] Honey.

447
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,488
Yeeun, calm down.

448
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,990
It'll be okay.

449
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,034
[doorbell rings]

450
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,872
Oh. [chuckles]

451
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,291
Who are you?

452
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,460
Ah, yes, hello.

453
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,420
I'm Kim Gukho's attorney.

454
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,506
And?

455
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,008
I have something to discuss with you.

456
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,386
Can you open the door for me?

457
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,262
-I have nothing to discuss.
-No, wait.

458
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,639
It'll just take a moment.

459
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,401
[Dongha] Mom?

460
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,990
The documents you left behind.

461
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,785
I looked over them.

462
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,288
An uncontested divorce will be difficult
with these conditions.

463
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,503
The issue regarding custody
is indeed something

464
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,672
that can be negotiated
between both parties,

465
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,551
but a unilateral written statement
of relinquishing custody will have...

466
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,052
no legal effect.

467
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,808
Don't tell that to me.

468
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,768
You can speak with my attorney.

469
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,729
Your son is...

470
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,815
He's a genius violinist.

471
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,153
But lately, it seems
he's more famous as Kim Gukho's son.

472
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,280
If this drags on,

473
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,782
you'll get mixed up with him
over custody issues.

474
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,534
Are you okay with that?

475
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,957
HUMAN ANATOMY II

476
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,673
Don't you mess with my son!

477
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,719
I'll kill him and everyone else.

478
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,973
There's something I didn't tell you.

479
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,267
I'm recording this.

480
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,442
[Sangbong] Call me
if you change your mind.

481
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,611
Your son's innocent.

482
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,247
[ringing tone]

483
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,414
OFFICER PARK

484
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,460
[Eunjeong] Yes, Lieutenant Baek.

485
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,587
[clears throat] Hey, Officer Park.

486
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,591
I have a favor to ask.
Track the location of a phone for me.

487
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,009
It's urgent.

488
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,886
Yes, that's not difficult.

489
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,638
Who is it?

490
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,474
[voice quivering] Yeah, it's my daughter.

491
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,018
[exhales] Don't ask anything else.

492
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,895
Can you just do it quickly?

493
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,105
Yes, I understand.

494
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,315
Can you text me the number?

495
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,196
[sobbing, shuddering]

496
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,823
[grunts, clears throat]

497
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,714
TO HOSAN

498
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,842
[Joongsik] Is that it?

499
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,343
Where did it go next? Find it.

500
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,015
-[officer] It's Route 59.
-Keep playing it.

501
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,106
What's wrong with that?

502
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,901
[officer] I think the security cameras
here are broken.

503
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,569
There isn't a bypass road here.

504
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,945
Fuck.

505
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,452
[protestors chanting]
Enforce it! Enforce it!

506
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:56,122
[lead protestor 1] Kim Gukho threatens
public safety! Execute him!

507
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,207
[protestors chanting]
Execute him! Execute him!

508
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:02,170
[lead protestor 1] We can't live
with the anxiety! Ensure public safety!

509
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,213
[protestors] Ensure it! Ensure it!

510
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,051
[lead protestor 1]
Castrate sex offender Kim Gukho!

511
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,637
[protestors] Castrate him! Castrate him!

512
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,349
[lead protestor 2] Give Kim Gukho
the death penalty! Execute him!

513
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,643
[protestors] Execute him! Execute him!

514
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:21,731
[lead protestor 2] Ban sex offender,
Kim Gukho, from Hosan City!

515
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,983
[protestors] Ban him! Ban him!

516
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,028
[lead protestor 2]
We can't live with the anxiety!

517
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,572
Ban Kim Gukho!

518
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,699
[protestors] Ban him! Ban him!

519
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,912
[lead protestor 1]
Castrate sex offender Kim Gukho!

00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,872
[protestors] Castrate him! Castrate him!

521
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,085
[protestors continue chanting slogans]

522
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,642
[officer 1] You may go in.

523
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,312
Lift your arms, please.

524
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,189
[beeping]

525
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,779
You may come in.

526
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,323
I am...

527
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,492
Kim Gukho's son.

528
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,203
-Excuse me?
-I'm his son.

529
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,206
I'm here to see my dad.

530
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,836
Kim Gukho's son is here.

531
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,630
[officer 2] His son is here? Send him in.

532
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,551
Go inside.

533
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,019
[officer 2] Mr. Kim, your son is here.

534
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,478
[Gukho] My son?

535
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,896
My son is here?

536
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,273
Send him in! Now!

537
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,441
[camera shutters clicking]

538
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,574
[officer 2] He's going in now.

539
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,372

545

You're old enough to drink.
That's right. Yeah!

564
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,401
You should learn how to drink from me!
Wait a second.

It's not that.

569
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,085
Can you order in a nice whiskey
and dishes for us?

Thinking about you,

577
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,152
I folded each one by hand.

578
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,112
Do you remember?

579
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,989
You loved tigers.

580
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,828
Dad, I...

581
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,912
Yeah? What?

582
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,457
Can I see my room for a second?

583
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,750
Your room?

584
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,838
I didn't clean up.

585
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,841
Yeah, of course.

586
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,134
This is your house.

587
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,510
Go ahead.

588
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:25,808
Dongha!

589
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,728
I have beer. Do you want some?

590
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,812
Well...

591
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,191
Let's drink when the food gets here.

592
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,901
Okay, go ahead.

I'll be right there!

602
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,902
[Dongha] Mom,

603
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,325
it seems we have forgotten
the emotional pain we've been living with

604
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,784
for some time now.

605
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,537
I thought we could live happily

606
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,708
without that jerk in our lives.

607
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,876
Here you go.

608
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,420
But because of this incident...

609
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,796
[shopkeeper] I'm paying you handsomely.

610
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,090
I realized we'll have to live
with this label

611
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,135
and be in pain for the rest of our lives.

612
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,307
I'm okay with people
pointing their fingers at me...

613
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,643
-Goodbye.
-...but I can't endure seeing you

614
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,063
in pain any longer.

615
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,566
You've carried the pain for me
all this time,

616
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,777
so now,

617
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,321
I'll bear that pain for you instead.

618
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,033
I'm sorry, Mom.

622
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,931
This is a fine whiskey.

623
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,934
Son, let me pour you a glass.

624
