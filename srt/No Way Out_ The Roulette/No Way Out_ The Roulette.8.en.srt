We intend to carefully consider

<i>His remorse and willingness to settle</i>

<i>Oh, there's some blood here. </i>[chuckles]

553
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,414
<i>Am I right?</i>
[accented] <i>Baek Joongsik?</i>

554
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,582
<i>Sorry.</i>

555
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,835
<i>Forget my Korean. My Korean is bad, so...</i>

556
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,547
<i>I have news for you.</i>

557
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,093
<i>I got a new client.</i>

558
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,305
<i>And he wants me to kill...</i>

559
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,973
<i>the "Mask Guy".</i>

560
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:19,354
<i>And I know. You are after him.</i>

561
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,439
<i>Right?</i>

562
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:24,943
<i>Okay.</i>

563
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,695
<i>Come here.</i>

564
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,032
<i>Here is the thing.</i>

565
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,575
<i>You'd better stop...</i>

566
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,368
<i>now.</i>

567
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:40,125
<i>Or I will hunt you down</i>
<i>and kill anybody you love.</i>

568
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,961
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

569
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,550
<i>So, get the fuck out of my way.</i>

570
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,053
<i>He's mine.</i>

571
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:06,944
[beeping]
