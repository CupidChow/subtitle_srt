It smells amazing.

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,000
It's right out of the pot.

who pacified the northern border,

57

Didn't she once elope

73
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,000
with Academician Gu,

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,980
(Wei)
only to be abandoned

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,310
and become the laughingstock of Huajing?

76
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,240
And now, what is she doing?

77
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,990
Bravo!

78
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,660

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,240
blocks the road, could it be that,
after the Chu family's

82
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,130
fall, she's here to challenge

83
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,680
the Wei family out of resentment?

84
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,710
Lady Chu,

85
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,720
the Wei family returns victorious today.

86
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,560
Could you please

87
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,120
let us pass first?

Wei soldiers.

89

Come on.

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Make way, make way!

91
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
Where's the rest of your family?

92
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,150
The rest?

93
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,750
What do you mean by that?

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,680
Are you waiting for someone?

95
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,100

(Gu Chusheng,
Senior Compiler of the Hanlin Academy)

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,870
Isn't that Academician Gu, the one

99
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,710
who abandoned her?

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,000
So she was waiting

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,040
for him.

102
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,560
I am confronting him!

103
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
So what?

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,680
People say Academician Gu

105
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,160
is an upright official.

106
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,360
How can such a man be so faithless?

107
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,040
(Wei Qiu, Wei Yun's Guard)
You don't know what happened

108
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
between them.

109
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,120
Five years ago...

110
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,710
Gu,

111
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,870
I'll go with you

112
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
to the southwest border.

113
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,430
I'm being exiled.

114
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
You don't have to share my hardship.

115
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Gu Chusheng,

116
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,750
as long as I'm willing,

117
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,560
I'll brave anything.

118
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
I just ask,

119
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
do you dare take me with you?

120
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,040
I know we've separated.

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,480
But right now, you're the only one

122
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,570
I can turn to.

123
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,290
My father and brother are holding Fengling
to the last.

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
If the court doesn't send reinforcements,

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
they'll surely perish.

126
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm just an academician.

127
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,480
How could I influence His Majesty's decision?

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Gu Chusheng,

129
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,960
please, I beg you!

130
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Get up.

131
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,270
Please.

132
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,600
I beg you.

133
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,600
Save my father,

134
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
save my brother!

135
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,630
You're the only one I can ask!

136
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
Please.

137
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Court affairs

138
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,240
are not changed

139
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,320
by mere words from someone.

140
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,510
The Chu family can no longer help you

141
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,360
on the path you seek in the imperial service,

142
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,110
is that so?

143
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
And now it's the day

144
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,840
you marry into the Duke of Ning's

145
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
noble house.

146
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
Truly, fate loves its cruel jokes.

147
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,390
My lord,

148
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,080
I'll have this dealt with immediately.

149
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,180
(Zhang Deng, Gu Chusheng's Page Boy)
Your wedding will not be delayed!

150
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,360
What's Academician Gu doing?

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,840
He's going.

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,270
Why's he going up there?

153
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,120
What is he doing?

154
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,240
Now this will be interesting.

155
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,110
Chu Yu,

156
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,600
I know I wronged you.

157
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,960
But why ruin

158
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,800
your reputation

159
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,390
like this,

160
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,240
before everyone?

161
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
You're not one to cling to the past.

162
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,080
If so,

163
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,030
why stand here?

164
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,590
Do you mean

165
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,750
to personally persuade me

166
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,840
not to ruin my marriage?

167
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,080
I'm standing here...

168
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm standing here to stop you.

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,910
Now that the Chu family has fallen,

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,790
you should find your own path.

171
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,320
As for me,

172
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,270
I have a future I must face.

173
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,280
There's no longer

174
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,080
anything between us.

175
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,470
Gu Chusheng,

176
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,720
should I say you know me,

177
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
or that you don't?

178
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,500
(Wei Jun, First Son of the Wei Family)

179
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,840
The Wei Army is amazing!

180
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
Look at their vigor and pride.

181
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
Yun,

182
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,560
Father sent you to deliver the good news.

183
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,890
The army

184
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,980
has finished assembling in camp

185
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,750
and awaits inspection.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,990
Yet you still haven't returned.

187
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,680
What are you doing here?

188
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,800
Jun, look.

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
Today Academician Gu is getting married,

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,480
but Lady Chu is purposely

191
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,720
blocking him from Spring Breeze House.

192
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,030
The road into the city is jammed.

193
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,870
You can't get in.

194
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,960
Might as well watch the show here.

195
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,720
Sounds good.

196
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Usually it's all battles,

197
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,200
no show.

198
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,660
(Wei Ya, Fifth Son; Wei Feng, Fourth Son;
Wei Shu, Second Son)

199
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,540
(Wei Qin, Third Son; Wei Rong, Sixth Son)

200
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,630
The Wei Army is glorious!

201
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
The Wei Army is glorious!

202
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,200
Jun, just watch a little.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,870
The Wei Army is glorious!

204
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,710
Indeed,

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,870
I'm never one to cling to the past.

206
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,440
How do you know

207
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
I came for you?

208
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,350
The Wei Army is glorious!

209
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,740
Look!

210
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,700
(Fair gentleman!)

211
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,980
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's)

212
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,640
Chu Yu, enough.

213
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,480
Stop it right now.

214
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,640
Academician Gu,

215
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,560
today is your wedding day.

216
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,750
If you stay here,

217
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,470
aren't you afraid the Duke of Ning will notice?

218
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,180
What gentleman?

219
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,060
What good mate?

220
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,300
Jun, Jun,

221
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,660
what does this mean?

222
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,060
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's good mate.)

223
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,340
It reads,

224
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,700
"Fair gentleman!

225
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,850
Sweet lady's good mate."

226
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,100
Today I have come for

227
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,180
Young General Wei Jun.

228
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,330
- Me?
- Yes.

229
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,460
I've long admired

230
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,540
your bravery.

231
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,610
I'm no noblewoman, but I learned

232
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
martial arts as a child.

233
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,340
If war breaks out,

234
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,700
I can go to battle with you.

235
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,010
Do I deserve you

236
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,250
in your eyes?

237
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,300
So it was for Jun.

238
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,970
Jun,

239
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,610
Lady Chu put on

240
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,850
such a show

241
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,610
for you!

242
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,700
- Jun, Jun.
- Jun.

243
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,940
She did it for you.

244
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,340
At least give her an answer!

245
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,450
Yes.

246
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,700
Thank you for your favor, Lady Chu,

247
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,580
but I've pledged myself to the state.

248
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,580
I'm not the right match for you.

249
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,930
You said you're pledged

250
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,740
to the state,

251
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,740
but I am also a person of the state.

252
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,260
How could I not be your match?

253
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,170
If you care about

254
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,010
gossip,

255
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,130
I will say this:

256
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,770
Chu Yu is a Chu.

257
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,530
Though her house fell,

258
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,130
the martial spirit remains unchanged.

259
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,620
Report! Northwest General

260
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,890
(Fengling City)
Chu Jianchang

261
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,050
has fallen at Fengling City.

262
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,530
General Chu Linyang

263
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:39,860
is gravely wounded.

264
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,120
(Sui)

265
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,260
Lady Chu, rest assured.

266
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,980
I never believed

267
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,100
those rumors.

268
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,980
Jun, do you know what you said

269
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,380
- means yes?
- Wanyue.

270
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,220
Here I am.

271
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,540
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's good mate.)

272
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,670
Young General Wei,

273
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,670
I await your reply.

274
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,710
Jun,

275
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,320
she's suspicious.

276
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,190
Seeing is believing.

277
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,800
A woman revealing her feelings

278
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,640
is rare.

279
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,350
Lady Chu's boldness

280
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,990
earns my respect.

281
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Yun,

282
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,710
where is the thing

283
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,640
fell from the pedals?

284
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,680
I never meant to hide it.

285
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,430
Here.

286
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,630
Lady Chu, rest assured.

287
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,910
I will

288
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,830
give you

289
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,760
a satisfactory answer.

290
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,830
Good. I'll be waiting.

291
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,190
Let's go.

292
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,700
(Chu Mansion)

293
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,070
Does Gu Chusheng

294
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,390
really think

295
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,000
we came for him today?

296
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,480
What a narrow road for enemies.

297
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,280
Who could've known his wedding

298
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,590
would nearly ruin my plan?

299
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,670
Exactly.

300
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,240
She acts shameless

301
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,080
and indecent!

302
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,910
I'll be dragged down with her.

303
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,280
How will I be able to

304
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,120
go out now?

305
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,350
My Lady, keep your voice down.

306
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,830
Don't let your sister hear.

307
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,260
(Chu Jin, Second Daughter of the Chu Family)

308
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
I don't want such a sister!

309
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,340
She's shamed the entire Chu family.

310
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,520
Who are you cursing?

311
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,390
I'm cursing you!

312
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,070
You can be shameless all you want,

313
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,630
but doing something so disgraceful,

314
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,150
how are we supposed to live after this?

315
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,110
you're selfish.

316
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,950
You...

317
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,870
You should be afraid.

318
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,710
Remember,

319
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,780
misfortune comes from the mouth.

320
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,910
I'm tired today.

321
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,750
I won't argue.

322
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,670
Just watch your words from now on.

323
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,580
I'm not someone

324
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,420
to be trifled with.

325
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,470
As if I'd be afraid of you!

326
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,270
Lady Jin,

327
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,190
how can you hit My Lady?

328
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,980
Who asked you to speak?

329
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,470
So what if I hit her?

330
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,630
If you keep this up,

331
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,710
I won't be polite.

332
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,780
What? You'll hit me now?

333
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,260
You did wrong and

334
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,110
I can't even reprimand you?

335
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:15,750
Say that again!

336
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,820
I dare you!

337
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,740
Let go of me!

338
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,780
You're unreasonable!

339
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,980
I am unreasonable?

340
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,430
If you keep being so brazen,

341
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,020
- Let go!
- my fists will be the law.

342
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,510
- Let go!
- Do you understand?

343
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,610
(Xie Yun, Old Madam of Chu Family)
What is it?

344
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,480
Are you wrecking the house?

345
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,370
Are you all right?

346
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,910
Mother.

347
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,230
What happened?

348
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,500
Chu Yu hit me!

349
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,190
- Are you alright?
- Always pretending.

350
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,110
Mother,

351
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,500
I only said she disregarded

352
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,740
the Chu family's honor,

353
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,460
she tried to beat me

354
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,740
nearly to death.

355
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,430
When did I ever try to kill you?

356
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,430
Wasn't it you who

357
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,700
first smashed a cup at me?

358
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,220
If I hadn't held back,

359
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
you'd be dead already.

360
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,270
Sister, you're skilled in arms,

361
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,380
how could I offend you?

362
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,980
Just now, if I hadn't struggled,

363
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,180
I'd have been killed.

364
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,380
I had no choice but to fight back.

365
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,940
And you still dare to lie.

366
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,150
Madam,

367
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,830
I clearly saw it.

368
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,270
Lady Jin struck first

369
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,110
and hit Lady Yu.

370
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,590
You are her maid,

371
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,870
of course you'll defend her.

372
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,710
Enough.

373
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,420
Even if your sister was wrong,

374
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,830
shouldn't you give way?

375
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,400
You grew up with your father

376
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,570
and brother on the frontier

377
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,410
and got used to freedom.

378
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,720
I thought after coming to Huajing

379
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,090
you'd become sensible,

380
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,810
but you don't

381
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,010
want to be a proper

382
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,880
noble lady.

383
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,680
You disgrace yourself

384
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
in public.

385
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,960
Have you considered the Chu family's honor?

386
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,960
So what if your sister hit you?

387
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,570
Didn't you deserve it?

388
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,610
You didn't even ask me

389
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,200
why I did that today.

390
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,400
And you judged me

391
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,880
based only on Chu Jin's word.

392
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
Jin spoke the truth.

393
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,370
You'll never believe me.

394
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,290
Fine.

395
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,130
I'm used to it.

396
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,330
Think what you like.

397
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,850
I won't change anyway.

398
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,880
- Look at her!
- Madam.

399
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,720
She...

400
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,330
You're too biased.

401
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,920
This... This makes me furious.

402
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,160
Mother, it's all my fault.

403
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,370
I shouldn't have angered her.

404
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,230
(Chu Linyang, First Son of the Chu Family)

405
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,330
Seeing you pick up the spear

406
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,570
and display the Chu spearwork

407
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
puts me at ease.

408
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,120
After more than half a year of recovery,

409
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
my health

410
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,920
is fine now.

411
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,130
That's good.

412
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,850
What's wrong?

413
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,290
Still angry at Mother and Jin?

414
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,050
I'm used to it.

415
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,480
Jin

416
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,530
grew up by Mother's side.

417
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,090
If Mother is sometimes unfair,

418
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,410
it's understandable.

419
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,410
Give her time.

420
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,050
She'll come to understand you.

421
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,760
Honestly,

422
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,050
why are you getting close

423
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,770
to Wei Jun?

424
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,750
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

425
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,770
What I did today was out of desperation.

426
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,040
Please keep it secret.

427
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,530
If you forgive me,

428
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,200
meet me at the pavilion

429
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,810
in the eastern woods at dusk.

430
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,880
So, it seems

431
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,090
you weren't angered by me

432
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,930
after all.

433
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,570
At first,

434
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,810
you nearly fooled me.

435
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,130
But I know

436
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,480
General Chu has just fallen for the country.

437
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,120
You must observe three years of mourning.

438
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
The Chu family can hold no celebrations
during this.

439
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,720
Your public confession

440
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,960
was only to divert suspicion.

441
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
Have you not heard the rumors

442
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,330
that I chase men in vain

443
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,530
and long to marry into nobility?

444
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,010
The city says Lady Chu is improper

445
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,050
and rebellious.

446
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,350
But I

447
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,580
don't believe so.

448
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,520
When you accompanied Gu Chusheng,

449
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,570
that was an act of loyalty.

450
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,290
Few are so true

451
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,290
and faithful.

452
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,160
People simply

453
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,290
repeat false tales.

454
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,850
Besides, today,

455
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,440
I've seen the truth

456
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,400
outside Spring Breeze House.

457
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,640
Lady Chu, forgive me.

458
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,810
I didn't mean to mention

459
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,650
Gu Chusheng.

460
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,610
There's no need for you to apologize.

461
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,770
If anything,

462
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,290
I should say sorry to you.

463
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,810
My drastic move today

464
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,770
was because I have something

465
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,090
I need your help investigating.

466
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,610
Please, speak.

467
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,160
During the battle at Fengling, my father

468
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:14,810
was killed

469
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,480
by the North Qi army, using a strange

470
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,400
new crossbow.

471
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,250
My brother was badly injured as well.

472
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,250
When I pressed him,

473
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,090
he said

474
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,640
the weapon's power

475
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,480
was immense,

476
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,960
its mechanism fired instantly,

477
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,610
with no need for manual winding.

478
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,320
I think

479
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,130
you must know

480
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,370
this crossbow

481
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,210
better than I do.

482
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,290
(Chu)
This is the Chu family's heirloom jade token.

483
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,720
I swear on my family,

484
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,290
every word I've said is true.

485
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,380
(Chu)
Why are you getting close

486
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,290
to Wei Jun?

487
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,090
After Fengling,

488
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,330
the Chu family was shattered.

489
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,330
North Qi's weapon craft

490
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,370
was never superior to ours,

491
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,960
yet the octagonal crossbow

492
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,400
that killed Father and injured you

493
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,920
used a core trigger

494
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,370
identical to the new

495
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,210
Wei family design.

496
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,040
And that weapon hasn't

497
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,160
even been released publicly in Great Sui.

498
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,400
So I must rely on the Wei family's strength

499
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,720
to find the traitor
who leaked our military secrets

500
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,160
and make him pay in blood.

501
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,850
To the world,

502
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:17,810
I'm just a woman

503
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,650
who'd risk

504
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,680
her reputation for love.

505
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,960
So my public confession to Wei Jun,

506
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,090
even if the court hears,

507
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,570
they'll only laugh at my foolishness,

508
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,330
never suspect my true intent.

509
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,130
Yu,

510
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,210
is it worth it?

511
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,690
Brother,

512
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,090
what did all our fighting

513
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,640
bring us in the end?

514
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,290
Did anyone care about Father's death

515
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,250
or your injuries?

516
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,400
After the Chu family's fall,

517
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,370
I've never

518
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,290
seen things clearer.

519
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,960
What others won't care about,

520
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,130
I will.

521
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,290
What the world won't give me,

522
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,480
I'll find myself.

523
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,890
I don't care about anything else.

524
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,570
I just want the truth.

525
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,170
Brother,

526
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,810
you understand me, don't you?

527
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,630
Chu...

528
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,160
It's not that I don't trust you.

529
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,370
The Arsenal Bureau's new octagonal crossbow

530
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,090
indeed uses that instant-firing trigger.

531
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,770
But that mechanism is a state secret.

532
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,440
How could the North Qi

533
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,330
have obtained the design?

534
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,090
That's exactly what I want to find out.

535
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,390
Look!

536
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,240
Jun really came to meet Lady Chu!

537
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,500
- Something must be going on!
- Don't push!

538
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,350
You're stepping on me!

539
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,030
What do you think they're talking about?

540
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,960
- Don't push!
- Make room!

541
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,680
Yun, there's so much space outside,

542
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,680
why squeeze in?

543
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
I like being close to you!

544
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,610
You suspect the Arsenal Bureau,

545
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,960
and you know I oversee it,

546
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,280
yet you still bring this matter to me.

547
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,410
Aren't you afraid

548
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,480
that I might be the very traitor you seek?

549
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,390
Yun?

550
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,630
What are you doing here?

551
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,590
I...

552
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,270
You five,

553
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,350
come out too.

554
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,990
Go on.

555
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,050
Eavesdropping?

556
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,600
Who taught you that?

557
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,600
Yun.

558
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,120
What? We can't hear you, Jun.

559
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,130
We can't hear.

560
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,880
- We're leaving now.
- Yes.

561
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,090
Go, go, hurry.

562
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,070
Told you you can't beat her.

563
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,560
Stop.

564
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,680
You haven't apologized

565
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,520
to Lady Chu yet.

566
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,720
She's three years

567
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,750
older than you.

568
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,960
Don't be rude.

569
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,910
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,200
Lady Chu, forgive his insolence.

571
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,640
I'll discipline them at home.

572
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,150
Never mind.

573
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,910
Kids will be kids.

574
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
I won't make an issue.

575
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,400
What did I say to you earlier?

576
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,670
Lately it's chilly.

577
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,730
How about we go to Qinxi Valley
to avoid the cold tomorrow?

578
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,940
Lady Chu,

579
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,140
let's discuss it then.

580
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,340
Sure.

581
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,340
Goodbye.

582
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,380
Let's go.

583
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,860
Let's go home.

584
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,020
Come on.

585
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,580
I'll deal with you later.

586
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,260
You are waiting for me?

587
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,900
Why did you suddenly

588
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,740
favor my brother

589
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,460
when you had no ties before?

590
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,460
Are you asking for him?

591
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,460
Of course not.

592
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,100
Do you think I'm unworthy

593
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,180
and want to stop me?

594
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,460
You're overthinking.

595
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,820
My brother treats me well.

596
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,460
I only want to be sure

597
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,700
he won't be hurt,

598
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,340
especially emotionally.

599
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,820
Rest assured.

600
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,020
I won't hurt him.

601
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,340
You...

602
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,220
Are you really with my brother?

603
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,860
Want to know?

604
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,140
Win, and I'll tell you.

605
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,680
You lost.

606
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,960
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

607
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,840
Looking at your palm,

608
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,280
you're sure to have a chubby son.

609
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,480
It's delicious.

610
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,200
Why are you staring at me?

611
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Let Daddy see.

612
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,600
Have you washed your hands?

613
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,560
Father! Mother!

614
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,440
- Father.
- Here.

615
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,480
- Father! Mother!
- Let's eat, let's eat.

616
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,320
Father.

617
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,680
Meal time!

618
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,520
Eat, eat, eat,

619
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,480
you are still in the mood.

620
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,290
Don't you worry?

621
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,480
(Liu Xueyang, Marchioness of Zhenguo)

622
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,320
(Wei Zhong, Marquis of Zhenguo)
After Lady Chu's spectacle,

623
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,120
the whole city says

624
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,240
Jun is marrying her.

625
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,040
Lady Chu publicly begged to wed,

626
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm a bit envious.

627
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,400
You're already wed.

628
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240
What's there to envy?

629
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,040
If anyone should be envied, it's Yun.

630
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,360
- Am I right?
- Yes.

631
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,200
Right, right, right.

632
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,040
Enough.

633
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,040
The one who is most envious

634
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,320
is you yourself.

635
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,880
Eat more.

636
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,240
Jun,

637
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
what exactly is going on

638
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,360
with Lady Chu?

639
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,080
Yes, Jun,

640
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
what's happening.

641
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,760
Tell us.

642
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
- Yes.
- That's right.

643
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,000
What's going on, Jun?

644
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,920
Tell us.

645
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,800
- Come on.
- What's going on?

646
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,680
Tell us.

647
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,600
General Chu just fell in battle,

648
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,720
and Young General Chu is injured.

649
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,960
Lady Chu is trying to help

650
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,720
hold up the family.

651
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,560
That's no easy task.

652
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,720
That

653
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,880
doesn't sound right.

654
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,560
You actually praise her so much?

655
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,920
Father, Mother,

656
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,040
Lady Chu

657
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,920
is blunt by nature,

658
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,640
but

659
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,920
I find her interesting,

660
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,280
and

661
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,080
she suits Jun well.

662
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,080
Yes.

663
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,040
I agree with Feng.

664
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,880
Right.

665
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,240
I can't imagine how lively

666
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,720
it would be if Lady Chu joined

667
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,640
the Wei household.

668
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,280
Exactly.

669
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,600
I've always hoped for

670
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,640
a big sister-in-law

671
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,480
to help Mother

672
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,680
manage the household.

673
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,160
But

674
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,320
Lady Chu

675
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,280
is indeed different.

676
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,240
She's born

677
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,600
to a military family

678
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,440
and raised on the frontier,

679
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
naturally she's unlike

680
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,320
Huajing women.

681
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,720
As a woman

682
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
she eloped for love

683
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
and caused a scandal,

684
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
regardless of private morals.

685
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,240
Our military house must not

686
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,480
intermarry with such a family.

687
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,040
Eat more.

688
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Stop playing. Eat properly.

689
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,240
Father, Mother, I'm full.

690
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,600
I have some official business to attend.

691
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,440
Excuse me.

692
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,120
You barely eat anything.

693
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,400
- Jun! Jun!
- Jun,

694
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,280
you're not eating?

695
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
- Jun.
- Enjoy your meal.

696
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,200
- Look at him.
- Jun,

697
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,160
where are you going?

698
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,190
- Where are you going?
- Leaving now?

699
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,640
You are not eating?

700
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,780
I deliberately chose this

701
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,180
at the market.

702
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,060
Do you like it?

703
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,100
(Jiang Chun, Wei Shu's Wife)

704
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,940
I do.

705
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,960
(Zhang Han, Wei Qin's Wife)
look, what's different about me today?

706
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,200
You've gotten chubbier.

707
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,550
I can't believe a blockhead like you

708
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,070
actually got a wife.

709
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,700
(Yao Jue, Wei Feng's Wife)

710
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,420
The sky was fine earlier.

711
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,580
Why did it suddenly rain?

712
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,740
You heard it.

713
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
Second Brother bought her wife jewelry.

714
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,420
Why didn't you buy me anything?

715
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,470
Tomorrow night,

716
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,190
we'll taste tea

717
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,870
and watch the moon.

718
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,510
Did I hurt you?

719
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,910
No.

720
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,800
You bad boy!

721
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,000
This was my favorite pastry.

722
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,800
Try it.

723
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,220
(Xie Jiu, Wei Ya's Wife)

724
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,860
(Wang Lan, Wei Rong's Wife)

725
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,020
He kicked me.

726
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,820
Naughty boy,

727
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,700
when I return victorious next time,

728
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,060
you should be out already.

729
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,980
By then, you and your mother will come

730
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,940
to the city gate to welcome me,

731
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,980
understand?

732
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
Yes, Daddy.

733
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,110
The Arsenal Bureau's octagonal crossbow

734
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,150
harms both enemy and user,

735
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,030
so it's never been used by our

736
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,870
Great Sui army.

737
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,280
Then how

738
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,360
did North Qi

739
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,190
obtain the design?

740
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,220
(Qinxi Valley)

741
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,220
Qinxi Valley

742
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,660
is the Eldest Princess's garden.

743
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,780
Unlike the outside chill,

744
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,020
spring flowers

745
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,220
bloom here now.

746
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,020
If not for the Eldest Princess's

747
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,180
special flower-viewing event,

748
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,620
we wouldn't be allowed in

749
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,460
to enjoy

750
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,620
the blooms

751
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,500
with you,

752
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,700
Mr. Gu.

753
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,120
You are considerate, Linlang.

754
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,220
(Cao Yan, Minister of the Court
of Judicial Review; Young Master Sun)

755
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,540
(Miss Zheng; Miss Zhou)

756
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,880
Everyone in Huajing says

757
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,880
Academician Gu is handsome and talented,

758
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,200
(Wang Linlang, Daughter of Duke of Ning)
and

759
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,760
now highly favored by court.

760
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,440
You guys

761
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,240
have been outshone.

762
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,240
Academician Gu first won
the General's daughter's following,

763
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,950
then the Duke of Ning's daughter's favor,

764
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,860
such "luck"

765
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,500
we truly envy.

766
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,820
General Chu's daughter?

767
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,500
I heard Lady Chu

768
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,780
grew up on the frontier.

769
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,860
In the army

770
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,100
she never flaunted her status

771
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,980
and joked freely with soldiers,

772
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,540
ignoring gender taboos.

773
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,420
It's almost unimaginable.

774
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,340
I feel ashamed

775
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,700
for General Chu.

776
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,420
You lot!

777
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,700
Don't go too far!

778
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,580
Shut up!

779
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,460
How rude!

780
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,580
Whose maid are you?

781
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,740
She's my maid.
