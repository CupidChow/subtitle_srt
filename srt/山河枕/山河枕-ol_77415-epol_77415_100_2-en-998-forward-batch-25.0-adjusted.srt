21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
Who do you think they are?

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,710
Just a bunch of people leaning on

23
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,760
family status

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,400
to act recklessly, calling themselves

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,790
gentlemen and ladies while only

26
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,560
gossiping behind others' backs.

27
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,870
So it's Lady Chu.

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,350
No wonder you didn't

29
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,520
recognize me at first.

30
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,030
What?

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,150
Rejected by Young General Wei

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,030
and now you come

33
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,960
to Qinxi Valley to fish for

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,430
another rich groom?

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,310
Mr. Cao,

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,800
no need for more words.

37
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,280
Academician Gu may be awkward

38
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
to step forward because of his past.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,710
Ms. Wang,

40
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,520
what are you afraid of?

41
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,150
Do you expect

42
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,840
the defeated Chu Jianchang

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
to crawl out

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,310
of his coffin

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,150
and defend her?

46
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,150
Don't be rash.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,470
Who?

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Who is it?

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,000
Who hit me in the head?

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,710
Brother Wei.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,310
I'm late to the appointment.

52
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,750
Please forgive the delay.

53
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Young General Wei,

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,080
both of us serve the court,

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,470
don't blame me for warning you:

56
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,590
with Lady Chu's reputation,

57
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,310
keep your distance

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
or

59
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,590
your Marquis Mansion's honor may be sullied.

60
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
Cao Yan,

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,960
as Minister of Justice,

62
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,150
your words

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,560
are coarse and crude.

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
Wei Jun,

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,470
I give you courtesy

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,310
because of your father,

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,520
otherwise would I, Minister of Justice,

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,840
fear you?

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,310
Earlier, you called me a child,

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,750
and now, I'm the one

71
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,870
defending you here.

72
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,750
So it was you who hit me.

73
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,360
You...

74
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,240
You conspirators,

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
plotting against an imperial official!

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,000
How many heads will be enough?

77
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,270
I will not let you go.

78
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,110
Are you all right?

79
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,670
I'm fine.

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,270
Lady Chu and my Seventh Brother

81
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,800
truly have an odd fate.

82
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,270
Chu Yu,

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Wei Jun,

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,270
and you brat,

85
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,920
you coarse men-at-arms!

86
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
True,

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
we are soldiers,

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
but soldiers who protect Great Sui's

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
people and keep peace.

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,600
Lady Chu's family are meritous.

91
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,390
You shall not slander them

92
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,430
like this.

93
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,310
Fine, fine.

94
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,360
The humiliations you heaped upon me today,

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,400
I will make you

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
repay tenfold someday.

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
The Young General speaks rightly.

98
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
Let this end here.

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,670
Let's go home.

100
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
I was only trying to scare him.

101
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
How would I know the Minister of Justice

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
would...

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You got your hands dirty.

104
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,470
I...

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
Thank you,

106
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,270
Brother Wei, for your help today.

107
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,920
I will thank you properly another day.

108
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,720
Lady Chu, don't take Cao Yan's words

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,560
to heart.

110
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,560
I certainly won't take them to heart.

111
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,040
Brother Wei, let's go for a walk.

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
Alright.

113
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, got it.

114
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,240
I'll take my leave now.

115
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,960
Don't stray too far.

116
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,240
This is today's route for

117
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
Young General Wei and Wei Yun.

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,440
General,

119
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
how are you so sure

120
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,360
he'd go to

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,200
the Arsenal Bureau today?

122
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,750
Born to a military house,

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,080
you trust yourself,

124
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,310
the banner behind you,

125
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240
and the soldiers at your side.

126
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,800
Yesterday Chu Yu

127
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,450
(Chushan, Chu Linyang's Guard)
told him the octagonal crossbow

128
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,930
(Chushan, Chu Linyang's Guard)
appeared in North Qi hands,

129
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,160
how could he not go

130
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,870
check the Arsenal Bureau

131
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
to see what happened?

132
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,480
So the Arsenal Bureau's true location

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
lies in the movements

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,270
of the Wei brothers.

135
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,510
(I hope Chu Yu makes progress.)

136
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
Brother Wei,

137
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
when I

138
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,390
confessed to you atop Spring Breeze House,

139
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,840
I didn't think it through.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,030
You may publicly

141
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,750
refuse me there another day

142
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,910
and save Wei family face.

143
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,910
Lady Chu, do not take it to heart.

144
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,440
I don't mind.

145
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,440
The octagonal crossbow's instant trigger

146
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,030
comes from the Arsenal Bureau's craft,

147
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,320
so I cannot be fully blameless.

148
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,910
What you said

149
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,200
matters not only

150
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,060
to me but tightens

151
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,550
the noose on the Wei family,

152
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,670
and for Great Sui

153
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,920
as a whole.

154
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,470
I will

155
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,720
investigate this thoroughly.

156
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,670
Can't I investigate with you?

157
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,550
If the Chu family is suspected of
colluding with the enemy

158
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,750
and the Wei family is suspected of treason,

159
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,150
the stakes are high.

160
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
You have your public plan,

161
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,960
I have my worries.

162
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,550
But I promise,

163
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,910
after I investigate,

164
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,150
I will explain everything to you.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,840
I...

166
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,480
This is what I found in the grove just now.

167
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,390
Yun?

168
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
It was nearly frozen,

169
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,790
so I kept it warm in my arms.

170
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,840
When it revived

171
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,550
it scampered everywhere.

172
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,120
If you want it,

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,910
you can have it.

174
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,390
Why do you fall silent

175
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,600
as soon as I arrive?

176
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Lady Chu, please send my regards

177
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,390
to Young General Chu.

178
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,510
Thank you, Brother Wei.

179
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
We'll meet again another day.

180
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,990
Let's go.

181
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,350
My Lady.

182
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you find the spot?

183
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,360
I followed that General Wei

184
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,600
up a ridge.

185
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,120
He's like a rabbit,

186
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,360
extremely swift,

187
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,960
with a crafty guard.

188
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,750
I lost him when I

189
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,150
wasn't careful.

190
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,870
No matter.

191
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,030
The Arsenal Bureau is extremely important

192
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
for Great Sui.

193
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
It won't be easy to find.

194
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,120
Finding the exact ridge

195
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
is already good.

196
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,150
Tomorrow,

197
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll scout it myself.

198
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,350
Go now.

199
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm exhausted.

200
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Today Wei Qiu and I

201
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
ran back and forth.

202
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,030
When I asked for personnel files,

203
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,600
do you know how the deputy commander

204
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
responded?

205
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,030
He's strange

206
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,000
and headstrong.

207
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,000
I suppose he refused.

208
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,350
Yes.

209
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,510
He even asked

210
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,840
whether you had time to go to the Arsenal.

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,360
If you cannot, he said

212
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
he could come find you.

213
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,360
Jun, are you toying with me?

214
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,030
Of course not.

215
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
I sent you

216
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,960
because someone is watching me.

217
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
This is serious.

218
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
Lady Chu?

219
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,840
How could it be her?

220
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Of course not.

221
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,720
Jun,

222
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,630
between you and Lady Chu,

223
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,720
is this real?

224
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,590
Jun,

225
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,870
Lady Chu

226
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,510
may be odd,

227
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,090
but you mustn't

228
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,200
toy with her feelings.

229
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,270
Do you think I would

230
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,000
deceive a woman's heart?

231
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,120
Of course not.

232
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,480
In my eyes,

233
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,080
you're one of Great Sui's finest.

234
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,670
Ye deserve

235
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,870
the best woman.

236
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,750
I fear you may

237
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,750
fall for her beauty trap.

238
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,480
You're paying

239
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,080
extra attention to Lady Chu.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,390
Do you think she's beautiful?

241
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,350
I...

242
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,590
I...

243
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,150
I'm telling you business here.

244
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Fine.

245
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
Let me ask you,

246
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,720
what is the best woman in the world?

247
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,750
There are many women,

248
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
but the one you love

249
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,750
is the best.

250
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,600
I really want to know

251
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,270
what you will be like

252
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,360
after marriage.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,840
Will you

254
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,390
stay as mischievous?

255
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,470
I...

256
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,230
See you later.

257
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,580
(Tong; General Wei Jun)

258
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,080
This is the instant trigger
from the octagonal crossbow.

259
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,200
You...

260
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,270
This was brought back

261
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,150
at great risk by my brother

262
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,270
from the Fengling battlefield.

263
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,870
It's made by North Qi.

264
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,600
Brother Wei, I know you're upright.

265
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,960
To investigate

266
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,000
you need evidence.

267
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,390
If my brother distrusts you,

268
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,120
I'll believe you once.

269
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,870
(If there's a traitor in the Arsenal Bureau,)

270
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,870
(who might it be?)

271
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,150
Urgent news!

272
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,960
Urgent news!

273
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,240
Urgent news!

274
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,620
(Chengqing Gate)

275
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,460
(Loyalty and Valor)

276
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,280
Jun,

277
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,680
if I win today,

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,840
when we next march,

279
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,110
you'll ask Father to let me

280
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,450
skip the drawing of lots for duty, alright?

281
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,050
I want to return to the battlefield.

282
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,350
Yun,

283
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,510
you know Father's rules.

284
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Yun,

285
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,440
you've gone to war

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,280
three times in a row.

287
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,160
Give your brothers

288
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,070
a chance.

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,680
Qin, it's just bad luck you drew guard duty

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
three times in a row.

291
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,660
Jun, watch this move!

292
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,280
In five moves,

293
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,480
Yun will lose.

294
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,830
That's already good.

295
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,440
Previously he couldn't last

296
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,680
two hundred moves against Jun.

297
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,790
Now

298
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,960
it's nearly even.

299
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,110
Indeed,

300
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,590
at Yun's age

301
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,750
I could never beat Jun.

302
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,670
- Father.
- Father.

303
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,870
Father.

304
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,830
His Majesty commands:

305
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,750
North Qi is agitating;

306
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,550
the northern border is urgent.

307
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,110
The Wei army

308
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,440
will mobilize at once

309
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,920
to respond.

310
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,040
Yes!

311
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,790
- Jun.
- Yun,

312
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,000
I have somewhere to go.

313
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,590
I'll be back soon.

314
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,750
Go pick up some cloth later,

315
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,020
- don't forget.
- Yes.

316
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,900
(Chu Mansion)

317
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,430
Young General Wei.

318
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Please tell Lady Chu Yu,

319
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,110
Wei Jun requests

320
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,080
an urgent message.

321
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,790
Lady Chu is out and hasn't come home.

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,830
General Wei, perhaps you should

323
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,670
wait a while?

324
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,590
No, better not.

325
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,440
That would damage your household's reputation.

326
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,830
Please deliver this letter

327
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,070
to Lady Chu.

328
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,840
Farewell.

329
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,940
(Chu Mansion)

330
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,300
(Chu Mansion)

331
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,660
(True Might)

332
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,680
Is Xie Jiu

333
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,830
still sulking with you?

334
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,830
We're still the same,

335
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,830
familiar,

336
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,480
yet distant.

337
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,350
Yun,

338
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,310
believe me or not,

339
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,830
the unlucky rear-guard post this time

340
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,440
- is yours.
- Don't curse me.

341
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm not just going to the front,

342
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,960
I'll crush North Qi completely.

343
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,310
When they hear my name,

344
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,310
Wei Yun,

345
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
they'll flee in terror.

346
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,080
First draw gets the spot!

347
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,320
Yun, don't cheat.

348
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,980
(Rear Guard)

349
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,200
Yun.

350
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Looks like I was right.

351
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,720
Doesn't count, let's draw again!

352
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,830
- Impossible.
- Let me draw again!

353
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,670
Yun,

354
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,270
it's already settled.

355
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,680
You can't

356
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,750
go back on it.

357
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,550
Yun.

358
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,220
(True Might)

359
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,190
Zhong,

360
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,350
why are you leaving

361
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,680
earlier than planned?

362
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,440
Don't worry,

363
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
I'll return

364
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,080
victorious.

365
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,350
My dear sons,

366
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,590
take care of yourselves,

367
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
and your father.

368
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,510
Don't worry, Mother.

369
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

370
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,150
Depart!

371
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:29,780
May you return victorious!

372
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,460
(Wei)
May you return victorious!

373
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,070
May you return victorious!

374
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,910
My Lady.

375
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,110
Chu Shan,

376
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,110
why are you standing outside?

377
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,160
Let me tell you,

378
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,310
I'm exhausted today.

379
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,160
If not for fear of arousing suspicion,

380
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,310
I'd have brought more men

381
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,160
to find the Arsenal Bureau.

382
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,880
- Earlier...
- I've been running all day.

383
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,350
- I...
- What's the matter?

384
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,070
What is it? Speak.

385
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,200
While you were out,

386
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,440
Young General Wei came to see you.

387
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,350
He waited,

388
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,350
then left a letter for you.

389
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,070
The first one there

390
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,070
is actually the Crown Prince.

391
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,440
This time His Highness himself

392
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
will oversee the campaign.

393
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,590
The Crown Prince is even

394
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,930
(Li Huan, the Crown Prince)
younger than Yun

395
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
and has no field experience.

396
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,240
How could His Majesty send him

397
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,880
(Yao Yong, the State-Supporting General)
as overseer?

398
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,110
His Majesty's mind

399
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,880
is not for us to guess.

400
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,630
No matter.

401
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,480
We'll just fight the enemy.

402
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,680
Jun, we are setting out today,

403
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,070
why is she not here to see you off?

404
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,440
Today's departure was sudden,

405
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,920
and earlier than planned.

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,030
I can understand.

407
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,310
"To Lady Chu:

408
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
I hope this letter

409
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
finds you well.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,310
I depart today for war.

411
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,680
Please be at ease.

412
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,350
I

413
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,640
never meant to hinder you,

414
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,070
but the Arsenal Bureau

415
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,550
is the empire's critical stronghold.

416
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,510
There are only two ways in.

417
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,440
Once I return victorious,

418
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,440
you shall have your answer."

(To Lady Chu)

442
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,350
Linyang.

443
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
It's walnut cookies from Jiqing Pastry.

444
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,590
They are still warm.

445
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
Try one.

446
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,240
Still troubled by the

447
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,910
Arsenal Bureau?

448
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,030
Wei Jun mentioned it

449
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,590
in his letter—

450
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,310
there are only two ways

451
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,440
to enter:

452
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,510
a royal decree,

453
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,790
or

454
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,590
an official post

455
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,440
or token of authority.

456
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,350
We can't hope for a decree

457
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,830
or appointment,

458
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,550
but what is that "token"?

459
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,480
He didn't say.

460
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,110
Still,

461
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,680
if he told me this much,

462
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,480
then once he returns victorious,

463
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,750
we'll investigate together.

464
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,190
Linyang.

465
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,080
Linyang.

466
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,920
It's cold at night.

467
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,160
Why are you here instead of

468
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,240
staying in your room?

469
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,560
Put this on.

470
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
You're thoughtful, Jin.

471
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,510
You always think of her first,

472
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,720
never of me

473
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
when you have something delicious.

474
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,200
Jin,

475
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,040
yours has already

476
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,350
been sent to your room

477
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,350
by Chu Shan.

478
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,880
Really?

479
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Really.

480
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,270
I knew it.

481
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,400
Brother always

482
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,920
thinks of me first.

483
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,920
What's so funny?

484
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,310
I heard

485
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,960
you went to see Wei Jun again.

486
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,790
You've really gone to great lengths

487
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,310
for this marriage.

488
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,520
Jin,

489
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,400
Yu's contact with Wei Jun

490
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,790
is not for

491
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,750
his family status.

492
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,680
Don't speak with barbs.

493
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,880
Whether I marry Wei Jun

494
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,160
or another,

495
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,030
it will be because I love him,

496
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,270
not to climb.

497
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,960
Your confession

498
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
at Spring Breeze house

499
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,640
was showy and trying to

500
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,550
draw his attention,

501
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,200
and now you

502
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,640
hide behind lofty reasons.

503
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,590
I did that because

504
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,240
my nature is what it is.

505
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,240
While you,

506
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,440
with your refined airs—

507
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,290
what's under

508
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,160
your bed?

509
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,350
Pai gow, dice,

510
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,590
and that other thing...

511
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,430
You went through my stuff!

512
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,550
You just didn't hide them well.

513
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,110
Ask around the household,

514
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,280
everyone knows.

515
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,350
Stop glaring at me.

516
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,350
Why stop?

517
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,830
I won't stop!

518
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,920
Enough.

519
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,400
Don't fight.

520
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,640
Linyang, you needn't intervene.

521
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,270
- Glare again!
- So what?

522
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,640
- I dare you!
- Try me!

523
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,480
You asked for this!

524
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,440
You dare hit me!

525
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,750
Come on, catch me.

526
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,270
- You can't catch me.
- Chu Yu!

527
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,240
Chu Yu!

528
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,960
Come on. I'm here.

529
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,440
- If I catch you,
- You think you can?

530
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,340
you'll regret this!

531
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,080
(Chu Mansion)
You can catch me?

532
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,480
- No way!
- Chu Yu!

533
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,420
(Wei Encampment)

534
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,140
(Wei)

535
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,860
Why did Father suddenly mobilize the army?

536
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,920
Weren't we only to defend the city?

537
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,000
Why change

538
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,840
after only a month?

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Report from the front:

540
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,840
North Qi forces have retreated to Baidi Valley.

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,960
They're fewer than twenty thousand.

542
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,950
The Crown Prince ordered us

543
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,000
to pursue the victory.

544
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,440
Baidi Valley is a depression.

545
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Though we have more men,

546
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
it will be a fierce battle.

547
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,830
Why not plan tactics

548
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,670
before pursuit?

549
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,310
It's a military order.

550
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
I...

551
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,680
Yun,

552
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,520
don't worry.

553
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,030
When we return

554
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,270
we'll teach you

555
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,200
battlefield craft.

556
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,110
I...

557
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,280
Stop that.

558
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,390
Yun,

559
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,240
stay and guard the rear.

560
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,080
When we return

561
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,350
we'll celebrate, drink,

562
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,320
and have reunion meals.

563
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,950
Yun,

564
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,240
guard the camp well.

565
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
Believe your brothers.

566
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,240
We will return victorious.

567
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,480
Jun,

568
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,080
give the orders.

569
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,720
Wei soldiers,

570
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,160
out there today,

571
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,000
united we fight,

572
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,960
united we die!

573
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,400
Protect the nation

574
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,110
with no regrets!

575
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,960
Protect the nation

576
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,350
with no regrets!

577
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,830
Protect the nation

578
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
with no regrets!

579
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,960
Protect the nation

580
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,510
with no regrets!

581
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,110
Protect the nation

582
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,640
with no regrets!

583
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,390
March out!

584
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,340
(Wei)

585
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,660
(Sui)

586
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,540
(Qi)

587
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,340
(Su Cha, North Qi General)

588
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,510
Charge!

589
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,830
Charge!

590
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:02,690
Charge! Charge! Charge!

591
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:09,400
Charge! Charge! Charge!

592
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,800
Retreat!

593
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
Retreat!

594
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,120
Retreat now!

595
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,000
In this battle, we will

596
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,960
crush North Qi so thoroughly

597
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,120
they won't dare attack for ten years.

598
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,590
I'll take the head of

599
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,110
North Qi's war god Su Cha.

600
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,360
What bad luck!

601
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,030
When we get back

602
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,630
I'll hire a fortune-teller

603
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,550
to wipe it out.

604
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,800
Young General,

605
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,150
you've been to the front so often.

606
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,000
Take a break this time.

607
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,800
How can I rest with enemies to kill?

608
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,960
I want North Qi to quake

609
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,070
at the sound of my name,

610
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,710
earn the greatest merits,

611
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,840
and hold the highest office,

612
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,670
even higher than my father.

613
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,320
Alright, alright.

614
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,670
At this time,

615
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,550
they should have been

616
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,590
entered Baidi Valley.

617
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,000
Charge!

618
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,320
Halt!

619
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,580
(Wei)

620
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,280
Oh no!

621
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,120
Ambush!

622
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,840
Fall back!

623
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
Take cover!

624
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,510
General, the intelligence was wrong.

625
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,120
The enemy is far larger than twenty thousand.

626
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,000
There must be

627
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,070
a spy who fed false reports.

628
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,110
Spy again?

629
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,480
Charge!

630
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,960
Charge!

631
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,510
Charge out!

632
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,700
Charge!

633
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,840
Charge!

634
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,430
(An octagonal crossbow?)

635
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Shu!

636
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,150
Shu!

637
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,320
Father!

638
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
