(Be Loyal and Courageous)

22
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,150
Your Highness.

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,680
Do you have any idea

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,070
where I was earlier?

25
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,590
You had 18 cases

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
of betrothal gifts

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,240
delivered to Miss Song.

28
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,680
It was a spectacle.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,680
It's now the talk of the town.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,630
Are you saying this

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,840
to mock me?

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
Qingping and I have been engaged.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
But when I arrived,

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,920
she broke it off

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,360
in public.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,630
It must have spread

37
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,280
all over the city.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,240
You're the Crown Prince.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,910
Every move you make

40
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
catches attention.

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,400
What you actually do

42
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
does not matter.

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Besides,

44
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,750
compared to you,

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
this breakup case

46
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,310
would have a much greater impact

47
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,910
on Miss Song.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,870
Chu Linyang.

49
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,680
You really know how to keep your cool.

50
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,470
For a man like you,

51
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,470
Qingping refused to be

52
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,310
the Crown Princess.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
You must be

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,000
feeling very proud now.

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
With all due respect,

56
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,280
I'd like to be frank, Your Highness.

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,240
What Miss Song did

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,800
surprised me as well.

59
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,470
But regardless of whether

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,800
she truly meant to break it off,

61
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,240
she and I

62
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,120
weren't meant to be.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,310
Are you saying this

64
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,520
to calm me down,

65
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,590
because of who my father is?

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Your Highness,

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,280
instead of guessing

68
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,310
whether I'm the reason

69
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,240
Miss Song broke it off,

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,470
you should think more

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,560
about whether you can give her

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,080
the life she wants.

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,590
If you can't,

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,280
she would still make

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,560
the same choice

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,240
even without me.

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,980
(Sui)

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,880
General.

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,750
Every time you're upset,

80
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,630
you do this.

81
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,120
Is it because you just said something

82
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,920
that you didn't mean?

83
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,040
Which part of that

84
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,000
wasn't the truth?

85
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,710
The truth

86
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,720
may not be true feelings.

87
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,790
Huajing City

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,870
isn't where I belong.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,870

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
on the battlefield.

91
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,910
One day,

92
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,070
I will return to Fengling City.

93
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,040
I must get back

94
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,800
what I lost there.

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Miss Song

96
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,040
isn't a caged bird.

97
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,680
But she's a noble lady, after all.

98
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,870
If we're destined to part forever,

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,070
why do we even start?

this is for you.

Jin,

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,840
I broke my promise.

105
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,110
It was my fault.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,840
Hit me.

107
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,270
No, no, no.

108
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,510
She's a gentle lady.

109
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,310
She won't hit me.

110

with His Highness.

113
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,560

about apologizing to Jin?

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,830

116

it must be a gift

142
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,250
from Mr. Song.

143
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,640
He must have realized

144
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,120
he was wrong.

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360

151
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,560
But I won't accept anything

152
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,750
just for money.

153
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,430
Since he has his ambitions,

154
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,040

My Lady,

157
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
this is just your grief talking.

158
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,120
Look, you came here.

159
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
What does that mean?

160
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,630
It means

161
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,190
you still care about Mr. Song

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000

No.

164
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520

173
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,870
It means I'm not that important

to him.

175
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,270
He broke his promise first.

176
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,200

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,230
I promised Jin

194
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,990
I would never go to the battlefield.

195
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,800
But if I make contributions

196
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,700
on the battlefield,

197
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,120
won't she benefit too?

198
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm a skilled fighter anyway.

199
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
I won't get hurt easily.

200
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,380
Wenchang,

201
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,860
it might seem trivial

202
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,500
in your eyes.

203
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,740
But to Ms. Chu Jin,

204
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,180
you even failed to keep

205
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,060
such a small promise.

206
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,380
How can she ever trust you again?

207
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,900
822.

208
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,860
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

209
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,020
823.

210
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,340
- You weren't at work.
- 824.

211
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,380
- So, you're tired of writing.
- 825.

212
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,700
Now, you use a sword.

213
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,220
826.

214
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,860
Chusheng.

215
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,100
Why are you here?

216
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,900
Zhang An told me

217
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,220
you quit your job

218
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,900
and will join the army.

219
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,220
I will be Minister of Personnel.

220
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,380
There'll be a vacancy

221
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,220
for my old position.

222
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,740
Are you sure you will

223
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,020
leave at this time?

224
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,700
This sword

225
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,980
is heavier than I imagined.

226
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,860
But swinging this sword

227
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,500
is easier for me

228
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,340
than writing at work.

229
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,940
Now, generals are in high demand.

230
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
There, I'll have more chances

231
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,020
to stand out.

232
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,860
After all,

233
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm from a military family.

234
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,700
Father lifted the ban

235
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,980
that prevented his sons

236
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,820
from going to war.

237
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,100
I should try.

238
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,140
Besides, Chusheng,

239
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,940
your path and mine

240
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,540
are destined to vary.

241
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,820
What if Wenchang

242
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,180
steals your thunder?

243
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
He doesn't have what it takes.

244
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,260
I'm sparkling in the family.

245
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,820
My other brothers

246
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,420
complain a lot about me.

247
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,300
My eldest brother

248
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,380
has been hearing

249
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,620
a lot of rumors.

250
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,340
He doesn't bother.

251
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,980
But he has stood up for me.

252
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,940
On the battlefield,

253
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,980
weapons have no eyes.

254
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,100
People get hurt.

255
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,420
It's time

256
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,900
I protected him.

257
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,940
I hope you'll get what you want.

258
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,300
What about you?

259
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,500
Have you thought

260
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
about using the Crown Prince

261
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,780
to break away from the Duke of Ning?

262
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,940
That's the plan.

263
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,660
But I need to be patient.

264
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,140
Master,

265
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,700
Ms. Chu Yu sent a message, asking

266
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,180
to meet you at Spring Breeze House.

267
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,900
I didn't dare to tell Madam.

268
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,700
So, I brought it to you.

269
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,380
(To Gu Chusheng)

270
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,060
(I'll see you at the Shen hour
at Spring Breeze House.)

271
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,500
(Bring what you found
at Qinxi Valley. By Chu Yu)

272
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,780
Since Mrs. Wei saved you

273
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,860
from the Gu family,

274
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,020
the two of you have reconciled.

275
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,340
But Chusheng,

276
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,540
I've heard

277
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,900
since she returned to her own family,

278
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
she hasn't got along

279
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,660
with Wei Yun.

280
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,580
She wants to see you at this time.

281
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
You must think carefully.

282
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,020
At last, she has to come to me.

283
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,780
You're right.

284
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,580
I should think carefully.

285
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,220
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

286
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,060
Did he really go out?

287
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,460
Not only did he go out,

288
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,940
what's even stranger,

289
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,180
he was wearing a new outfit.

290
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,980
He must be meeting someone

291
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,580
very important.

292
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,980
No one but Chu Yu

293
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,780
can make him

294
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
care about his looks.

295
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,600
- It's a good place.
- Really?

296
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,530
I told you about it.

297
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,620
- Welcome.
- Is it fine?

298
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,890
- This way, please.
- Alright.

299
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,140
Let's sit over there.

300
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,710
What would you like to eat? My treat.

301
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,670
- Anything.
- Sit.

302
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,140
Mr. Gu, you seem surprised

303
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,180
to see me here.

304
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,700
Yu is married,

305
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,020
and so are you.

306
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,540
You shouldn't meet alone.

307
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,180
These days, in Huajing City,

308
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,300
people gossip a lot.

309
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
As her brother,

310
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,020
I have to be here.

311
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,900
Mr. Gu,

312
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,260
take a seat.

313
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,900
Mrs. Wei, what is it you want

314
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,380
to see me about?

315
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
I think you know why.

316
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,300
What on earth

317
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,260
did you find

318
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,420
at Qinxi Valley?

319
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,900
Is this the only reason

320
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,780
you wanted to see me?

321
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,300
Or what?

322
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,540
Thank you for your fair judgment

323
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,260
that brought Yao Yong to justice.

324
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,860
After we parted,

325
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
you were gone for days.

326
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,820
I meant to see you,

327
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,140
but I was held back

328
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,980
in Yao Yong's case.

329
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,180
Compared to that,

330
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,180
I would rather hear you say,

331
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,820
"Be safe."

332
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,580
Where is that stuff?

333
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,380
Yao Yong is dead.

334
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,620
Everything is settled.

335
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,580
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

336
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,900
(20 spies to serve General Yao.)
Is this clue

337
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,300
still that important?

338
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,460
Of course.

339
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,740
This secret letter

340
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,740
indeed can prove Yao Yong's sin.

341
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,380
I also thought that

342
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,860
by sending killers after you,

343
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,140
Yao Yong aims to
divide me and Wei Yu,

344
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,780
so he can crush us individually.

345
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
But Yao Yong did not know

346
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,120
anything about it.

347
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,210
He even believes

348
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,140
Wei Yun and I

349
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,620
would appear at Dingfeng Valley.

350
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,180
So it was someone else

351
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,660
who wanted to kill me.

352
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,980
But the paper of this letter

353
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,540
is ordinary.

354
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,660
And you read it.

355
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,860
Nothing is special.

356
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,000
In that case,

357
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,540
why don't you give it to me?

358
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,980
I'll keep pursuing it.

359
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,340
Maybe I can find

360
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,220
some new clues.

361
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,060
Yu,

362
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,540
it's very hard

363
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
to investigate alone.

364
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,660
Let me

365
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,780
do it with you.

366
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,060
You're Minister of Justice.

367
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,860
It's indeed your duty

368
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,380
to clean up North Qi remnants.

369
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,660
But after holding it

370
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,580
for some days,

371
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,980
you made no progress.

372
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,740
Why don't you let Yu do it?

373
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,500
She may achieve something.

374
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,660
And I will accompany her.

375
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,260
She won't be alone.

376
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,700
Am I

377
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,900
interrupting?

378
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,260
Gu, you're so well dressed.

379
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,540
I thought you would
meet an honored guest.

380
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,220
So, you were meeting Mrs. Wei

381
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,700
and General Chu.

382
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,540
I don't think we should get involved

383
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,620
in your conversation.

384
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,420
So, we'll take our leave.

385
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,260
Chu Yu.

386
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,460
Now that I'm here,

387
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,700
let's make everything clear.

388
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,900
I'm always a decent woman.

389
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,340
But today,

390
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,300
I will lay everything out

391
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,060
and make it clear

392
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,700
between you and Gu

393
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,460
regardless of my dignity.

394
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,140
He never dared

395
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,020
to ask you something.

396
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,930
I'll ask for him, too.

397
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,790
Linlang.

398
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,100
General Chu is also here.

399
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,260
You tell me in his face.

400
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,940
Will you and Gu

401
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,860
get back together?

402
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,460
Haven't you figured it out yet?

403
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,860
It's not Chu Yu who stands between us.

404
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,660
It's you and your father

405
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,060
who stand between Chu Yu and me.

406
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,940
Indeed.

407
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,380
My father forced you to marry me.

408
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,140
But your career

409
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,980
also took off

410
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
with my family's power.

411
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,140
Gu Chusheng,

412
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,420
you can't be so ungrateful.

413
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,940
You can't pursue power

414
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,140
and Chu Yu at the same time.

415
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,340
You're right.

416
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,900
I was forced.

417
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
But I did get

418
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,700
what I wanted.

419
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,540
But I, Gu Chusheng,

420
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
will never be a puppet

421
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,700
of you and your father.

422
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
Linlang,

423
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,380
you think I'm greedy.

424
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,780
Then tell me.

425
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,060
When your father held a dagger

426
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,580
to my neck,

427
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,540
what would you choose if you were me?

428
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,580
Chu Yu,

429
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,140
did you hear that?

430
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,540
Wang Linlang,

431
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,940
it's never me who stands

432
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
between the two of you.

433
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,300
And it's not you who stands

434
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,700
between the two of us.

435
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,460
Your problem

436
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,940
doesn't concern me.

437
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
Linyang, let's go.

438
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,660
(Spring Breeze House)

439
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,580
Linlang,

440
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,020
you're a good woman,

441
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,340
but I only love her.

442
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,700
I was telling the truth.

443
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
It's not Chu Yu

444
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,940
but your father

445
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,580
who stands between us.

446
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,540
If I hadn't been made

447
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,180
to marry you like that,

448
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,940
you and I might not be so miserable.

449
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,260
I know you hate him.

450
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,140
But after all,

451
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,700
I am the reason

452
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,100
he's been forcing you.

453
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,260
I know you want me

454
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,100
to back down.

455
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,220
Back down?

456
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,580
Your father colluded with outsiders,

457
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,980
trying to kill me.

458
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,420
Did he also do that

459
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
to make me back down?

460
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,900
What are you saying?

461
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,580
That's impossible.

462
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,540
My father wouldn't do that.

463
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,220
Gu,

464
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,420
my father arranged everything

465
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,260
to get you back from the southwest.

466
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,140
He cleared your record,

467
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,340
got you in the exam,

468
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,620
and even made you Minister of Justice.

469
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,940
Everyone at court knows

470
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,580
you're his most trusted man.

471
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,700
Why would he kill you?

472
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,940
No one but your father

473
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,460
knew where I was that day.

474
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,020
This is all I need to say.

475
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,220
What Gu Chusheng just said

476
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,540
was intended for you, perhaps.

477
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,180
I know.

478
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,660
He even used Ms. Wang

479
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,900
to make sure I would know.

480
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,820
He's trying to make me relent.

481
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,460
It seems that he knows me better

482
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,420
than I think he does.

483
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,100
Then, Yu.

484
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,740
He didn't have a choice then.

485
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,340
The two of you...

486
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,540
We won't be back together.

487
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,500
Nothing will help.

488
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,140
After all,

489
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,100
he had a third option.

490
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,780
To explain everything to me

491
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,740
and face it with me.

492
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,140
But he didn't.

493
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,340
A woman like me

494
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,620
will only look forward.

495
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,420
What's so funny?

496
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,700
Well, it's...

497
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,020
There was a time

498
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,780
when I said the same

499
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,940
to Wei Yun.

500
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,580
Come on. One more.

501
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,980
Congratulations, Yun.

502
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,020
You've had revenge.

503
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,540
Cheers.

504
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,460
What's wrong?

505
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,060
What's bothering him?

506
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,860
Can't you see?

507
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,180
He's trapped in love.

508
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,980
I know.

509
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,460
Then, who does he like?

510
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,380
Do you really not know that?

511
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,580
Just tell me.

512
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,660
Ms. Chu Yu.

513
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,940
I knew it.

514
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,940
Tragic, huh?

515
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,100
But in that case,

516
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,740
our seniority will get messed up.

517
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,700
He and Ms. Chu Yu...

518
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,460
Ms. Chu Yu is his sister-in-law.

519
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,140
What shall I call her, then?

520
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,420
What are you doing?

521
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm the one who sees
a lot of pretty women

522
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,020
but cares for none of them.

523
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,420
In Huajing City,

524
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,980
I'm known to all,

525
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,140
loved by all,

526
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,980
and supported by all.

527
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,260
Do you need our help?

528
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,700
(Always Fortunate, Always Propitious)

529
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,060
(Chu Mansion)
Take a look.

530
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,500
Make the lanterns align.

531
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,500
- Sure.
- Be careful.

532
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,340
Alright.

533
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,340
Leave this to me.

534
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,820
Alright.

535
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,300
The two of you, hang it properly.

536
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,430
- Sure.
- Alright.

537
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,220
(15 supply carts sent by General Yao
have entered North Qi.)

538
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,800
(20 spies have been sent
into Great Sui to serve General Yao.)

539
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,860
My Lady!

540
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,260
Master! Madam!

541
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,860
Come out and see!

542
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,340
Mother,

543
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,980
so many treasures.

544
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,940
Jin.

545
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,300
(Wei)
Wei?

546
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,700
So, I'm sure

547
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,180
these things are for Chu Yu.

548
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,060
Why did they deliver

549
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
so many gifts?

550
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,300
Wei.

551
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,500
Marquis of Zhenguo is here.

552
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,140
Why are you here?

553
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,220
Don't be so disrespectful.

554
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,180
Yeah.

555
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,500
Don't scare him away.

556
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,860
I'm here for Ms. Chu Yu.

557
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,100
Young Marquis,

558
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,420
what do you mean?

559
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,460
Greetings, Madam Chu.

560
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,780
And General Chu.

561
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,340
Ms. Chu Yu got married

562
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,220
in such haste.

563
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,580
It took us

564
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,740
a very long time

565
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,580
to regain our status.

566
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,740
So, her wedding

567
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,580
was delayed.

568
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,100
These are

569
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,060
some thank-you gifts for her.

570
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,580
Please check.

571
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,180
Mother, let me do it.

572
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,300
I'm good at that.

573
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,340
(Catalog)

574
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,380
It's so generous of His Lordship.

575
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,020
Thank-you gift?

576
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,820
Why do I think

577
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,740
they're like betrothal gifts?

578
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,900
Speaking of which,

579
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,420
Yu married into your family

580
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,780
without traditional marriage rituals.

581
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,060
It seems that

582
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,460
you're making it up

583
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,500
for General Wei.

584
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,540
That's not true.

585
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,420
I'm not doing this for him.

586
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,340
So, on whose behalf

587
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,660
are you doing this?

588
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,780
On his own behalf, of course.

589
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,180
We have regained our status

590
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,780
with Ms. Chu's great help.

591
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,980
If my parents were alive,

592
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,740
they would also prepare...

593
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,700
The thank-you gifts.

594
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,100
I'm just doing this

595
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,940
for my parents.

596
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,980
What if I ask you

597
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,940
for a divorce paper?

598
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,740
Then, as the former Mrs. Wei,

599
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,220
she still deserves

600
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,060
all these things.

601
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,460
Thank you, Young Marquis

602
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,300
for your generosity.

603
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,100
But I don't think

604
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,340
she wants the paper now.

605
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,340
What are they talking about?

606
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,260
Are you sure?

607
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,900
My brother is right.

608
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,660
I need to think it over.

609
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,100
Stop talking in riddles.

610
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,940
I don't understand.

611
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,580
It's getting late.

612
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
Your Lordship,

613
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,340
why don't you stay for a meal?

614
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,660
- No need.
- Alright.

615
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,620
Young Marquis is here

616
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,020
with so many gifts,

617
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,940
but you don't keep him for a meal.

618
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,100
If it gets out,

619
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,340
people will laugh at us

620
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,020
for being impolite.

621
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,860
That's right.

622
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,020
Your Lordship,

623
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,980
come in, please.

624
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,940
Thank you, Madam Chu.

625
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,820
But without Ms. Chu's permission,

626
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
I wouldn't have it.

627
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,460
Come in, please.

628
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,900
Make yourself at home.

629
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,460
Eat more.

630
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,940
Thank you, Madam Chu.

631
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,500
Here. Have some more.

632
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,580
- It's enough.
- It's fine.

633
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,100
- Really.
- Help yourself.

634
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,940
Yu,

635
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,580
I had our cook make this.

636
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,580
Taste it.

637
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,220
Does it taste the same as before?

638
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,060
It's delicious.

639
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,060
Linyang,

640
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,820
why do you only

641
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,260
serve her food again?

642
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,740
Here.

643
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,220
This is for you, Jin.

644
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,740
Alright?

645
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,100
But I don't like fried fish.

646
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,620
When Linyang serves you food,

647
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,100
just say thank you.

648
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,100
Don't be so obstinate.

649
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,380
Or what will you do

650
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,940
when you get married?

651
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
Your Lordship,

652
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,620
sorry for that.

653
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,460
Please excuse her.

654
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,540
It's nothing.

655
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,420
Don't worry, Madam Chu.

656
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,180
I knew

657
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,220
you would be

658
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,420
a most polite man.

659
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,940
Now your family

660
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,980
has restored its vitality.

661
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,740
Many matchmakers

662
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,860
are scrambling
to arrange a marriage for you.

663
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,300
I was wondering,

664
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,420
have you decided
whom to marry?

665
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,620
Not yet.

666
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,180
Your Lordship,

667
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,620
you're impressive.

668
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,100
At such a young age,
you've done much in war.

669
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,140
And you're from a noble family.

670
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,380
You certainly have high standards.

671
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,380
It's too soon to think of that.

672
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:18,900
Currently,

673
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,420
you're a leading general.

674
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
It's time you considered

675
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,340
your marriage thing.

676
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,220
I have someone in mind

677
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,940
who would be a good fit.

678
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,620
I wonder if you will

679
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,740
think about it.

680
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,620
You don't need
to get Chu Yu's consent.

681
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,780
Do you yourself want to?

682
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,500
What do you think of our Chu Jin?

683
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,620
- No.
- No.

684
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,460
Why?

685
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,380
You're both single.

686
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,580
Besides,

687
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,490
military families
have made repeated merits.

688
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,420
Now,

689
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,500
His Majesty has permitted

690
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,460
marriages between military families.

691
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,140
I can tell that you don't

692
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,420
reject our family.

693
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,180
Chu Yu is a good woman.

694
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,140
Chu Jin is

695
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,660
even better.

696
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Mother has a point.

697
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,100
However,

698
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,780
the three of you said no.

699
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,980
There should be reasons.

700
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,620
Tell Mother the reasons.

701
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,500
- Jin, you go first.
- I...

702
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,460
But I want Ms. Chu Yu

703
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,940
to say it first.

704
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,620
Anyone who lives

705
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,700
in the Wei family

706
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,580
needs martial arts.

707
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,940
Jin has no martial arts at all.

708
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,220
She can learn.

709
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
I can teach her.

710
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,620
Why don't you tell me

711
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,060
what kind of woman

712
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,900
would fit me?

713
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,060
A woman whom you like

714
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,620
and who likes you back.

715
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,540
Mother,

716
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,300
I'll never marry a man

717
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,660
who goes to war.

718
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,220
This is my rule.

719
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,300
- You...
- Yeah.

720
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,140
I agree.

721
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,500
Warriors may die in the war.

722
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,980
It's risky to marry me.

723
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,660
You guys talk.

724
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,220
I have things to do.

725
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,300
I'll take my leave.

726
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,740
Young Marquis,

727
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,620
let's play chess.

728
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,020
Shall we?

729
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,260
Let's go.

730
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,220
Why are you taking me

731
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,060
to Chu Mansion?

732
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,420
Jin doesn't want to see me.

733
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,500
Didn't you say

734
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,900
Young Marquis Wei

735
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,860
took Mr. Lu's advice

736
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,060
and delivered betrothal gifts?

737
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,020
Don't you want

738
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,860
to take a look?

739
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,860
Besides,

740
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,580
since when have you been so timid?

741
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,500
Ms. Chu Jin doesn't come to you.

742
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,900
But you can go see her.

743
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,260
Right.

744
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,940
You're right.

745
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,140
Let's go.

746
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,740
Catch up.

747
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,420
You little fool.

748
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,700
Young Marquis Wei is perfect.

749
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,060
Even your brother helps you

750
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,220
to find out his thoughts.

751
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,900
You must seize the opportunity.

752
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,300
Oh, Mother.

753
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,920
My heart belongs to someone else.

754
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,780
I just haven't made up my mind.

755
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,350
Don't make a mismatch.

756
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,940
I'm doing this for your good.

757
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,060
You silly girl.

758
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,140
So many dishes aren't finished.

759
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,620
Do you think this game

760
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,700
can be won?

761
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,500
It's not the end yet.

762
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,980
No one can predict.

763
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,780
You're playing

764
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,420
in quite an unusual way.

765
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,940
Special, indeed.

766
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,820
Before, I didn't like

767
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,660
to play like this.

768
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,780
In that case,

769
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,260
you're behaving

770
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,460
quite like Yu.

771
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,490
There's nothing wrong
with being unusual.

772
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,540
Conforming isn't wrong, either.

773
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,900
But when making a decision,

774
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,580
one should ask himself

775
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,340
what he really wants.

776
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,620
Sounds like you have

777
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,700
thought very clearly.

778
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,580
It won't be

779
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,100
an easy road.

780
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
But if I do nothing,

781
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,140
I will regret it.

782
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,580
You can regret in a game.

783
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,460
But human life

784
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,780
is always limited.

785
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,060
Young Marquis,

786
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,260
I have to remind you.

787
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,380
You're accustomed to battles.

788
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,300
But it doesn't mean

789
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,140
you can do

790
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,580
something else without scruple

791
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,420
just like that.

792
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,500
I know you're impatient.

793
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,020
But you have to wait

794
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,260
and see if the other person has decided

795
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,980
and whether she wants

796
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,260
to fight a way out with you.

797
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,220
By then,

798
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,940
will you help me

799
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,980
remove the obstacles?

800
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,380
Or will you stand in my way?

801
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,260
Yu is my sister

802
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,500
and the pearl of this family.

803
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,580
What I choose

804
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,380
doesn't matter.
