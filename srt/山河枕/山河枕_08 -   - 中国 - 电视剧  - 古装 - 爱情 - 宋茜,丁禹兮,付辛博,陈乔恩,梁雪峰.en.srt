Goodbye. Goodbye.

00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
Thanks.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Thank you.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Please.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,120
What is this, Lady?

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,870
You said you'd entertain me,

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,920
and now you're off to someone else.

28
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,790
He doesn't pamper you like I do.

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Fill it up.

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
Seems the young lord

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,360
and this lady fancy each other.

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,590
Then I'll serve you instead,

33
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,470
Master Lu.

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Fine, fine.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,310
Oh, Wei Yun,

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,590
I thought you were

37
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,430
a man who wouldn't be tempted.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,080
Didn't expect

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
you liked this.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,750
Not bad,

41
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,030
better potential

42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,750
than Wei Jun.

43
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,870
Young lord,

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,080
don't be upset.

45
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,080
Master Lu

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,470
often entertains

47
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,590
guests here.

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,190
We see him a lot.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,190
But you

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,750
don't look like a regular.

51
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,470
What important guests

52
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,520
do you host here, Master Lu?

53
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,150
Just colleagues and friends.

54
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,630
Since I came

55
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,960
with you today,

56
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,310
you owe me

57
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
a clear answer.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,710
Just now,

59
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,030
I already said,

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,030
it depends on your ability.

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,750
You want answers?

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,470
Get yourself into the Arsenal Bureau first.

63
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,560
Why so nervous?

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
Keep pouring.

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,630
Of course.

66
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,190
I'll make you

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,430
feel at home today.

68
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,590
Please.

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Come on.

70
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Alright,

71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
you two look close.

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,960
I won't

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,190
get in the way.

74
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,480
You haven't told me

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,190
when I can enter the Arsenal Bureau.

76
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,040
Wei Yun,

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,430
you think it's easy

78
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,270
to enter?

79
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
Get your title,

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,750
earn the tally,

81
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,430
enter as the Marquis,

82
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,590
otherwise

83
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,040
you'll never walk out again.

84
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,480
Why are you pulling me?

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
Why are you here?

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,920
To help you, of course.

87
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't you know

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
what kind of place this is?

89
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,430
Of course I do.

90
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,270
I know Mingliu well.

91
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,120
She's helping me.

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,040
I can handle it.

93
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,360
Seems you forgot

94
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
you're from the Wei family.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,720
Okay, okay,

96
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
I know.

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,760
How did you come?

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,480
You took the divorce paper,

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
why go back to the Wei Mansion?

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,240
I just borrowed it.

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,080
Take it back.

102
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,070
Is your brother's matter settled?

103
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,230
Of course.

104
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
By the way,

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,720
that man earlier,

106
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,000
is he really the Arsenal Bureau's

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,840
master of arms?

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,750
Then why did he ask to meet you

109
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,680
at Fragrance House?

110
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,800
What were you doing there?

111
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,720
You were really just helping me?

112
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Of course.

113
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,160
I figured it was

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,000
your first time there,

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,630
and you might not manage alone.

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,580
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

117
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,920
What are you doing now?

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,360
My bell won't come off.

119
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
It's caught in my hair.

120
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,870
Come help me.

121
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
That's

122
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,510
not proper.

123
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
What's improper?

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm fully dressed.

125
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,120
Hurry.

126
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
I...

127
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,270
Here,

128
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,110
help me.

129
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,000
Here.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,840
Right here.

131
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,270
Come on.

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
Do it now.

133
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,000
Get it off for me

134
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,040
before someone sees

135
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,000
and gets suspicious.

136
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,560
It's fine,

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,510
you can pull harder.

138
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,030
I'm afraid of hurting you.

139
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Chun.

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Yun.

141
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,230
Yu?

142
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,150
Why did you two

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,630
come back together?

144
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,080
We ran into each other on the road,

145
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,630
so he kindly brought me back.

146
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,630
Is there food?

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm hungry.

148
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
Yes,

149
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,510
I'll have someone make it.

150
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,700
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

151
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,630
Yun,

152
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,550
why are you sweating?

153
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,560
What's wrong?

154
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,680
I...

155
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,750
It's hot today.

156
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,630
Little puppy!

157
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,320
Where did you come from?

158
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,240
You're so cute!

159
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,720
Where's your family?

160
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,150
All alone?

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,840
You're adorable!

162
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,270
Come, I'll get you something to eat.

163
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,110
Alright?

164
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,110
My Lady.

165
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
A puppy?

166
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't scare it.

167
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,510
From now on,

168
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,720
we're a family of three.

169
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,600
So you still

170
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,960
want a dog.

171
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,240
Of course.

172
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,630
They're so cute.

173
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,510
If Mother hadn't forbidden it,

174
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
I'd have kept a whole pack at the Chu home.

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,150
My Lady, you seem relaxed.

176
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,510
So Lord Linyang's matter

177
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,360
is settled?

178
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,360
Of course.

179
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,720
And I even

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,750
saw Lu Qiba tonight.

181
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,750
If Wei Yun hadn't been watching me,

182
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,480
I'd have said more,

183
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
but he ruined it.

184
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,910
So what should

185
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,080
we do next?

186
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,360
Next, the most important thing

187
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
is the investiture banquet.

188
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,150
Once Wei Yun successfully inherits his title

189
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,150
and gains control over

190
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,120
the Arsenal Bureau,

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,630
I'll have the chance

192
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,550
to get the tally

193
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,360
and enter.

194
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,900
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

195
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,270
I'll hang you up.

196
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's see how you disturb me then.

197
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,200
I'll hang you up later.

198
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,920
Commander Lu,

199
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,390
why suddenly examine

200
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,630
the octagonal crossbow schematics?

201
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
Look at this mechanism.

202
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,630
It's neither from Great Sui

203
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,750
nor our Arsenal Bureau.

204
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,600
Then where did this mechanism

205
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
(Wei Tongfeng, Arsenal Bureau Director)
come from?

206
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,480
From Wei Yun.

207
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,510
Commander Lu,

208
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,670
with him about to inherit the title,

209
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,150
does this mean our Arsenal Bureau

210
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,510
will take orders from him?

211
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,960
Since I lured him

212
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,150
into the plan at Fragrance House,

213
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,600
I won't let him

214
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
inherit easily

215
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,150
or step into our bureau.

216
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,920
Why the rush?

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,270
There's a good show coming.

218
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,260
Ladies, which do you prefer?

219
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,490
Have you heard?

220
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,530
Since returning to the capital,

221
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,390
the Young General Wei Yun

222
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,870
stays at Fragrance House every night,

223
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,960
with a different companion each time.

224
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,480
How could a loyal Wei family

225
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,550
raise such a reckless,

226
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,080
shameless son?

227
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Did you hear?

228
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,600
Last night, Wei Yun

229
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,480
spent a fortune

230
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,730
on a dancer

231
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,840
and even got into a fight.

232
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,740
Of course I heard that.

233
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,360
This rumor has spread

234
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,670
throughout the city.

235
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,150
Have you heard it?

236
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,150
Yesterday, Wei Yun went to

237
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
Fragrance House for pleasure.

238
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Really?

239
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,360
Such reckless behavior

240
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,240
in the mourning period?

241
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,280
Indeed.

242
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,320
Have you heard?

243
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,390
General Wei Yun

244
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,480
often lingers in brothels.

245
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,240
He would struggle to wield a weapon,

246
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
let alone going to the battlefield.

247
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,750
The Wei family is doomed.

248
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,750
Excuse me,

249
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
are you talking about

250
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,080
Wei Yun of the Marquis' house?

251
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,870
Who else could it be?

252
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,360
There's only one

253
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,550
Wei family in Huajing City.

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
I'd never heard Wei Yun

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
behaved this way.

256
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,240
Could there be

257
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,270
a misunderstanding?

258
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,240
What misunderstanding?

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He just hid it well before.

260
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,630
Passing through countless flowers,

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,720
one cannot remain untouched.

262
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,000
What we know

263
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,600
might only be the tip of the iceberg.

264
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,200
Pick me some fresh ones.

265
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,120
Wrap these up.

266
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,150
Sure, no problem.

267
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,440
Jin,

268
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,790
your brother's dismissal just got resolved,

269
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,000
yet people are spreading such rumors.

270
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,320
Someone clearly doesn't

271
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,960
want our military families at peace.

272
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,080
I truly don't know how your sister

273
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,720
is faring at the Wei household.

274
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,840
Why don't you

275
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
accompany me there now

276
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,670
to bring Yu home?

277
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,560
Mother,

278
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,750
Chu Yu severed ties with you

279
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,720
to marry into the Wei family.

280
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,510
Even with Wei Yun in prison,

281
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,670
she refused to return.

282
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,360
Even if you went to fetch her,

283
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,630
she wouldn't come with you.

284
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,120
Impossible..

285
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,030
Yun came home with

286
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,960
her yesterday.

287
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,000
How could he have gone to Fragrance House?

288
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,120
This rumor isn't baseless.

289
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
There must be another motive.

290
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,790
Will this rumor

291
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,870
affect the inheritance?

292
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,960
My family is in ruins,

293
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,390
yet I'm said to frequent brothels,

294
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,230
idle,

295
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,080
debauched, immoral.

296
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,870
I can already imagine

297
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,720
the censors impeaching me.

298
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,870
He was really there?

299
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,200
Yes.

300
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,360
No wonder he arranged to meet there.

301
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,750
He planned this.

302
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,910
Lu Qiba truly is a scoundrel.

303
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,720
But

304
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,480
most people at Yun's age

305
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,000
would already be married with children.

306
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,390
It's understandable

307
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,600
that Yun did that.

308
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,470
Exactly.

309
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,120
He's in the prime of youth after all.

310
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,120
Then Yu,

311
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,840
this was your mistake.

312
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,870
My mistake?

313
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,480
You shouldn't have hidden it from us,

314
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,920
letting him go to Fragrance House

315
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
and be tricked.

316
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,000
Even if Yun

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,070
really liked that

318
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,520
Lu Qiba,

319
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,790
could the Wei family

320
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,350
not accommodate a dancer?

321
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,200
Yes.

322
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
Chun,

323
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
I didn't buy any dancer.

324
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,630
I...

325
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,240
This is a big misunderstanding.

326
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,200
I can't explain it clearly.

327
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,150
Heavens.

328
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,030
If the investiture fails,

329
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,720
should we still

330
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,750
hold the banquet?

331
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,150
Of course.

332
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
We cannot let others ridicule us.

333
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,030
Will His Majesty believe

334
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,110
whatever they say?

335
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,590
The matter isn't settled yet.

336
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,960
We must stay composed.

337
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Yu,

338
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,640
do you have a solution?

339
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,680
Change all the invitations

340
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,000
to a "Thanksgiving Banquet,"

341
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,440
to honor everyone

342
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,920
who has ever helped the Wei family.

343
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,030
Even on this battlefield,

344
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,550
the Wei family cannot lose.

345
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,150
Thank you.

346
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,200
We hope we can do it.

347
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,790
That said,

348
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,890
he doesn't seem worried at all.

349
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
Could it be all bluff?

350
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,440
Could you be silent for a moment

351
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,630
and let me think?

352
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,480
Heads may fall, blood may spill,

353
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,860
battles may be fought,

354
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,360
but even if the sky falls,

355
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,750
the Wei family cannot lose its title.

356
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,200
How will outsiders

357
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,070
see it later?

358
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,000
Let them think what they will.

359
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,070
Reputation is earned.

360
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,510
I simply don't want to lose to Lu Qiba.

361
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,960
Since he set a challenge,

362
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,510
I'll solve it.

363
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
Otherwise, how can I enter the Arsenal Bureau?

364
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,100
Perhaps you could ask

365
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
the Eldest Princess

366
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,740
or Grand Tutor Xie

367
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,020
to speak on our behalf?

368
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,820
The rumors arose because I

369
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,060
visited the brothel,

370
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
hardly something suitable

371
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,780
to bring before them.

372
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,500
How could I ask them for help?

373
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,780
My Lady,

374
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,260
look

375
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,100
what I brought.

376
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,820
It's

377
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,100
from my brother?

378
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,940
Did he say anything?

379
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,780
He said

380
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,860
he had already inquired about

381
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,070
the Emperor's intentions.

382
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,900
The Emperor hasn't made a clear decision,

383
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,300
only suggested

384
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
he consider it.

385
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
There's still

386
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,300
room for negotiation.

387
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,220
Go to the Duke of Hu's residence

388
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,780
and invite Lord Song

389
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,260
to our home for a meeting.

390
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,380
I'll drag him here if I have to.

391
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,340
Just go.

392
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,620
My Lord.

393
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,220
What is it now?

394
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,580
Lady Yu is looking for you.

395
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,380
Why have you

396
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,060
come to me?

397
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,820
Isn't that mine?

398
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,260
It's for deterring thieves.

399
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,140
With so many items here,

400
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,620
any thief wouldn't know where to start.

401
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,820
I drafted an invitation.

402
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,780
Since it's for your Thanksgiving Banquet,

403
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,740
you should review them.

404
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,900
Is this a pile of kindling you've drawn?

405
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,700
Everyone in Huajing City knows

406
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,100
General Chu's calligraphy is commanding,

407
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,100
like dragons and tigers.

408
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,260
Your handwriting

409
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
hasn't inherited a fraction of that.

410
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,780
My hands

411
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,060
won't cooperate.

412
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,140
Whenever I try

413
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,220
to pick up a book,

414
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,180
they reach for spears and swords instead.

415
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,500
I can't refuse such courtesy.

416
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,860
Chu General never taught you?

417
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,260
My father

418
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,820
lets me do

419
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,860
whatever I like.

420
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,180
My happiness comes first.

421
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
What,

422
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
you think it's improper too?

423
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,580
Right?

424
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,220
Then hurry up and write it.

425
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,300
After all, I am now

426
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,900
part of the Wei household.

427
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,500
It wouldn't do to show

428
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,940
sloppy work, right?

429
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,660
Will Lu Qiba's commotion

430
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,060
affect your investiture?

431
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,420
Is there anything else?

432
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,900
If you have plans,

433
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
tell me,

434
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,340
I might be able to help.

435
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,260
Now that you are First Madam

436
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,180
of the Wei family,

437
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,740
my status as Marquis

438
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,860
does not affect yours.

439
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,340
Why do you care so much

440
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,580
whether I inherit the title?

441
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,900
How could it not matter?

442
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,300
If you inherit,

443
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,500
my status as the First Madam

444
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,780
of Wei family rises with it.

445
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,700
Right?

446
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,020
Why are you here?

447
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,060
You are

448
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,900
afraid of dogs?

449
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,500
Of course not.

450
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,740
I'm just worried about hurting it.

451
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,460
Really?

452
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,860
I didn't expect

453
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,100
Young General Wei

454
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,580
to fear a dog.

455
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,940
I'm not afraid.

456
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,140
It just appeared suddenly,

457
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,700
and I wasn't prepared.

458
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,220
Xiaoqi, you're so adorable,

459
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,300
how can anyone fear you?

460
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,020
What do you call it?

461
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,660
Xiaoqi.

462
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,740
Do you think the name

463
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,020
suits it perfectly?

464
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,130
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

465
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,220
Not at all.

466
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,100
I tried many names,

467
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
but it only

468
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,380
liked this one.

469
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,220
Am I right?

470
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,780
If you don't like it,

471
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,620
perhaps

472
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
you should ask it.

473
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,500
Since you won't speak,

474
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,380
I'll take that as agreement.

475
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,820
This

476
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,900
is excellent.

477
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,900
Then please write the rest.

478
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,580
I'll have Wanyue pick them up later.

479
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,740
Let's go home.

480
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,140
Come on, Xiaoqi.

481
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:23,260
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

482
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,020
A thanksgiving banquet?

483
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,020
Yes.

484
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,020
Thank you for your previous advice

485
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,460
and speaking for Yun

486
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,460
in front of His Majesty.

487
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,140
It's to thank

488
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,500
everyone who

489
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,940
spoke up for Yun.

490
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,020
We hope

491
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,340
Your Highness will attend.

492
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
(Invitation)

493
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,860
Besides the banquet,

494
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,860
you have nothing else to say?

495
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,660
There is, actually.

496
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,140
I know

497
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,820
Your Highness has

498
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,780
many handsome,

499
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,980
talented followers.

500
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,580
These playing cards

501
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,580
were made from

502
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,700
(5 guan)
the portraits

503
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,700
of the best ten

504
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,580
among them.

505
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,380
They were made for Your Highness

506
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,740
as a small

507
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,020
Thanksgiving gift.

508
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,940
(7 guan)

509
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,780
Interesting.

510
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,220
I like these cards.

511
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,140
In your spare time, Your Highness

512
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
can use them to pass the hours.

513
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
(7 guan)
If you like,

514
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,500
I can make

515
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,740
other little items as gifts.

516
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,020
You can make other things?

517
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,100
Of course.

518
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,060
Miniature calendars,

519
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,980
clay figurines,

520
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,940
fan faces,

521
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,580
lantern paper,

522
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,420
anything

523
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,900
Your Highness fancies,

524
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,740
I can make.

525
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,660
You and the cards are charming.

526
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,900
I knew

527
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,940
at Qinxi Valley

528
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,500
you were clever and knew

529
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,100
how to please people.

530
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,020
(8 guan)

531
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh, Hanmei,

532
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,140
even his small portrait

533
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,740
is outstanding.

534
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,020
(Eldest Princess's Mansion)

535
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,420
Lady Chu, please wait.

536
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,500
Mr. Xue.

537
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,580
Although you did not

538
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,260
mention the rumors about General Wei,

539
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Her Highness knows

540
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,980
the investiture

541
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,780
is of extreme importance to the Wei family.

542
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,580
Moreover,

543
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,060
the gift you brought

544
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,500
pleased Her Highness greatly,

545
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,940
so

546
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,460
she is willing to help you once more.

547
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,460
This silk bundle

548
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,420
may relieve the Wei family's present worries.

549
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,060
Is this bundle from Her Highness

550
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,460
or from you, Mr. Xue?

551
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,980
Why do you ask this?

552
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,220
Does it

553
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,340
matter?

554
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,980
I suppose Her Highness's liking of you

555
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,540
is not only for your looks.

556
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,340
Then thank you for the bundle

557
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,580
from both of you.

558
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,580
Will Your Highness

559
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,060
attend the Wei family's banquet?

560
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,180
I feel that though it's called "Thanksgiving,"

561
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,820
it's really about the investiture.

562
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,380
Rumors about the Wei family

563
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,500
now boil in the city.

564
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,100
Wei Yun's investiture

565
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,260
is top priority.

566
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,100
He lacks the military success

567
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,980
and reputation to win

568
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,060
everyone's trust.

569
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
The capital's powerful

570
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,140
are fence-sitters.

571
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,260
And Chu Yu is clever.

572
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,740
She will find a strategist

573
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
to steady the wind

574
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,300
and fix the outcome.

575
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,900
I have already helped

576
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,740
Wei Yun once at court.

577
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,700
Why should the Wei family

578
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,140
expect me to help a second time?

579
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,460
Then I'll dispose

580
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,300
the invitation as usual.

581
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,820
Don't rush.

582
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,060
I've already given her a token.

583
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,460
Let's see how she uses it.

584
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,140
Early spring,

585
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,740
the weather is still cold.

586
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,500
Catch may be poor.

587
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,060
Fishing isn't only about hook and catch.

588
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,140
It's about observing

589
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,140
where fish gather

590
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,380
to sharpen one's observation

591
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,980
and sensitivity.

592
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,780
Based on your observation,

593
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,140
should I

594
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,740
go to the banquet

595
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,980
or not?

596
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,340
(Invitation)

597
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,380
Your Highness worries that

598
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,500
attending

599
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,260
would openly align you

600
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,580
with the Marquis of Zhenguo

601
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
and break

602
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,280
the delicate civil-military balance

603
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
the Emperor has

604
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,340
barely achieved,

605
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,620
disrupting court order.

606
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,900
You sure have your own read

607
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,620
on court affairs.

608
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,100
I haven't pondered so deeply.

609
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
I simply find

610
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,260
Lady Chu interesting

611
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,780
and compatible with Your Highness.

612
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,740
If Your Highness socializes more,

613
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,060
I will be pleased.

614
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,980
Coincidentally,

615
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,300
I also find

616
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,500
Lady Chu interesting.

617
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,860
But was your smile

618
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,220
for Lady Chu,

619
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,540
or for me?

620
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,860
Your Highness,

621
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,460
I just returned from the herb fields.

622
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,860
I may have

623
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,700
some unclean herbs on me.

624
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,180
Medicine heals, right?

625
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,100
Yes and no,

626
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,580
unsuitable herbs

627
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,980
can also poison.

628
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,540
Bring me water.

629
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,980
Yes.

630
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,180
Your Highness.

631
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,380
Mr. Xue has served

632
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,300
by your side ten years.

633
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,660
How could he harm you?

634
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,860
He wouldn't dare.

635
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,340
But his coldness

636
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,220
hasn't changed at all.

637
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,100
(Drunken Immortal Tavern)

638
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,180
You just took office

639
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,140
and still have time to treat me to a drink?

640
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,420
Speak,

641
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,580
what do you need?

642
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,180
Recently I've been

643
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,460
acting as Minister of Justice.

644
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,420
Whenever I meet Vice Minister Song,

645
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,020
something seems off.

646
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,260
Though from

647
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,180
Duke of Hu's Mansion,

648
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,660
he rose by study

649
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,980
and merit to be

650
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,420
a vice minister.

651
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,220
After all,

652
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,420
he's one of many sons

653
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,860
of the Duke of Hu.

654
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,780
I suspect he bears resentment.

655
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,980
Even if Song is resentful,

656
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,260
with his character,

657
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,860
he shouldn't trouble you.

658
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,700
He hasn't troubled me yet,

659
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,260
but I need his help

660
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,020
in doing something.

661
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
I want to reopen the Lord of Qin treason case.

662
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,220
(Spring Breeze House)

663
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:09,980
Mr. Gu.

664
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,700
Mr. Song.

665
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,060
Minister Gu,

666
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,860
congratulations on your

667
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,940
promotion to Minister of Justice.

668
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,580
This cup I offer to you,

669
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,980
and I hope you

670
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,620
will guide me well in the future.

671
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,740
No vinegar in this wine,

672
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,220
Mr. Song,

673
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,980
why does it sound sour?

674
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,700
Mr. Song,

675
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,340
the Lord of Qin's treason case

676
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,260
is crucial for my Gu family.

677
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,340
I've labored to become

678
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
Minister of Justice

679
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,940
to investigate it.

680
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,660
If it weren't for this,

681
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,740
the title of Minister

682
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,900
or even top scholar means nothing to me.

683
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,340
Once the truth is clear,

684
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,780
I will voluntarily resign

685
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,100
before the Emperor.

686
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,140
Mr. Gu, your talent

687
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
surpasses mine as a top scholar.

688
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,180
Moreover,

689
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,300
I know why you act

690
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,140
as you do.

691
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,100
During the Lord of Qin case,

692
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,860
your whole family suffered.

693
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,100
Not only

694
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,580
did Chancellor Gu

695
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,740
and Mrs. Gu die,

696
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,180
but you were exiled

697
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,140
to the southwest.

698
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,100
Now all of Huajing

699
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,260
say you married into

700
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,740
a wealthy household for gain,

701
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,380
yet I understand

702
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,100
the heavy responsibility you bear.

703
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,740
Mr. Song, you know me so well.

704
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,420
My suspicions were petty.

705
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,740
Mr. Gu,

706
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,260
enough bowing.

707
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,420
The dishes will get cold.

708
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,500
It's all because of you

709
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,580
talking nonsense?

710
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,940
I see, you're jealous

711
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,420
because we are better friends.

712
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,860
Mr. Gu,

713
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,420
please.

714
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,460
I am not jealous of you two.

715
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
I only fear that ill feelings

716
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,940
might grow between you.

717
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,580
Since you

718
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,420
accuse me,

719
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,580
today's wine

720
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,740
is on you.

721
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,220
As you wish.

722
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,420
However,

723
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,740
the Lord of Qin treason case

724
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,420
is dangerous, people could die.

725
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,020
Mr. Gu,

726
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,700
are you certain you want to investigate?

727
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,580
How can I not?

728
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,940
The past is gone,

729
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,820
but my heart is uneasy.

730
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,100
I have lived

731
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,940
for this reason.

732
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Even in death,

733
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,700
I must face my parents

734
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,780
and my family

735
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,020
in the afterlife with pride.

736
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,380
It's a pity

737
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,340
the Lord of Qin,

738
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,820
though born common,

739
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,700
gained the title by

740
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,020
unprecedented military merit,

741
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,100
only to betray Great Sui

742
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,420
with the Princess Yunyang

743
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,300
in North Qi,

744
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,060
a tragic waste of fame.

745
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,660
The Lord of Qin

746
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,500
did not betray Great Sui.

747
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,860
My words end here.

748
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,700
I act not only for the Gu family's honor,

749
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,420
but for Great Sui's future.

750
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,580
Gentlemen,

751
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,660
we have studied for years

752
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,230
but were born in turbulent times.

753
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,100
We cannot fight in armor.

754
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,780
Should we passively allow others

755
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,140
to ruin our land?

756
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,380
We should cling on our fading age!

757
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,820
Mr. Gu,

758
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,460
your reminder is timely.

759
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,380
We know Mr. Song

760
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,780
is from the Duke of Hu's household

761
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,570
and is talented in both civil

762
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,940
and military affairs.

763
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,500
Mr. Song,

764
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
I seek neither power

765
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,220
nor wealth,

766
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,420
only the truth

767
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,020
and peace of mind.

768
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,460
The Lord of Qin case files

769
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,060
are sealed.

770
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,940
Only we may retrieve them

771
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,140
in person.

772
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,700
Mr. Gu,

773
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,260
we have known each other for years.

774
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,700
I understand your intent.

775
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,500
Rest assured,

776
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,620
I will help you.

777
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,500
Thank you.

778
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,660
Yun,

779
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,700
come on, hurry.

780
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,780
My brother?

781
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,780
No wonder he left home

782
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,740
so early.

783
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,940
So he went to meet General Wei.

784
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,620
Wei Yun's Spring Breeze House rumor

785
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,180
has caused a stir across the city.

786
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
All court officials

787
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,020
are critical.

788
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,540
He surely needs to move about now

789
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,020
to find a chance.

790
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,620
Is he sure seeking my brother

791
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
is really a good decision?

792
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,940
I suppose you received the invitation

793
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,380
to the Wei family's Thanksgiving banquet.

794
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,740
What do you think?

795
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,660
Are you going?

796
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,580
(Yuelai Inn)

797
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,420
Come.

798
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,140
I asked you to lead me to the Crown Prince.

799
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,340
Why

800
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,220
did you bring me to the inn?

801
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,180
Are you closer

802
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,060
to the Crown Prince, or I?

803
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,300
I said he's here,

804
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,420
so he must be here.

805
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,580
Let's go.

806
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,900
Wei Yun.

807
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,060
Why are you here?

808
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,020
The Eldest Princess told me to come.

809
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,140
You...

810
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,500
Looks like the Crown Prince really is here.

811
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,580
Naturally.

812
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,700
