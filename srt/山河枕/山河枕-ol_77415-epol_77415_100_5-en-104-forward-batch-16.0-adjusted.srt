=Episode 5=

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,000
The death of 70,000 soldiers

22
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,710
will bring trouble to even our families.

23
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,560
You have to decide

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
whether you're leaving or staying.

25
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,790
You're leaving already?

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,350
But what about your reputation?

27
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm a woman too

28
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,480
and I understand your choices.

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,510
But you don't have to

30
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,790
all turn against me.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,560
I never said I would leave

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
to marry someone else.

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
But after all these years,

34
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,080
don't you love your husband

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,680
even a little bit?

36
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,360
I will not leave.

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,870
When Mother passed away,

38
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,800
she left this family in my care.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,750
My husband is dead.

40
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,400
But I must

41
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
protect this family

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,520
for him and Mother.

43
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,470
Lan,

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,750
you're pregnant.

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,150
What's your decision?

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,150
I do not want to leave.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,240
But my father pressured me.

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,710
I have to go home

49
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,910
and give birth to the baby.

50
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,240
I never dared to speak my mind at home.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,590
Now, my husband is gone.

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,190
What choice do I have?

53
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,310
You don't have any children.

54
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,430
You can leave or stay as you please.

55
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,240
But it's not the same for us.

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,800
Our children are still here.

57
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,520
It breaks our hearts

58
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,710
when you pressure us to leave.

59
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,750
Is it so wrong of me

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
to leave this family?

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Alright.

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,590
Am I interrupting?

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,590
Will you stop me as well?

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,870
Right.

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,910
You and Wei Jun

66
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,870
were only betrothed,

67
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,520
yet you chose to become his widow.

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,710
How could a loyal woman like you

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
stand someone like me

70
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,070
who is leaving so ungratefully?

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,120
Life isn't easy for us women.

72
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,600
And what I care about least

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,240
is the reputation.

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,830
So, I'll never hold you back

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,950
with that kind of thing.

76
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,720
I've seen the world
outside Huajing City.

77
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,110
So,

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,800
even if all of you want to leave,

79
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,120
I will not stop you.

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
You make your choices

81
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,390
about your own lives.

82
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
We all understand.

83
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,110
But Ms. Chu,

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,390
you shouldn't be saying that.

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
That's right.

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
But at present,

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,190
Wei Yun is in prison.

88
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,950
You can't leave

89
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,120
without his divorce papers, right?

90
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,920
I am here today

91
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,000
because I want you

92
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,430
to give me a hand.

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,880
Let's not make a move

94
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,560
until Wei Yun gets back.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,040
What Ms. Chu just said

96
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,680
makes sense.

97
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,960
At this moment,

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
our priority is to get Yun out.

99
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,120
If you spoke up for me

100
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,310
just to secure my help,

101
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,830
that really wasn't necessary.

102
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,800
My great-uncle

103
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,120
is the Duke of Ning's tutor

104
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,920
but he remains impartial.

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,040
to stop Can Yan in person

107
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,510
and confront the Duke of Ning.

108
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,800
If there's injustice in Yun's case,

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,510
he will also speak out.

110
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,680
I don't need to push him.

111
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
(Wei Ya,)

112
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,310
(how I wish)

113
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,160
(I did not love you.)

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,380
(Xie Jiu)

115
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,920
(You always asked me)

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
(to write to you.)

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,720
But now, I can only

118
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,830
burn the letter.

119
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,160
You aren't

120
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
as heartless

121
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,630
as you claim to be.

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,510
To me,

123
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
you're a very loyal woman.

124
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,270
You misunderstand me.

125
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,200
Everything I do

126
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,830
is for my own benefit.

127
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,870
What could be wrong

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,400
with self-interest?

129
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,680
Your family only values
legitimate children.

130
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,230
I suppose

131
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,510
you went through a lot

132
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
before you came this far.

133
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,870
No one else knows

134
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,950
what you have been through.

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,430
You don't think I'm heartless?

136
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,830
Soon after my husband died,

137
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
I wanted to leave his family.

138
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,430
I only believe what I see.

139
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,240
What I saw just now

140
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
was a loyal woman

141
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
who loved her husband.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But I can't kill myself for my husband

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,270
like Chun tried to do.

144
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,870
I'm a Xie.

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,430
I've never been able to control my life.

146
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
I have to live.

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,510
I must struggle to survive.

148
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,720
I've been struggling all these years.

149
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
How could I kill myself

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,040
just for a man?

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,240
But I miss him.

152
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,680
I miss him every single minute.

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,760
You are not wrong.

154
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,270
You don't need to feel guilty.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Nor do you need to be stuck here.

156
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
The world is so vast.

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,430
Your loyalty need not be proven

158
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,120
by a mere monument of virtue.

159
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,150
Thank you.

160
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,510
We have to count on you

161
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,950
for Yun's case.

162
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,680
Actually, you should not

163
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,870
have been part of this.

164
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,870
Chu Yu,

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,440
I admire you.

166
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,630
But what I said earlier

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
wasn't an excuse.

168
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,840
My great-uncle won't stand by.

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,240
This is the assurance I expected.

170
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
I have always known

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,030
you are the most sensible.

172
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
Yeah.

173
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,720
My husband said the same thing.

174
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,200
My Lady,

175
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,030
Zhang Deng delivered this.

176
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,950
(Gu)
Hope we can meet.

177
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,200
I await your reply.

178
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
My Lady,

179
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,030
what does the letter say?

180
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,150
Gu Chusheng wants to see me.

181
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,120
What for?

182
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Then, My Lady,

183
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,840
will you or will you not see him?

184
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,750
Of course not.

185
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,100
(Chu Mansion)

186
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,920
Yu?

187
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,910
Look, freshly fried dough twists.

188
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,200
They taste best when they're hot.

189
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,120
They're still good when they're cold.

190
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,350
But anyway,

191
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,750
they won't be as crispy.

192
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,920
Come on. Taste one.

193
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,990
I think

194
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,200
you actually want some.

195
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,390
When you're nervous,

196
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,240
you always eat snacks to calm down.

197
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
Others may not know.

198
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,600
But as your big brother,

199
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,440
I know you very well.

200
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,040
Go ahead and eat.

201
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
Today,

202
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,240
I'm here to say thank you.

203
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,670
Since there's some wine here,

204
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,270
I'd like to propose a toast.

205
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,120
On the funeral day,

206
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,600
Grand Tutor Xie wouldn't have appeared

207
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,630
without your help, right?

208
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,750
Do you know

209
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,670
where I saw him

210
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,480
that day?

211
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm Chu Linyang.

212
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,030
Greetings, Grand Tutor.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,480
Now that you're here,

214
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,000
why don't you see what's happening?

215
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
(Xie)

216
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,790
In the 31st year of the Yuanshun reign,

217
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,390
our border was invaded.

218
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,200
Wei Chengyun,
the late General of Cavalry

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
defended the city for a whole year,

220
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,870
holding up 200,000 enemy troops.

221
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,480
So, our nation

222
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,120
won the battle with very few casualties.

223
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,360
His four children, however,

224
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,750
all died when defending the city.

225
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,920
In the 2nd year of the Pinde reign,

226
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,960
North Qi invaded us.

227
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,200
Wei Jingyi, the late General of Command,

228
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,270
defended the city with 7,000 soldiers.

229
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Even with only 200 soldiers left,

230
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,440
they didn't retreat.

231
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
Grand Tutor,

232
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,510
as the Emperor's tutor.,

233
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,200
you should uphold the law.

234
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,510
Does a family of loyal heroes

235
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,750
for a century

236
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,750
deserve less than some villains

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
who defy His Majesty

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
with their flattery?

239
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,670
Can't these heroes

240
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,510
keep their descendants alive?

241
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,510
Can't they get some coffins

242
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,080
and a proper burial?

243
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Grand Tutor,

244
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,480
please have them respected

245
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,870
as they deserve to be.

246
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,030
Currently,

247
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,710
Grand Tutor Xie alone

248
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,100
may not be enough.

249
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,140
To get Wei Yun out,

250
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,110
we still need

251
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,380
some helpers

252
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,380
who are close to His Majesty.

253
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,660
Close to His Majesty?

254
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,190
At this point,

255
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,590
who has a strong bond with His Majesty?

256
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,110
No one but the Eldest Princess does.

257
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,710
Hope we can meet.

258
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,310
I await your reply.

259
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,350
Flowers in winter.

260
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,830
You've chosen a lovely spot.

261
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,260
Academician Gu, may I ask

262
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,710
why you wanted to see me?

263
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,190
Do you have to be

264
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,900
so aloof?

265
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,780
Are we

266
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,230
ever close or what?

267
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,230
I know you've been trying

268
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,660
to get Wei Yun released.

269
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,350
Why didn't you come to me?

270
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,900
Right now, you are

271
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,300
Duke of Ning's precious son-in-law.

272
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,260
You do sound more sure of yourself

273
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,340
than you did

274
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,190
back in the southwest.

275
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,070
So,

276
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,110
will you help me?

277
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,070
The Wei family is finished.

278
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,070
Duke of Ning wants peace talks,

279
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,660
so he won't back down.

280
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,500
Chu Yu,

281
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,550
sticking with them

282
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,950
will only get you hurt.

283
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,380
So, you're telling me to abandon them?

284
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,830
Who is being so noisy?

285
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm Chu Yu, widow of Wei Jun,

286
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,110
Marquis of Zhenguo's son.

287
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,190
He's Senior Compiler Gu Chusheng.

288
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,540
Greetings, Your Highness.

289
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,300
Is he the one who came first
in three exams,

290
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,660
the most brilliant scholar
in the capital?

291
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,070
Exactly.

292
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,570
(Elegant and Graceful)

293
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,770
(Li Changming,
the Eldest Princess of Great Sui)

294
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,950
Greetings, Your Highness.

295
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,670
Xiang,

296
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,190
serve some tea.

297
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,740
Yes.

298
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
So, you're the man

299
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,750
the Duke of Ning thinks so highly of.

300
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,140
You flatter me, Your Highness.

301
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,110
Academician Gu,

302
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,780
if you follow me,

303
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,900
you will rise to the top

304
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,870
just like him.

305
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,260
Isn't it better

306
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,470
than being someone's son-in-law?

307
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,710
My loyalties lie elsewhere.

308
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,260
I'm afraid

309
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,950
I must disappoint you.

310
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,350
I'm not one

311
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,780
to impose.

312
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,470
If one day you change your mind,

313
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,140
you'll always be welcome here.

314
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,150
The Weis are in deep trouble.

315
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,540
So, you wanted to see me?

316
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,310
Yes.

317
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,150
Mr. Gu, the top scholar,

318
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,150
is your stepping-stone.

319
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,190
Or you wouldn't have seen me.

320
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,950
Then, I should

321
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,430
thank him for his benevolence

322
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,020
and for helping me to see you.

323
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,150
I heard you arguing earlier.

324
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,620
Academician Gu,

325
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,710
you tell me.

326
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,580
Shall I help them or not?

327
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,580
That depends

328
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,780
on how Ms. Chu pleads.

329
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,670
Ms. Chu,

330
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,670
you're as headstrong

331
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,950
as people say.

332
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,670
You even dared to set me up.

333
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,670
Your Highness, you're intelligent.

334
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,150
I don't dare to hide anything.

335
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,150
Right now, you are the only one

336
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,500
I can beg for help.

337
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,340
So, I had this unwise plan.

338
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,390
You know what interests me.

339
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,670
And I appreciate it.

340
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,830
You may rise.

341
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,510
Thank you.

342
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,950
But anyway, the Wei's case

343
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,990
has nothing to do with me.

344
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,500
Why should I help?

345
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,150
Your Highness, you are the one

346
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,300
and only Eldest Princess.

347
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,390
You are a woman of high status.

348
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,790
In the past,

349
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,990
Shu Region was flooded.

350
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,300
You went south three times in person

351
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,500
for the victims and disaster relief.

352
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,750
I believe

353
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,820
a righteous person like you

354
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,100
won't just stand by.

355
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,990
Save your flattery.

356
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,710
You think a little flattery

357
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,430
will make me help you?

358
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,470
The Wei family has defended us

359
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,310
for a century.

360
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,990
With brilliant strategies,

361
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,030
they were invincible.

362
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,670
Behind this defeat,

363
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,750
there must have been

364
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,290
(Xue Hanmei, the Princess's follower)
some reasons.

365
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,340
His Majesty always balances
the civil and military forces.

366
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,020
I believe Your Highness won't stay out

367
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,190
of the Wei's conviction

368
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,670
or the decline
of the military's influence.

369
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,750
You're interesting, indeed.

370
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,260
It's such a pity

371
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,670
that a woman like you is widowed.

372
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,710
If you were a man,

373
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,990
you would certainly

374
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,710
have a successful official career.

375
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,950
But in my opinion,

376
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,510
a woman can also

377
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,710
do great things.

378
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,340
I believe you agree, Your Highness.

379
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,820
For Wei Yun's case,

380
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,300
there's something you can do.

381
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,690
(Qinxi Valley)

382
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,540
Thank you for your guidance.

383
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
If I can get Wei Yun out,

384
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,430
I will be

385
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,510
eternally grateful.

386
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,990
I'll take my leave.

387
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,190
So, back there,

388
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,020
you spoke up for Ms. Chu, didn't you?

389
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,670
The Weis are declining.

390
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,670
They need timely help.

391
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,340
If you help Wei Yun to survive,

392
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,780
he will be grateful.

393
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,500
Do you want me to offer timely help

394
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,540
or do you actually

395
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,300
want Ms. Chu to be grateful to you?

396
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,780
The first, of course.

397
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,540
Ms. Chu is devoted to the Wei family

398
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
and Wei Yun.

399
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,950
She behaves recklessly.

400
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,630
But she's as dazzling

401
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,860
as you were in the early years.

402
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,260
So, my heart softened.

403
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,990
You are a clever man.

404
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,780
But have you considered

405
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,990
that by helping Wei Yun like this,

406
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,630
I would be making an enemy

407
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,020
of the Duke of Ning and his faction?

408
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,670
If he and his men really

409
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,910
try to hurt me,

410
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,260
what can I do?

411
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,750
He is stubborn.

412
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,670
Though the Crown Prince is inept,

413
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,750
he has never wavered

414
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,910
in his support for him.

415
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,540
Instead of trying

416
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,430
to win their support,

417
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,950
it's better to rescue someone useful.

418
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,950
I didn't expect to hear

419
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,750
such a plain explanation.

420
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,030
Hanmei,

421
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,150
be careful how you answer.

422
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,060
My entire life

423
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,150
is devoted to you.

424
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,430
No matter who wishes you harm,

425
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,630
I will stand before you and protect you.

426
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,750
Even if it costs me my life.

427
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,710
At court,

428
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,060
my position is not so precarious

429
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,470
that you need to die for me.

430
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,260
But what happened today

431
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,780
must not happen again.

432
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,190
So, this is why you asked

433
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,030
to meet me here.

434
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,100
You're the one who wrote to me

435
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,390
and asked to meet me.

436
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,260
I just found a place

437
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,430
with fewer people.

438
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,990
What's made you so angry?

439
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,140
Chu Yu,

440
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,910
must you insult me like that?

441
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,860
How would serving the Eldest Princess

442
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,990
be an insult?

443
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,190
Besides,

444
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,060
earlier,

445
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,710
you seemed quite eager to help me.

446
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,100
Why do you look reluctant now?

447
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,270
- You...
- Forget it.

448
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,260
My Lady,

449
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,470
if Gu Chusheng hadn't come,

450
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,500
was there another way?

451
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,990
Certainly.

452
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,950
I asked you to prepare a man's suit.

453
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,790
Had he not come,

454
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,020
I would have gone myself.

455
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,990
Very shrewd.

456
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,050
(The Court of Judicial Review)

457
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,630
Why are you still here?

458
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,100
We can barely protect ourselves.

459
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,470
If you think we can

460
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,500
protect your family,

461
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,630
you are mistaken.

462
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,780
Just the two of us are here.

463
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,260
Save the righteous act.

464
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,580
Wei Jun was sincere with me.

465
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,300
I would never harm his family.

466
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,100
Shall we make a bet?

467
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,670
I will get you out,

468
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,340
and you will let me stay.

469
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,510
Deal.

470
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,470
Then, stay alive.

471
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,020
If you can't get out alive,

472
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,820
I will scourge your family

473
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,860
and make a huge mess.

474
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,300
I dare you.

475
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,300
Just you wait and see.

476
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,060
In this case,

477
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,670
you go to the Duke of Hu's Mansion

478
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,950
and get me Song Wenchang.

479
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,190
You did have a backup plan.

480
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,030
Eat your fill.

481
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,730
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

482
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,850
(Song Wenchang, Duke of Hu's eldest son)

483
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,390
Come on. Hurry up.

484
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,380
Hurry.

485
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,620
Yun.

486
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,990
I'm still alive.

487
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,430
Cao Yan is ridiculous.

488
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,470
How dare he torture you?

489
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,990
I'll kill him!

490
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,910
Calm down.

491
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,260
I'll say something serious.

492
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,190
I missed the funeral day.

493
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,510
Do you blame me?

494
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,990
Blame my father.

495
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,150
I had the mourning on.

496
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,540
But he didn't let me go.

497
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,660
I almost fell out with him.

498
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,990
Go apologize to your father.

499
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,100
Why?

500
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,540
You're my close friend.

501
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,230
I failed to help you out of trouble.

502
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,190
I felt really sorry.

503
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,750
Today, I got Ms. Chu's message

504
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,790
and rushed over.

505
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,510
Yun,

506
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,190
if you need any help from me,

507
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,030
let me know.

508
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,990
For you, I'd do anything,

509
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,990
whatever it takes.

510
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,990
That's not necessary.

511
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,260
Apology to your father

512
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,670
and it will be a huge help.

513
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,340
My family is in deep trouble.

514
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,670
Your father has his reasons

515
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,540
to stop you.

516
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,260
But I know.

517
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,100
Your father stays at home in retirement,

518
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,430
but he still has the military spirit.

519
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,390
I'm sure he won't

520
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,710
see my family fall like this.

521
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,660
So, apologize to him.

522
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,180
Meanwhile,

523
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,910
take something to him for me.

524
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,470
Rest assured.

525
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,750
I will always do

526
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,860
what you ask me to.

527
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,970
(Always Peaceful)

528
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,380
Shilan,

529
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,510
you're amazing.

530
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,750
As expected, you got first place again.

531
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,510
Just by luck.

532
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,330
(Song Qingping, Song Zhao's daughter)
Theoretically,

533
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,900
(Song Shilan, Song Zhao's second son)
Brother should have won.

534
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,470
You actually tutored him

535
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,710
for two nights.

536
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,820
He forgot everything.

537
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,030
Look.

538
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,470
He even drew a little turtle

539
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,580
on his exam paper.

540
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,500
He draws well, though.

541
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,860
You know what? Don't be scared.

542
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,950
If Brother gives you trouble,

543
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,820
let me know.

544
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,750
I can make him my new drug tester.

545
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,300
You terrible son!

546
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,380
Father,

547
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,950
be reasonable, will you?

548
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,230
Why am I terrible?

549
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,230
You're pissing me off.

550
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,900
(Be Honest and Impartial)

551
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,940
You're pushing your father.

552
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,380
Isn't that terrible enough?

553
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,910
Father.

554
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,270
Oh, Father.

555
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,870
- Father. Father.
- You...

556
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,220
Father, take it.

557
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,430
(Song Zhao, Duke of Hu)
Why? Try to kill me?

558
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,460
No way.

559
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,660
The sword is sheathed.

560
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,550
How could I kill you?

561
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,420
I don't want it.

562
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,110
I can't take the Red Shadow Sword.

563
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,660
You have to.

564
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,220
If you don't help Wei Yun,

565
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,270
he will have to die.

566
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,870
What does that have to do with me?

567
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,310
Listen.

568
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,460
I haven't punished you for seeing him

569
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,870
without my permission.

570
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,710
I just did, so what?

571
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,350
Wei Yun said

572
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
our family was involved

573
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,350
in Lord of Qin's treason case.

574
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,220
Without Mr. Wei Zhong's guarantee,

575
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,790
our family would

576
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,590
have perished in Huajing City.

577
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,270
Yun asked me to bring you this sword

578
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,590
because he was reminding us.

579
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,740
They once helped us

580
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,030
and we should repay them now.

581
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,870
We should?

582
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,110
You go ahead, then.

583
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,980
- Take it.
- Come on.

584
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,900
- Come.
- Take it.

585
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,020
Take it, Father.

586
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,620
- Father.
- Oh, my back.

587
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,140
Oh, my back.

588
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,980
Are you all right?

589
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,630
- Father.
- Brother.

590
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,380
- Stop being so willful.
- Father.

591
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,870
How could you push Father like that?

592
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,940
Ignorant man.

593
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,380
Shut up, the concubine's son.

594
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,870
You know what?

595
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,790
In the Baidi Valley battle,

596
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,070
seventy thousand soldiers died.

597
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,460
Wei Yun's family

598
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,460
may survive.

599
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,700
But they'll be punished.

600
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,550
If I help them recklessly,

601
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,940
I will be seen

602
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,790
as their accomplice.

603
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,220
By then,

604
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,700
our family will also be doomed.

605
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,790
Whatever.

606
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,110
- You're terrible.
- Father!

607
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't call me Father.

608
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,970
I'm not your father.

609
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,380
Father.

610
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,590
Is your back all right?

611
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,670
Look at her.

612
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,830
You are such a bad son.

613
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,790
See? Your sister

614
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,220
is a famous physician in town.

615
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,740
Your younger brother

616
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,350
is even the Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review.

617
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,540
What about you?

618
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,310
You are practically

619
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,830
the most famous playboy

620
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,420
in Huajing City.

621
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Still famous, anyway.

622
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,140
Aren't you ashamed?

623
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,660
You have no ambition.

624
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,350
All you do is bring trouble

625
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,420
to the family and me.

626
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,260
What else can you do?

627
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,460
Could you even be

628
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,140
a good brother for your siblings?

629
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,620
- I can't stand it.
- Father.

630
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,030
- Calm down.
- I threw my back out.

631
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,900
Go rub it for me.

632
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,740
All right.

633
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,140
- Be careful.
- Hurry.

634
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,980
Hurry.

635
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,310
Father, are you going to ignore this?

636
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,170
(Thrive and Prosper)

637
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,020
Be careful.

638
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,510
Move faster.

639
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,420
Father. Father.

640
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,270
Slow down.

641
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,180
What about your back?

642
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,380
I lied to him.

643
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,460
Otherwise,

644
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,310
he wouldn't let me go.

645
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,270
Let's go. Don't let him see us.

646
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,870
He ran really fast.

647
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,940
He should fight in battle.

648
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,900
- Let's go.
- I'm exhausted.

649
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,750
- Be careful.
- Move.

650
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,680
Come on.

651
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,110
Brother,

652
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,830
this case involves policy

653
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
and it's complicated.

654
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,460
Not as simple as you think.

655
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,980
Don't show off.

656
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,870
Move aside. Don't stand in my way.

657
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,930
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

658
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120
The Eldest Princess?

659
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,240
To help His Majesty

660
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,040
with his throne,

661
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,800
she married Jinxi Military Governor

662
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,850
to get his support.

663
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:11,770
So, His Majesty

664
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,610
highly respects her.

665
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,970
What did she say?

666
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,240
She said...

667
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
His Majesty threw Wei Yun in prison

668
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,520
but hasn't convicted him yet.

669
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,610
Do you know why?

670
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,040
His Majesty thinks the Weis are guilty,

671
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,520
but Wei Yun doesn't deserve to die.

672
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,360
Exactly.

673
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,690
You're very clever.

674
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,760
His Majesty

675
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,960
won't release Wei Yun

676
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,280
unless there's a good reason.

677
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,520
It has to be a reason

678
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,810
that follows the law

679
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,810
and silences all opposition.

680
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,560
Are you saying

681
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,330
we'll give His Majesty an out?

682
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,160
A reason that follows the law

683
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,120
and silences all opposition.

684
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,440
What can it be?

685
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,770
It should be sentiment,

686
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,130
human sympathy,

687
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,290
and justice.

688
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,400
Whatever it is,

689
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,410
it won't be easy.

690
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,570
Chun, will you go with me?

691
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,290
Of course.

692
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,160
You've been making efforts for us.

693
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,890
I haven't even thanked you yet.

694
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,810
I will certainly go with you.

695
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,290
Then, Chun,

696
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,600
please take Wei Shu's tablet

697
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,650
and go with me.

698
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,680
His tablet?

699
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,960
Just the two of us will go.

700
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,410
The other ladies will leave eventually.

701
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,250
In that case,

702
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,480
the fewer people go,

703
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,250
the safer it will be.

704
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,690
I get it.

705
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,610
Mr. Wei Jun,

706
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,730
you're like my brother, too.

707
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,210
I will get Wei Yun out for you.

708
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:11,270
(Tablet of Wei Jun, Tablet of Wei Zhong)

709
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,070
(Chengqing Gate)

710
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,170
Who are you?

711
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,330
Chu Yu from Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion.

712
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,850
With the tablets of my family,

713
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,210
we request to see His Majesty.

714
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,410
Ms. Chu, did His Majesty summon you?

715
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,650
No.

716
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,960
Ms. Chu,

717
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,600
why don't you come when summoned?

718
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,730
If it were going to happen,

719
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,560
we needn't have been here.

720
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,450
You're putting me on the spot.

721
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,160
We don't mean to, My Lord.

722
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,480
We simply request you

723
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,730
to inform His Majesty.

724
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,210
We...

725
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,090
My whole family

726
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,450
will not leave

727
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,210
until we see His Majesty,

728
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,080
even if we turn to stone.

729
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,610
Your Majesty,

730
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,450
the ladies of Wei Zhong's family

731
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,480
are kneeling outside.

732
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,650
They said

733
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,450
they would kneel forever

734
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
before an audience.

735
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,440
I believe

736
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,080
they're putting on a show

737
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,290
and threatening with their merits.

738
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,780

(The Court of Judicial Review)

743
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,030
What are you doing here?

744
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,520
I think Yun needs me now.

745
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,880
I will leave.

746
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,150
But before I leave this family,

747
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,550
I have the duty to come.

748
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,880
Yun is the brother

749
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,960
my husband loved most.

750
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,840
If I can secure Yun's release

751
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,400
by bringing his tablet,

752
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,670
I won't have failed him.

753
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,630
In the past, my husband

754
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
loved to play

755
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,200
with his brothers.

756
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,240
If I didn't come,

757
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,960
he would be disappointed.

758
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,320
I think this is

759
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,280
