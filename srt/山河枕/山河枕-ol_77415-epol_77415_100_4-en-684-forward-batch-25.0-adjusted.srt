00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,200
Madam. Don't, Madam.

22
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,710
Don't do this, Madam.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Madam!

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,790
Madam.

25
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,630
- Chun.
- Chun.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
- Chun.
- Chun.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
- Chun.
- Chun.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Chun, are you all right?

29
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,790
- No.
- Chun.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Let me go.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Chun.

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,640
How could you

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
do something so foolish?

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,840
On my wedding day, I sprained my ankle.

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,190
He noticed that

36
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,630
and carried me all the way back.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
He even wiped my foot
with medicinal liquor.

38
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,800
If I hadn't experienced love,

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,870
I'd surrender to fate.

40
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,750
But I once had

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,710
such a wonderful man.

42
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,120
I can't spend the rest of my life alone.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Let me go.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,910
Chun. Chun.

45
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,590
Chun!

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,800
If your death could restart everything,

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,030
we would not stop you.

48
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,960
But what you're doing

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,400
will only bring us trouble.

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,590
It won't help at all.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,470
No matter who dies,

52
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,680
life must move on.

53
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,270
That's not true.

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
That's not.

55
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,590
Let me go.

56
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,470
Dying is easy.

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,120
But what about Lingchun?

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Lingchun.

59
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,990
Lingchun, my son.

60
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,190
You and Shu loved each other.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,630
Lingchun has lived happily
since he was born.

62
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,120
Suddenly, he lost his father.

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,520
How could you let him
lose his mother too?

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
Chun.

65
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,150
All men in our family

66
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,000
are unyielding.

67
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,800
Your husband not only defended

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,310
our nation and its people.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,360
He also wanted you to be carefree.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Chun,

71
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,800
you are his wife

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
and madam of the second branch.

73
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,870
My eldest son never married.

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
So, you're just like

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
my eldest daughter-in-law.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,680
You've been taking care of this family

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,310
and haven't put a foot wrong.

78
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,160
(Wei)
Now,

79
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm entrusting you
with the Commanding Jade Seal

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
of this family.

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,310
Hope you will not

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,080
(Wei)
let me down.

83
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,430
Chun.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
- Madam.
- Chun.

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,640
Mother,

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,750
I won't do such a foolish thing again.

87
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,630
I promise you.

88
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,590
Unless I'm dead,

89
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,390
I will always protect this family.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
Don't cry, Chun.

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,120
- Mother.
- Don't.

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,430
Mother.

93
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,590
Chun.

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
(Wei Yun,)

95
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,800
(you didn't protect your family.)

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
(You're in no position to comfort them.)

97
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,590
Chu Yu.

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,590
What on earth

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,110
do you want from us?

100
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
What do you mean?

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,680
My big brother is dead.

102
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,040
But you're determined to be his widow.

103
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,000
What on earth

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
are you up to?

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,510
What if I simply like Wei Jun?

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Others may

107
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,630
buy that lie.

108
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,560
But you won't fool me.

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,150
You made a scene
at the Spring Breeze House

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,590
and you came here today.

111
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,040
You've been plotting this all along.

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,000
Is it for my big brother

113
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,000
or actually for this family?

114
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,350
Wei Yun,

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,270
instead of suspecting my purpose,

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,870
why don't you think

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,750
about how you can get justice

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,630
for your lost family and dead soldiers?

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Yun.

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Back in there,

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,620
you saved Chun in time.

122
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,630
I had my reservations about you.

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
- Now...
- Mother.

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't let her fool you.

125
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,000
Stop being so rude to her.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm going to the mourning hall.

127
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,120
Yun is

128
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,040
in great distress.

129
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
If he comes off as offensive,

130
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,120
please don't mind.

131
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,910
I won't.

132
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not easy for you to trust me.

133
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,350
And anyway,

134
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,680
Wei Yun had a narrow escape

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
from the battlefield.

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,920
I have something to say as well.

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
You're a different daughter-in-law.

138
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,720
My eldest son

139
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,430
didn't marry you

140
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
with a formal wedding.

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,750
After the funeral,

142
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,720
you can think it through.

143
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,000
You're free to go home anytime.

144
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,950
Do not waste

145
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,360
your youth here.

146
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,270
All right.

147
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll think it through

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,950
and let you know.

149
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Before, Brother and I

150
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
tried really hard,

151
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,480
only to find out about a mountain.

152
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,630
You think you can get more information

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
by simply rummaging around?

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,480
I was just trying to see

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
what I could do to help.

156
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,360
You must not touch

157
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,350
Mr. Wei Jun's stuff.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,840
Since Father died,

159
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,120
I've locked up

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
his study.

161
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,150
Everything in there

162
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,440
is kept the way it was.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
Every time I see it,

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,750
I feel as if he were still around me.

165
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,670
Mr. Wei Jun was upright and honest.

166
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,510
Pretend I'm doing the same

167
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,870
for his own brother.

168
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,560
What's wrong?

169
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,470
Let me see.

170
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,150
How did it end up like this?

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
You leave it alone.

172
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,630
Does it hurt?

173
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,870
It's the first day you've been here

174
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
and you're already hurt.

175
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,030
What's going to happen in the future?

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
My Lady,

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,290
what are your plans?

178
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,040
We'll help them through this crisis.

179
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,900
They're in such big trouble.

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,300
Maybe it's related

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,340
to the leak of the octagonal crossbow.

182
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,020
I'm at the center of the vortex

183
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,300
and I have to be involved.

184
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,140
Otherwise, I will be consumed by it.

185
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,300
But I see General Wei Yun

186
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,300
press you really hard.

187
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,420
I'm afraid

188
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,940
you will have a really hard time

189
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,340
in this mansion.

190
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,980
I'm worried that...

191
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,260
Don't worry.

192
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,580
Mr. Wei Jun just died in battle.

193
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,060
I suddenly

194
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,820
became his widow.

195
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,260
If I were Wei Yun,

196
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,340
I'd be suspicious too.

197
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,700
Once I find out the truth, I will leave.

198
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,340
I don't want to be a burden.

199
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
As for Wei Yun...

200
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,820
We'll cross that bridge

201
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,900
when we come to it.

202
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,300
(True Might)

203
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,020
Kneel.

204
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,900
Read the funeral oration

205
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,900
to tell their stories.

206
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,380
The 27th day of the 7th month

207
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
marked the border crisis.

208
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,300
My father, brothers, and I rushed there.

209
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,580
We fought for seven days and nights

210
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,860
before repelling the enemy.

211
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,660
That night, we drank.

212
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,620
My brothers and I

213
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,100
got drunk on the city tower.

214
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,660
I was too young

215
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,180
to know the life meaning.

216
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,660
So, I asked my brothers

217
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,060
what they would wish for.

218
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,300
My big brother said

219
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,580
he wished for world peace

220
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,980
and justice everywhere.

221
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
My other brothers hailed.

222
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
I asked again,

223
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,700
"In case of world peace,

224
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,980
what will you want to do?"

225
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,940
(Wei's Ancestral Hall)

226
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,380
My brother smiled and replied,

227
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,060
"Watch the willows in spring.

228
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,100
Enjoy the snow in winter.

229
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,300
Drink with friends

230
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,940
and get drunk in the restaurant.

231
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,780
It's dangerous on the battlefield.

232
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,060
Yet it's romantic in Huajing City.

233
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,980
We're just ordinary guys.

234
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,180
Whatever happens,

235
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,420
we'll go back to loving families.

236
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,660
That's enough."

237
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,820
First come, first draw.

238
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,100
- Yun.
- Yun.

239
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,940
Don't cheat.

240
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,860
Father.

241
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,020
When will Yun

242
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,820
truly grow up?

243
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,660
Father, if he can always

244
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,100
remain so carefree,

245
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,580
isn't that great?

246
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:56,900
(Wei)

247
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
Raise the coffins!

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,690
Isn't he the Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review?

249
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,660
What's he doing here?

250
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,460
I'm Minister Cao Yan of the Court.

251
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,180
I was sent to get sinful Wei Yun.

252
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,220
Mr. Cao,

253
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,380
what crime did I commit?

254
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,860
Your family overreached,

255
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,700
causing the death of 70,000 soldiers

256
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,900
in Baidi Valley.

257
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,020
Even in death,

258
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,540
they are held responsible.

259
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,180
Oh, I see.

260
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,420
All those soldiers

261
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,860
lost their lives in vain

262
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,060
just because of your family!

263
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,940
Thousands of our soldiers

264
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,460
spilled their blood

265
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
and gave their lives

266
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,140
to contribute for a century

267
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,460
to your family's glory.

268
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,900
How could you still be greedy?

269
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,940
The Weis are murderers.

270
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,460
Since Wei Yun is still alive,

271
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,620
hold him accountable.

272
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,100
- Hold him accountable!
- Hold him accountable!

273
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,060
We demand justice from the court!

274
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:48,940
We demand justice! We demand justice!

275
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,540
General Wei Yun,

276
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,100
did you hear?

277
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,740
This is what our people want.

278
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
I advise you

279
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,500
not to resist arrest.

280
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,860
Otherwise,

281
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,460
I'll have to be rude.

282
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,300
Yun.

283
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,140
It's him.

284
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,620
- It's him.
- It's him.

285
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,340
What are you doing? Stop it.

286
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,660
- Stop.
- Lan, be careful.

287
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,860
Stop it.

288
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,700
No.

289
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,540
That's not true.

290
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,620
You're to blame.

291
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,060
Our family isn't...

292
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,740
- Mother.
- Mother.

293
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,580
Mother.

294
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,860
Mr. Cao,

295
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,380
my father and brothers aren't buried.

296
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,620
Sorry, but right now,

297
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,780
I can't go with you.

298
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,300
That's not a problem.

299
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,060
Somebody.

300
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,700
Take these criminals' coffins

301
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,060
back to our court too.

302
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,060
Yes.

303
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,340
Wait.

304
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,460
Mr. Cao,

305
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,660
when you enjoyed your life here,

306
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,220
Wei's 70,000 soldiers

307
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
were fighting a bloody battle

308
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,980
to defend our nation.

309
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,980
So, Mr. Cao,

310
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,300
please show some respect for them.

311
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,340
Let's not make a move

312
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,500
until they're buried.

313
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,740
Respect?

314
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,980
Ms. Chu,

315
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,300
take a close look.

316
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,780
What wood is used

317
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,380
for their coffins?

318
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,740
What patterns are on them?

319
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,580
And what paint is used?

320
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,060
The wood, patterns,

321
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,540
and paint are used

322
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,380
according to the ranking

323
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
of Marquis of Zhenguo and his sons.

324
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
Nothing is wrong.

325
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,060
Ridiculous.

326
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,540
Wei Zhong and his sons are sinful.

327
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,500
By law,

328
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,380
they can only be buried as commoners.

329
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,140
They don't deserve such good coffins.

330
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,140
- Somebody.
- Here.

331
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,620
Go to the east of town

332
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,220
and buy some ordinary coffins.

333
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,540
I'm being really generous.

334
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,300
Your family has collapsed.

335
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,780
These coffins

336
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,180
will be my present

337
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,420
for you.

338
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,620
Don't bother to thank me, General.

339
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Ms. Chu,

340
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,140
don't try to stop me anymore.

341
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,900
Go back home

342
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,660
and live with Wei Jun's tablet.

343
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,500
Cao Yan,

344
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
I dare you

345
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,980
to touch their coffins!

346
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,500
Guards.

347
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Take out the bodies

348
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,140
of Wei Zhong and his sons.

349
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,980
Yes.

350
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,420
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

351
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,260
No.

352
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,700
Cao Yan!

353
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,380
If you hurt their bodies,

354
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,700
I will slaughter your entire family!

355
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,460
You don't know if or when my family

356
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,300
will be slaughtered.

357
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,900
But I know

358
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,980
every single one of yours

359
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,380
will die very soon.

360
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,940
- Wei Yun.
- Go away!

361
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,780
Yun.

362
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,100
Cao Yan,

363
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,900
don't go too far!

364
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
You wouldn't dare

365
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,180
to kill an official right here.

366
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,220
If you take one more step forward,

367
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,140
I will kill you!

368
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,380
I just did, so what?

369
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,540
Wei Yun.

370
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,380
No, Yun.

371
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,460
Yun.

372
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,100
No.

373
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,020
Don't do that.

374
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,700
Yun.

375
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,300
Cao Yan.

376
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,380
Why are you pushing us like this?

377
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,300
Trying to exterminate us?

378
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,300
Then, today,

379
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,180
I will kill myself

380
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,620
to clear our name.

381
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
My family

382
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,700
has a clear conscience.

383
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,700
Mother!

384
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,460
Mother!

385
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,540
Mother.

386
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,420
- Mother.
- Mother.

387
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,860
Mother.

388
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,020
Mother.

389
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,420
Mother.

390
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,420
Yun.

391
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,980
Don't cry.

392
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,620
A soldier seldom

393
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,260
gets to be with his wife in life

394
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,620
or see her in death.

395
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,420
Mother has to leave you alone.

396
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,580
I'm going to see your father.

397
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,380
Our family rule.

398
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,700
Our family rule.

399
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,620
Defend the nation and the throne.

400
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,780
Hold no regrets.

401
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,900
Mother.

402
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,260
Mother.

403
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,580
Mother.

404
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,860
Mother.

405
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,900
Mother!

406
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,940
This is the Wei family!

407
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
Why did you do this

408
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,260
to this family of loyal heroes?

409
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,380
It's still in broad daylight.

410
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,580
Cao Yan,

411
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,180
you killed an innocent woman!

412
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,780
You killed an innocent woman!

413
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,100
What are you doing?

414
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,140
Mother demonstrated with her life

415
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,420
that we had a century-old reputation

416
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,620
and we would never attack an official.

417
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,340
So, we will

418
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,380
defend their coffins with our bodies.

419
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,140
None of us

420
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,660
will hurt our own people.

421
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
We must not fight.

422
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,500
I'm here at the order of His Majesty.

423
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,900
Are you

424
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,100
trying to defy His Majesty?

425
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,940
How dare some wives of criminals

426
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,140
stand in my way?

427
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,420
Get out of my way.

428
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,140
Out of my way!

429
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,140
Move aside.

430
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,100
Get out of the way.

431
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,940
Don't move.

432
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,940
Cao Yan,

433
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,300
you're going too far!

434
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,900
Cao Yan, I dare you

435
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,100
to hurt these loyal people.

436
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,380
They defended our nation for ages.

437
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,980
How could you deny their contributions

438
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,980
just because of one mere defeat?

439
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,380
- We don't agree!
- Yeah.

440
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,380
We don't agree!

441
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,380
- We don't!
- We don't!

442
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,700
That's right.

443
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,420
You're hurting innocent people.

444
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,340
This is infuriating!

445
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,580
These stubborn people

446
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,020
are interfering.

447
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,100
Take them back too!

448
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,300
Let them go.

449
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,220
Let go!

450
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,740
Let go!

451
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,660
Let them go!

452
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,300
Let go! Let go!

453
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,220
Back off.

454
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,580
- Back off.
- Let go.

455
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,580
Cao Yan.

456
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,140
When you insulted me that day,

457
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,100
did you see this coming?

458
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,220
Let go.

459
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,820
Let go.

460
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,300
Cao Yan.

461
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,860
Let go!

462
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,740
Wei Yun,

463
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,660
what else are you trying to say?

464
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Don't hurt these people.

465
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,660
I'll go with you.

466
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,700
- General Wei Yun.
- Don't.

467
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
Yun.

468
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,780
- Don't.
- Just don't.

469
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,660
Yeah.

470
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,500
Are you sure?

471
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,340
Today, if you dare

472
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,300
to hurt anyone present,

473
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,620
I will kill you right here.

474
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,020
Try me, if you dare.

475
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,260
Take him.

476
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,100
Yes.

477
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,380
Cao Yan.

478
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,380
Grand Tutor.

479
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,660
(Xie Mingyi, the Grand Tutor)

480
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,500
Unshackle him.

481
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Grand Tutor,

482
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,700
what do you mean?

483
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,740
How dare you be so impudent

484
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,140
in front of these loyal souls?

485
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,740
Cao Yan,

486
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,580
the Weis aren't convicted yet.

487
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,180
Even if they are,

488
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,540
they'll still be a noble family.

489
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,820
Unless His Majesty

490
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,740
strips away their nobility,

491
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,380
they're still the family
of Marquis of Zhenguo.

492
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,140
Rites and laws
are the emperor's prestige.

493
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,380
Do you

494
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,860
show no respect for His Majesty?

495
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,020
Grand Tutor,

496
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,580
you get me wrong.

497
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,740
His Majesty sent me.

498
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,940
If I can't bring back this sinful man,

499
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,660
I'm afraid I'll lose my life.

500
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,940
Do you have to rush
within just one hour?

501
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,700
Or are you actually

502
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,380
taking revenge for yourself?

503
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,660
I was too hasty.

504
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,460
Grand Tutor, please don't blame me.

505
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,860
I'm also concerned with rites and laws.

506
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,700
But I guess we understand them

507
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,740
in different ways.

508
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
In this case,

509
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,900
General Wei Yun...

510
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,740
You may proceed.

511
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,420
My men and I

512
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,740
will wait behind you.

513
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,820
Grand Tutor.

514
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,380
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of my family.

515
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,180
You...

516
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,500
- Thank you, Grand Tutor.
- Thank you.

517
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,780
Don't do this.

518
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,980
Get up now.

519
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
Don't do this.

520
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,500
Get up.

521
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,620
Since Mother died

522
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,980
for our father-in-law,

523
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,820
let's bury them in the same coffin.

524
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,240
Rest in peace, Your Lordship!

525
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,750
Rest in peace, generals!

526
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,240
Rest in peace, Your Lordship!

527
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,440
Rest in peace, generals!

528
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,020
Kneel.

529
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,380
Kowtow.

530
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,300
(Filial piety never fades.)

531
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,860
(Blessings linger forever.)

532
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,620
Kowtow again.

533
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:10,300
(Filial piety never fades.)

534
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,220
I, Wei Yun, hereby swear.

535
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,420
If I come back alive,

536
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,060
I will live up to your expectations.

537
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,940
I'll find out the truth,

538
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,820
protect our family,

539
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,220
and defend our nation.

540
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,220
General Wei Yun,

541
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,980
can we go now?

542
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,900
Cao Yan,

543
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,820
if you dare

544
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,900
to lay one finger on him,

545
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,980
we will become your sworn enemies.

546
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,740
Wei Yun.

547
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,220
Take care.

548
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,500
Even if you're up to something,

549
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,780
you don't need

550
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,900
to waste your life there.

551
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,460
Go back home.

552
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,420
You should worry about yourself.

553
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,420
Cao Yan won't let you off.

554
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,460
You'll have a hard time in prison.

555
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,780
Your family is in trouble.

556
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,940
I won't just stand by.

557
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,020
My sisters-in-law,

558
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,220
take care.

559
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,780
Yun.

560
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,740
Whoa, easy.

561
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,580
I just won't be.

562
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,940
So, you'll learn your lesson.

563
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,420
You should have protected yourself.

564
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,580
Why didn't you take me during the day?

565
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,220
Had I been there,

566
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,260
I could have protected you.

567
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,460
You?

568
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,820
You're so hot-tempered.

569
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,780
Had you been there,

570
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,340
you would have fought Cao Yan.

571
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,220
Messing with him

572
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
wouldn't do you any good.

573
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,100
I don't care.

574
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,420
Cao Yan is

575
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,380
a terrible guy, anyway.

576
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,780
General Wei Yun is in prison.

577
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,020
No one here can restrain us.

578
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,100
Let's search around

579
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,060
and then go back home.

580
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,340
We can't leave now.

581
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,380
And we must get Wei Yun out.

582
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,560
He lost his father and brothers.

583
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,500
Even his mother...

584
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,220
Anyone who feels sympathy

585
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,820
would step up like me.

586
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,060
My Lady,

587
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,500
did they remind you

588
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,660
of your own father?

589
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,980
We don't have

590
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,100
a family rule

591
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,700
to defend the nation or hold no regrets.

592
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,980
Father kept telling me

593
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,500
death was always a part of battle

594
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,500
and I should protect myself.

595
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,940
But everybody feels sympathy.

596
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,420
When I just came here yesterday,

597
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,780
I didn't understand.

598
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,020
But anyway,

599
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,900
they moved me.

600
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,220
In my opinion,

601
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,460
people defend this nation

602
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,300
in different ways.

603
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,740
But all in all,

604
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,700
they share the same goal.

605
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,100
Yeah.

606
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,500
Some wanted to live

607
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,220
but ended up dead.

608
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,340
There are always people
who sacrifice for justice.

609
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
Those people are heroes.

610
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,580
Since I can't be one of them,

611
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,740
I should protect them

612
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,980
from being insulted.

613
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,660
What happened today

614
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,100
hardened my resolve

615
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
to find out the truth

616
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,740
of the crossbow case.

617
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,980
But once we manage

618
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,260
to get General Wei Yun out,

619
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,780
won't it be harder

620
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,820
to investigate that case?

621
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,060
Only after I get Wei Yun out

622
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,260
can I feel more secure.

623
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,080
The Arsenal Bureau

624
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,800
is an important military site.

625
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,160
If Wei Yun is convicted

626
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,320
and his family falls,

627
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
the supervisor of the Arsenal Bureau

628
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,640
will be someone else.

629
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,480
Then, it'll be harder to sneak in.

630
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,400
For whatever reason,

631
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,320
I have to get Wei Yun out.

632
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,320
Then, My Lady,

633
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,440
have you come up with a plan?

634
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,960
(The Court of Judicial Review)

635
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,160
My Lord.

636
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,320
My Lord.

637
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Please let us out.

638
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,040
We're innocent.

639
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,000
My Lord.

640
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
My Lord.

641
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,200
It's stuffy in here.

642
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,680
In case you can hardly breathe,

643
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
I had you attended to first.

644
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,080
If looks could kill,

645
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm afraid

646
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,160
you'd have killed me a thousand times.

647
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,080
But under such circumstances,

648
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,480
even if I let you down,

649
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,360
would you dare to kill me?

650
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,680
You never had any conflict with us.

651
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,480
Someone must have ordered you,

652
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,320
so you dared to exterminate us.

653
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,080
We always handle a case

654
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,640
under the order of authorities.

655
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,840
But this time,

656
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
it's His Majesty who gave an order.

657
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,440
I don't think it's His Majesty.

658
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,280
It's...

659
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,440
The Duke of Ning.

660
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,640
If my family falls,

661
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,640
the one who benefits the most

662
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,320
will be the Duke of Ning,
head of the civil officials.

663
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,360
Cao Yan,

664
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,800
His Majesty hates the clique thing most.

665
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,440
You're knowingly defying him.

666
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,680
You're truly Wei Zhong's son.

667
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,120
Wei Yun,

668
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,760
you're really clever.

669
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
But sadly,

670
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
even if you know the truth,

671
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
what can you do to me?

672
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,520
You don't think

673
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,320
you can leave alive,

674
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,600
do you?

675
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,040
Wei Yun,

676
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,120
your family got 70,000 soldiers killed.

677
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,520
Do you or do you not

678
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,760
plead guilty?

679
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
We are innocent.

680
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,800
Not guilty!

681
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
