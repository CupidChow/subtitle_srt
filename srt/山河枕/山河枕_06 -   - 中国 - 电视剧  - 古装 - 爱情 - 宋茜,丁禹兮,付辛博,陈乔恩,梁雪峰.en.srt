was bought with thousands,

tens of thousands of lives

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,840
from our clan.

37
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,150
It must not,

38
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,150
and will not, fall here.

39
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,520
If His Majesty insists on condemning Wei Yun,

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,400
we will kneel here without rising.

41
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,030
Even if we freeze to death,

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
we will

00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,750
hold him up.

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,960
(But you died for our state.)

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,870
(You are a hero.)

58
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,400
Eat.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
Lord Cao says

60
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,920
that you spent years on campaign

61
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,680
and is used to this food.

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,360
You'd

63
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
better eat.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,360
No one

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,750
will visit you

66
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,800
again.

67

Han.

Wei Qiu,

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,560
escort Lady Han back.

71
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,470
Yu,

72
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,830
Lan is pregnant.

73
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,950
Let her return too.

74
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,430
Wei Qiu,

75
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,430
escort Lady Lan as well.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
Careful.

77
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,180
(Tablet of Wei Zhong, Marquis of Zhenguo)

78
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,820
(Chengqing Gate)

79
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Look, entire Wei family

80
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,090
are still kneeling.

81
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,240
They've been kneeling a long time.

82
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
Yes.

83
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,070
And right here at the gate.

84
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,700
(Zhang An, Deputy Minister of Personnel)

85
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,590
Deputy Minister Zhang,

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
where are you going?

87
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,000
Mr. cao,

88
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,430
I'm going to another gate.

89
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,830
I won't enter from here.

90
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,270
Why?

91
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,880
Heroes rest here.

92
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,430
How could I take their path?

93
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,240
The side gate is enough.

94
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,360
Such pretense.

95
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,710
Lady Chu,

96
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,630
why pretending like this?

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,190
If kneeling could move His Majesty,

98
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,720
what use

99
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,710
is our law?

100
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Mr. Cao is right.

101
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,720
You ignore the law and try

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
to coerce the throne.

103
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
The law may be rigid.

104
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,360
Our laws exist for the people.

105
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,270
Duke of Ning and Lord Cao,

106
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,790
you've reversed cause and effect.

107
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,990
Teacher.

108
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,200
Sincerity

109
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,270
can pierce stone.

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Academician Gu,

111
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,670
what does that old man's

112
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
saying mean?

113
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,750
Mr. Cao,

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
the snow is coming.

115
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,150
Best hurry.

116
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,510
If you can't take it,

117
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,440
go rest a while.

118
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,350
I'm fine.

119
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
If you can stand,

120
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,240
so can I.

121
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,800
Sister,

122
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,510
are you alright?

123
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,390
Just because you called me "Sister,"

124
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
I must hold on.

125
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
Since we're here,

126
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,630
there's no turning back.

127
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
Linyang, it's freezing.

128
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,270
Don't go.

129
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,320
Chu Linyang!

130
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,710
Chu Linyang!

131
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,150
Dressed like this,

132
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,320
are you going to the palace?

133
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,670
You returned from Fengling injured

134
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,750
and haven't attended court.

135
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,870
Now, with the Wei family in crisis,

136
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,270
you go despite illness?

137
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,440
Chu Yu is already married into the Wei family.

138
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,480
At this moment

139
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
you should avoid suspicion.

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,870
Otherwise His Majesty

141
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,030
will doubt our families' ties.

142
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
If we

143
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,510
anger Duke of Ning,

144
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,790
how will the Chu family survive?

145
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
Mother,

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
in the wind and snow at the Chu Mansion,

147
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,360
someone can holds an umbrella for us.

148
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,200
But before the palace gates,

149
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,630
no one shields Yu from the storm.

150
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,630
I'm going today

151
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,110
not for anyone else,

152
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,030
but for her.

153
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
She chose to marry into the Wei family.

154
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,390
She chose to kneel at the palace gates.

155
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,390
Every bit of suffering

156
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,030
is her own doing.

157
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
Linyang,

158
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,960
this family

159
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,910
isn't only her.

160
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,840
If something happens to you,

161
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,360
what will Mother and I do?

162
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Do you only

163
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
see Chu Yu as you sister,

164
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,120
but not me?

165
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,320
Jin,

166
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,360
if you were the one kneeling at the gate today,

167
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,840
I would go without hesitation

168
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,720
to shield you as well.

169
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,710
I don't believe you.

170
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,150
Linyang, make your choice

171
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,720
between Jin and Yu today.

172
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,630
If you step out that gate,

173
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,080
you lose me as your sister.

174
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,590
Jin,

175
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,510
stop being childish.

176
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,510
I must go today.

177
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,710
Mother,

178
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,080
Yu is holding up

179
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,030
the entire Wei family alone.

180
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,750
No one stands behind her.

181
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
I am her brother,

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,440
her family.

183
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
How can I do nothing?

184
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,360
Brother!

185
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Your Majesty,

186
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,080
Wei Yun is now

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
imprisoned by the Court

188
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,560
of Judicial Review,

189
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,030
yet Minister Cao

190
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,200
has found no solid evidence

191
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,600
against the Wei family.

192
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,270
Without evidence,

193
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,720
Wei Yun should be released.

194
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,150
I beg Your Majesty to show mercy.

195
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,750
I, Chu Linyang, implore

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,120
Your Majesty to pardon Wei Yun.

197
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,270
Young General Chu,

198
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,720
you came to court too today.

199
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,720
My father died for the state.

200
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,160
Now

201
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,600
I am weak in body, and

202
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,750
my younger sister bears the burden alone,

203
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,720
defending Wei family's honor

204
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,630
with all her loyalty.

205
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,720
I cannot bear it,

206
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,480
so I beg for her sake.

207
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,480
General Chu, are you trying to sway

208
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,240
His Majesty with sentiment?

209
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,380
Seventy thousand loyal souls

210
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
lie buried in Baidi Valley, Your Majesty.

211
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,750
This cannot be investigated

212
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,870
overnight.

213
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,910
Please give

214
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,200
the Court more time.

215
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,840
I will definitely

216
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,080
unveil the truth.

217
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,030
If the Wei family is truly innocent,

218
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,440
we will clear their name.

219
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,230
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,510
seventy thousand

221
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,120
died because Wei Zhong

222
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,390
sought merit and acted rashly.

223
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,480
Seven members of the Wei family died.

224
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,160
Are their lives considered lives,

225
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,670
but the seventy thousand

226
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,030
are not?

227
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,200
Duke of Ning,

228
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,480
hearing you speak

229
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,600
so confidently,

230
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,510
one might think

231
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,750
you actually

232
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,320
was there in Baidi Valley.

233
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,600
Your Highness, you jest.

234
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,320
I am but a civil official,

235
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,000
unfit for the battlefield.

236
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,270
Good.

237
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,240
Since you insist,

238
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,750
I will support you.

239
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,150
A war I choose to fight,

240
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,510
I never lose.

241
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,040
Changming?

242
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
You came too?

243
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,240
Forgive me, Brother.

244
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,550
I shouldn't be here,

245
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,910
but this concerns Huan.

246
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,840
As his aunt,

247
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,680
I cannot stay away.

248
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,360
Her Highness is right.

249
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,750
Since the Crown Prince

250
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,150
and General Yao are here,

251
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
let them recount

252
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,550
the events so His Majesty

253
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,360
may judge fairly.

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Huan is grown,

255
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,870
brave and capable

256
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,960
even in the battlefield.

257
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,510
About what happened in Baidi Valley,

258
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,480
even if he says nothing,

259
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,910
I believe

260
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,510
the Court

261
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,030
will uncover the truth.

262
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,360
As crown prince

263
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,600
and His Majesty's only bloodline,

264
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,840
he knows Him best.

265
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,270
His Majesty never spares

266
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,960
a guilty man

267
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,150
nor wrongs an innocent one.

268
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,280
Am I right,

269
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,800
Huan?

270
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,150
Father,

271
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,510
though seventy thousand died,

272
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,400
the Wei family

273
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,310
has always been loyal.

274
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,560
Everything they did

275
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,920
was for the realm

276
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,760
and the people.

277
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,220
Their merits outweigh faults.

278
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,400
Please spare Wei Yun.

279
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,280
Your Majesty,

280
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,880
if a man sheds blood

281
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,350
for the realm,

282
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,400
yet his widows and orphans

283
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,480
must still suffer cold and scorn,

284
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,960
if a family that has fought

285
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,800
for four generations

286
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,160
still leaves its descendants disgraced,

287
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,350
then the hearts

288
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,750
of those

289
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,480
seventy thousand

290
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
who died will freeze.

291
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Your Majesty,

292
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,790
for the Wei family's

293
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,510
century of loyalty,

294
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,400
please free Wei Yun.

295
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,790
We beg Your Majesty.

296
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,070
We beg Your Majesty.

297
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,920
- We beg Your Majesty.
- We beg Your Majesty.

298
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,590
- We beg Your Majesty.
- We beg Your Majesty.

299
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,920
- We beg Your Majesty.
- We beg Your Majesty.

300
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,480
Your Majesty,

301
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,310
this case is grave.

302
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,200
Even with all these pleas,

303
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,960
the law cannot be ignored.

304
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,830
Please rule impartially.

305
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
You rascal,

306
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,750
speaking wildly again.

307
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,680
Your Majesty,

308
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,750
if you add my plea,

309
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,750
surely it carries weight.

310
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,190
Your Majesty,

311
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,510
since even Duke of Hu

312
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,680
begs for the Wei family,

313
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,510
you might as well visit the Madam

314
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,310
of the Wei family at the palace gate.

315
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,070
Once you see her,

316
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,440
you will understand

317
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,440
why we kneel here

318
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,240
and plea for them.

319
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,720
(Chengqing Gate)
His Majesty arrives!

320
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,540
(Chengqing Gate)

321
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,720
Still pretending.

322
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,510
If you admire them so much,

323
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,240
wait till you die,

324
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,240
you can have your descendants

325
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,920
set out your memorial tablet too.

326
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,110
Mind your step, Your Majesty.

327
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,750
Whose wife are you?

328
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,590
Your Majesty,

329
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,480
I am

330
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,270
the wife

331
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,480
of General Wei Jun,

332
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,920
the daughter of Chu Jianchang, Chu Yu.

333
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,000
You kneel here asking to see me

334
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,200
for what matter?

335
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,750
My entire family has come

336
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,830
to beg Your Majesty

337
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,830
to release Wei Yun.

338
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
The state has its laws.

339
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes,

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,840
I understand.

341
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,400
Laws

342
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,590
are not for personal desires.

343
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,400
I was born into a military family

344
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,200
and once followed my father to war,

345
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,240
taking the protection of home as my duty,

346
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,920
the Wei family even more so.

347
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,480
I do not know what crime
the Wei family committed,

348
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,880
nor what crime Wei Yun committed.

349
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,440
I only know the Wei family's loyalty.

350
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,350
If Your Majesty

351
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,270
insists he pay

352
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,200
for his mistakes,

353
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,200
I beg you

354
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,920
let him die on the battlefield,

355
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,080
not

356
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,750
in prison,

357
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,280
to honor

358
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,550
the Wei family's devotion to the realm.

359
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,860
(Spirit Tablet of Wei Jun
Spirit Tablet of Wei Zhong)

360
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,180
(Spirit tablet of Wei Ya)

361
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,900
(Spirit tablet of Wei Rong)

362
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,270
Bring Wei Yun to court.

363
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,630
Yu.

364
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,590
Yu.

365
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,200
I, Wei Yun,

366
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,160
bows before Your Majesty.

367
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,670
What...

368
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,160
How did he get hurt like this?

369
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,200
He was only jailed,

370
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,200
how did it become this?

371
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Cao Yan!

372
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,270
I did not know

373
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,590
the Court was this incompetent.

374
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,550
Do you only torture confessions out of people?

375
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,680
Your Majesty,

376
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,520
I am fearful.

377
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,920
I acted strictly under orders

378
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,270
and would never overstep.

379
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,790
Was it under imperial orders

380
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,960
that you whipped my father

381
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,590
and brothers' coffins in public?

382
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,790
Whipped Lady Yu?

383
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,960
And drove my mother to her death in the street?

384
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,200
The Wei family is a family of criminals.

385
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,550
If I am a criminal,

386
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,030
my guilt should be judged by His Majesty.

387
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
I ask you:

388
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,790
did His Majesty order these things?

389
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,920
Answer me.

390
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,030
I have not yet been convicted,

391
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,830
yet you abuse private punishment

392
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,960
and mistreat an official.

393
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,030
Was that under His Majesty's orders as well?

394
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,480
Chancellor.

395
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,000
Your Majesty.

396
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,790
The case is not yet concluded,

397
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,720
yet Mr. Cao

398
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,590
has disgraced the entire Wei family.

399
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,560
This is a shame

400
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,110
of our dynasty.

401
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,320
Guards!

402
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,200
Cao Yan, Minister of Justice,

403
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,440
for dereliction of duty and abuse of power,

404
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,000
take him to the dungeon

405
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,070
to await judgment.

406
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,920
Your Majesty!

407
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,070
I am innocent!

408
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,590
I acted for the state!

409
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,440
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

410
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,030
Your Majesty, have mercy!

411
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,160
Your Majesty! Spare me!

412
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,510
Your Majesty!

413
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

414
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,750
Your Majesty is wise.

415
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,520
Wei Zhong was

416
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,790
my study companion in childhood.

417
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,270
Since he died for the country,

418
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,910
I must

419
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,270
show care

420
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,550
for his bloodline.

421
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,320
Wei Yun,

422
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,310
I hope you live well

423
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,960
and restore the Wei household.

424
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,240
As long as you live,

425
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,750
the Wei family's spirit lives on.

426
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,040
Yun,

427
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,790
do you understand

428
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,550
my burdens?

429
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,510
I don't understand many things.

430
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,590
I only know

431
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
I am of the Wei family.

432
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,590
I will protect the realm,

433
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,240
the land, and the people,

434
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,270
with no regret in life or death.

435
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:38,870
Good.

436
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
Good.

437
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,400
Go back

438
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,510
and recover well.

439
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

Good,

469
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,590
you didn't keep me waiting long.

470
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,590
You haven't come to the palace in a long time.

471
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,200
Do you still remember this centennial soup?

472
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
You used to

473
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,880
love it.

474
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
Thank you, Brother.

475
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,920
But time has passed,

476
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,310
and my tastes have changed.

477
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,550
I fear I'll

478
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,510
disappoint you.

479
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,920
As long as you come often,

480
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,280
I'll have them

481
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,440
prepare anything you like.

482
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,760
Thank you.

483
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,640
I came today

484
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,960
to ask something of you.

485
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
I know,

486
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,110
you're here about

487
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,830
the Wei family.

488
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,350
Yes.

489
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm here for the Wei family,

490
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,550
and for you.

491
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,480
Your rule is already unstable,

492
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,310
do you not see it?

493
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,640
Generals of Chu and Wei have fallen
one after another,

494
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,550
as if the army has lost both arms.

495
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,880
Our state has been at war year after year.

496
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,030
Now even Wei Zhong is gone.

497
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,960
If you don't release Wei Yun

498
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,030
to lead the Wei household,

499
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,960
when war breaks out again,

500
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,430
who will hold the line?

501
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,480
I know you wish

502
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
to balance civil and military power

503
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,110
and avoid strong military clans
growing too close.

504
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,790
And I know the Duke of Ning

505
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,000
supports peace talks with North Qi

506
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,240
to gain time to recover,

507
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,270
to win without fighting.

508
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,070
But you cannot

509
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,590
negotiate from a losing position.

510
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
My rule

511
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,200
was built with your blood and tears.

512
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,680
I won't let you down.

513
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Since you already has a plan in mind,

514
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm relieved.

515
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,590
I'll take my leave.

516
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,070
When will you visit the palace again?

517
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,920
Whenever you summons me,

518
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,630
I will come.

519
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
But there are some past matters

520
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,510
I do not wish to hear again.

521
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,190
Back then,

522
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,920
so I could inherit

523
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,070
the throne,

524
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,440
Changming married the Jinxi Military Governor,

525
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,360
buying his support for me.

526
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,840
But after the wedding,

527
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,190
she suffered endless torment.

528
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,280
She has

529
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,920
escaped that misery,

530
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,710
yet I know

531
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,880
my Changming

532
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,030
has never

533
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,670
truly healed.

534
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,230
Those memories remain

535
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,190
a knot between us.

536
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,070
I

537
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,590
owe her so much.

538
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,840
My Lady,

539
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,360
the way you're drinking that medicine

540
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,400
looks like you're ready to die heroically.

541
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Who'd imagine

542
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,550
our fearless Lady Chu

543
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,760
is actually

544
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,030
afraid of medicine?

545
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,360
Right,

546
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,200
how is Wei Yun?

547
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,720
General Wei,

548
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,760
I need to press out

549
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,920
the pus in your leg before applying medicine.

550
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,200
Bear with it.

551
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,030
Doctor,

552
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,400
please

553
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,240
be gentle.

554
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
I've seen mountains of corpses

555
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,200
on the battlefield,

556
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,910
how could I fear this?

557
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,360
It's bone-deep.

558
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,030
You must rest more.

559
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,110
I'll take my leave.

560
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,200
How is she?

561
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,800
Why do you care about him?

562
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,760
You look like this—

563
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
sick and wounded—

564
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,840
because of him.

565
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,360
And this is his family's home.

566
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,840
Plenty of people care for him here.

567
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,550
My lady,

568
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,190
even in the southwest,

569
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,030
you never fell ill like this.

570
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,510
But after just days in the Wei household,

571
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,670
you're making up

572
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,960
for every sickness

573
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,800
and disaster

574
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,150
you never had.

575
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,470
I don't regret it.

576
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,960
I don't regret saving Wei Yun.

577
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,200
My Lord.

578
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
Linyang?

579
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Yu.

580
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,150
Yu.

581
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,990
Linyang,

582
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,430
why are you here?

583
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,510
You were gravely ill,

584
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,920
so I came to bring you home.

585
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,000
But seeing you like this,

586
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,190
you seem to be recovering well.

587
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,640
Of course!

588
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,760
Who am I?

589
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,630
I'm Chu Yu,

590
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,160
strong as ever.

591
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,670
But I still worry.

592
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,680
Yu,

593
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,950
come home with me.

594
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,070
There are many ways

595
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,400
to find the truth.

596
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,270
You don't have to sacrifice yourself like this.

597
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,070
- I can't just watch you...
- Linyang,

598
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,440
what I'm investigating

599
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,360
isn't solved yet.

600
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,960
The road I'm walking

601
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
hasn't reached its end.

602
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,320
Besides, didn't I save

603
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
Wei Yun today?

604
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,880
The Wei family hasn't fallen.

605
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And I believe

606
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,280
winter's snow will melt,

607
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,480
and spring's flowers will bloom.

608
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,910
I won't give up.

609
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,360
I will keep going.

610
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,000
Young General Chu

611
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,590
wanted to take Lady Chu back home,

612
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,550
but she

613
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,590
insisted on staying.

614
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,840
The doctor visited her.

615
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,840
She only needs

616
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,030
a few days' rest.

617
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,860
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

618
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,640
Duke.

619
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,070
Academician Gu,

620
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,880
in court today,

621
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,670
what possessed you

622
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,760
to forget

623
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,550
who granted you

624
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,590
your current success?

625
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,280
You're angry that

626
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
I didn't stand up for you?

627
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,800
Father,

628
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,510
the doctor said your liver fire is high.

629
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Please don't get angry.

630
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,280
Drink some tea please.

631
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,910
Chusheng

632
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,670
is not an ungrateful man.

633
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,280
There must be

634
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,920
a misunderstanding.

635
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,320
Here,

636
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,720
have some tea.

637
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,190
If you won't drink it,

638
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,760
I won't believe any "misunderstanding."

639
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,870
Father,

640
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,070
the tea is very hot.

641
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,360
His seat is also very hot.

642
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,070
Let him feel it.

643
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,070
Thank you for the tea.

644
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,350
Wait.

645
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,640
Let me

646
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,840
fill your cup to the brim.

647
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,150
You know it's hot now?

648
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,440
So listen.

649
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,320
Otherwise, go back to the southwest.

650
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,800
There's only cold tea there.

651
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,800
I will remember

652
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,510
your teachings,

653
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,280
Duke.

654
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:37,990
