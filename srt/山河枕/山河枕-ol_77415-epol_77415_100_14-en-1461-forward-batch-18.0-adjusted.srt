Chu Yu.

Protect the Eldest Princess!

24
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
Young Master!

25
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,750
Chu Yu!

26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,340
Gu!

27
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,560
- My Lady!
- Stop!

28
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,590
My Lady.

29
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,120
Be careful, Yu!

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
Hold my hand!

31
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
Hold on tight!

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,800
- My Lady!
- My Lady!

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,360
Thank you, Yun.

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,920
Are you alright?

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,990
I'm fine.

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,710
Greetings, Your Highness.

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,260
No need to stand on ceremony.

38
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,270
Chu Yu,

39
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,430
how are you?

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,750
Your Highness,

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,590
I'm fine.

42
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
Impressive, Yun.

43
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,880
Catching someone with bare hands

44
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,950
is as easy as pie for you.

45
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,360
It seems that Mr. Gu

46
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,730
still can't let go of Chu Yu.

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,710
Indeed.

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,810
He instinctively tried to save her.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,470
But Mrs. Gu...

50
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,140
Your Highness,

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,340
we've caught the assassin.

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
However,

53
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,520
he's poisoned himself to death.

54
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,420
Has his identity been discovered?

55
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,180
Not yet.

56
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,860
The body has been sent
to the Court of Judicial Review.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,960
I will definitely find out.

58
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,820
How dare the people of North Qi

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,980
cause trouble on my territory!

60
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,180
Your Highness,

61
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,300
it happened so suddenly.

62
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,500
There must be other clues
in Qinxi Valley.

63
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,700
Please allow us

64
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
to seal off Qinxi Valley

65
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,180
for investigation.

66
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,900
Then I leave it to you.

67
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,740
You must get

68
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,220
to the bottom of this.

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
Yes.

70
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,100
Mr. Gu,

71
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,920
how is your injury?

72
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,780
It's not serious.

73
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,980
Miss Song has bandaged me.

74
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,420
I'm tired.

75
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,740
Hanmei,

76
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,940
let them all leave.

77
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
The auction banquet

78
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,060
is over.

79
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,300
Goodbye, Your Highness.

80
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,220
Chu Yu,

81
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,340
follow me.

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,580
I'll wait for you outside the door.

83
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,620
Seeing me here,

84
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,980
you seem quite surprised.

85
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,940
I was just worried

86
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,100
that Ms. Chu would fall.

87
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,460
Then it seems

88
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,380
that you must try harder

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,220
to hide your secret and expressions.

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,740
Anything good happened to you?

91
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,580
You look so happy.

92
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,180
I've only heard that General Wei Jun

93
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,100
was valiant

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,860
and rare in the world.

95
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
But just now,

96
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,540
Young Marquis Wei's moves

97
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,500
were also good.

98
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,420
I don't think he'd be inferior

99
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,460
to General Wei Jun.

100
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,780
Young Marquis Wei

101
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,420
is indeed a fine young man.

102
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,180
The only drawback is

103
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,820
that he has to go to the battlefield.

104
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
Otherwise, he'd be a good choice.

105
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,780
Naturally.

106
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,200
Chu Jin,

107
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,340
when you choose a husband,

108
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,380
you must be careful.

109
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,220
A man like Young Master Sun

110
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,000
is definitely not someone to rely on.

111
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,140
The eyes of Ms. Chu Jin

112
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,260
look very bright to me.

113
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,300
Why does she need your reminder?

114
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
You're not even worthy

115
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,420
to marry into the Wei family.

116
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,660
Ms. Chu Jin,

117
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,060
with so many things happening

118
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,200
at the auction banquet today,

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,080
were you scared?

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,380
Thank you for your concern.

121
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,020
(Qinxi Valley)

122
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
You promised me something

123
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,980
at the banquet just now.

124
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,340
Is it still valid?

125
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,540
I don't know if you like

126
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,780
to play pitch-pot.

127
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,900
I learned it with my brother
when I was young,

128
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,700
but I haven't played for a long time,

129
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,760
and I'm quite rusty now.

130
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,660
I can teach you.

131
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm very good at this.

132
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,180
One day,

133
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,660
I can invite some friends,

134
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,040
and we can go to the suburbs

135
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,640
to play pitch-pot and enjoy the spring.

136
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,500
What do you think?

137
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,260
Thank you for your kind invitation.

138
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,060
If I have time,

139
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,380
I'd like to see

140
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,220
your skills.

141
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,980
In a few days,

142
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,420
I'll send an invitation to your home.

143
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,660
Then it's settled.

144
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,140
When I choose a good day,

145
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,460
I'll come to pick you up.

146
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,900
Sure.

147
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,380
Then I'll take my leave now.

148
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,060
Goodbye.

149
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,360
Your Highness, please forgive me.

150
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,340
I didn't tell you

151
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,420
my plan for today in advance

152
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,420
because I didn't have solid evidence.

153
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,180
When you came to me that day,

154
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,020
I knew you had something on your mind.

155
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,340
Though I didn't know what it was,

156
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,820
I was willing

157
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,940
to trust you.

158
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,460
Today, I helped you again.

159
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,620
Will you trust me

160
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
in the future?

161
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,860
If there is a next time,

162
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,040
there is no need
to go through so much trouble.

163
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,260
As the Eldest Princess of Great Sui,

164
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I may be domineering,

165
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,820
but I'm also magnanimous.

166
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,060
I won't lose the big picture
over small things.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,820
So, you can directly tell me

168
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,980
in the future.

169
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,540
(Qinxi Valley)

170
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,620
Your Lordship,

171
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,720
get into the carriage.

172
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,090
I'll wait here.

173
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,020
I'm worried

174
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,140
that you'll catch a cold

175
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,700
waiting here for Ms. Chu.

176
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,140
What if you got a headache or fever?

177
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,020
If you keep talking,

178
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,300
I'll have a headache right now.

179
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,700
Your Lordship,

180
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,940
have you truly thought it through

181
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,300
about your feelings for Ms. Chu?

182
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,980
I have.

183
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,460
Ms. Chu is here.

184
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,860
I can see her.

185
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,460
Does the wound still hurt?

186
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
It's fine.

187
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,880
You must've been tired.

188
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,160
I've come to take you home.

189
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,820
Thank you, Young Marquis Wei.

190
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,020
(Yao Mansion)

191
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,460
How useless.

192
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,940
We had a perfect trap.

193
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,740
How could he escape?

194
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,700
Young Marquis Wei

195
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,860
has never been here before,

196
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,080
nor does he know the layout.

197
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,300
Yet he escaped so quickly.

198
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,060
Does he have

199
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,780
some supernatural ability?

200
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,020
Nonsense.

201
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,580
Someone must've helped him.

202
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,210
Go.

203
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,100
Bring everyone

204
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,040
who was on duty today.

205
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,260
I want to ask them in detail.

206
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,860
Yes.

207
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,700
Hurry up.

208
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,300
Also,

209
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
about that assassin
in Qinxi Valley today,

210
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,020
I had him take the opportunity

211
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,960
to gather intelligence.

212
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,620
Instead, he directly attacked Chu Yu.

213
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,020
Has he gone mad?

214
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,300
But he's already dead.

215
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,500
Presumably, he didn't reveal

216
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,440
any other information.

217
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

218
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,220
Father.

219
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm back.

220
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,940
Where is Gu Chusheng?

221
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,140
Why didn't he come back with you?

222
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,460
He's gone to handle a case.

223
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,120
Do you need him for something?

224
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,620
I'll tell him when he returns.

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,900
You should rest early.

226
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,060
I heard he was injured today.

227
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,540
What exactly happened?

228
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,060
He was injured today

229
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,340
while saving me.

230
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,740
At this point,

231
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,980
you're still defending him?

232
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,820
Do you really think I don't know

233
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
what happened today?

234
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,180
Nowadays,

235
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,900
he still has an ambiguous relationship

236
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
with Ms. Chu.

237
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,820
What does he

238
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,060
take our family for?

239
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,980
Father,

240
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,500
Chu Yu is a strange woman

241
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,620
who will stop at nothing

242
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,300
to achieve her goals.

243
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
I can't compete with her,

244
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,180
nor can I outwit her.

245
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,180
How could Gu, who is so upright,

246
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,180
be a match for her?

247
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,220
I've seen

248
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,440
what kind of woman she is.

249
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,140
You're my daughter.

250
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,620
We won't be pushed around

251
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,980
by a woman.

252
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,860
Don't worry.

253
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,740
Since she bullied you

254
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,620
like this today,

255
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,860
I will definitely not

256
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,340
let her go.

257
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,800
Your Highness, you must've been tired.

258
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,930
I'll take my leave now.

259
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,060
Why the rush?

260
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,460
Grant Hanmei

261
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,220
a seat.

262
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,060
Since such a thing happened

263
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,380
in my place today,

264
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,180
I naturally need

265
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,700
to search thoroughly.

266
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,460
Indeed,

267
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,260
there are two culprits.

268
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,180
You secretly colluded

269
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,820
with the North Qi people.

270
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,240
You passed intelligence

271
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,780
to the North Qi people.

272
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Also...

273
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,540
Hanmei,

274
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
what do you think I should do with them?

275
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,620
I'm innocent.

276
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,900
I did meet the North Qi people

277
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,760
during my travels,

278
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,500
but I certainly didn't commit treason.

279
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,100
Of course, I know.

280
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

281
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

282
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,700
Kill them.

283
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,020
Kill them right here.

284
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,700
I'm innocent.

285
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm innocent!

286
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,980
What fun is there in just killing them?

287
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Watching the expressions

288
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,260
on the faces of the dying

289
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,740
is the most entertaining.

290
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,380
Hanmei,

291
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,660
do you understand?

292
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,660
The people of Great Sui and North Qi

293
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,360
have suffered from the chaos of war.

294
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,390
You gave me

295
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,580
a new name and a new life.

296
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,080
How could I have any ulterior motives?

297
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,060
Keep running.

298
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,580
Why do you stop now?

299
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,820
Take out your money pouch.

300
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,300
We won't make it hard for you.

301
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,740
Take it out.

302
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,900
Let's go.

303
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,470
Come with me.

304
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,100
From now on,

305
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,040
no one will dare to bully you like this.

306
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,000
If you don't believe me,

307
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,500
then kill me

308
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,000
to prove my innocence.

309
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,900
I don't want to accuse you of anything.

310
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,420
I just don't like being deceived.

311
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
Otherwise, your end

312
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,260
will be the same as these two.

313
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,660
Do you understand?

314
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,420
If I really want to win your favor,

315
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,980
wouldn't it be better to say

316
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,920
that I'm from Great Sui?

317
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,180
Although I'm from North Qi,

318
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,980
I've never deceived you.

319
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,700
Your Highness,

320
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,660
you have always known

321
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,540
my heart.

322
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,340
I have never known

323
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,180
your heart.

324
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,060
How could I know?

325
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,620
But Hanmei,

326
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,620
everyone in the world can betray me,

327
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
but you must not.

328
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,860
Do you understand?

329
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,980
I won't.

330
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,020
Never.

331
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,020
(Joy)

332
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,180
This is our wedding night.

333
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,100
Where are you going?

334
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
We are both tired today.

335
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,660
Let's rest early.

336
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,500
Gu,

337
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,380
I know

338
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,540
today's events have exhausted you.

339
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,620
But we are already married.

340
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,440
In the future,

341
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,540
we still have plenty of time

342
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,580
to get to know each other.

343
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,740
I have waited

344
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,500
for a devoted husband,

345
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,620
so I won't give up easily.

346
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,020
Gu,

347
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,300
since you

348
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,060
have chosen to be my husband,

349
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,500
can we forget

350
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,100
about the past?

351
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,700
If you could forget,

352
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,260
you wouldn't have been so determined
to marry me,

353
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,060
would you?

354
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,220
Give me some time.

355
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,940
Gu Chusheng.

356
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,220
Answer me.

357
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,100
Have you ever considered me

358
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,420
as your wife?

359
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,220
What have I done wrong

360
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,140
to let you treat me like this?

361
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,100
You still love Chu Yu, right?

362
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,380
Answer me.

363
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,260
Answer me!

364
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,220
Gu Chusheng, answer me!

365
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,340
Tell me. Do you still love her?

366
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,940
Do you still love her?

367
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,810
Answer me!

368
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,780
So what if I love her?

369
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,380
What do you take me for?

370
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
I can endure

371
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,700
the loneliness of not sharing a bed.

372
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
I can also help you

373
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
cover up in front of my father.

374
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,180
I've done so much for you,

375
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,020
and you just can't see it, can you?

376
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,020
Do you know how sinister

377
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,940
she is?

378
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,250
She is so ruthless,

379
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
and you still love her?

380
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,180
You have never let go of her.

381
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,500
So, why did you marry me?

382
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,340
Why do you have to torture me like this?

383
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,500
Don't you know

384
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,420
why I married you?

385
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,080
Take a look.

386
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,470
The Four Treasures of the Study.

387
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,540
Has Miss Song bandaged you?

388
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,940
Should we go to the clinic?

389
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,260
It's all bandaged up.

390
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,100
Let me show you.

391
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,940
I...

392
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,040
No matter what happens in the future,

393
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,460
don't hurt yourself.

394
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,520
It really doesn't hurt.

395
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,660
I'm afraid you're in pain.

396
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,540
Today...

397
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,920
What happened today

398
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,060
is indeed a bit strange.

399
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,820
I originally planned

400
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,940
to use the excuse of an assassin

401
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,020
to stall Yao Yong,

402
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,860
but unexpectedly,

403
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,260
there really was an assassin.

404
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,580
We put on a show,

405
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,300
and they took it seriously.

406
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,940
None of them is easy to deal with.

407
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,100
Yao Yong

408
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,460
is indeed very cunning.

409
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,540
Yes.

410
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,260
You came late today,

411
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,300
and I was worried

412
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,420
that you might be trapped.

413
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,540
I ran into Jue at Yao Mansion.

414
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,460
Jue?

415
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,780
It's me.

416
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
Chase!

417
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
Get inside.

418
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,840
Yun, why are you here?

419
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,300
Yao Yong might've committed treason.

420
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,780
I came to investigate this.

421
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,580
Jue,

422
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,680
I need a favor from you.

423
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,840
This is the map of Yao Yong's study.

424
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,980
The secret room marked here

425
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
may contain evidence

426
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,080
of Yao Yong's collusion with North Qi.

427
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,540
Feng's death

428
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,160
is also related to him.

429
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,540
Are you willing

430
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,580
to avenge Feng personally?

431
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,300
There is a window
behind the four-poster bed,

432
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,900
leading to the parapet of the backyard.

433
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,040
You can leave through there.

434
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,340
As for what you want,

435
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,340
I will do my best.

436
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,340
Hurry up and leave.

437
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,780
Yao Yong is not a good person.

438
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,020
If he finds out

439
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,900
that it was Jue who helped you escape,

440
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,460
he won't let her go.

441
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,320
We need to come up with a plan asap

442
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,160
to save Jue.

443
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,950
I was thinking the same thing.

444
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,220
Today, I discovered

445
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,470
that he was hiding weapons at home.

446
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,580
He's planning a rebellion?

447
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,220
These weapons will definitely be moved.

448
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,980
But this trip today

449
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,700
was not entirely in vain.

450
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,240
As a high-ranking official

451
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,540
in the court,

452
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,980
how can Yao Yong do

453
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,340
such outrageous things?

454
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,660
How greedy

455
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,580
can a person be

456
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,220
to never be satisfied?

457
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,120
Great Sui and North Qi
have been at war for years,

458
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,700
and the commoners are suffering.

459
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,020
As for us who are fighting in the war,

460
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,960
we only hope for peace in the world.

461
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,860
How can there be people like him

462
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,260
who don't care about others' lives?

463
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,620
Why should he be able to live well?

464
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,740
Why should he

465
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,940
keep getting promoted?

466
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,340
It's so unfair.

467
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,380
Your Lordship, My Lady,

468
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,420
we're home.

469
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,180
It's been quite a tiring day.

470
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,560
You should rest early.

471
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,940
What's wrong with Ms. Chu?

472
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,700
She looks so dispirited.

473
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,800
Did you confess to her?

474
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,900
Stop your nonsense.

475
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,620
(Virtue Shines Brightly)

476
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,300
Among thousands of flowers,

477
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,380
the one I want

478
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,860
is just this one.

479
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,940
I know I can't,

480
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,140
but if it's you,

481
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,020
I want to try once.

482
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,900
Linyang.

483
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,940
Jin has told me everything that happened

484
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,840
at the auction banquet.

485
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,220
If I had known,

486
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,560
I should have been there.

487
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,420
Linyang,

488
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,340
why are you blaming yourself?

489
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,950
Since you had a plan,

490
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,540
why didn't you tell me?

491
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,860
It's confidential.

492
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,540
To avoid alarming anyone,

493
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,800
I even

494
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,730
kept the Eldest Princess

495
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,700
in the dark.

496
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,420
Besides,

497
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,960
if I had gone back for no reason,

498
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,230
Yao Yong

499
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,680
would've become suspicious.

500
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,300
If you had told me even a little,

501
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,210
I would definitely have been there.

502
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,260
Perhaps,

503
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,160
you wouldn't have been hurt.

504
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,900
I kept it from you

505
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,240
to avoid implicating you

506
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,220
if the plan failed.

507
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,020
Yu,

508
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,220
I had no choice but to agree

509
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,020
to you marrying Wei Jun.

510
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,440
Now, I really don't want you

511
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,700
to risk your life

512
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,310
for the investigation.

513
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,380
Linyang,

514
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,620
it's about Father.

515
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,320
I can't think about anything else.

516
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,140
Nothing is more important to me

517
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,780
than finding out the truth

518
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,180
about Father's death.

519
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,660
I know you hate the taste
of the medicine,

520
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,160
so I brought this topical medicine.

521
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,220
(As your eldest brother,)

522
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,620
(I'm not strong enough,)

523
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
(so you have to risk your life.)

524
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,580
Don't you know

525
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,000
what kind of person your father is?

526
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,180
He gave me two choices:

527
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,460
One was the path to success,

528
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,340
which was to marry you;

529
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,780
the other

530
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,220
was the path to death.

531
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,860
If it were you, what would you choose?

532
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,300
I thought

533
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,980
about death,

534
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,260
but what about the grievances

535
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,300
of my parents

536
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,820
and the dozens of lives in my family?

537
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,580
I have to clear their names;

538
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,860
I have to overturn the case.

539
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,140
Clear their names?

540
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,860
Overturn the case?

541
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,780
I don't know anything

542
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,140
about what you're saying.

543
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,180
All I know is that I love you.

544
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,180
What do you see in me,

545
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,500
such an unworthy man?

546
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,480
Chu Yu waited for me for five years,

547
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,380
and I could just marry you.

548
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,280
I'm following every step

549
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,880
that your father instructed me to take.

550
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,180
What more do you want from me?

551
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
To be good to you?

552
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,000
To fall in love with you?

553
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,020
Gu,

554
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,220
I can learn

555
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,700
those poems and songs

556
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,140
that I don't like for you.

557
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,620
I can even learn from Chu Yu

558
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,840
to be an eccentric

559
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
and free-spirited woman for you.

560
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,220
Don't leave me, okay?

561
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,440
We can't go back to the beginning,

562
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,460
nor can we fulfill our own wishes.

563
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,300
We have to swallow the bitter fruit

564
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,540
that we ourselves have sown.

565
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,420
You are like this,

566
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,620
and so am I.

567
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,300
But I am your wife.

568
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,500
Rest early.

569
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,060
Wei Yun,

570
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,060
why are you here?

571
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,580
Just passing by.

572
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,300
The Spring Breeze House is nearby.

573
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,940
Why come here to drink?

574
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,080
What's so good
about the Spring Breeze House?

575
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
It's compartmentalized.

576
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,860
Even for a simple meal

577
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,700
or drink,

578
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,380
one has to put on airs
to seem dignified.

579
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,660
Look.

580
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,900
How nice it is here.

581
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,460
People coming and going,

582
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,940
with hearts close to hearts.

583
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,740
I like it

584
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,900
here.

585
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,820
Ever since we came back
from Qinxi Valley,

586
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,000
you've been in a bad mood.

587
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,240
Is it because of Yao Yong?

588
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,740
Guess

589
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,900
why I'm unhappy

590
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,340
because of Yao Yong.

591
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,300
Is it because of your father?

592
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,100
General Chu spent his whole life
in the military,

593
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,500
devoting everything to Great Sui

594
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,060
and its people,

595
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,740
yet in the end,

596
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,940
he died on the battlefield.

597
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,180
Yet a rat like Yao Yong,

598
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,040
who betrays Great Sui
and sells out his country,

599
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,660
can still live a good life.

600
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,140
You feel wronged,

601
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,020
don't you?

602
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,700
Why should my father

603
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,980
and those soldiers,

604
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,620
who fought so hard for Great Sui,

605
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,620
end up dead?

606
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,980
Why should a traitor

607
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,460
like Yao Yong

608
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,180
enjoy high positions

609
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,460
and rich rewards?

610
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,520
You and I will remember

611
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,380
their sacrifices,

612
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,380
and so will the people of Great Sui.

613
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,540
Our descendants will never forget.

614
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,380
Their sacrifices

615
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,140
will not be in vain.

616
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,080
We've been investigating all the way

617
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,460
from the Arsenal Bureau to Wei Tongfeng,

618
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,060
and now to Yao Yong.

619
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,980
How hard it's been.

620
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,580
We encountered dangers time and again.

621
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,540
Now, we've discovered

622
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,020
that he's suspicious,

623
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,260
but we can't just kill him

624
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,580
with our own hands.

625
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,460
What a pity.

626
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,500
Do you regret it?

627
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,900
Regret?

628
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,820
No.

629
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,840
I've never regretted it.

630
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,540
I will continue the investigation.

631
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,260
No matter how many of them there are,

632
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,860
or how powerful

633
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,420
the forces behind them are,

634
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,500
I will capture them with my own hands.

635
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,300
I will make them kneel before the graves

636
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,700
of our fathers and brothers

637
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,240
and those soldiers who died in battle,

638
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,900
and let them repent.

639
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,020
I will make them kneel forever.

640
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,700
I will do

641
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,340
what I say.

642
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,070
No matter how hard this matter is,

643
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,080
I am willing to do it with you.

644
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,660
Good.

645
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,140
- It's raining.
- It's pouring.

646
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,180
Hurry up.

647
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,620
Wei Yun, come and see.

648
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,660
It's raining.

649
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,580
Landlady.

650
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,960
Two more jugs of Rose Dew.

651
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,060
Coming.

652
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,620
More wine?

653
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,460
I'm not drinking by myself.

654
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,140
I'm drinking with my father.

655
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,020
Wait a moment, here.

656
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,220
This jug

657
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,340
is for my father

658
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,260
and those brave soldiers.

659
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,500
I'll also toast to my parents,

660
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,180
my brothers,

661
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,740
and the soldiers

662
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
who died in Baidi Valley.

663
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,220
Also,

664
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,420
to those who sacrificed
their lives for justice

665
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,380
and their families.

666
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,500
To what they did for the war...

667
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,860
No.

668
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,860
To everything they did

669
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,700
for peace.

670
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,140
Stop drinking.

671
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,200
Or you won't be able to go home.

672
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,140
Don't look down on me.

673
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,340
I can never get drunk.

674
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,460
You can never get drunk,

675
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,740
