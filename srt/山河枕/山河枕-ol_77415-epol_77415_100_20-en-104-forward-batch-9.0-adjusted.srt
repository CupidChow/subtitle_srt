(Thrive and Prosper)

23
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,630
Shilan,

24
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,830
we've been practicing like this

25
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,600
for four hours now.

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,510
Why won't Father let us in?

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,350
Do you think

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,120
he's not even inside?

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Wenchang, if you speak louder,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,230
Father can still hear you

31
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,480
even if he isn't at home.

32
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,680
Stand up.

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,360
You seem to have a strong voice.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,750
You truly look

35
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,150
like battle-hardened soldiers.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
You flatter us.

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,030
You're more vigorous than us.

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,280
I've heard that when you

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
went to suppress Yao's troops,

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,800
you fought three against one.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
How invincible.

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,150
As your son, I'm impressed.

43
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,520
I've also heard you're good.

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
However,

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,960
you just learned a few moves.

46
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,030
How could you be so overconfident

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,870
and fool around

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,470
with Wei Yun?

49
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,630
I was helping Yun

50
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,590
eliminate villains.

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,870
We were not fooling around.

52
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,560
Besides,

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,400
I captured

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,360
at least

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,680
15 rebels.

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,760
You used to accuse me of fooling around,

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,150
but I've achieved

58
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,120
great merit this time.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Yet you're still angry.

60
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,350
You're so hard to please.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,060
After standing in a horse stance
for four hours,

62
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,440
you still haven't realized why.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Forget it.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,960
No more horse stance.

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,030
Starting today,

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
practice calligraphy

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,470
for 15 pages every day.

68
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,840
Hand them to me.

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,190
I'll check them personally.

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,910
If you miss one,

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
you'll be punished with three more

72
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,150
until you understand.

73
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Father.

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,630
Wenchang and I acted impulsively,

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
risking our lives

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,400
by going to Dingfeng Valley.

77
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
Sorry for worrying you.

78
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,430
Father, rest assured.

79
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,430
Wenchang and I will deliver

80
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,990
our calligraphy work every day

81
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,880
to your desk on time.

82
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,030
Did I say you should also do that?

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,870
Listen.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,590
You must swing your sword
1,000 times a day,

85
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,870
shoot 300 arrows,

86
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,790
and stand in a horse stance
for two hours.

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,080
Can you do that?

88
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,400
I accept my punishment.

89
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,520
Father,

90
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,870
this is so unfair.

91
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,710
I was the one

92
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,570
who encouraged Shilan.

93
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,240
The punishment should be the same.

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
Shilan,

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,590
do you also think

96
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,750
I'm unfair?

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,520
No.

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,800
Wenchang will inherit

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,830
your title.

100
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
He mustn't take risks.

101
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,160
I failed to stop Wenchang.

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
It's my fault.

103
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,600
I was wrong.

104
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,150
Shilan,

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,260
I think you're most like me

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,000
when I was young.

107
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,830
You know how to be ambitious

108
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,870
and also how to protect yourself.

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,000
I once thought

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,750
that if you were Wenchang,

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
our family

112
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,680
might be in a different situation.

113
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
Father,

114
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,950
how can you say that?

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,390
Am I not good enough?

116
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,230
I understand.

117
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Wenchang may be playful,

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,240
but he has a pure heart.

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
You chose to step back

120
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,510
to avoid the whirlpool

121
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,800
of the court.

122
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,830
Wenchang is more suited

123
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,560
to the future duke than I am.

124
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,270
So,

125
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,560
you didn't join the army

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,430
but took the imperial exams and went

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,070
to the Court of Judicial Review.

128
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Shilan,

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,430
my intentions

130
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,310
are clear to you,

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,670
but I also know

132
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,980
you have military talent.

133
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,190
Not being in the army

134
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
is a waste of your abilities.

135
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,430
As part of the family,

136
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
I understand

137
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,560
that our family's honor

138
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,000
and losses are shared.

139
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,430
Let me think about it.

140
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,280
I'll try to figure it out.

141
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
Father,

142
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,800
please also reconsider

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,830
my calligraphy work

144
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,010
and Shilan's exercise.

145
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,560
I just want to teach you a lesson.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,020
Don't think

147
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,270
about getting away from this.

148
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,110
Go now.

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
- Father.
- Go.

150
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
Go!

151
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,430
I can protect you for a while,

152
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
but not forever.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,920
Lan said

154
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,000
that when Yao Yong rebelled,

155
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,240
the city was in chaos.

156
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,560
They rushed out
and forgot to lock the door.

157
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,390
When they came back,

158
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,480
Xiaoqi was gone.

159
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,750
These past few days,

160
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,800
Chun's been searching the city.

161
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
But...

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Maybe someone like me,

163
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,560
always on the go,

164
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,050
isn't suited to take care of Xiaoqi.

165
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
He's so adorable.

166
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,760
Maybe

167
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,720
he's found a new home.

168
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
I should go home, too.

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Isn't this your home?

170
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,620
We can't force a firefly

171
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,160
to stop only

172
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,270
for ourselves.

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
When we were in the small village,

174
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,510
we shared a beautiful dream.

175
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,830
Now that we're back in Huajing,

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
it's time to wake up.

177
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,830
Yao Yong has been captured,

178
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,120
but the turmoil in Huajing City

179
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
has not yet ceased.

180
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,360
So, we still have

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,310
more important things to do next.

182
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,360
So, you have

183
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,720
even less reason to leave.

184
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,560
I can forgo the answer to that question

185
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,830
and even accept your refusal,

186
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
as long as you don't

187
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
avoid me.

188
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,470
No matter what,

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
we are still family.

190
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,120
How could I avoid you?

191
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,630
My family's door

192
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,870
is always open for you.

193
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,990
My Lady,

194
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,270
I've packed everything

195
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,750
and checked it three times.

196
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,900
Nothing is left behind.

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,920
Yun,

198
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,390
aren't you going to say goodbye?

199
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,140
There's no need for goodbye.

200
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,660
♪Snow falls silently, soft and light♪

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240

♪Tinting strands of hair in white♪

203
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,710
Look.

204
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,270
The Marquis of Zhenguo

205
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,480
is weaving a garland for you.

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,630
It's a custom here.

207
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,510
It seems

208
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
he truly likes you.

209
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,710
As the Marquis of Zhenguo,

210
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,030
he doesn't even frown

211
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,870
on the battlefield,

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,720
yet when weaving a garland...

Welcome, please come in.

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,340
Hurry up.

225
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,460
Watch this.

226
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,550
My Lady,

227
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,200
you're still pregnant.

228
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,390
You shouldn't come

229
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,080
to this bustling market again.

230
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,870
Chun has sent you to protect me,

231
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,840
hasn't she?

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,270
Someone is

233
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,440
always watching me

234
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
at home.

235
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,150
If this continues,

236
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,510
I'll suffocate.

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,060
Fresh steamed buns!

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,360
There seems to be a man.

239
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
He's still alive.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,860
Don't...

241
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,920
- It's okay.
- Don't go.

242
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
(Oh, no.)

243
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,630
(How could Ms. Wang be here?)

244
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,650
Fresh flowers!

245
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,600
The straight cut

246
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
on this man's leg

247
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,570
is almost to the bone,

248
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,200
so whoever did this

249
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,480
used a great deal of force.

250
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,310
Will such a severe injury

251
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,460
leave him disabled?

252
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,990
It won't.

253
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,660
He's fortunate.

254
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,000
Though the blow was heavy,

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,500
it didn't damage his tendons or bones.

256
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,320
He'll recover in a few days.

257
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,600
That's good to hear.

258
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,840
Thank you.

259
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,750
Goodbye.

260
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,800
Goodbye.

261
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,630
My Lady,

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
we could leave it to officers.

263
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,550
Why trouble ourselves?

264
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,150
Since I've seen it,

265
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
I can't just ignore it.

266
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Leaving him here

267
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,360
can also accumulate blessings

268
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,750
for the child in my womb.

269
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,510
You always go all the way
in doing good deeds.

270
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm afraid

271
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,910
that you'll promise

272
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,670
to take care of this man

273
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,360
for the rest of his life.

274
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,150
Though I'm willing to do good,

275
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,240
I can tell what's important.

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,510
Lisheng,

277
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,390
help him up.

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,040
I'll fetch the physician.

279
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,990
Yes.

280
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,120
I think I've seen him before.

281
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,200
Ma'am, here's your dish.

282
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,630
- Thank you.
- Let me check.

283
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,480
Wei Qiu.

284
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,960
My Lady.

285
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,200
What are you doing here?

286
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,720
His Lordship said

287
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,150
that this inn has an excellent pastry

288
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,610
and asked me to buy some.

289
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Did you just see

290
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,030
a physician walk out?

291
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,080
Bring him back for me.

292
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,200
My Lady,

293
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,140
why are you here alone?

294
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,610
Why do you need a physician?

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
Are you feeling unwell?

296
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
Do you need me to escort you back?

297
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Your barrage of questions

298
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,360
has left me unsure

299
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,420
which one to answer first.

300
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,600
Rest assured. I'm fine.

301
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
But a friend of mine is injured

302
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,630
and needs a physician.

303
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
That's good to hear.

304
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Huajing has just been in chaos,

305
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,720
and the city is not safe now.

306
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Since you're in a delicate condition,

307
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,420
it's better to stay indoors

308
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,870
unless it's necessary.

309
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
Since you're awake,

310
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,080
stop pretending to be asleep.

311
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,590
It's not shameful for others to see you

312
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,690
in a vulnerable state.

313
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,000
I've paid the physician's fee twice

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,870
to save you.

315
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,190
If I still fail,

316
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,160
that'd truly be embarrassing.

317
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,710
You must be thirsty.

318
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,800
Have some water.

319
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,200
Why did you save me?

320
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,200
As the Marquis

321
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,930
of Zhenguo's family,

322
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,390
I can't watch others die.

323
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,870
Could you pour me another cup?

324
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,350
Here.

325
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,720
Would you like to tell me

326
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,510
why you were so severely injured?

327
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,880
I came from Qingzhou.

328
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,630
Lately,

329
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,830
North Qi has been raiding Qingzhou.

330
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,680
My family also perished in the war.

331
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,440
On my way to Huajing,

332
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,640
I encountered bandits.

333
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,070
They took all my possessions

334
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,030
and slashed my leg.

335
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,160
Have bandits become so rampant

336
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,070
as to commit violence

337
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,680
right under the Emperor's nose?

338
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
Do you have any relatives

339
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,270
or friends in Huajing?

340
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,720
Times are tough.

341
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,840
It seems

342
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,310
you're a pitiable man.

343
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,160
I've paid

344
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,350
for five days in this room.

345
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,270
Since you have no belongings

346
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,310
and no friends or family,

347
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,750
just stay here and recover.

348
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,240
It's getting late.

349
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,240
I must leave now.

350
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,520
Wait.

351
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,310
Will you come back?

352
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,750
I just don't want to owe you a favor.

353
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,240
I'll repay you

354
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,160
for the room

355
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,030
and the medicine.

356
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
Of course, I'll come back.

357
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,790
Your dressing needs to be changed.

358
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,220
As for repaying the money,

359
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,310
we can talk about it

360
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,640
once you're mostly recovered.

361
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,030
You won't just leave

362
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,070
without a word, will you?

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
My Lady,

364
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,440
I've sent the physician back.

365
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,550
It's getting late.

366
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,070
Let's head back now.

367
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,780
(Laws Aid Morals)

368
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,510
Make way, please.

369
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,590
Isn't that General Yao?

370
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,550
Oh, it's him.

371
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,950
He must've done something serious.

372
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,670
Indeed.

373
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,060
(To be executed, Yao Yong)

374
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,310
Isn't that Young Marquis Wei?

375
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,150
Yes, it is.

376
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,920
Why is he here?

377
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Indeed.

378
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,830
I heard you spoke well of me

379
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,960
to the Crown Prince,

380
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,720
which earned me this opportunity.

381
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,680
Is that to repay my favor?

382
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,110
Yes,

383
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,960
but not entirely.

384
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,680
Apart from repaying you

385
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,000
for saving my life,

386
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,110
I also did that

387
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,630
for Chu Yu

388
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,240
and my family.

389
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,640
I never expected that before my end,

390
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,680
you'd personally

391
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,920
see me off.

392
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,400
I've lived a life

393
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,400
worth living.

394
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,630
You stole the blueprints
of the octagonal crossbow for North Qi,

395
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,100
killed 30,000 Chu troops,

396
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,790
colluded with North Qi
to fabricate military intelligence,

397
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,200
and conspired to kill 70,000 Wei troops.

398
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,550
The fact that you're still alive

399
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,610
is already a gift from the heavens.

400
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
Indeed.

401
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,070
I did it.

402
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,750
Trading my life

403
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,790
for seven men in your family

404
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,750
and 100,000 Wei and Chu troops

405
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,790
of Great Sui

406
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,110
is more than enough

407
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,790
for me.

408
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,510
No need to provoke me with your words.

409
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,980
Yao Yong,

410
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,400
you believe that the Lord of Qin

411
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
died wrongfully,

412
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,000
so you've harbored such hatred

413
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,310
against Great Sui and His Majesty

414
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,440
that you even allied

415
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,310
with North Qi

416
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,790
to hand Great Sui over to them.

417
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,960
I used to be

418
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,790
the Lord of Qin's attendant,

419
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,510
so I've always lived in suspicion

420
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,320
and never been trusted.

421
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,510
A wise bird chooses its perch.

422
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,440
Under Emperor Chunde's rule,

423
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,680
Great Sui would fall

424
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,400
into someone else's hands

425
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,400
sooner or later,

426
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,240
even if not North Qi.

427
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,540
What are you laughing at?

428
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,790
I'm laughing at how
you're still in the dark

429
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,440
even at the brink of death.

430
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,400
Was the Lord of Qin truly innocent?

431
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,400
If he hadn't been so gullible,

432
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,920
how could our military secrets

433
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,030
have reached North Qi,

434
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,440
leading to the loss of three cities?

435
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,960
Your so-called righteous ruler

436
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,790
was outmaneuvered by North Qi

437
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,440
and became a prisoner.

438
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,720
It's not a wrongful death at all.

439
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,270
And yet, you

440
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,160
still worked for North Qi.

441
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
That's impossible.

442
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,200
It was Emperor Chunde's jealousy

443
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,260
of the Lord of Qin's talent

444
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,880
that led to his wrongful death.

445
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,830
So, you didn't know

446
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,750
that the weapon of your revenge

447
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,130
was pointed in the wrong direction.

448
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,590
You've been working

449
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,720
for your true enemies,

450
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,130
and no one was willing
to tell you the truth?

451
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,680
Now,

452
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,920
I can't tell

453
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,810
whether you're more pitiable

454
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,830
or more detestable.

455
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,680
Wei Yun...

456
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,750
Today, I've chosen to tell you this

457
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,680
because I want to let you know

458
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,930
that no matter what reason you have,

459
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,720
it's not a justification

460
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,850
for betraying your country.

461
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Throughout history,

462
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,550
traitors have had only one end.

463
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,480
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

464
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,720
Kill him!

465
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,790
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

466
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,270
This traitor deserves no pity.

467
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,720
He's caused so many deaths.

468
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,440
Kill him!

469
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,280
Young Marquis,

470
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,680
stop wasting your breath.

471
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,750
I'm a man already marked for death.

472
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,680
If I repent now,

473
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,510
wouldn't my whole life

474
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,920
become a joke?

475
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,140
I'm not just saying this

476
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,000
to you

477
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,310
but also to others

478
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,200
who harbor ill intentions.

479
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
In Great Sui,

480
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,270
we have not only rats like you,

481
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,700
but also families like the Wei family

482
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,680
and the Chu family,

483
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,440
who wholeheartedly protect our country.

484
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,680
Only with Great Sui's existence

485
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,340
do the commoners have the right

486
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,710
to live in peace and contentment.

487
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,160
Only then do officials and generals

488
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,160
have the chance
to be remembered in history.

489
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,080
Great Sui

490
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,920
will always be the people's nation.

491
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,440
- Well said!
- Well said!

492
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,310
Young Marquis Wei is right.

493
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,240
Only with Great Sui

494
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,480
can the people live in peace.

495
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,590
He deserves to die.

496
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,830
Well said!

497
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,240
Kill him! Kill him!

498
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,310
Well said!

499
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,000
Kill him! Kill him!

500
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,240
A general

501
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,510
who has brought harm to the nation

502
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,750
deserves to die!

503
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,680
He deserves to die!

504
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
He deserves to die!

505
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,830
Instead of being a good official,

506
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,750
you chose to sneak around.

507
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,000
Fine.

508
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,550
Since you liked stealing my blueprints,

509
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,270
I'll burn

510
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,720
more paper money for him today.

511
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,510
Well said! Well said!

512
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,350
Kill him! Kill him!

513
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,050
If it were me,

514
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,680
I wouldn't even burn paper money
for him.

515
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,000
I'd dig up his ancestors' graves.

516
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,840
Scoundrel!

517
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,030
Kill him! Kill him!

518
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,200
Yao Yong colluded with North Qi,

519
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,790
betrayed his country,

520
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,160
stole Great Sui's military secrets,

521
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,440
killed 100,000 of Great Sui's troops,

522
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,990
ordered the assassination
of the Eldest Princess,

523
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,510
and attempted to murder court officials.

524
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,510
His crimes

525
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,070
are heinous.

526
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,590
By the Emperor's decree,

527
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,510
Yao Yong is stripped of his generalship

528
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,680
and sentenced to beheading.

529
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,240
His entire family is exiled.

530
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,030
Marquis Wei Yun will execute him.

531
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,120
He deserves to die.

532
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,960
Indeed.

533
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,260
(To be executed)

534
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,630
Execute!

535
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,030
- Good!
- Good!

536
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,750
- Great!
- Great!

537
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,000
He deserved to die.

538
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,510
- Great!
- Great!

539
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,080
(Father,)

540
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,350
(Mother,)

541
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,200
(my brothers,)

542
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440

(avenged you all.)

544
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,510
The winter in Huajing City has passed.

545
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:37,870
Father,

546
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,920
you can rest in peace now.

547

548
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,850
though Yao Yong is dead,

549
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,350
there are surely more

550

North Qi collaborators.

551
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,840
One day,

552
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,310
we will eliminate them all.

Why did you come out alone today?

572
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,270
A few days ago, I saved someone

573
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,920
who was severely injured.

574
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,510
I couldn't bear to leave him,

575
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,400
so I arranged for him
to stay at the inn.

576
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,170
I'll leave you to your work

577
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,920
and head back now.

578
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,910
Don't worry.

579
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,960
I've sent someone

580
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,200
to secretly protect Ms. Wang.

581
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Don't tell her yet.

582
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,400
She's close to giving birth.

583
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,830
If anything happens,

584
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,670
it wouldn't be good.

585
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,550
This man is injured

586
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,000
and won't be going out

587
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,240
to find his contact

588
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,200
anytime soon.

589
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,750
Keep a close watch.

590
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,390
If necessary,

591
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
we'll have

592
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,590
to flush him out.

593
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,830
Celebrating the festival for Tudigong!

594
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,200
Run slowly.

595
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
- Celebrating!
- Celebrating!

596
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,270
(It's been a while.)

597
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,720
She should be coming back.

598
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,760
Celebrating!

599
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,140
(Chu Mansion)

600
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,670
Yu, look.

601
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,510
The recoil force is smaller now,

602
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
but I still haven't been able to test

603
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,590
the more accurate values.

604
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,270
As expected of you.

605
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,400
You're amazing.

606
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,440
However,

607
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,550
though adjusting the arrows

608
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,480
can alleviate the issue of recoil,

609
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,240
it cannot completely solve it.

610
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,590
If we want to promote
the octagonal crossbow,

611
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,830
it seems

612
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,680
we need to find more suitable materials

613
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,830
for the mechanism.

614
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,920
Did Wei Yun

615
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,520
tell you this?

616
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,350
Yu,

617
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,200
be honest with me.

618
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,900
What's really going on

619
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,960
between you and Wei Yun?

620
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,440
Last time in the small village,

621
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,400
when I pretended to be the officiant,

622
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,360
I could tell that what's between you

623
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,640
is far

624
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,100
from just a cooperation.

625
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,430
Yu,

626
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,960
I didn't stop you

627
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,270
when you followed Gu Chusheng

628
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,920
to the southwest,

629
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,350
nor did I stop you

630
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,310
when you married Wei Jun alone,

631
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,030
dressed in wedding clothes,

632
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,260
to investigate the octagonal crossbow.

633
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,680
I didn't interfere once or twice

634
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,440
because I know

635
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,590
that's just your nature.

636
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,110
But Yu,

637
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,790
this is the third time,

638
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,920
and I have to remind you now.

639
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,940
Be honest with yourself.

640
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,040
Ask yourself:

641
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,970
What do you truly feel

642
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
for Wei Yun?

643
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,960
Sometimes, being together every day

644
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,510
makes it hard to see clearly.

645
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,040
A few days apart

646
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,640
might help you figure it out.

647
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,960
Don't worry, Linyang.

648
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,750
I've already refused him.

649
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,550
But you're right.

650
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,590
I do need some more time

651
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,640
to think it through.

652
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,030
After all, I'm not a child anymore.

653
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,550
Duke of Hu,

654
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,310
do you know how sincere
the Crown Prince is?

655
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,920
He chose

656
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,550
these betrothal gifts

657
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,550
one by one

658
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,240
by himself.

659
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,030
Today, he even delivered them himself.

660
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,720
It shows how sincere he is

661
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,670
toward Miss Song.

662
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,590
Look at this birdcage.

663
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,150
The Crown Prince

664
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,670
designed it personally

665
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,110
for Miss Song.

666
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,150
There's no other like it

667
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,510
in all of Great Sui.

668
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,550
Why bring this up?

669
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,670
Qingping will be my wife.

670
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,070
She naturally deserves

671
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,280
the finest things.

672
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,720
Duke of Hu,

673
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,030
where is Qingping today?

674
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,240
Your Highness,

675
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,440
this birdcage

676
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,880
is indeed unique.

677
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,400
It's a good thing it's one of a kind.

678
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
If you had prepared

679
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,320
another one for someone else,

680
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,880
then Qingping

681
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,360
shouldn't accept

682
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,960
this gift.

683
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,900
The matter of the mistress
is already in the past.

684
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
As you can see,

685
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,400
when Father was ill,

686
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,510
I was worried every day.

687
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,710
I helped relieve Father's worries

688
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,010
by promoting capable officials

689
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,670
and even apologized to Wei Yun.

690
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,800
Once Father recovered,

691
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,030
I immediately

692
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,000
brought

693
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,060
these betrothal gifts here.

694
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,840
You've been

695
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,320
doing well lately.

696
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,280
Let me look at the list of gifts.

697
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,110
Indeed, no one can be as generous

698
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,360
as the Crown Prince.

699
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,840
Coral.

700
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,510
A goldfinch.

701
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,840
These are all rare treasures

702
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,190
in Huajing.

703
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,880
Don't you agree, Shilan?

704
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,720
Put it back.

705
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,990
However,

706
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,480
our mansion is too small

707
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,920
to accommodate

708
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,960
such noble gifts.

709
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,350
Your Highness,

710
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,670
why not wait

711
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,880
until we've made some room

712
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,000
before sending

713
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,880
the betrothal gifts?

714
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,910
Wenchang,

715
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,730
why are you here, spoiling the fun

716
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,440
instead of studying in your room?

717
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,070
Song Wenchang,

718
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,190
what do you mean?

719
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,840
My betrothal to Qingping

720
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,760
was decided long ago.

721
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,730
Are you defying the imperial decree?

722
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,840
Moreover,

723
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,840
this is between Qingping and me.

724
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,500
If there are any objections,

725
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,000
Qingping should come

726
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,960
and speak to me herself.

727
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,920
Since you think

728
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,020
your mansion is too small,

729
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,650
you can move these things

730
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,070
to the courtyard.

731
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,720
Duke of Hu,

732
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,070
goodbye.

733
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,510
Power can be oppressive!

734
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,710
Wenchang.

735
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,550
Song Shilan,

736
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,250
why didn't you say anything just now?

737
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,120
Are you mute?

738
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,200
Don't you know who Tuantuan likes?

739
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:16,860
Besides,

740
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,310
I can't stand Tuantuan being wronged

741
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,350
even before her marriage.

742
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,200
Which eye do you think
I'd let go of Tuantuan?

743
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,700
Only the one who tied the bell
can untie it.

744
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,590
Only if Tuantuan speaks up

745
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,870
can this be resolved.

746
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,320
Shilan is right.

747
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,000
You two

748
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,440
should talk to Qingping again.

749
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,440
If she still refuses,

750
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,840
I'll risk my life

751
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,200
to break off the betrothal

752
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,030
between the Crown Prince and her.

753
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,650
Has the Crown Prince left?

754
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,030
He left behind a pile

755
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,310
of exquisite betrothal gifts.

756
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,030
Especially the birdcage,

757
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,360
the goldfinch inside

758
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,660
is the most precious of all.

759
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,880
Wenchang,

760
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,630
what's so great

761
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,670
about a bird in a cage?

762
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,190
If you like it so much,

763
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,460
you marry him on my behalf.

764
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,280
Look at you, so full of resentment.

765
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,360
If you don't want to marry, just say it.

766
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,720
Tuantuan,

767
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,360
do you remember?

768
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,590
When we were little,

769
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,840
Father kept a parrot.

770
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,350
It would use

771
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
its foot to kick open

772
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,920
its cage door.

773
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,960
You always said

774
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,070
that if only you could be

775
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,670
like Ms. Chu

776
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,110
and take control of your life.

777
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,920
Chu Yu is like a bird

778
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,100
that can't be kept in a cage,

779
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,440
but I'm not.

780
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,160
Why not?

781
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,000
Can I?

782
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,190
Even I

783
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,230
can win over Jin.

784
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,440
If I can,

785
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,400
why can't you?

786
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,640
Wenchang,

787
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,920
that's because you happened

788
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,400
to catch the eye of Ms. Chu Jin.

789
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
That doesn't comfort me at all.

790
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,150
- I...
- Tuantuan,

791
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,030
if you think that way,

792
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,360
you're making a big mistake.

793
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,870
Tuantuan,

794
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,880
listen to me.

795
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Life is short.

796
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,440
If you can't spend it

797
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,380
with the one you love,

798
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,670
doing what you love,

799
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,630
isn't that a waste?

800
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,440
Just follow your heart.

801
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,910
If anything happens,

802
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,070
we and the old man

803
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,920
will cover for you.

804
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,390
Li Huan.

805
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,990
Qingping.

806
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,350
Qingping.

807
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,430
Take it back.

808
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,380
Don't you like it?

809
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,200
Didn't you say

810
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,190
you loved birds?

811
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,790
I do like birds,

812
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,520
but it's not because they sit

813
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,870
in a cage for me to admire,

814
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,880
but because they can

815
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,780
fly freely

816
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,880
in the sky.

817
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,720
Your Highness,

818
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,070
if you truly care for me,

819
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,290
please ask His Majesty

820
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,260
to revoke the betrothal.

821
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,580
You don't want to marry me

822
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,000
because I kept a mistress, right?

823
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,470
If that's the case,

824
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,030
I can assure you

825
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,630
it will never

826
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,670
happen again.

827
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,590
If an emperor favors only one woman

828
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,400
and takes no other consorts,

829
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,820
that would be

830
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,150
truly shocking.

831
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,710
That's not the reason

832
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,080
why I don't want to marry you.

833
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,480
Then why?

834
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,030
Is it because

835
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,960
of Chu Linyang?

836
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,830
I've heard

837
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,080
you two have been close lately.

838
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,030
It's because of him,

839
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,880
but not entirely.

840
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,550
Your Highness,

841
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,800
I don't care about power

842
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,630
or the dream

843
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,800
of ruling the world.

844
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,110
I just want to know

845
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,960
how many herbs I haven't collected

846
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,230
left in the mountains,

847
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,840
why smallpox can't be completely cured,

848
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,440
and what other uses
there are for Mafeisan

849
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,230
besides removing bone-deep poison.

850
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,030
I don't want to be stopped

851
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,030
by those high walls.

852
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,000
If I can't give you that,

853
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,920
can Chu Linyang

854
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,840
do it?

855
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,840
I do like Chu Linyang,

856
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,820
but if one day

857
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,140
he becomes

858
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,360
the wall in my way,

859
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,310
I won't stop

860
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,160
for him, either.

861
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,670
Even a little bird

862
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,590
will struggle to get out

863
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,880
if there's the slightest opening.

864
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,360
And I will never give up

865
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
if there is

866
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,710
the slightest chance.

867
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,060
If you want me to be
a phoenix in a cage,

868
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,510
I'd rather be a sparrow

869
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,670
that roams freely.

870
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,070
Please grant me this, Your Highness.

871
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,460
Let's go to the Chu Mansion.

872
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:35,990
Son,

873
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,630
tell me the truth.

874
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,000
Did you offend the Crown Prince?

875
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:43,030
Why do you ask, Mother?

876
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,110
He looked quite upset

877
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,110
when he came,

878
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,510
as if he was here to reprimand us.

879
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,510
Don't worry, Mother.

880
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,500
I think I know

881
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,590
why the Crown Prince came.

882
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,790
Don't worry.

883
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,290
Everything will be fine.

884
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,760
Mother.

885
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,400
Jin,

886
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,240
you're back.

887
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,350
Did you

888
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,840
find out anything?

889
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,070
I heard that today,

890
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,480
the Crown Prince left the Palace

891
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,820
to deliver betrothal gifts
to the Duke of Hu,

892
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,400
but he had an unpleasant encounter

893
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,550
with Miss Song.

894
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,880
Miss Song?

895
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Miss Song

896
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,360
keeps seeking out your brother.

897
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,180
It's obvious to anyone with eyes

898
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,540
that she has feelings for him.

899
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:34,820
Oh, no.

900
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,510
She must've upset

901
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,670
the Crown Prince.

902
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,510
Is he here to vent his anger?

903
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,000
We can't afford to offend

904
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,440
either the Crown Prince

905
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,800
or the Duke of Hu.

906
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,120
Mother,

907
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,200
don't worry.

908
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,150
Since Linyang dared

909
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,210
to meet the Crown Prince,

910
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,320
he must be

911
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,190
very confident.

912
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,800
Everything will surely be fine.

913
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,880
I hope so.
