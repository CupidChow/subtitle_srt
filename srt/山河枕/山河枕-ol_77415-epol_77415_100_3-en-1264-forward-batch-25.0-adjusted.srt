Father!

Chun,

25
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,310
you usually help Mother

26
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,150
with the household

27
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,910
and take care of our Chun'er.

28
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,120
It's truly hard on you.

29
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,680
Don't say that.

30
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,630
I just hope

31
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,800
you can stay a little longer this time.

32
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,430
Chun,

33
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm not leaving this time.

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
I'll stay

35
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,240
with you forever.

36
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,710
Zhong,

37
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,470
why are you leaving

38
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,680
earlier than planned?

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
The Wei family protects the nation.

40
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,360
When there's war we must go.

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
Don't worry,

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
I'll return

43
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
victorious.

44
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,030
I'll await your safe return.

45
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,630
No problem.

46
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,310
Shu bought Chun jewelry.

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,870
Buy me one too,

48
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,710
okay?

49
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,680
Hearing you makes

50
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,270
my hand ache again.

51
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,270
Shut up!

52
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,800
I'll beat you up!

53
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Don't be mad.

54
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,070
Don't be mad.

55
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,360
When I return from the campaign

56
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll buy you one

57
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
even better than Chun's.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,750
I can't believe a blockhead like you

59
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,920
actually got a wife.

60
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,080
Take a bite, come on.

61
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
You...

62
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,590
You blockhead!

63
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,350
Delicious.

64
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
You're still smiling!

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,510
You're annoying.

66
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,680
If one day

67
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,750
I don't return from the campaign,

68
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
find your own life.

69
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Remarry

70
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
or leave.

71
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,920
Don't waste your youth

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,270
stuck in the Wei household

73
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,600
for my sake.

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Rong!

75
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,710
Rong!

76
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,430
I can see you,

77
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,480
don't hide.

78
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Rong!

79
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Rong!

80
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,720
Soon you'll be a father

81
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
and still so childish.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,840
Rong!

83
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,510
Lan.

84
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,480
Lan.

85
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,390
Lan.

86
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,560
I thought I'd never find you again.

87
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,720
Lan,

88
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,350
I'm...

89
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,270
I'm afraid you'll never find me again.

90

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Wei Ya!

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,800
Wei Rong!

97
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,990
Wei Yun!

98
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,630
(Undying Loyalty)
Ancestors of the Wei family above,

99
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,000
your descendants

100
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,320
swear here:

101
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,480
After decades of sharpening our swords,

102
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,510
we will again slay North Qi's fiends,

103
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,000
bring welfare to Great Sui's people,

104
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,480
and protect our land

105
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,870
until peace returns.

106
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,360
We pray our ancestors

107
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,390
bless us with a victorious return.

What's that smell?

111
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,390
It's the granary!

112
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,790
Water!

113
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,630
Put out the fire!

114
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,360
- Get water!
- There's fire!

115
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,840
- This way!
- Someone help!

116
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,680
Quick!

117
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,550
Find more water!

118
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,390
Put out the fire!

119
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,200
Put it out!

120
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,680
- Put the fire out!
- Bring water!

121
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,350
- Hurry!
- Help!

122
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,680
Over here!

123
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
Be quick!

124
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,230
Bring more people!

125
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,630
Come on! Hurry!

126
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,000
Make it quick!

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
That way!

128
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,470
Hurry!

129
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,670
Get more water!

130
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,030
- Here, here!
- This way!

131
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,120
Carry what's not burning away!

132
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Quick!

133
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,620
Give me a hand here!

134
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,790
North Qi retreating to Baidi Valley

135
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,290
should have kept them occupied.

136
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,960
Why send men to burn our granary?

137
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
Report!

138
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,990
Young General,

139
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,960
all our generals

140
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,360
are trapped in Baidi Valley.

141
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,870
Please send urgent rescue.

142
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,600
Weren't we supposed to have the advantage?

143
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,960
The intelligence was wrong.

144
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
North Qi's forces

145
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,510
are over four times

146
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,350
our estimate.

147
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,510
Our army is hard-pressed

148
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,870
and cannot break out.

149
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,000
Leave some to continue fighting the fire,

150
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,350
the rest,

151
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
follow me to reinforce Baidi Valley.

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,320
- Yes!
- Young General!

153
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
(Octagonal crossbow?)

154
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,260
Charge!

155
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,870
(Wei)
Charge!

156
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,280
Jun!

157
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,510
Protect the general!

158
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,150
Brothers, come on!

159
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,630
Jun.

160
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,200
I told you to guard the camp,

161
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,030
why didn't you listen?

162
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
I...

163
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
Jun.

164
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,580
(Wei)

165
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,180

166
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:39,420
(Wei)

167
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,590
And,

168
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,750
there's a mole in the Arsenal Bureau.

169
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,150
They gave the octagonal crossbow plans

170
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,320
to North Qi.

171
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,350
Find...

172
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,750
Find him.

173
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,310
Find him.

174
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,000
Yun,

175
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm sorry.

176
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,440
From now on

177
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,680
we will leave you

178
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,350
to face what comes alone.

179
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,200
No, Jun!

180
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,790
I'm sorry.

181
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
No!

182
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,630
No!

183
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
Jun!

184
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,350
Sir!

185
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
The Marquis of Zhenguo has fallen!

186
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,440
General Wei Shu has fallen!

187
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,350
Captain Wei Qin has fallen!

188
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,400
Captain Wei Feng has fallen!

189
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,510
Deputy Captain Wei Ya has fallen!

190
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,680
Deputy Captain Wei Rong has fallen!

191
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,790
Retreat.

192
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,480
Fall back to Tianshou Pass

193
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,960
to prevent North Qi from

194
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,750
attacking Huajing again.

195
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,310
Yes!

196
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,860
(Great Sui Imperial Palace)

197
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,110
Father,

198
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
this was not my fault.

199
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,270
It... It was Wei Zhong.

200
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,110
He was greedy for glory

201
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,080
and reckless in pursuit.

202
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,510
He ignored my advice

203
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,830
and chased the fleeing enemy,

204
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,200
falling right into North Qi's ambush.

205
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
(Emperor Chunde of Great Sui)
He caused Great Sui

206
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,050
to lose seventy thousand elite soldiers!

207
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Advice?

208
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,880
How did you advice him?

209
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,510
When Wei Zhong proposed the pursuit,

210
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,310
I told him again and again:

211
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Never block a retreating army.

212
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,520
Don't chase a cornered foe.

213
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,590
But he...

214
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,040
But he

215
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,680
dismissed me

216
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,070
as too young

217
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,000
and inexperienced.

218
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,000
General Yao...

219
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,510
He can testify.

220
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,590
Yao Yong,

221
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,680
is this true?

222
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,160
Your Majesty,

223
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,920
every word His Highness said

224
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,270
is true.

225
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Duke of Ning,

226
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,110
in your view,

227
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,960
is the Crown Prince blameless?

228
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,040
Your Majesty,

229
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,030
not entirely.

230
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,020
(Wang Jingzhi, Duke of Ning)
His fault lies in

231
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,920
lacking command authority

232
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,000
as the Crown Prince.

233
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,070
Though he saw danger,

234
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,920
he failed to stop it.

235
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,590
Yet, Your Majesty,

236
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,830
His Highness

237
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,680
is still young.

238
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,030
That he could sense the danger

239
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,000
is already rare.

240
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,680
You are all dismissed.

241
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,920
Father, please see my sincerity.

242
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,550
I take my leave.

243
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,760
My Lady!

244
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,910
My Lady!

245
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
The whole city's talking:

246
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,790
the Wei army's been defeated,

247
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,070
their entire clan wiped out.

248
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,550
Seventy thousand soldiers perished

249
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,040
in Baidi Valley!

250
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Their whole family

251
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,280
are gone?

252
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,880
My Lady,

253
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,830
where are you going?

254
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,660
(Best regards. Wei Jun)

255
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,420
(Investigate the Arsenal Bureau.
Best regards. Wei Jun)

256
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,400
Such loyal soldiers,

257
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,070
pillars of the nation.

258
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,070
Why is there no justice for them?

259
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,510
Heaven has no eyes!

260
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,040
Your Majesty,

261
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,440
the loss of seventy thousand

262
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,400
elite troops at Baidi Valley

263
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,510
is catastrophic.

264
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,550
The Crown Prince may be forgiven,

265
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,830
but the Wei family

266
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
cannot escape blame.

267
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,480
Seven great generals

268
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,830
have fallen.

269
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,070
I know Your Majesty meant well,

270
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,640
but the people won't understand.

271
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,240
This morning,

272
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,750
the Ministries of Rites,

273
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,310
Revenue, and Personnel

274
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,350
all came to discuss this matter.

275
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,830
We know Your Majesty

276
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,590
favors the Wei family too much.

277
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,830
But people will think Your Majesty

278
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,920
favors them too much.

279
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,920
Public resentment will grow.

280
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,840
And I heard

281
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,790
the General Wei Yun returns

282
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,150
to the capital today with the coffins.

283
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
Your Majesty should

284
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,070
decide soon.

285
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,200
About the Wei family case,

286
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,510
after the Marquis's burial, hand it over

287
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,240
to the Court of Judicial Review.

288
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,110
But...

289
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Duke of Ning,

290
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,440
what say you?

291
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,590
Wise decision, Your Majesty.

292
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,270
I'm weary.

293
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,200
You may leave.

294
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,550
Does Great Sui

295
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
no longer have soldiers

296
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,510
who can guard our borders

297
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,350
and resist the enemy?

298
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Must I truly

299
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,830
make peace with North Qi?

300
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,030
The Crown Prince is useless.

301
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,200
What will become of

302
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,510
Great Sui's future?

303
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,460
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

304
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,820
(True Might)

305
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,820
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

306
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,440
- Mother!
- Mother!

307
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,390
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

308
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,150
Mother!

309
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,480
Mother!

310
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,830
I, Wei Yun,

311
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,920
have returned with my father and brothers.

312
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,800
Mother!

313
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,150
Sisters!

314
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,510
I'm sorry.

315
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,520
Yun...

316
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,320
- Mother.
- Rong!

317
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,750
Yun.

318
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,920
Yun.

319
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,510
Mother!

320
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,840
My husband

321
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,790
and my sons

322
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
died for Great Sui.

323
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,960
They were heroes,

324
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,400
true men of loyalty and honor!

325
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,640
All of you...

326
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,590
You did well.

327
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,980
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

328
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,640
You did well!

329
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,480
Brother Wei!

330
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,300
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

331
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,590
Lady Chu, are you here

332
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,640
to shame the Wei family?

333
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,720
Before Wei Jun went to war,

334
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,550
we secretly agreed we'd marry each other

335
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,720
after he returns from the battlefield.

336
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,590
Now that he's returned,

337
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,240
I've come to fulfill our promise.

338
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,790
My brother never

339
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,830
told me about that.

340
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,200
Then you don't know

341
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,510
what passed between us.

342
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,070
Thank you, Mother.

343
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,910
Jun,

344
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,110
I had hoped

345
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,920
to see you wed this time.

346
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,550
Once I return in victory,

347
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,550
you will see me marry.

348
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,830
You already have someone in mind?

349
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,880
Mother,

350
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,720
we'll talk

351
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,800
after I return.

352
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,110
Just wait for us.

353
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,670
Yun,

354
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,960
put down the sword.

355
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,510
My son went to the afterlife alone.

356
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,270
He failed you, Lady Chu.

357
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,680
Please, go home.

358
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,240
That day at the Spring Breeze House,

359
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,200
I confessed to Wei Jun.

360
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,790
Everyone mocked me for shamelessness,

361
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,720
but only he

362
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,640
understood my courage to love.

363
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,680
Lady Chu,

364
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,310
do you realize that if you marry him,

365
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,270
you'll be a widow?

366
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,200
Marriage is a lifelong matter,

367
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,960
does your mother even know?

368
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,760
Chu Yu!

369
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,070
Where are you going dressed like that?

370
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,920
I'm going to marry Wei Jun

371
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,590
to fulfill our promise.

372
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
After Baidi Valley,

373
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,550
the Wei family's defeat

374
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,270
dragged down seventy thousand men!

375
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,680
The Wei family is ruined.

376
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,720
What are you doing?

377
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,800
I said before,

378
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,880
this isn't just for me.

379
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,680
No one will stop me today.

380
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,040
Chu Yu!

381
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,160
How long will you keep making a scene?

382
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,680
Will you only stop

383
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,920
once you've completely ruined

384
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,110
the Chu family's name?

385
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,840
Chu Linyang,

386
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,350
why aren't you stopping your sister?

387
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,070
She always listens to you.

388
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,240
Linyang,

389
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,750
I don't have a choice,

390
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,270
at least not now.

391
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,520
Mother,

392
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,200
let her go.

393
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,880
Chu Yu,

394
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,590
if you dare step out

395
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,070
of this house today,

396
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,550
you are

397
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,680
no longer of the Chu family.

398
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,830
I've told my mother before coming.

399
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,750
I know marriage is a serious matter,

400
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,270
one decided by parents

401
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
and matchmakers.

402
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,750
But I, Chu Yu,

403
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,630
will only

404
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,510
follow my own heart in this life.

405
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,070
Lady Chu,

406
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,920
it's not that the Wei family won't accept you,

407
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,200
but if you enter this house today,

408
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,510
you'll be widowed.

409
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,590
How could I bear that?

410
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,710
Mrs. Wei, you were young once too,

411
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,760
and you've known the pain

412
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,070
of losing the one you love.

413
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,590
You must understand

414
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,880
how I feel now.

415
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,320
Today,

416
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,190
I swear by cutting my hair

417
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,030
I marry Wei Jun,

418
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,710
with no regrets, no remorse.

419
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,510
From this day on,

420
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,030
Wei Jun is my husband.

421
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,480
If no one will mourn him,

422
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,030
I will.

423
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,070
If no one will live as his widow,

424
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,550
I will.

425
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,440
The first branch of the family still stands.

426
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,110
If you refuse me entry today,

427
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,000
I'll kneel here and never rise

428
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,630
until Wei Jun

429
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,000
is laid to rest.

430
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,360
Wei Jun,

431
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,070
I remember

432
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
every promise we made.

433
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,800
I will keep them.

434
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
I must,

435
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,360
and I will.

436
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,400
Mother,

437
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,320
everyone in Huajing

438
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,280
knows of this by now.

439
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,000
If we turn her away,

440
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,840
her life will

441
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,000
only be harder.

442
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,150
Let her have this.

443
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Lady Chu,

444
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,150
come inside and change your clothes.

445
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,360
We'll discuss the rest

446
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,280
after the burial.

447
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,470
Mother,

448
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,030
she's really not...

449
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,760
Yun,

450
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,350
take your father

451
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,630
and brothers

452
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,920
home first.

453
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,440
Her Ladyship gifted you

454
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,400
a new inkstone.

455
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,030
I'll take this one out.

456
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,640
Put it down.

457
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,990
My Lord,

458
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,000
Lady Chu went

459
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,510
dressed in wedding clothes,

460
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,920
married into the Wei family herself.

461
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,480
Why are you still thinking about her?

462
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,350
Leave me.

463
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,400
Beat him!

464
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
Beat him to death!

465
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,000
Beat him to death!

466
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,320
I said it, so what?

467
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,590
I won't let anyone

468
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,430
insult her!

469
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,360
Keep hitting him!

470
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,280
Harder!

471
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,280
- Let's go!
- Go!

472
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,760
They ran off!

473
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,960
You always told me

474
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,590
to treat others with courtesy,

475
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,070
that a gentleman uses words, not fists.

476
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,920
So why are you fighting today?

477
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,590
They slandered you.

478
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,070
How could I still cling to
"gentlemanly conduct"?

479
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,350
That title means nothing if I can't defend you.

480
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,190
In that case,

481
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,360
if you truly want to protect me,

482
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,670
I'll teach you martial arts.

483
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,640
You're so skilled,

484
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,190
why should I bother learning?

485
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,990
How about this:

486
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,350
you stay

487
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,960
by my side always

488
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,680
and protect me.

489
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,840
Alright?

490
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,910
Alright.

491
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,230
From now on,

492
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,360
I'll stay by your side

493
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,590
and protect you for life.

494
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,710
Here, a new inkstone for you.

495
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,110
Your exams are near.

496
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,920
May your words

497
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
flow clearly,

498
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
your mind stay calm,

499
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,190
and your name reach the top of the list.

500
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,400
Okay.

501
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,230
I'll try to do that.

502
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,820
(Chu)

503
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:15,910
The "Chu" as in Chu Yu?

504
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,670
Also as in Gu Chusheng.

505
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,420
(Chu)

506
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,030
Don't worry.

507
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,710
I won't let you down.

508
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,070
Tonight is our wedding night.

509
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,590
Where are you going?

510
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
We're both tired.

511
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,640
Let's rest early.

512
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm never one to cling to the past.

513
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,280
How do you know

514
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,840
I came for you?

515
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,760
Today

516
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
I have come for

517
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
Young General Wei Jun.

518
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,220
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

519
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:40,140
(In Pines and Bamboos)

520
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,550
Brother Wei,

521
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,840
forgive me

522
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,880
for entering the Wei household

523
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,840
this way.

524
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,630
This matter may be

525
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,030
graver than we thought.

526
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,320
But I promise you,

527
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,590
once I uncover the truth,

528
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,030
I'll leave and confess my guilt

529
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,280
myself.

530
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,720
Who's there?

531
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,280
My Lady, it's me.

532
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,880
Why are you here?

533
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,550
Lord Linyang sent me.

534
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,960
He said you shouldn't

535
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,190
face all this alone.

536
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,880
My Lady,

537
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,670
why did you leave me behind?

538
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,840
Didn't I say

539
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,190
I'd follow you

540
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,360
through fire and blades?

541
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,880
Look at you!

542
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,710
You want to suffer with me?

543
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,510
Whether it's pain or joy,

544
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,400
wherever you are, My Lady,

545
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,280
that's where I'll be.

546
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:19,350
Alright then.

547
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:20,710
I'm going to the mourning hall.

548
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,550
You

549
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,720
stay here.

550
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,710
You're leaving me behind again.

551
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,840
Lady Chun!

552
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,760
Lady Chun!

553
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:42,510
My Lady!

554
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,510
No, My Lady!

555
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:44,510
