Now say it.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,220
What "misunderstanding" is it?

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Duke,

25
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,710
there's no need to rush.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,750

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,910

28
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,360
The Wei clan has been nobles for a century,

29
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,710
quiet on the surface,

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
but they may

31
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,750
still have a lifeline.

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Now

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
only Wei Yun remains.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
If we want the Wei family gone,

35
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,400
we can't strike too hastily.

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,590
Otherwise, why would

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,590
His Majesty defend the Wei family,

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,630
yet keep you back alone afterward?

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Makes sense.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Haven't you always wanted

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
to be Minister of Justice?

42
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,430
Now that the position is vacant,

43
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,520
I'll speak

44
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,710
to His Majesty in a few days

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,710
so you can get some "experience" there.

46
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,030
Thank you, Duke.

47
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,310
Chusheng,

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
is your throat alright?

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Your hand

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,240
burned?

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
It's nothing.

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,520
But since I'll soon

53
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,120
be reassigned elsewhere,

54
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,310
I need to finish

55
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,190
the Hanlin Academy drafts.

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,030
Rest early.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,160
(A woman's knees hold gold.)

59
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,390
(You must not kneel lightly.)

60
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,720
(You knelt once for your father and brother.)

61
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,360
(Yet today you knelt outside the palace)

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,950
(unrelated to you.)

64
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,030
No.

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
The Wei family isn't safe.

66
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,600
It's a thorn in Duke of Ning's

67
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,480
eye.

68
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,630
I can't let her stay there.

69
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,110
Father,

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,230
look at my painting! How is it?

I wish Father a long, turtle-like life!

73
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,910
How is it, Father?

74
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
No, no.

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Yun's grown now.

76
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,840
- You rascal!
- Father!

77
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,040

Jun,

79
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,480
you're the Young General Wei,

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,830
so you should be both warrior and scholar.

81
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,750
But should I be that too?

82
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,700

break the block in his heart.

Yun.

194
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,350
Yun. Yun.

195
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Yun.

196
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,870
Jut is only twenty-four.

197
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,000
She has to think about her future.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,240
Living her whole life

199
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,700
in the Wei Mansion is frightening.

200
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,870
She isn't heartless.

201
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,000
Women have it hard

202
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,390
in this world.

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,510
Give her the divorce paper for me.

204
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,390
Let her go.

205
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,600
Jiu had it hard enough in the Xie family.

206
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,840
After marrying me,

207
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,790
she lived in worries.

208
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,340
I don't want her to spend her life as a widow.

209
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,910
Uncle Yun!

210
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,750
Uncle Yun!

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,870
Uncle Yun!

212
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,150
When will you come out?

213
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,030
Mother and aunts

214
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,790
are waiting for you outside.

215
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,390
Uncle Yun,

216
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,630
please come out,

217
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,390
everyone's worried.

218
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,120
I got it.

219
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,590
Wei Yun,

220
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,600
your life used to be calm

221
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,360
because your father and brothers

222
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,200
shielded you.

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,560
Now you are

224
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,390
the Wei family's only backbone.

225
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
You must hold up

226
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,240
the sky for them

227
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,910
and protect everyone under this roof.

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,870
The Wei house

229
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,240
needs you to restore its honor.

230
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,790
Besides, you must investigate

231
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,910
what really happened

232
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,750
at Baidi Valley

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,870
and root out the truth.

234
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,390
If we can't slay

235
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,230
those North Qi soldiers,

236
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,030
how can we answer

237
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,960
the seventy thousand fallen?

238
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,750
Don't let them rest in vain.

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
I dreamed my brothers told me

240
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
not to trap you

241
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,150
in the Wei household.

242
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,000
I agree as well.

243
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,380
(Divorce Paper)

244
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,260
(Defend the nation and the throne)
Today,

245
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,270
I gave you divorce papers

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
on my brothers' behalf,

247
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,030
but you will always be my family.

248
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
Although you have the papers now,

249
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,550
packing

250
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,390
takes time.

251
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,360
Don't rush.

252
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,600
If you do not wish to leave,

253
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
the Wei family won't drive you away.

254
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,960
If you ever want to return,

255
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,480
our gates

256
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
remain open.

257
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,590
Yun,

258
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,870
Yu,

259
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,080
thank you.

260
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,960
I planned

261
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,240
to wait until things were certain,

262
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,910
but seeing the situation now,

263
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,870
I decided to tell you now.

264
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,070
My brother works in the Ministry of Personnel,

265
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,390
he sent word yesterday

266
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,080
that the court is preparing to confer

267
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,480
the Marquis of Zhenguo title on Yun.

268
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,110
After all we suffered,

269
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,680
at least there's good news.

270
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,110
Yes, from

271
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,370
extreme hardship comes relief.

272
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,480
Congratulations to you, Yun.

273
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,350
Congrats.

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,840
This is

275
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,400
a major event for the Wei household.

276
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,640
Why not

277
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,310
stay until

278
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,310
the enfeoffment banquet?

279
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,750
We can

280
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,790
stay with the children

281
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,630
a few more days

282
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,910
and

283
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,000
help make a showing

284
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,880
for Yun's new rank.

285
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,950
What do you say?

286
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,310
This is a good idea.

287
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,480
The Wei family

288
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
is not what it used to be.

289
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,240
The banquet

290
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,590
will show

291
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,790
who truly

292
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,880
stands with us

293
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
and give you a proper send-off.

294
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,430
It's good.

295
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,590
Our Wei family

296
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,000
needs such an occasion.

297
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,790
Yes, let's go.

298
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's go get ready.

299
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,540
(Divorce Paper)

300
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,930
(Divorce Paper)

301
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,800
What is this?

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,720
You're still young,

303
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,110
remarrying

304
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,950
wouldn't be hard.

305
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,070
You and my brother

306
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,910
barely knew each other.

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
You were not deep in love.

308
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,070
If you take this divorce paper today,

309
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,310
I'll assume you stayed

310
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,200
only out of righteousness.

311
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,720
I won't

312
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
probe further.

313
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,070
When I inherit the title,

314
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,310
I'll speak well of Young General Chu.

315
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,510
The Wei family will remember your kindness.

316
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,880
Have you forgotten

317
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,720
our agreement?

318
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,790
If I rescue you,

319
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,240
you can't drive me away.

320
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,320
Otherwise

321
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,270
if I can save you,

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,160
I can send you back too.

323
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,830
I didn't know

324
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,960
you had such skills.

325
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,980
(Divorce Paper)

326
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,750
I've always been unruly

327
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,480
and unorthodox.

328
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,070
If you don't believe that,

329
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,390
test me.

330
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,340
(Defend the nation and the throne)

331
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,560
My Lord,

332
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,240
you still don't trust Lady Chu?

333
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,070
She's done so much for the Wei family.

334
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,790
I feel indebted to her.

335
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,110
I once urged her

336
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,270
not to bind herself here.

337
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,070
But which sister

338
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,640
does not love

339
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,000
this family?

340
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
They too might leave.

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,110
I tried to bribe her,

342
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,510
but she insisted on staying.

343
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,720
How can I trust her?

344
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,350
She tries so hard

345
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,350
to stay in the Wei family.

346
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,400
She must have her motives.

347
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,350
If so,

348
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,350
just

349
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,510
throw her out.

350
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,830
Even without proof,

351
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
what can she do?

352
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,910
Wei Qiu,

353
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,480
if a tiger always

354
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,510
covets your flesh,

355
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,880
do you keep it nearby

356
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,960
and lock it up,

357
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,750
or do you

358
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,030
drive it away,

359
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,790
constantly scared?

360
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,030
You mean it's safer

361
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,310
to keep Lady Chu

362
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,640
in the open

363
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,440
and watch her.

364
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,550
So your promise

365
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,480
in jail

366
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
was also for this?

367
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,350
If she's treacherous,

368
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,070
if we do nothing,

369
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,240
she'll show her hand.

370
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
You'll have people watch her

371
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,440
and report whom she meets

372
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,350
and what she does

373
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,480
every day.

374
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:51,020
(Wei)

375
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,660
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

376
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,000
Chu Yu! get out here at once!

377
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,950
Chu Yu!

378
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,530
You're making a scene at the Wei gate.

379
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,490
What sort of behavior is this?

380
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,310
Chu Yu,

381
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,260
marrying into the Wei family

382
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,110
is one thing,

383
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,550
but why must you drag our brother

384
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,540
and the entire Chu family down?

385
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,640
Drag him down?

386
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,840
Speak clearly.

387
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,960
Don't play dumb.

388
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,400
Do you not know that today

389
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,160
Gu Chusheng impeached him in court

390
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
for "overly close ties" with the Wei family,

391
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
asking for his removal?

392
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,830
Gu Chusheng impeached Linyang

393
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,030
asking for his removal?

394
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,790
Has he gone mad?

395
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,640
If you hadn't married into the Wei family

396
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,750
and made that petty man jealous,

397
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,110
why would he kick us

398
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,110
when the Chu family

399
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,030
is already struggling?

400
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,880
He's always been petty.

401
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,920
But how did you hear of this?

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,840
Speak up.

403
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,590
Why did you ask me here?

404
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,790
We're hardly friends.

405
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,400
The whole capital says

406
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,880
Chu Yu is fickle

407
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,270
and faithless.

408
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,030
I only want to know

409
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,640
whether she truly

410
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,590
loves Wei Jun.

411
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,640
With her nature,

412
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,070
it's not strange for her

413
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,240
to suddenly fancy someone.

414
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
You care this much,

415
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,550
don't tell me

416
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,880
you still have feelings for her.

417
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,880
Do you really think you're a phoenix

418
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,270
just because you climbed high?

419
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,270
You think our Chu family

420
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,400
needs your trifling gifts?

421
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,160
Lady Jin,

422
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,720
think nothing of it,

423
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,680
just a token.

424
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,440
But His Majesty

425
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,920
already dislikes the power

426
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,270
of military families.

427
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,200
Chu Yu insisted on marrying the Wei clan,

428
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,040
such alliances

429
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,310
will only make His Majesty wary.

430
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,960
The title of "First Madam" seems grand,

431
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,010
but it will make

432
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,440
life difficult for the Chu family.

433
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,800
Lady Jin,

434
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,640
persuade your brother to ally

435
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,480
with the Duke of Ning's family.

436
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,820
Civil and military united,

437
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,640
only then can great things be achieved.

438
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,110
Don't you dare use my brother

439
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,950
to threaten me.

440
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,400
Since you're so desperate to pry

441
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,590
information out of me,

442
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
I'll tell you:

443
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,310
Chu Yu and Wei Jun

444
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,270
met only a few times.

445
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,440
Talk of true love is nonsense.

446
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,350
Chasing you to the southwest

447
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,960
showed more devotion.

448
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,160
Since I've spoken

449
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,000
this much,

450
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,310
I'll accept

451
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,240
your little gift.

452
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,400
He must think

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,350
the Chu family is weak

454
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,030
and wants to stir trouble,

455
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,680
tricking you into speaking.

456
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
I...

457
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,920
So what even if I said it?

458
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,550
I didn't expect him

459
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,790
to target our brother.

460
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,270
If not for you,

461
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,200
he wouldn't be scheming

462
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,040
like this,

463
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,270
our brother wouldn't be facing this.

464
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,880
You caused the trouble.

465
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,110
Why blame me?

466
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
You truly hate me this much?

467
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,350
The Chu family suffers,

468
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,200
yet you live comfortably.

469
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,590
If you don't fix this,

470
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,510
I'll expose your intentions

471
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,590
to the entire

472
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,510
Huajing City.

473
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,750
I'll make Wei Yun

474
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
drive you out

475
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,200
and leave you

476
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,070
homeless.

477
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,830
What, you'll hit me here too?

478
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,880
I won't hit you now

479
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,200
or ever.

480
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,240
Go back.

481
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,640
I'll handle this.

482
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,960
I promise you,

483
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,350
this

484
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,590
won't harm you in the slightest.

485
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,880
You'd better keep your word.

486
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,240
She made a mistake,

487
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,310
but why does she put

488
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,270
all the blame on you?

489
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,560
My Lady,

490
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,160
why don't you teach her a lesson?

491
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,880
What did she do wrong?

492
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,590
Whatever.

493
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,640
Linyang's trouble matters most.

494
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,200
Gu Chusheng,

495
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,960
if you act without mercy,

496
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,720
don't blame me for answering in kind.

497
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,640
If he hates peace so much,

498
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,640
I'll give him

499
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,960
chaos.

500
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,080
Yu.

501
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,510
It's just family matters.

502
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,830
Don't worry.

503
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,240
I can deal with it.

504
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,440
If there's anything we can help with,

505
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
just tell us.

506
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,520
Family matters?

507
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,480
I doubt it.

508
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,720
Your marriage to the Wei clan

509
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,160
already counts

510
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
as an alliance.

511
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,440
My investiture is soon.

512
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,050
How could the officials

513
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,590
miss such a chance?

514
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,880
It may seem aimed at your brother,

515
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,440
but its true target is the Chu

516
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,110
and Wei families together.

517
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,060
So you were eavesdropping.

518
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,390
(Divorce Paper)
If you want a clean solution,

519
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,180
take the divorce paper.

520
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,300
If you return to the Chu family,

521
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,700
Gu Chusheng will naturally

522
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,620
drop the impeachment.

523
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,020
Yes, Yu.

524
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,500
Yun's right.

525
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,380
Even if you take the paper,

526
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,940
you're still family to us.

527
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,060
Yu,

528
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,060
if you've dragged the Chu family down,

529
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,540
how

530
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,500
will you face your mother?

531
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,620
Yes, Yu.

532
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,780
You've done so much for both Jun

533
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,620
and the Wei family.

534
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,020
Think for yourself this time.

535
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,780
Yun,

536
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,260
help think

537
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,860
of another way.

538
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,620
I appreciate your goodwill.

539
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,140
I'll thank you

540
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,580
after it's settled.

541
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,220
As you wish.

542
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,990
(Divorce Paper)
I'll take it.

543
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,020
Wei Qiu,

544
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,100
follow her these days.

545
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,180
Who knows what trouble she'll stir up next.

546
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,380
Yes.

547
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,460
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

548
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,300
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)
Absurd!

549
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,780
Only in the Duke of Ning's Mansion

550
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,460
can one taste such good tea.

551
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,020
Truly excellent.

552
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,620
Guards!

553
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,020
Drag her out!

554
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,780
Lady Wang, calm down.

555
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,820
Perhaps you two

556
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,260
don't know yet: Gu Chusheng

557
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,660
impeached my brother.

558
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,340
You know my history

559
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,500
with him.

560
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,860
He impeached my brother

561
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,060
to force me out of the Wei family

562
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,340
so he could reconcile with me.

563
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,060
Now that I've taken the divorce paper,

564
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,340
if my brother loses his post,

565
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,740
I'll have no choice

566
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,660
but to be with Gu Chusheng.

567
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,620
Delusion!

568
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
I am his lawful wife.

569
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,740
So what?

570
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,980
If you

571
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,940
don't help my brother,

572
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,860
then even as a concubine,

573
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,020
I'll marry into your manor.

574
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,340
Even being his mistress, why not?

575
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,180
As they say,

576
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,730
wildflowers smell sweeter than home ones.

577
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,220
How shameless

578
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,740
can a woman be!

579
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,180
Chusheng.

580
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,380
Chusheng.

581
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,860
Chusheng.

582
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,060
You're finally back.

583
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,300
I know you still care for me.

584
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Those years

585
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,780
under the moon, our vows

586
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,700
to be true forever,

587
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,060
never part.

588
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,460
Do you remember?

589
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,780
Yu.

590
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,260
What did you call her?

591
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,580
Chusheng,

592
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,060
I know

593
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,340
our love isn't

594
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,540
accepted by the world.

595
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,340
For you,

596
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,700
I will never yield.

597
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,340
Even heaven and earth may end,

598
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,340
this love never will.

599
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,220
Chu Yu,

600
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,460
he's my husband.

601
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,380
I already have the divorce paper.

602
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,500
What about you?

603
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,860
When will you divorce?

604
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,140
Why didn't you reject her?

605
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,660
Chusheng,

606
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,740
did you impeach Chu Linyang

607
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,820
because you wanted

608
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,860
to be with her?

609
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,540
Say something.

610
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,740
Speak!

611
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,060
Let me explain.

612
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,220
Chusheng.

613
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,060
Enough!

614
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,860
My Duke of Ning's manor

615
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,740
has never produced

616
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,140
such disgraceful conduct!

617
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,540
You...

618
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,540
Father!

619
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,840
- Gu Chusheng!
- My Lord.

620
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,460
Throw that wretch out!

621
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,900
Have some tea, calm yourself.

622
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,340
(Divorce Paper)

623
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,780
Chusheng,

624
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,980
I've fulfilled your wish.

625
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,620
I'll

626
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,180
wait for your good news.

627
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,540
Are you feeling better?

628
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,380
Lady Yu.

629
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,340
How coincidental.

630
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,180
Indeed.

631
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,500
Did Wei Yun send you?

632
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,860
No.

633
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,100
It's Lord Yun.

634
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,540
No, no,

635
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,380
not him.

636
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,380
I...

637
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,540
I thought Lord Yun

638
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,780
might worry about you.

639
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,420
So I came.

640
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,860
Yes.

641
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,780
Do you even know what you're saying?

642
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,500
I don't know

643
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,340
what I'm saying.

644
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,100
You're not good at lying.

645
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,260
He just doesn't believe

646
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,060
I'll leave after taking the divorce paper,

647
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,540
so he sent you to watch me.

648
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,140
Where is he?

649
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
This concerns the Wei family.

650
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,420
I'm fighting on the front lines.

651
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,780
Where has he slipped off to?

652
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Lord Yun went

653
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,660
to meet with Lu Qiba today.

654
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,620
He's hard to arrange.

655
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,940
Lu Qiba?

656
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,020
The one at the Arsenal Bureau

657
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,140
who made the octagonal crossbow?

658
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,460
Yes.

659
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,100
Look what you've done!

660
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,420
You'd better tell the truth.

661
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,660
Why did you impeach Chu Linyang?

662
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,060
Duke, don't believe

663
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,300
Chu Yu's nonsense.

664
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,180
I impeached him

665
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,060
to keep Wei Yun from

666
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,900
inheriting too easily,

667
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,860
to check the military's growing power.

668
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,020
Chu Yu caused a scene

669
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,420
only to protect

670
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,780
her brother's post.

671
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,980
Whatever your motive,

672
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,460
tomorrow you will report

673
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,860
to His Majesty

674
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,020
and withdraw the impeachment.

675
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,180
Chu Yu must

676
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,020
remain

677
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,460
the Wei family's First Madam.

678
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,380
Today's scandal must never repeat.

679
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,940
My Duke of Ning's Mansion

680
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,980
cannot afford such shame.

681
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,900
Yes.

682
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,540
I understand.

683
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,540
Good move,

684
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,460
Chu Yu.

685
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,940
(Fragrance House)

686
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,900
So it's agreed.

687
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,020
Don't forget.

688
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,860
Remember.

689
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,380
Isn't that Wei Yun?

690
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,060
The Wei family is in chaos,

691
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,300
yet he still comes to a place like this.

692
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,220
Seems

693
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,620
the rumors are true.

694
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,980
He's just a naive boy who respects

695
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,900
father and brothers.

696
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,140
The glory of the Marquis's manor

697
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,620
ends here.

698
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Sir, I haven't seen you before.

699
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,740
Which girl are you

700
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,580
looking for?

701
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,500
A man.

702
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,340
A man?

703
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,180
Lu Qiba.

704
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,540
Do you know him?

705
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,180
Oh! You're looking for Master Lu.

706
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,500
No problem.

707
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,260
Let go of that lady!

708
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,140
(Lu Qiba,
Deputy Commander of the Arsenal Bureau)

709
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,100
Didn't mean to scare you.

710
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,060
What's in that thing?

711
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,180
Aphrodisiacs.

712
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,140
What?

713
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,940
Kidding.

714
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,660
This is a secret tool

715
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,620
for dealing with brutes like you.

716
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,900
After all,

717
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,020
protecting every young lady

718
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,860
is my sacred duty.

719
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,620
Ladies,

720
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,580
shout my name!

721
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,060
Lu Qiba!

722
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,540
Lu Qiba!

723
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,260
Lu Qiba!

724
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,060
I am the man

725
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,980
everyone adores,

726
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,260
handsome, clever,

727
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,300
the best weapons master of Great Sui:

728
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,340
Lu Qiba.

729
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Young people are

730
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,980
so impatient nowadays.

731
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,420
I don't have time to fool around with you.

732
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Find a quiet place.

733
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,620
We have serious business.

734
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,460
Of course.

735
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,460
Madam Zhang,

736
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,780
open my private room.

737
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,780
Got it.

738
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Put it on his tab.

739
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,820
So you and Lu Qiba

740
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
are old acquaintances?

741
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,980
What's he like?

742
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,460
Does he come here often?

743
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,060
He's a regular.

744
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,820
But we won't casually

745
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,780
sell others' information.

746
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,740
You'll

747
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,980
have to check yourself.

748
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,900
Surely you've heard

749
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,660
of my charm.

750
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,900
Being too handsome

751
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,020
is a burden.

752
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,100
Of course, Wei,

753
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,540
this is something

754
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,420
you wouldn't understand.

755
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,740
You must be General Wei, right?

756
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,500
Truly a young general,

757
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,420
upright,

758
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,820
imposing.

759
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,100
I thought General Wei Jun

760
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,180
was unmatched,

761
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,740
but it seems

762
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,820
you

763
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,900
surpasses him.

764
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,140
Why are your eyes

765
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,300
so red?

766
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,900
Shall I blow

767
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,260
on them for you?

768
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,140
You must be blind.

769
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,780
I'm sure of it.

770
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,820
I have important business with Master Lu.

771
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,620
Please leave us for now.

772
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,820
If I offended you,

773
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,860
forgive me.

774
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,500
What a gentleman.

775
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,980
When you're done,

776
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,420
we sisters

777
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,460
will be waiting for you.

778
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,300
We'll be waiting.

779
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,500
- Let's go.
- Go.

780
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,460
So shy.

781
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,980
Haven't seen someone

782
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,500
this serious in a long time.

783
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,380
Fine.

784
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,620
You're just like Wei Jun,

785
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,380
boring.

786
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,140
You actually use your weapons

787
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,100
in a place like this?

788
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,940
Why not?

789
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,060
Is the Bureau

790
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,300
only for war?

791
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,480
- But...
- Fighting

792
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,420
is for peace and protecting

793
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,380
the people.

794
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,060
The tools I develop now

795
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,820
also protect them.

796
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
What's the difference?

797
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,500
Didn't Wei Jun

798
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,780
tell you that?

799
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,460
Seems you're far

800
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,820
behind your brother.

801
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,220
He may be rigid,

802
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,660
but not as tense as you.

803
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,660
Also,

804
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,340
he's much more generous.

805
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,820
Whenever he came here,

806
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,740
he paid first.

807
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,820
You should be grateful

808
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,940
I let you pay today.

809
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,660
Stop putting on that sour face.

810
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,180
Since you're close

811
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,020
with my brother,

812
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,020
and you understand Great Sui weapons best,

813
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,380
I'll be direct.

814
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,460
The core trigger technique

815
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,620
of the octagonal crossbow

816
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,700
may have leaked to North Qi.

817
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,940
They've built some

818
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,020
identical to ours.

819
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
Impossible.

820
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,780
Only Wei Jun

821
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,620
and I know

822
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,460
the core.

823
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,060
The crossbow appeared only once

824
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,180
in a military drill.

825
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,260
Only a few

826
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,940
top officers

827
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,220
knew.

828
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,220
And the blueprint

829
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,540
never left the Arsenal Bureau.

830
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,020
How could it leak?

831
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,260
Ask yourself, Master Lu.

832
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,540
The recoil is too strong.

833
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,820
Ordinary soldiers can't use it.

834
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,980
Ten parts of force and

835
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,060
you take three parts injury.

836
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,260
That is the octagonal crossbow.

837
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,780
I saw it on the battlefield myself.

838
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,140
This is my design.

839
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,220
And yes,

840
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,060
it wasn't adopted

841
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,060
because of that recoil.

842
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,700
Wait, you...

843
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,340
You're not

844
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,340
suspecting me, are you?

845
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,860
Until it's investigated,

846
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,740
everyone in the Arsenal Bureau

847
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,580
is a suspect.

848
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,620
I'll take this back and examine it.

849
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,860
Prove to me

850
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,820
you're clean.

851
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,340
If you didn't trust me,

852
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
why walk into my trap today?

853
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,020
When will you have results?

854
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,700
That depends on you.

855
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,380
When you can catch up to your brother.

856
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,900
Sir.

857
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,140
- Sit down.
- Lord Yun.

858
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,780
- Enjoy.
- That's right.

859
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,940
- Sit down.
- Yes.

860
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,340
Master Lu,

861
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,820
why so rushed?

862
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,260
I prepared fine wine

863
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,100
to treat you.

864
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,300
Stay and taste it.

865
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,980
Come on, try it.

866
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,820
There's actually

867
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,060
such a beauty in Fragrance House.

868
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,460
No need, no need.

869
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,300
Master Lu, sit.

870
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,660
Drink.

871
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,850
No. No.

872
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,980
Comfortable?

873
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,460
Is my strength just right?

874
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,620
Come, let me wipe that.

875
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,460
No need.

876
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,540
Ladies,

877
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,460
forgive me today,

878
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,460
this young man is mine now.

879
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,820
Goodbye. Goodbye.

880
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,660
Thanks.

881
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,020
Thank you.

882
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,740
