No one else is here,

just you and me.

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,480
In broad daylight?

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,760
- That's not appropriate.
- Come on.

26
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,000
You bad boy.

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
Yun, Lady Yu.

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,180
- Listen.
- You're so bad.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
We would never...

30
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,630
We would never

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,630
stoop to eavesdropping.

32
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,590
Why?

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,230
Don't you want the Crown Prince?

34
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,430
He's inside.

35
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,080
- Listen.
- Come catch me.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Hurry.

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,150
Come on.

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,080
Got you.

39
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,550
You cheated.

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,960
No one will find out, right?

41
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,990
It's just us.

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,990
Really?

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Don't run.

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,470
Don't be shy.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,190
Stop it.

46
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,150
What are you doing?

47
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,590
Just what you're thinking.

48
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,310
You knew this all along?

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,280
The Crown Prince is engaged

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
to our Tuantuan.

51
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,310
So of course I bribed an

52
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,680
Eastern Palace eunuch to keep an eye on him.

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,470
He even bought a dancer

54
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,750
from Fragrance House the other day.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I paid a lot of silver

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,710
for that information.

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,080
I was about to talk to him.

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
And since you happened to need him,

59
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,750
perfect.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
Two birds with one stone.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,400
What two birds with one

62
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,870
stone?

63
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,310
You just want me to help you

64
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,150
catch him cheating.

65
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,750
But didn't I help you

66
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
find him?

67
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,960
And you said

68
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,910
going straight to

69
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,030
the Eastern Palace would look bad.

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,080
I only knew he'd be here.

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,150
I must've been crazy

72
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,000
to ask for your help.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
But I did help, didn't I?

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Enough.

75
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Stop arguing.

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,700
We all want the Crown Prince.

77
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Since he's here,

78
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,990
handle the serious matter first.

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Lady Chu is right.

80
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,750
Yun,

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,590
open the door.

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
How would I open it?

83
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,280
You need me to teach you?

84
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,590
Like this

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
and this.

86
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Then it will open.

87
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,030
Go on, open it.

88
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,910
Why don't you do it?

89
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,870
I'm not the Marquis of Zhenguo.

90
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
You do it.

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,720
I can't.

92
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,120
You can, hurry.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
Go on.

94
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,470
Come on.

95
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,400
Come on.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,310
Stop it.

97
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,160
Come on, come on.

98
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,350
Who's there?

99
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,590
Your Highness!

100
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,560
Lady Chu is impressive.

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
- Greetings,
- Greetings,

102
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,360
Your Highness.

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,870
You barged into my room

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,470
without summons.

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
I could punish you for that, you know.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,830
Oh, you dare?

107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,070
Keeping a mistress in an inn,

108
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,150
you know it can't be seen.

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,790
Your are about to marry Tuantuan,

110
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,950
yet you do something

111
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,000
this disgraceful.

112
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,240
How are we supposed to

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,190
entrust Tuantuan to you?

114
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,720
As if your reputation outside

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
is spotless, Song Wenchang.

116
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,870
And I'm the Crown Prince.

117
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,160
I will have a harem in the future.

118
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,550
After the wedding,

119
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,880
Qingping will be Crown Princess,

120
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,360
and one day Empress.

121
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,270
Should an Empress

122
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,720
not tolerate other consorts?

123
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Can you compare yourself to me?

124
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,540
I've never had a betrothal.

125
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,270
If I make a promise to a lady,

126
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,150
I would never be

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,010
as fickle as you.

128
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,800
Your Highness is correct.

129
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,680
Forcing our way into your quarters

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,600
is indeed a capital offense.

131
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,450
I will go to His Majesty now,

132
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,800
explain everything,

133
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,270
and accept punishment.

134
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,620
I as well.

135
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,250
I came today

136
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,250
by order of the Eldest Princess,

137
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,120
but forcing entry was improper.

138
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,510
I will

139
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,920
return and beg her

140
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
pardon.

141
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,440
But...

142
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Right,

143
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,440
I'll inform my father and Tuantuan.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,400
Stop.

145
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,750
Whatever you intend to do,

146
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,950
at least choose an appropriate place.

147
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,600
Hot wontons.

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,870
Her Highness used a pouch

149
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,950
to lead me to the inn,

150
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,310
she clearly knew what

151
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,680
the Crown Prince was doing.

152
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
But she's his aunt.

153
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,750
Why have me catch him in the act?

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Wouldn't that harm the royal family's
reputation?

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,560
She is his aunt,

156
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,870
but compared to him,

157
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,310
she cares more about Lady Song

158
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,630
of the Duke of Hu's mansion,

159
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,560
Song Qingping.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
This Lady Song

161
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
has long treated Her Highness's

162
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
chronic headaches

163
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,350
and helped her greatly.

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
So the Emperor betrothed her

165
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,960
to the Crown Prince.

166
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,040
Her Highness likely couldn't act openly,

167
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,070
so she had you run this errand.

168
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,190
First, to warn the Crown Prince

169
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,360
for her and Lady Song.

170
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,830
Second, to help our Wei family.

171
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,510
A plan that serves two sides,

172
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,430
clearly with Mr. Xue's touch.

173
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,350
But catching

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,480
the Crown Prince cheating

175
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,000
isn't exactly glorious.

176
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
You

177
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,680
won't spread this, right?

178
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
Do I look like someone who gossips?

179
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,590
If you don't

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,960
speak of it,

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,310
neither will I.

182
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,320
Good.

183
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,430
Looks like you won't need to worry

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,950
about tomorrow's banquet anymore.

185
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,420
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

186
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,820
(True Might)

187
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,740
(Spirit tablet of Wei Sijie)

188
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,620
(Spirit tablet of Lady Qian)

189
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,020
(Spirit tablet of Lady Liu)

190
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,860
(Undying Loyalty)

191
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,700
Father,

192
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,230
Mother.

193
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,910
Whether I inherit

194
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,870
the title today or not,

195
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
as long as I live,

196
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,510
the Wei family will not fall.

197
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,870
I will carry the Wei name for you,

198
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,340
defend the nation and the throne,

199
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,480
hold no regrets.

200
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,660
(Ancestral Tablets of the Wei Clan)

201
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,020
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

202
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,720
Uncle Yun,

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
who are we still waiting for?

204
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,440
Why aren't we eating?

205
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,320
So impatient.

206
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
Mother said many ladies

207
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,550
and gentlemen would come today.

208
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,030
But it's been two whole hours.

209
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
Did they get lost?

210
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,550
Uncle Yun,

211
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,240
should we go find them?

212
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,720
I am hungry.

213
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,350
Lingmo,

214
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,630
didn't you just have snacks?

215
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,470
Hungry again?

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,960
Go play with your brother.

217
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,230
Let's eat.

218
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,110
Tell the kitchen

219
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,420
to bring the dishes to the hall.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
We'll eat by ourselves.

221
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,060
(Defend the nation and the throne)

222
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,560
Yun,

223
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
I have an unreasonable request.

224
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,270
After today,

225
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,670
we're leaving the Wei Mansion.

226
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,750
Before we go,

227
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,480
I want to take one thing of Qin's

228
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,240
as remembrance.

229
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,080
Of course.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,960
What would you

231
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,960
like to take?

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,510
When Wei Qin was alive,

233
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,270
his spear was his treasure,

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,790
full of his marks.

235
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,840
I want to take it.

236
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,800
Can I?

237
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,110
Han,

238
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,390
those spears

239
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,150
were forged by the seven

240
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,220
of them together.

241
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,870
Just leave them here,

242
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,880
it's like the brothers are reunited.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Yes.

244
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,150
Chun is right.

245
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,960
No,

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
take it.

247
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,630
I can't bear to part with it,

248
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
but in the end,

249
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
it's only an object.

250
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
They

251
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,120
may never have the chance

252
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,960
to go to war again.

253
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,020
If seeing the spear

254
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,510
lets you remember your days

255
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,480
here with my brothers,

256
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,440
then that's the best use of them.

257
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,240
And my brothers

258
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,150
would surely be glad.

259
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,680
Yun,

260
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,440
thank you.

261
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
Alright.

262
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,600
Enough waiting.

263
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,440
Let's wait a bit longer.

264
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,040
Just a little bit.

265
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Yes.

266
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,870
Maybe they're already at the gate.

267
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,150
Let's go check.

268
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,420
- Okay.
- Let's go.

269
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,030
Han, take the children

270
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,200
to the back garden.

271
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,720
Go on.

272
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,560
Let's go.

273
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,790
That day you insisted

274
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,200
on this banquet,

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
did you imagine this scene?

276
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,550
Whether they come is their choice;

277
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,150
whether we hold

278
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,440
the banquet is ours.

279
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,720
Do all we can, leave the rest to fate.

280
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,870
If you don't even dare try,

281
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,750
not even an immortal

282
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,870
could save you.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
You personally delivered an invitation

284
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
to Her Highness.

285
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,200
And I invited the Crown Prince.

286
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,150
But look at the result.

287
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,480
We did our part,

288
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
but fate is decided.

289
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
Then

290
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,040
let's bet:

291
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,350
Obverse—

292
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,350
someone will come.

293
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,960
Reverses—no one will.

294
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,350
Dare you?

295
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
Why not?

296
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,710
See?

297
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
Fate has spoken.

298
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
People will come today.

299
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
Yu,

300
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,080
General Chu and Lady Jin have arrived.

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,510
The first to watch the joke is here.

302
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
Please.

303
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,870
- Linyang, you're here.
- Yu.

304
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,990
Are we late?

305
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,670
Thank you for coming, General Chu.

306
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Not late,

307
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
just right.

308
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,550
See? I told you.

309
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,390
Why rush?

310
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,000
Even if we arrived an hour later,

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
we'd still be first.

312
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,630
Maybe even last.

313
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,030
Jin,

314
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,510
today is an important day.

315
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,840
Behave yourself.

316
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,670
If you cause trouble,

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,840
you'll regret it.

318
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,000
I came to support you,

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
yet you're ungrateful.

320
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
Oh, Chu Yu,

321
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,510
you schemed so hard to marry

322
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,440
into the Wei family,

323
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,720
what did you gain?

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,550
Not a single guest came to this banquet.

325
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,000
If not for Linyang and me,

326
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,240
the Wei family's

327
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,550
disgrace would reach the heavens.

328
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,600
And you still put on airs.

329
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Jin!

330
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not wrong, am I?

331
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,560
My sister was rude.

332
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,050
Please forgive her, Marquis Wei.

333
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,510
General Chu, don't call me that.

334
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm not the Marquis yet.

335
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,080
Don't worry.

336
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,120
On our way here,

337
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,390
we saw many carriages.

338
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,510
I think they're waiting for the right moment.

339
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,990
The right moment?

340
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,840
Probably waiting to see

341
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,720
who comes first.

342
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,030
The Eldest Princess has arrived.

343
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,590
The moment's here.

344
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,520
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
Greetings, Your Highness.

345
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,040
Rise.

346
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,350
Your Highness.

347
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,790
I didn't expect you to truly come.

348
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,960
I'm not late, am I?

349
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,750
You arrived perfectly.

350
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,000
I actually hadn't planned to come,

351
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,510
but when I heard no one else was here,

352
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,160
my interest grew.

353
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,590
And thank you

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
for standing up for Tuantuan.

355
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
Hanmei prepared gifts for you.

356
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

357
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,030
Well then, aren't you going to

358
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,270
arrange a good seat for me?

359
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,150
This way, Your Highness.

360
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,830
Please come inside.

361
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,310
General Wei.

362
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,920
- Young Master Sun has arrived.
- Please.

363
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,130
- Alright.
- As for soup,

364
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,000
check if the guests like it

365
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,990
- or not.
- Minister Gu has arrived!

366
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,390
- If not, don't serve it.
- Yes.

367
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,350
- Go ahead.
- Censor Chen.

368
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,190
Yes.

369
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,710
- Vice Minister Tong.
- You came quick early.

370
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,110
Together?

371
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,950
Alright.

372
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,670
Yun,

373
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,070
how could the three prodigies of the

374
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,310
Duke of Hu's Manor not be here today?

375
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Slowly.

376
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
Three steps ahead.

377
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,200
Yes, go on, go on.

378
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,390
Go.

379
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,110
Careful, steps.

380
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,750
I've met Mr. Song.

381
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,270
These two are...?

382
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,160
Okay, steady, steady.

383
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,270
The lady in yellow

384
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,030
is the Duke of Hu's only daughter,

385
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,440
Song Qingping, much favored

386
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,510
by the Eldest Princess.

387
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,510
The elegant gentleman

388
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
is Song Wenchang's half-brother,

389
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,000
Song Shilan.

390
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,080
The three of them

391
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,550
grew up together.

392
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,720
But it's changed now.

393
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,150
Yun,

394
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,960
this is the gift

395
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,880
I personally chose for you.

396
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,800
Come on, carry it inside.

397
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,480
Careful with your steps.

398
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,750
Lift it.

399
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,680
Higher. Yes.

400
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,520
Look out.

401
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,240
Slowly, yes.

402
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,240
Look, that is...

403
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,160
General Wei,

404
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,600
my brother

405
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,240
spent a whole day choosing

406
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,750
and crafting this himself.

407
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,590
He really put

408
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,110
his heart into it.

409
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,910
Do you see it?

410
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,590
This is the gift

411
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,960
I, Song Wenchang,

412
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,800
prepared for General Wei.

413
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,000
Guess what's inside.

414
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,280
(True Might)
what's inside

415
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,070
to match his status?

416
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,960
Must be quite the treasure.

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,000
I will never

418
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,110
give ordinary gifts.

419
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,550
You're Lady Chu Yu?

420
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,800
Yes.

421
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,310
I didn't get to greet you earlier.

422
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,560
No matter.

423
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,720
I came to thank you.

424
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,680
I heard you helped a lot

425
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,960
with the Crown Prince issue.

426
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,750
I'll reconsider

427
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,000
my marriage with him.

428
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,630
Lady Chu Yu,

429
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,440
you can call me Tuantuan.

430
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,030
Tuantuan.

431
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,960
Hiding it so mysteriously,

432
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,720
is it made of gold?

433
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,670
Don't rush.

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
A moment like this

435
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,240
needs some buildup.

436
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,550
Stop teasing.

437
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,400
Open it already.

438
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,000
It's just a rockery?

439
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,750
What do you mean "just" a rockery?

440
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
There's

441
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,240
great meaning behind it.

442
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,550
This golden miniature mountain

443
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,640
- Actually a rockery?
- symbolizes

444
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,830
my hopes for General Wei:

445
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,510
that he stands firm like Mt. Tai,

446
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,550
unshaken

447
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,400
in hardship,

448
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,750
and even if he falls,

449
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,200
he can rise again.

450
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,750
Congratulations, General Wei.

451
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,870
Yun, since I

452
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,310
learned you'd succeed the marquisate,

453
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,070
I ordered this made

454
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,270
in the likeness of Mt. Tai.

455
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,750
I wish you steadiness

456
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,590
and strength

457
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,000
as the Zhenguo Marquis.

458
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,670
Do you like it?

459
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,680
Today is a thank-you banquet.

460
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Marquisate?

461
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,590
We waited half the day

462
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,920
and saw no title bestowed.

463
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,550
Such a waste of my time.

464
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,310
Such a pretty girl,

465
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
why so sour-tongued?

466
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,110
Who are you?

467
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
My sister.

468
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
So you're the famed

469
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,960
first beauty of Huajing,

470
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,200
Lady Chu.

471
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,160
But what you said isn't quite right.

472
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,190
Jin,

473
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,510
what did I just tell you?

474
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
What's wrong with me telling the truth?

475
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,790
Lady Chu Jin, huh?

476
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,550
Let me broaden your horizons.

477
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,640
Are you still my friend or not?

478
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,400
When will you show up already?

479
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,200
His Highness the Crown Prince arrives!

480
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

481
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,000
Rise.

482
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,630
Wei Yun,

483
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,350
receive the decree.

484
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,720
By Heaven's mandate, the Emperor

485
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,440
confers upon Wei Yun,

486
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,030
for his talent,

487
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,440
virtue,

488
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,790
and loyal service,

489
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,270
the title of Marquis of Zhenguo

490
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,590
of the Great Sui,

491
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
grants him the Fish Tally,

492
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,310
and appoints him

493
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,130
Commander of

494
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,310
the Arsenal Bureau.

495
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,920
(Imperial Edict)
He'll supervise the Bureau.

496
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,550
Thus decreed.

497
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,640
I, Wei Yun,

498
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
receive the decree

499
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,400
and thank His Majesty.

500
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,510
(This is the Fish Tally to enter
the Arsenal Bureau.)

501
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,800
I know

502
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,240
you now favor the civil faction

503
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,680
led by Duke of Ning.

504
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,330
But since his accession, His Majesty

505
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
has always sought to balance civil
and military power.

506
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
You knowingly break this balance,

507
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,490
forming factions for private gain.

508
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,830
If His Majesty learns of it...

509
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,950
That's right.

510
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,790
You might lose your position

511
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,400
as the Crown Prince.

512
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm his only son.

513
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,270
What, will Father depose me?

514
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,790
His Majesty won't remove the heir,

515
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,030
but you haven't inherited the throne yet.

516
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,550
Great Sui is still His Majesty's.

517
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,750
If you continue to favor civil over military,

518
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,160
once you inherit the throne...

519
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,590
Among the generals,

520
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,160
only the Wei clan

521
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,590
can still deter foreign enemies.

522
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
If they decline as well,

523
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,310
and Great Sui and North Qi

524
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,200
go to war again,

525
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,520
Your Highness

526
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,550
will have to lead the army yourself.

527
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,030
Please think carefully.

528
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,900
Whether the Wei clan survives

529
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,750
depends entirely on Your Highness.

530
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,190
Your Highness,

531
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,160
about General Wei going to Fragrance House

532
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,240
during his mourning period,

533
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,550
can this matter be dismissed?

534
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,960
As for the Marquis visiting

535
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,280
Fragrance House while in mourning,

536
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,630
His Majesty has investigated.

537
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,830
It was a misunderstanding.

538
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,550
It was...

539
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,720
Mr. Song who

540
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,550
caused trouble there,

541
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,880
and the Marquis

542
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,310
stepped in

543
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,550
only to help

544
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,000
a friend.

545
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,280
You should

546
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,310
bear the blame, not him.

547
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,150
Mr. Song,

548
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,590
isn't that right?

549
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,480
Yes.

550
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,830
Yes, of course.

551
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,760
Yun,

552
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,800
it's all my fault.

553
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,310
I was young and foolish.

554
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
I caused trouble

555
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,200
and made you clean up after me.

556
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,590
And now

557
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,310
it's blown up into this huge joke.

558
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,190
Thankfully His Majesty

559
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,110
saw the truth

560
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,320
and cleared your name,

561
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,830
or I'd feel

562
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,200
terrible.

563
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,200
Since you know

564
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,720
you're ignorant

565
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,270
and idle,

566
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,200
you should

567
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,590
improve yourself.

568
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,640
If there's another "misunderstanding,"

569
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,550
forget Father,

570
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,680
I won't spare you either.

571
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,040
(For my friend,)

572
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,240
(I'll endure this.)

573
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,880
(What can you do to me?)

574
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,750
Thank you for the warning, Your Highness.

575
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,070
Didn't expect I'd end up taking all the blame.

576
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,510
I don't care, Yun.

577
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,840
I treat you so well,

578
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,830
you'd better treat me well too.

579
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,110
Thanks,

580
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,520
my friend.

581
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Anytime.

582
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,720
Marquis.

583
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,460
(Defend the nation and the throne)

584
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,660
(True Might)

585
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Congratulations, Marquis.

586
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,920
Today I receive His Majesty's favor,

587
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,750
inherit the duty of my forebears,

588
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,590
don armor,

589
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,030
defend the realm.

590
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,310
I offer this wine

591
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,040
to honor my ancestors

592
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,520
and to all of you.

593
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,310
May the world know peace

594
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,310
and live in clarity.

595
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,720
Today, I helped the Wei Mansion

596
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,880
by creating the right moment,

597
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,590
a congratulatory gift of sorts.

598
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,510
Are you satisfied, Chu Yu?

599
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,560
My thanks, Your Highness.

600
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,680
I should leave now.

601
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
Huan,

602
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,510
come with me.

603
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

604
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,720
No need.

605
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,750
The flowers in Qinxi Valley are in full bloom.

606
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,640
I'm going to enjoy them.

607
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,510
Goodbye, Your Highness.

608
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,270
Your Highness.

609
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,800
(True Might)
- A toast to you.

610
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,840
- Everyone.
- Cheers.

611
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,190
General Chu.

612
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,790
- Mr. Song.
- Yun.

613
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,960
- Linyang.
- Yu.

614
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,800
Thank you.

615
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
Linyang,

616
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,200
you must drink more today.

617
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,630
Alright.

618
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,670
Marquis Wei.

619
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,320
Come on.

620
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,110
Congratulations.

621
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,840
Chu Yu,

622
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,400
did you marry into the Wei family

623
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,310
to investigate a case?

624
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,510
If so,

625
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,660
I'm now Minister of Justice,

626
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,060
I can help you.

627
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,140
I went through all the files

628
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,420
on Lord of Qin's treason case

629
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,460
and found shocking things,

630
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,020
very likely

631
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,340
tied to the Chu

632
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,460
and Wei families.

633
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,780
This isn't the place to talk.

634
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,900
The Lord of Qin treason case

635
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,900
was over twenty years ago.

636
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,890
Why do you want to investigate?

637
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,820
Have you forgotten

638
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,820
why I was exiled?

639
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,780
Six years ago,

640
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,140
the Gu family was implicated.

641
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,860
To save my life, my father

642
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,220
took the blame.

643
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,020
With General Chu's plea,

644
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,380
I was

645
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
only exiled.

646
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,820
You mean

647
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,780
there was more to the case?

648
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,460
When Lord of Qin traveled south,

649
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,780
he fell in love with a woman.

650
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,140
She later bore him a son.

651
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,860
He promised her happiness,

652
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
but after he returned,

653
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,620
he was accused of colluding with North Qi.

654
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,900
During the investigation,

655
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,380
that woman took Great Sui's

656
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,860
secrets and fled back to North Qi,

657
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,860
causing three of our cities

658
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,940
to fall into their hands.

659
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,660
Since then,

660
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,220
many of our people have been

661
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,820
unable to return home.

662
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,460
(Lord of Qin case file)

663
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,780
(The woman was North Qi's Princess Yunyang)

664
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,580
(Leaked military plans to the enemy)

665
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,860
So

666
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,740
she deceived Lord of Qin.

667
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,700
She was

668
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,340
Princess Yunyang of North Qi,

669
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,420
and her child

670
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,500
returned to North Qi with her.

671
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,060
If Lord of Qin was framed,

672
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,100
your father was framed too.

673
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,860
Though it's been fifteen years,

674
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,820
all of this could've been

675
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,380
North Qi's scheme.

676
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,860
North Qi has never stopped coveting Great Sui.

677
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,980
They're cunning

678
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,940
and ruthless,

679
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,060
willing to pay any price

680
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,540
to devour us.

681
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,060
The battle at Baidi Valley

682
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,180
was suspicious.

683
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,260
Surely you came to the Wei family

684
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,780
trying to uncover something.

685
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,740
Gu Chusheng,

686
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,900
when the Chu family fell,

687
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,420
was there not something strange?

688
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,820
And do you remember

689
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,580
it was my father who pleaded

690
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,860
for yours in court?

691
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,020
How can you forget that case?

692
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,860
I didn't forget it.

693
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,660
If I hadn't gone to the Court,

694
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,180
I wouldn't know any of this.

695
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,100
- Now it's still...
- It's too late.

696
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,660
Who is it?

697
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,060
Open the door!

698
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,220
Someone is targeting us!

699
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,460
Narcotic Incense...

700
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,460
Stay away from me.

701
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,580
Mr. Gu,

702
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,860
your beauty is with you.

703
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,300
That's as far as I help you.

704
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
I may be low,

705
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,700
but not this vile.

706
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,260
Yu...

707
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,700
I was careless.

709
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,340
Jin,

710
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,780
I have something big to tell you.

711
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,060
You always hated

712
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,900
that Chu Yu, right?

713
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,700
Today I avenged you.

714
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,980
I drugged Chu Yu

715
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,660
and locked her in a room with Mr. Gu.

716
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,900
Is that true?

717
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,460
She bullied you before,

718
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,900
so today I paid her back in full.

719
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,260
Everyone,

720
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,300
everyone!

721
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,900
I just went to the backyard

722
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,500
and saw something

723
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,260
indescribable.

724
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,740
Interested?

725
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,900
Come with me!

726
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,380
Well...

727
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,380
- Let's go.
- Let's see.

728
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,220
We should take a look.

729
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,100
Let's go.

730
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,940
Who would've thought

731
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,140
someone would have a secret tryst

732
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
at the Young Marquis's banquet?

733
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,580
Society is truly decaying.

734
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,460
Good thing I was quick

735
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,940
and locked them inside.

736
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,980
What are you waiting for?

737
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,860
Open the door!

738
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,260
Go on.

739
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,660
Young Master Sun,

740
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,380
must you push this so far?

741
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,180
Today's

742
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Marquis Wei's banquet,

743
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,980
making a scene

744
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,700
helps no one.

745
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
General Chu, you're wrong.

746
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,740
If we let this go,

747
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,380
we'll only encourage corruption.

748
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,900
Why are you stopping me?

749
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,900
Do you know something?

750
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,540
Young Master Sun,

751
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,180
what are you looking for?

752
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,100
Impossible!

753
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,140
I swear there were two people.

754
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,260
Jin,

755
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,380
I was not lying!

756
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,140
What are you saying?

757
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,420
What does this have to do with me?

758
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,260
But...

759
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,180
Here's what happened:

760
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,620
Just now,

761
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
I was tired,

762
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,260
so after urging the dishes,

763
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,780
I came here to rest.

764
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,100
But the door

765
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,900
suddenly locked.

766
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,220
Could this be

767
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,820
Young Master Sun's doing?

768
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
Trying to ruin my reputation

769
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,420
with nothing but words?

770
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,740
That's right!

771
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,100
We can all testify for Yu.

772
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,860
- Yes!
- Impossible!

773
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,580
There were two people.

774
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,660
I saw it with my own eyes!

775
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,500
How did you stand up?

776
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,780
What are you implying?

777
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,940
If I don't stand,

778
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,700
what posture should I use

779
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,580
to face everyone?

780
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,940
Innocent people are fearless.

781
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,740
If you don't believe me,

782
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,580
search all you want.

783
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,340
But if you find nothing,

784
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,940
don't blame me for being rude.

785
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,740
Impossible!

786
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,840
There were definitely two people!

787
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,700
Wei Qiu.

788
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,940
Here!

789
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,300
Young Master Sun spread rumors

790
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,620
and caused trouble

791
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,860
at Marquis Wei's succession banquet.

792
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,460
Such disruption,

793
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,060
where does that put our lord's dignity?

794
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,540
Take him

795
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,820
to the magistrate.

796
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,380
- Yes.
- Wait!

797
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,260
- Move!
- No!

798
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,100
There were two people!

799
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,980
Believe me!

800
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,180
Please believe me!

801
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,580
Yu.

802
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,580
It was all a misunderstanding.

803
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,740
Chun,

804
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,860
look after the guests.

805
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,340
I need some rest.

806
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,940
Everyone, please.

807
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,020
Yu.

808
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,020
Give me some time, Linyang.

809
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,260
But you...

810
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,100
I'm fine.

811
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
Jin,

812
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,740
come with me.

813
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,620
What's so special about this place

814
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,940
that keeps Tuantuan lingering so long?

815
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,900
Don't tell me

816
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,140
you fancy Marquis Wei

817
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,820
and can't bear to leave.

818
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,620
Just now whose eyes

819
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,390
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
were fixed on Lady Chu Jin?

820
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,980
Shilan called you three times

821
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,940
before you came out.

822
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,940
Now you're projecting onto others?

823
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,500
I am nearly

824
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
twenty.

825
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,340
Shouldn't I focus on

826
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,420
my future marriage?

827
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,740
Tuantuan, you are simply regretful

828
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,580
that you couldn't take the pulse

829
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,990
of Lady Chu, who suddenly felt unwell.

830
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,100
Only Shilan understands me.

831
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,660
Chu Yu helped me out,

832
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,020
and I did nothing for her.

833
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,180
Our brother and Marquis Wei

834
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,020
are close.

835
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,340
You'll have

836
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,500
plenty of chances to repay

837
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,580
Lady Chu Yu.

838
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,460
Come on.

839
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,660
Linyang, walk slowly.

840
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,620
My foot hurts.

841
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,100
Linyang.

842
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,340
Linyang!

843
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,580
Young Master Sun did that.

844
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,740
It had nothing to do

845
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,660
with me.

846
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,940
I already scolded him!

847
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,420
Linyang,

848
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,380
I swear

849
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,020
I'll cut ties with him from now on.

850
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,140
I did everything I could.

851
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,940
Linyang, please don't ignore me.

852
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,580
One should not make their family look bad.

853
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,420
You seem to forget,

854
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,780
but I haven't.

855
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,500
We'll

856
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,740
settle this at home.

857
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,840
General Chu.

858
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,980
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)
I went

859
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,940
to several clinics

860
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,780
nearby.

861
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,940
It's too late,

862
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,260
the physicians

863
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,100
can't come.

864
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,460
Should I

865
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,940
try farther?

866
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,040
Brother, my medical box.

867
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,900
Okay.

868
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,740
General Chu.

869
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,340
Lady Song.

870
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,300
General,

871
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,020
are you looking for a doctor

872
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,180
to treat Lady Chu Yu?

873
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,020
I know some medicine,

874
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,860
perhaps I can help.

875
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,420
It's so late,

876
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,620
will this be too much a trouble for you?

877
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,660
Not at all.

878
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,500
Treating Lady Chu Yu

879
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,860
is never a trouble.

880
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,780
Why are you back again?

881
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,860
Seeing off guests

882
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,620
is handled by Chun and the others.

883
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,580
And I hid the fact

884
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,860
that you were drugged.

885
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,660
So,

886
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
I couldn't just

887
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,500
leave you alone.

888
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,740
Don't worry,

889
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,860
I'm not bored enough

890
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,580
to come back just to laugh at you.

891
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,940
If you didn't want to watch a joke,

892
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,420
why did I end up trapped

893
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,020
by Young Master Sun?

894
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,940
If you hadn't let your brother hold me off,

895
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,940
how would Sun have succeeded?

896
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,380
Besides,

897
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,580
didn't I help you get Gu Chusheng away?

898
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,500
You took him away

899
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,340
to protect

900
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,700
your family's reputation,

901
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,420
not for me.

902
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,020
You're part of the Wei family now.

903
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,700
Its reputation

904
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,460
is yours too.

905
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,300
Where did you take him?

906
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,700
Father clearly said

907
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,780
we shouldn't attend the banquet.

908
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,700
Why did you come?

909
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,300
And

910
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,060
why did Marquis Wei

911
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,100
tell me to "watch you carefully"

912
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,060
when he put you in the carriage?

913
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,540
What did you do?

914
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,500
Looks like, true or false,

915
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,580
you and Chu Yu

916
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,020
will always

917
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,660
be tangled.

918
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,940
I

919
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,020
am always the outsider.

920
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,500
Don't overthink.

921
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,100
Look at you.

922
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,500
How can I not?

923
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,420
Since you

924
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,580
admit I'm part of the Wei family,

925
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,340
you won't refuse

926
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,700
a small request like escorting me

927
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,620
back to my room, right?

928
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,860
In my arms

929
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,500
or on my back?

930
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,900
Can I choose neither?
