00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,200
Madam. Don't, Madam.

22
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,710
Don't do this, Madam.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Madam!

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,790
Madam.

25
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,630
- Chun.
- Chun.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
- Chun.
- Chun.

27
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
- Chun.
- Chun.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Chun, are you all right?

29
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,790
- No.
- Chun.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Let me go.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Chun.

32
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,640
How could you

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,920
do something so foolish?

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,840
On my wedding day, I sprained my ankle.

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,190
He noticed that

36
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,630
and carried me all the way back.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
He even wiped my foot
with medicinal liquor.

38
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,800
If I hadn't experienced love,

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,870
I'd surrender to fate.

40
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,750
But I once had

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,710
such a wonderful man.

42
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,120
I can't spend the rest of my life alone.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
Let me go.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,910
Chun. Chun.

45
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,590
Chun!

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,800
If your death could restart everything,

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,030
we would not stop you.

48
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,960
But what you're doing

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,400
will only bring us trouble.

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,590
It won't help at all.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,470
No matter who dies,

52
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,680
life must move on.

53
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,270
That's not true.

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
That's not.

55
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,590
Let me go.

56
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,470
Dying is easy.

57
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,120
But what about Lingchun?

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Lingchun.

59
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,990
Lingchun, my son.

60
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,190
You and Shu loved each other.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,630
Lingchun has lived happily
since he was born.

62
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,120
Suddenly, he lost his father.

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,520
How could you let him
lose his mother too?

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
Chun.

65
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,150
All men in our family

66
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,000
are unyielding.

67
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,800
Your husband not only defended

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,310
our nation and its people.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,360
He also wanted you to be carefree.

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Chun,

71
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,800
you are his wife

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
and madam of the second branch.

73
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,870
My eldest son never married.

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
So, you're just like

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
my eldest daughter-in-law.

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,680
You've been taking care of this family

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,310
and haven't put a foot wrong.

78
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,160
(Wei)
Now,

79
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm entrusting you
with the Commanding Jade Seal

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
of this family.

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,310
Hope you will not

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,080
(Wei)
let me down.

83
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,430
Chun.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
- Madam.
- Chun.

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,640
Mother,

86
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,750
I won't do such a foolish thing again.

87
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,630
I promise you.

88
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,590
Unless I'm dead,

89
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,390
I will always protect this family.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
Don't cry, Chun.

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,120
- Mother.
- Don't.

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,430
Mother.

93
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,590
Chun.

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
(Wei Yun,)

95
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,800
(you didn't protect your family.)

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
(You're in no position to comfort them.)

97
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,590
Chu Yu.

98
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,590
What on earth

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,110
do you want from us?

100
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
What do you mean?

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,680
My big brother is dead.

102
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,040
But you're determined to be his widow.

103
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,000
What on earth

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
are you up to?

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,510
What if I simply like Wei Jun?

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Others may

107
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,630
buy that lie.

108
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,560
But you won't fool me.

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,150
You made a scene
at the Spring Breeze House

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,590
and you came here today.

111
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,040
You've been plotting this all along.

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,000
Is it for my big brother

113
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,000
or actually for this family?

114
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,350
Wei Yun,

115
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,270
instead of suspecting my purpose,

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,870
why don't you think

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,750
about how you can get justice

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,630
for your lost family and dead soldiers?

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Yun.

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Back in there,

121
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,620
you saved Chun in time.

122
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,630
I had my reservations about you.

123
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
- Now...
- Mother.

124
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
Don't let her fool you.

125
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,000
Stop being so rude to her.

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,760
I'm going to the mourning hall.

127
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,120
Yun is

128
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,040
in great distress.

129
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
If he comes off as offensive,

130
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,120
please don't mind.

131
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,910
I won't.

132
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not easy for you to trust me.

133
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,350
And anyway,

134
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,680
Wei Yun had a narrow escape

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
from the battlefield.

136
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,920
I have something to say as well.

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
You're a different daughter-in-law.

138
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,720
My eldest son

139
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,430
didn't marry you

140
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
with a formal wedding.

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,750
After the funeral,

142
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,720
you can think it through.

143
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,000
You're free to go home anytime.

144
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,950
Do not waste

145
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,360
your youth here.

146
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,270
All right.

147
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll think it through

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,950
and let you know.

149
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Before, Brother and I

150
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
tried really hard,

151
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,480
only to find out about a mountain.

152
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,630
You think you can get more information

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
by simply rummaging around?

154
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,480
I was just trying to see

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
what I could do to help.

156
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,360
You must not touch

157
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,350
Mr. Wei Jun's stuff.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,840
Since Father died,

159
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,120
I've locked up

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,960
his study.

161
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,150
Everything in there

162
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,440
is kept the way it was.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
Every time I see it,

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,750
I feel as if he were still around me.

165
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,670
Mr. Wei Jun was upright and honest.

166
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,510
Pretend I'm doing the same

167
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,870
for his own brother.

168
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,560
What's wrong?

169
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,470
Let me see.

170
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,150
How did it end up like this?

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
You leave it alone.

172
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,630
Does it hurt?

173
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,870
It's the first day you've been here

174
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
and you're already hurt.

175
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,030
What's going to happen in the future?

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
My Lady,

177
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,290
what are your plans?

178
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,040
We'll help them through this crisis.

179
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,900
They're in such big trouble.

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,300
Maybe it's related

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,340
to the leak of the octagonal crossbow.

182
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,020
I'm at the center of the vortex

183
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,300
and I have to be involved.

184
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,140
Otherwise, I will be consumed by it.

185
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,300
But I see General Wei Yun

186
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,300
press you really hard.

187
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,420
I'm afraid

188
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,940
you will have a really hard time

189
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,340
in this mansion.

190
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,980
I'm worried that...

191
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,260
Don't worry.

192
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,580
Mr. Wei Jun just died in battle.

193
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,060
I suddenly

194
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,820
became his widow.

195
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,260
If I were Wei Yun,

196
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,340
I'd be suspicious too.

197
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,700
Once I find out the truth, I will leave.

198
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,340
I don't want to be a burden.

199
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
As for Wei Yun...

200
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,820
We'll cross that bridge

201
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,900
when we come to it.

202
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,300
(True Might)

203
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,020
Kneel.

204
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,900
Read the funeral oration

205
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,900
to tell their stories.

206
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,380
The 27th day of the 7th month

207
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
marked the border crisis.

208
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,300
My father, brothers, and I rushed there.

209
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,580
We fought for seven days and nights

210
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,860
before repelling the enemy.

211
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,660
That night, we drank.

212
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,620
My brothers and I

213
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,100
got drunk on the city tower.

214
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,660
I was too young

215
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,180
to know the life meaning.

216
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,660
So, I asked my brothers

217
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,060
what they would wish for.

218
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,300
My big brother said

219
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,580
he wished for world peace

220
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,980
and justice everywhere.

221
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
My other brothers hailed.

222
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,900
I asked again,

223
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,700
"In case of world peace,

224
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,980
what will you want to do?"

225
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,940
(Wei's Ancestral Hall)

226
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,380
My brother smiled and replied,

227
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,060
"Watch the willows in spring.

228
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,100
Enjoy the snow in winter.

229
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,300
Drink with friends

230
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,940
and get drunk in the restaurant.

231
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,780
It's dangerous on the battlefield.

232
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,060
Yet it's romantic in Huajing City.

233
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,980
We're just ordinary guys.

234
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,180
Whatever happens,

235
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,420
we'll go back to loving families.

236
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,660
That's enough."

237
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,820
First come, first draw.

238
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,100
- Yun.
- Yun.

239
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,940
Don't cheat.

240
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,860
Father.

241
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,020
When will Yun

242
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,820
truly grow up?

243
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,660
Father, if he can always

244
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,100
remain so carefree,

245
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,580
isn't that great?

246
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,900
(Wei)

247
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,500
Raise the coffins!

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,690
Isn't he the Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review?

249
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,660
What's he doing here?

250
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,460
I'm Minister Cao Yan of the Court.

251
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,180
I was sent to get sinful Wei Yun.

252
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Mr. Cao,

253
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,380
what crime did I commit?

254
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,860
Your family overreached,

255
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,700
causing the death of 70,000 soldiers

256
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
in Baidi Valley.

257
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,020
Even in death,

258
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,540
they are held responsible.

259
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,180
Oh, I see.

260
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,420
All those soldiers

261
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,860
lost their lives in vain

262
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,060
just because of your family!

263
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,940
Thousands of our soldiers

264
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,460
spilled their blood

265
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,460
and gave their lives

266
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,140
to contribute for a century

267
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,460
to your family's glory.

268
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,900
How could you still be greedy?

269
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,940
The Weis are murderers.

270
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,460
Since Wei Yun is still alive,

271
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,620
hold him accountable.

272
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,100
- Hold him accountable!
- Hold him accountable!

273
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,060
We demand justice from the court!

274
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:23,940
We demand justice! We demand justice!

275
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,540
General Wei Yun,

276
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,100
did you hear?

277
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,740
This is what our people want.

278
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
I advise you

279
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,500
not to resist arrest.

280
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,860
Otherwise,

281
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,460
I'll have to be rude.

282
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,300
Yun.

283
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,140
It's him.

284
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,620
- It's him.
- It's him.

285
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,340
What are you doing? Stop it.

286
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,660
- Stop.
- Lan, be careful.

287
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,860
Stop it.

288
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,700
No.

289
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,540
That's not true.

290
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,620
You're to blame.

291
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,060
Our family isn't...

292
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,740
- Mother.
- Mother.

293
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,580
Mother.

294
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,860
Mr. Cao,

295
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,380
my father and brothers aren't buried.

296
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,620
Sorry, but right now,

297
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,780
I can't go with you.

298
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,300
That's not a problem.

299
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,060
Somebody.

300
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,700
Take these criminals' coffins

301
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,060
back to our court too.

302
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,060
Yes.

303
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,340
Wait.

304
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Mr. Cao,

305
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,660
when you enjoyed your life here,

306
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,220
Wei's 70,000 soldiers

307
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,900
were fighting a bloody battle

308
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,980
to defend our nation.

309
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,980
So, Mr. Cao,

310
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,300
please show some respect for them.

311
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,340
Let's not make a move

312
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,500
until they're buried.

313
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,740
Respect?

314
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,980
Ms. Chu,

315
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,300
take a close look.

316
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,780
What wood is used

317
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,380
for their coffins?

318
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,740
What patterns are on them?

319
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,580
And what paint is used?

320
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,060
The wood, patterns,

321
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,540
and paint are used

322
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,380
according to the ranking

323
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,620
of Marquis of Zhenguo and his sons.

324
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,020
Nothing is wrong.

325
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,060
Ridiculous.

326
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,540
Wei Zhong and his sons are sinful.

327
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,500
By law,

328
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,380
they can only be buried as commoners.

329
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,140
They don't deserve such good coffins.

330
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,140
- Somebody.
- Here.

331
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,620
Go to the east of town

332
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,220
and buy some ordinary coffins.

333
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,540
I'm being really generous.

334
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,300
Your family has collapsed.

335
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,780
These coffins

336
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,180
will be my present

337
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,420
for you.

338
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,620
Don't bother to thank me, General.

339
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Ms. Chu,

340
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,140
don't try to stop me anymore.

341
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,900
Go back home

342
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,660
and live with Wei Jun's tablet.

343
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,500
Cao Yan,

344
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
I dare you

345
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,980
to touch their coffins!

346
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,500
Guards.

347
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
Take out the bodies

348
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,140
of Wei Zhong and his sons.

349
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,980
Yes.

350
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,420
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

351
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
No.

352
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
Cao Yan!

353
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,380
If you hurt their bodies,

354
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,700
I will slaughter your entire family!

355
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,460
You don't know if or when my family

356
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,300
will be slaughtered.

357
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,900
But I know

358
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,980
every single one of yours

359
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,380
will die very soon.

360
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,940
- Wei Yun.
- Go away!

361
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,780
Yun.

362
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,100
Cao Yan,

363
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,900
don't go too far!

364
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
You wouldn't dare

365
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,180
to kill an official right here.

366
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,220
If you take one more step forward,

367
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,140
I will kill you!

368
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,380
I just did, so what?

369
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
Wei Yun.

370
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,380
No, Yun.

371
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,460
Yun.

372
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,100
No.

373
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,020
Don't do that.

374
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,700
Yun.

375
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,300
Cao Yan.

376
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,380
Why are you pushing us like this?

377
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,300
Trying to exterminate us?

378
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,300
Then, today,

379
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,180
I will kill myself

380
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,620
to clear our name.

381
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,900
My family

382
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,700
has a clear conscience.

383
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
Mother!

384
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,460
Mother!

385
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,540
Mother.

386
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,420
- Mother.
- Mother.

387
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
Mother.

388
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,020
Mother.

389
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,420
Mother.

390
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,420
Yun.

391
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,980
Don't cry.

392
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,620
A soldier seldom

393
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,260
gets to be with his wife in life

394
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,620
or see her in death.

395
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,420
Mother has to leave you alone.

396
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,580
I'm going to see your father.

397
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,380
Our family rule.

398
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,700
Our family rule.

399
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,620
Defend the nation and the throne.

400
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,780
Hold no regrets.

401
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,900
Mother.

402
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,260
Mother.

403
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,580
Mother.

404
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,860
Mother.

405
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,900
Mother!

406
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,940
This is the Wei family!

407
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Why did you do this

408
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,260
to this family of loyal heroes?

409
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,380
It's still in broad daylight.

410
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,580
Cao Yan,

411
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,180
you killed an innocent woman!

412
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,780
You killed an innocent woman!

413
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,100
What are you doing?

414
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,140
Mother demonstrated with her life

415
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,420
that we had a century-old reputation

416
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,620
and we would never attack an official.

417
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,340
So, we will

418
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,380
defend their coffins with our bodies.

419
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,140
None of us

420
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,660
will hurt our own people.

421
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
We must not fight.

422
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm here at the order of His Majesty.

423
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,900
Are you

424
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,100
trying to defy His Majesty?

425
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,940
How dare some wives of criminals

426
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,140
stand in my way?

427
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,420
Get out of my way.

428
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,140
Out of my way!

429
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,140
Move aside.

430
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,100
Get out of the way.

431
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,940
Don't move.

432
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,940
Cao Yan,

433
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,300
you're going too far!

434
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,900
Cao Yan, I dare you

435
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,100
to hurt these loyal people.

436
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,380
They defended our nation for ages.

437
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,980
How could you deny their contributions

438
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,980
just because of one mere defeat?

439
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,380
- We don't agree!
- Yeah.

440
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,380
We don't agree!

441
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,380
- We don't!
- We don't!

442
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,700
That's right.

443
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,420
You're hurting innocent people.

444
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,340
This is infuriating!

445
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,580
These stubborn people

446
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,020
are interfering.

447
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,100
Take them back too!

448
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,300
Let them go.

449
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,220
Let go!

450
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,740
Let go!

451
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,660
Let them go!

452
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,300
Let go! Let go!

453
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,220
Back off.

454
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,580
- Back off.
- Let go.

455
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,580
Cao Yan.

456
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,140
When you insulted me that day,

457
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,100
did you see this coming?

458
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,220
Let go.

459
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,820
Let go.

460
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,300
Cao Yan.

461
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,860
Let go!

462
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,740
Wei Yun,

463
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,660
what else are you trying to say?

464
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Don't hurt these people.

465
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,660
I'll go with you.

466
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,700
- General Wei Yun.
- Don't.

467
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,860
Yun.

468
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,780
- Don't.
- Just don't.

469
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,660
Yeah.

470
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,500
Are you sure?

471
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,340
Today, if you dare

472
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,300
to hurt anyone present,

473
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,620
I will kill you right here.

474
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,020
Try me, if you dare.

475
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,260
Take him.

476
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,100
Yes.

477
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,380
Cao Yan.

478
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,380
Grand Tutor.

479
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,660
(Xie Mingyi, the Grand Tutor)

480
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,500
Unshackle him.

481
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,340
Grand Tutor,

482
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,700
what do you mean?

483
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,740
How dare you be so impudent

484
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,140
in front of these loyal souls?

485
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,740
Cao Yan,

486
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,580
the Weis aren't convicted yet.

487
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,180
Even if they are,

488
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,540
they'll still be a noble family.

489
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,820
Unless His Majesty

490
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,740
strips away their nobility,

491
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,380
they're still the family
of Marquis of Zhenguo.

492
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,140
Rites and laws
are the emperor's prestige.

493
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,380
Do you

494
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,860
show no respect for His Majesty?

495
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
Grand Tutor,

496
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,580
you get me wrong.

497
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,740
His Majesty sent me.

498
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,940
If I can't bring back this sinful man,

499
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,660
I'm afraid I'll lose my life.

500
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,940
Do you have to rush
within just one hour?

501
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,700
Or are you actually

502
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,380
taking revenge for yourself?

503
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,660
I was too hasty.

504
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,460
Grand Tutor, please don't blame me.

505
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,860
I'm also concerned with rites and laws.

506
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,700
But I guess we understand them

507
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,740
in different ways.

508
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,820
In this case,

509
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,900
General Wei Yun...

510
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,740
You may proceed.

511
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,420
My men and I

512
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,740
will wait behind you.

513
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,820
Grand Tutor.

514
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,380
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of my family.

515
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,180
You...

516
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,500
- Thank you, Grand Tutor.
- Thank you.

517
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,780
Don't do this.

518
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,980
Get up now.

519
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,820
Don't do this.

520
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,500
Get up.

521
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,620
Since Mother died

522
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,980
for our father-in-law,

523
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,820
let's bury them in the same coffin.

524
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,240
Rest in peace, Your Lordship!

525
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,750
Rest in peace, generals!

526
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,240
Rest in peace, Your Lordship!

527
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,440
Rest in peace, generals!

528
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,020
Kneel.

529
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,380
Kowtow.

530
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,300
(Filial piety never fades.)

531
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,860
(Blessings linger forever.)

532
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,620
Kowtow again.

533
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,300
(Filial piety never fades.)

534
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,220
I, Wei Yun, hereby swear.

535
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,420
If I come back alive,

536
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,060
I will live up to your expectations.

537
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,940
I'll find out the truth,

538
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,820
protect our family,

539
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,220
and defend our nation.

540
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,220
General Wei Yun,

541
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,980
can we go now?

542
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,900
Cao Yan,

543
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,820
if you dare

544
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,900
to lay one finger on him,

545
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,980
we will become your sworn enemies.

546
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,740
Wei Yun.

547
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,220
Take care.

548
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,500
Even if you're up to something,

549
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,780
you don't need

550
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,900
to waste your life there.

551
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
Go back home.

552
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,420
You should worry about yourself.

553
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,420
Cao Yan won't let you off.

554
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,460
You'll have a hard time in prison.

555
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,780
Your family is in trouble.

556
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,940
I won't just stand by.

557
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,020
My sisters-in-law,

558
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,220
take care.

559
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,780
Yun.

560
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,740
Whoa, easy.

561
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,580
I just won't be.

562
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,940
So, you'll learn your lesson.

563
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,420
You should have protected yourself.

564
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,580
Why didn't you take me during the day?

565
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,220
Had I been there,

566
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,260
I could have protected you.

567
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,460
You?

568
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,820
You're so hot-tempered.

569
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,780
Had you been there,

570
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,340
you would have fought Cao Yan.

571
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,220
Messing with him

572
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
wouldn't do you any good.

573
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,100
I don't care.

574
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,420
Cao Yan is

575
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,380
a terrible guy, anyway.

576
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,780
General Wei Yun is in prison.

577
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,020
No one here can restrain us.

578
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,100
Let's search around

579
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,060
and then go back home.

580
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,340
We can't leave now.

581
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,380
And we must get Wei Yun out.

582
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,560
He lost his father and brothers.

583
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,500
Even his mother...

584
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,220
Anyone who feels sympathy

585
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,820
would step up like me.

586
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,060
My Lady,

587
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,500
did they remind you

588
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,660
of your own father?

589
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,980
We don't have

590
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,100
a family rule

591
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,700
to defend the nation or hold no regrets.

592
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,980
Father kept telling me

593
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,500
death was always a part of battle

594
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,500
and I should protect myself.

595
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,940
But everybody feels sympathy.

596
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,420
When I just came here yesterday,

597
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,780
I didn't understand.

598
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,020
But anyway,

599
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,900
they moved me.

600
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,220
In my opinion,

601
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,460
people defend this nation

602
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,300
in different ways.

603
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,740
But all in all,

604
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,700
they share the same goal.

605
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,100
Yeah.

606
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,500
Some wanted to live

607
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,220
but ended up dead.

608
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,340
There are always people
who sacrifice for justice.

609
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,300
Those people are heroes.

610
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,580
Since I can't be one of them,

611
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,740
I should protect them

612
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
from being insulted.

613
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,660
What happened today

614
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,100
hardened my resolve

615
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
to find out the truth

616
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,740
of the crossbow case.

617
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,980
But once we manage

618
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,260
to get General Wei Yun out,

619
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,780
won't it be harder

620
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,820
to investigate that case?

621
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,060
Only after I get Wei Yun out

622
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,260
can I feel more secure.

623
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,080
The Arsenal Bureau

624
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,800
is an important military site.

625
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,160
If Wei Yun is convicted

626
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,320
and his family falls,

627
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,320
the supervisor of the Arsenal Bureau

628
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,640
will be someone else.

629
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,480
Then, it'll be harder to sneak in.

630
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,400
For whatever reason,

631
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
I have to get Wei Yun out.

632
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,320
Then, My Lady,

633
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
have you come up with a plan?

634
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,960
(The Court of Judicial Review)

635
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,160
My Lord.

636
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,320
My Lord.

637
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Please let us out.

638
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
We're innocent.

639
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,000
My Lord.

640
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,680
My Lord.

641
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,200
It's stuffy in here.

642
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,680
In case you can hardly breathe,

643
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,480
I had you attended to first.

644
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,080
If looks could kill,

645
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm afraid

646
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,160
you'd have killed me a thousand times.

647
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,080
But under such circumstances,

648
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,480
even if I let you down,

649
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,360
would you dare to kill me?

650
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,680
You never had any conflict with us.

651
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,480
Someone must have ordered you,

652
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,320
so you dared to exterminate us.

653
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,080
We always handle a case

654
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,640
under the order of authorities.

655
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,840
But this time,

656
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,800
it's His Majesty who gave an order.

657
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,440
I don't think it's His Majesty.

658
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,280
It's...

659
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,440
The Duke of Ning.

660
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,640
If my family falls,

661
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,640
the one who benefits the most

662
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,320
will be the Duke of Ning,
head of the civil officials.

663
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Cao Yan,

664
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,800
His Majesty hates the clique thing most.

665
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,440
You're knowingly defying him.

666
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,680
You're truly Wei Zhong's son.

667
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,120
Wei Yun,

668
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,760
you're really clever.

669
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
But sadly,

670
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
even if you know the truth,

671
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,920
what can you do to me?

672
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,520
You don't think

673
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,320
you can leave alive,

674
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,600
do you?

675
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,040
Wei Yun,

676
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,120
your family got 70,000 soldiers killed.

677
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,520
Do you or do you not

678
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,760
plead guilty?

679
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,920
We are innocent.

680
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,800
Not guilty!

681
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
