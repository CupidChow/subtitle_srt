It smells amazing.

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,000
It's right out of the pot.

who pacified the northern border,

57

Didn't she once elope

73
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
with Academician Gu,

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,980
(Wei)
only to be abandoned

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,310
and become the laughingstock of Huajing?

76
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,240
And now, what is she doing?

77
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,990
Bravo!

78
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,660

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,240
blocks the road, could it be that,
after the Chu family's

82
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,130
fall, she's here to challenge

83
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,680
the Wei family out of resentment?

84
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,710
Lady Chu,

85
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,720
the Wei family returns victorious today.

86
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,560
Could you please

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
let us pass first?

Wei soldiers.

89

Come on.

90
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,920
Make way, make way!

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
Where's the rest of your family?

92
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,150
The rest?

93
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,750
What do you mean by that?

94
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,680
Are you waiting for someone?

95
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,100

(Gu Chusheng,
Senior Compiler of the Hanlin Academy)

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,870
Isn't that Academician Gu, the one

99
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,710
who abandoned her?

100
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,000
So she was waiting

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,040
for him.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,560
I am confronting him!

103
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
So what?

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,680
People say Academician Gu

105
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
is an upright official.

106
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,360
How can such a man be so faithless?

107
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,040
(Wei Qiu, Wei Yun's Guard)
You don't know what happened

108
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,080
between them.

109
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,120
Five years ago...

110
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,710
Gu,

111
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
I'll go with you

112
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,000
to the southwest border.

113
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,430
I'm being exiled.

114
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
You don't have to share my hardship.

115
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Gu Chusheng,

116
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,750
as long as I'm willing,

117
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,560
I'll brave anything.

118
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,880
I just ask,

119
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,120
do you dare take me with you?

120
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,040
I know we've separated.

121
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
But right now, you're the only one

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,570
I can turn to.

123
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,290
My father and brother are holding Fengling
to the last.

124
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,320
If the court doesn't send reinforcements,

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
they'll surely perish.

126
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm just an academician.

127
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,480
How could I influence His Majesty's decision?

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Gu Chusheng,

129
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,960
please, I beg you!

130
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Get up.

131
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,270
Please.

132
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,600
I beg you.

133
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,600
Save my father,

134
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
save my brother!

135
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,630
You're the only one I can ask!

136
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
Please.

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Court affairs

138
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,240
are not changed

139
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
by mere words from someone.

140
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,510
The Chu family can no longer help you

141
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,360
on the path you seek in the imperial service,

142
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,110
is that so?

143
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,200
And now it's the day

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,840
you marry into the Duke of Ning's

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
noble house.

146
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,720
Truly, fate loves its cruel jokes.

147
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,390
My lord,

148
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,080
I'll have this dealt with immediately.

149
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,180
(Zhang Deng, Gu Chusheng's Page Boy)
Your wedding will not be delayed!

150
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,360
What's Academician Gu doing?

151
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,840
He's going.

152
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,270
Why's he going up there?

153
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,120
What is he doing?

154
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
Now this will be interesting.

155
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,110
Chu Yu,

156
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,600
I know I wronged you.

157
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,960
But why ruin

158
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,800
your reputation

159
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,390
like this,

160
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,240
before everyone?

161
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,840
You're not one to cling to the past.

162
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,080
If so,

163
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,030
why stand here?

164
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,590
Do you mean

165
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,750
to personally persuade me

166
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,840
not to ruin my marriage?

167
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm standing here...

168
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm standing here to stop you.

169
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,910
Now that the Chu family has fallen,

170
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,790
you should find your own path.

171
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,320
As for me,

172
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,270
I have a future I must face.

173
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,280
There's no longer

174
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,080
anything between us.

175
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,470
Gu Chusheng,

176
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,720
should I say you know me,

177
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,320
or that you don't?

178
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,500
(Wei Jun, First Son of the Wei Family)

179
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,840
The Wei Army is amazing!

180
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,800
Look at their vigor and pride.

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
Yun,

182
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
Father sent you to deliver the good news.

183
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,890
The army

184
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,980
has finished assembling in camp

185
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,750
and awaits inspection.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,990
Yet you still haven't returned.

187
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,680
What are you doing here?

188
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Jun, look.

189
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,440
Today Academician Gu is getting married,

190
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,480
but Lady Chu is purposely

191
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
blocking him from Spring Breeze House.

192
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,030
The road into the city is jammed.

193
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,870
You can't get in.

194
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,960
Might as well watch the show here.

195
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,720
Sounds good.

196
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Usually it's all battles,

197
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,200
no show.

198
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,660
(Wei Ya, Fifth Son; Wei Feng, Fourth Son;
Wei Shu, Second Son)

199
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,540
(Wei Qin, Third Son; Wei Rong, Sixth Son)

200
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,630
The Wei Army is glorious!

201
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
The Wei Army is glorious!

202
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,200
Jun, just watch a little.

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,870
The Wei Army is glorious!

204
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,710
Indeed,

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,870
I'm never one to cling to the past.

206
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,440
How do you know

207
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,360
I came for you?

208
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,350
The Wei Army is glorious!

209
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,740
Look!

210
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,700
(Fair gentleman!)

211
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,980
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's)

212
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,640
Chu Yu, enough.

213
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,480
Stop it right now.

214
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,640
Academician Gu,

215
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,560
today is your wedding day.

216
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,750
If you stay here,

217
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,470
aren't you afraid the Duke of Ning will notice?

218
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,180
What gentleman?

219
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,060
What good mate?

220
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,300
Jun, Jun,

221
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,660
what does this mean?

222
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,060
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's good mate.)

223
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,340
It reads,

224
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,700
"Fair gentleman!

225
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,850
Sweet lady's good mate."

226
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
Today I have come for

227
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,180
Young General Wei Jun.

228
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,330
- Me?
- Yes.

229
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,460
I've long admired

230
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,540
your bravery.

231
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,610
I'm no noblewoman, but I learned

232
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,820
martial arts as a child.

233
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,340
If war breaks out,

234
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,700
I can go to battle with you.

235
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,010
Do I deserve you

236
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,250
in your eyes?

237
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,300
So it was for Jun.

238
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:07,970
Jun,

239
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,610
Lady Chu put on

240
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,850
such a show

241
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,610
for you!

242
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,700
- Jun, Jun.
- Jun.

243
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,940
She did it for you.

244
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,340
At least give her an answer!

245
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,450
Yes.

246
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,700
Thank you for your favor, Lady Chu,

247
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,580
but I've pledged myself to the state.

248
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,580
I'm not the right match for you.

249
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,930
You said you're pledged

250
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,740
to the state,

251
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,740
but I am also a person of the state.

252
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,260
How could I not be your match?

253
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,170
If you care about

254
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,010
gossip,

255
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,130
I will say this:

256
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,770
Chu Yu is a Chu.

257
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,530
Though her house fell,

258
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,130
the martial spirit remains unchanged.

259
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,620
Report! Northwest General

260
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,890
(Fengling City)
Chu Jianchang

261
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,050
has fallen at Fengling City.

262
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,530
General Chu Linyang

263
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,860
is gravely wounded.

264
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,120
(Sui)

265
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,260
Lady Chu, rest assured.

266
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,980
I never believed

267
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,100
those rumors.

268
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,980
Jun, do you know what you said

269
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,380
- means yes?
- Wanyue.

270
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,220
Here I am.

271
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,540
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's good mate.)

272
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,670
Young General Wei,

273
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,670
I await your reply.

274
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,710
Jun,

275
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,320
she's suspicious.

276
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,190
Seeing is believing.

277
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,800
A woman revealing her feelings

278
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,640
is rare.

279
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,350
Lady Chu's boldness

280
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,990
earns my respect.

281
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,400
Yun,

282
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,710
where is the thing

283
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,640
fell from the pedals?

284
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,680
I never meant to hide it.

285
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,430
Here.

286
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,630
Lady Chu, rest assured.

287
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,910
I will

288
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,830
give you

289
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,760
a satisfactory answer.

290
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,830
Good. I'll be waiting.

291
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,190
Let's go.

292
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,700
(Chu Mansion)

293
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,070
Does Gu Chusheng

294
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,390
really think

295
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,000
we came for him today?

296
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,480
What a narrow road for enemies.

297
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,280
Who could've known his wedding

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,590
would nearly ruin my plan?

299
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,670
Exactly.

300
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,240
She acts shameless

301
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,080
and indecent!

302
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,910
I'll be dragged down with her.

303
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,280
How will I be able to

304
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
go out now?

305
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,350
My Lady, keep your voice down.

306
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,830
Don't let your sister hear.

307
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,260
(Chu Jin, Second Daughter of the Chu Family)

308
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,480
I don't want such a sister!

309
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,340
She's shamed the entire Chu family.

310
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,520
Who are you cursing?

311
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,390
I'm cursing you!

312
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,070
You can be shameless all you want,

313
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,630
but doing something so disgraceful,

314
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,150
how are we supposed to live after this?

315
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,110
you're selfish.

316
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,950
You...

317
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,870
You should be afraid.

318
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,710
Remember,

319
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,780
misfortune comes from the mouth.

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,910
I'm tired today.

321
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,750
I won't argue.

322
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,670
Just watch your words from now on.

323
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,580
I'm not someone

324
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,420
to be trifled with.

325
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,470
As if I'd be afraid of you!

326
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,270
Lady Jin,

327
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,190
how can you hit My Lady?

328
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,980
Who asked you to speak?

329
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,470
So what if I hit her?

330
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,630
If you keep this up,

331
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,710
I won't be polite.

332
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,780
What? You'll hit me now?

333
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,260
You did wrong and

334
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,110
I can't even reprimand you?

335
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,750
Say that again!

336
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,820
I dare you!

337
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,740
Let go of me!

338
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,780
You're unreasonable!

339
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,980
I am unreasonable?

340
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,430
If you keep being so brazen,

341
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,020
- Let go!
- my fists will be the law.

342
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,510
- Let go!
- Do you understand?

343
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,610
(Xie Yun, Old Madam of Chu Family)
What is it?

344
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,480
Are you wrecking the house?

345
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,370
Are you all right?

346
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,910
Mother.

347
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,230
What happened?

348
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,500
Chu Yu hit me!

349
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,190
- Are you alright?
- Always pretending.

350
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,110
Mother,

351
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,500
I only said she disregarded

352
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,740
the Chu family's honor,

353
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,460
she tried to beat me

354
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,740
nearly to death.

355
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,430
When did I ever try to kill you?

356
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,430
Wasn't it you who

357
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,700
first smashed a cup at me?

358
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,220
If I hadn't held back,

359
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
you'd be dead already.

360
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,270
Sister, you're skilled in arms,

361
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,380
how could I offend you?

362
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,980
Just now, if I hadn't struggled,

363
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,180
I'd have been killed.

364
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,380
I had no choice but to fight back.

365
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,940
And you still dare to lie.

366
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,150
Madam,

367
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,830
I clearly saw it.

368
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,270
Lady Jin struck first

369
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,110
and hit Lady Yu.

370
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,590
You are her maid,

371
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,870
of course you'll defend her.

372
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,710
Enough.

373
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,420
Even if your sister was wrong,

374
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,830
shouldn't you give way?

375
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
You grew up with your father

376
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,570
and brother on the frontier

377
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,410
and got used to freedom.

378
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,720
I thought after coming to Huajing

379
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,090
you'd become sensible,

380
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,810
but you don't

381
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,010
want to be a proper

382
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,880
noble lady.

383
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,680
You disgrace yourself

384
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,960
in public.

385
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,960
Have you considered the Chu family's honor?

386
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,960
So what if your sister hit you?

387
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,570
Didn't you deserve it?

388
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,610
You didn't even ask me

389
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,200
why I did that today.

390
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,400
And you judged me

391
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
based only on Chu Jin's word.

392
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,200
Jin spoke the truth.

393
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,370
You'll never believe me.

394
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,290
Fine.

395
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,130
I'm used to it.

396
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,330
Think what you like.

397
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,850
I won't change anyway.

398
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,880
- Look at her!
- Madam.

399
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
She...

400
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,330
You're too biased.

401
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,920
This... This makes me furious.

402
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,160
Mother, it's all my fault.

403
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,370
I shouldn't have angered her.

404
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,230
(Chu Linyang, First Son of the Chu Family)

405
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,330
Seeing you pick up the spear

406
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,570
and display the Chu spearwork

407
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,880
puts me at ease.

408
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,120
After more than half a year of recovery,

409
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,520
my health

410
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,920
is fine now.

411
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,130
That's good.

412
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,850
What's wrong?

413
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,290
Still angry at Mother and Jin?

414
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,050
I'm used to it.

415
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,480
Jin

416
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,530
grew up by Mother's side.

417
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,090
If Mother is sometimes unfair,

418
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,410
it's understandable.

419
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,410
Give her time.

420
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,050
She'll come to understand you.

421
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,760
Honestly,

422
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,050
why are you getting close

423
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,770
to Wei Jun?

424
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,750
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

425
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,770
What I did today was out of desperation.

426
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,040
Please keep it secret.

427
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,530
If you forgive me,

428
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,200
meet me at the pavilion

429
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,810
in the eastern woods at dusk.

430
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,880
So, it seems

431
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,090
you weren't angered by me

432
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,930
after all.

433
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,570
At first,

434
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,810
you nearly fooled me.

435
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,130
But I know

436
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,480
General Chu has just fallen for the country.

437
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,120
You must observe three years of mourning.

438
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
The Chu family can hold no celebrations
during this.

439
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,720
Your public confession

440
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,960
was only to divert suspicion.

441
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,440
Have you not heard the rumors

442
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,330
that I chase men in vain

443
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,530
and long to marry into nobility?

444
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,010
The city says Lady Chu is improper

445
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,050
and rebellious.

446
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,350
But I

447
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,580
don't believe so.

448
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,520
When you accompanied Gu Chusheng,

449
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,570
that was an act of loyalty.

450
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,290
Few are so true

451
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,290
and faithful.

452
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,160
People simply

453
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,290
repeat false tales.

454
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,850
Besides, today,

455
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,440
I've seen the truth

456
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,400
outside Spring Breeze House.

457
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,640
Lady Chu, forgive me.

458
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,810
I didn't mean to mention

459
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,650
Gu Chusheng.

460
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,610
There's no need for you to apologize.

461
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,770
If anything,

462
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,290
I should say sorry to you.

463
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,810
My drastic move today

464
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,770
was because I have something

465
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,090
I need your help investigating.

466
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,610
Please, speak.

467
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,160
During the battle at Fengling, my father

468
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,810
was killed

469
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,480
by the North Qi army, using a strange

470
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,400
new crossbow.

471
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,250
My brother was badly injured as well.

472
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,250
When I pressed him,

473
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,090
he said

474
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,640
the weapon's power

475
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,480
was immense,

476
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
its mechanism fired instantly,

477
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,610
with no need for manual winding.

478
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,320
I think

479
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,130
you must know

480
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,370
this crossbow

481
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,210
better than I do.

482
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,290
(Chu)
This is the Chu family's heirloom jade token.

483
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,720
I swear on my family,

484
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,290
every word I've said is true.

485
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,380
(Chu)
Why are you getting close

486
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,290
to Wei Jun?

487
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,090
After Fengling,

488
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,330
the Chu family was shattered.

489
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,330
North Qi's weapon craft

490
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,370
was never superior to ours,

491
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,960
yet the octagonal crossbow

492
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,400
that killed Father and injured you

493
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,920
used a core trigger

494
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,370
identical to the new

495
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,210
Wei family design.

496
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
And that weapon hasn't

497
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,160
even been released publicly in Great Sui.

498
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,400
So I must rely on the Wei family's strength

499
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,720
to find the traitor
who leaked our military secrets

500
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,160
and make him pay in blood.

501
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,850
To the world,

502
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,810
I'm just a woman

503
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,650
who'd risk

504
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,680
her reputation for love.

505
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,960
So my public confession to Wei Jun,

506
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,090
even if the court hears,

507
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,570
they'll only laugh at my foolishness,

508
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,330
never suspect my true intent.

509
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,130
Yu,

510
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,210
is it worth it?

511
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,690
Brother,

512
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,090
what did all our fighting

513
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,640
bring us in the end?

514
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,290
Did anyone care about Father's death

515
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,250
or your injuries?

516
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,400
After the Chu family's fall,

517
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,370
I've never

518
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,290
seen things clearer.

519
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,960
What others won't care about,

520
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,130
I will.

521
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,290
What the world won't give me,

522
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,480
I'll find myself.

523
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,890
I don't care about anything else.

524
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,570
I just want the truth.

525
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,170
Brother,

526
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,810
you understand me, don't you?

527
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,630
Chu...

528
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,160
It's not that I don't trust you.

529
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,370
The Arsenal Bureau's new octagonal crossbow

530
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,090
indeed uses that instant-firing trigger.

531
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,770
But that mechanism is a state secret.

532
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,440
How could the North Qi

533
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,330
have obtained the design?

534
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,090
That's exactly what I want to find out.

535
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,390
Look!

536
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,240
Jun really came to meet Lady Chu!

537
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,500
- Something must be going on!
- Don't push!

538
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,350
You're stepping on me!

539
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,030
What do you think they're talking about?

540
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,960
- Don't push!
- Make room!

541
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,680
Yun, there's so much space outside,

542
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,680
why squeeze in?

543
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,440
I like being close to you!

544
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,610
You suspect the Arsenal Bureau,

545
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,960
and you know I oversee it,

546
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,280
yet you still bring this matter to me.

547
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,410
Aren't you afraid

548
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,480
that I might be the very traitor you seek?

549
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,390
Yun?

550
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,630
What are you doing here?

551
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,590
I...

552
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,270
You five,

553
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,350
come out too.

554
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,990
Go on.

555
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,050
Eavesdropping?

556
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,600
Who taught you that?

557
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,600
Yun.

558
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,120
What? We can't hear you, Jun.

559
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,130
We can't hear.

560
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,880
- We're leaving now.
- Yes.

561
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,090
Go, go, hurry.

562
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,070
Told you you can't beat her.

563
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,560
Stop.

564
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,680
You haven't apologized

565
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
to Lady Chu yet.

566
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,720
She's three years

567
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,750
older than you.

568
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,960
Don't be rude.

569
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,910
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
Lady Chu, forgive his insolence.

571
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,640
I'll discipline them at home.

572
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,150
Never mind.

573
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,910
Kids will be kids.

574
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,480
I won't make an issue.

575
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,400
What did I say to you earlier?

576
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,670
Lately it's chilly.

577
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,730
How about we go to Qinxi Valley
to avoid the cold tomorrow?

578
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,940
Lady Chu,

579
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,140
let's discuss it then.

580
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,340
Sure.

581
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,340
Goodbye.

582
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,380
Let's go.

583
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,860
Let's go home.

584
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,020
Come on.

585
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,580
I'll deal with you later.

586
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,260
You are waiting for me?

587
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,900
Why did you suddenly

588
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,740
favor my brother

589
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,460
when you had no ties before?

590
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,460
Are you asking for him?

591
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,460
Of course not.

592
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,100
Do you think I'm unworthy

593
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,180
and want to stop me?

594
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,460
You're overthinking.

595
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,820
My brother treats me well.

596
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,460
I only want to be sure

597
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,700
he won't be hurt,

598
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,340
especially emotionally.

599
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,820
Rest assured.

600
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,020
I won't hurt him.

601
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,340
You...

602
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,220
Are you really with my brother?

603
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,860
Want to know?

604
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,140
Win, and I'll tell you.

605
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,680
You lost.

606
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,960
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

607
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,840
Looking at your palm,

608
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,280
you're sure to have a chubby son.

609
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,480
It's delicious.

610
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,200
Why are you staring at me?

611
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Let Daddy see.

612
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,600
Have you washed your hands?

613
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,560
Father! Mother!

614
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
- Father.
- Here.

615
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
- Father! Mother!
- Let's eat, let's eat.

616
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,320
Father.

617
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,680
Meal time!

618
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
Eat, eat, eat,

619
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,480
you are still in the mood.

620
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,290
Don't you worry?

621
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,480
(Liu Xueyang, Marchioness of Zhenguo)

622
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,320
(Wei Zhong, Marquis of Zhenguo)
After Lady Chu's spectacle,

623
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,120
the whole city says

624
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,240
Jun is marrying her.

625
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,040
Lady Chu publicly begged to wed,

626
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,200
I'm a bit envious.

627
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,400
You're already wed.

628
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,240
What's there to envy?

629
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,040
If anyone should be envied, it's Yun.

630
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,360
- Am I right?
- Yes.

631
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,200
Right, right, right.

632
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,040
Enough.

633
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,040
The one who is most envious

634
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,320
is you yourself.

635
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,880
Eat more.

636
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
Jun,

637
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
what exactly is going on

638
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,360
with Lady Chu?

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,080
Yes, Jun,

640
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
what's happening.

641
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,760
Tell us.

642
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,160
- Yes.
- That's right.

643
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
What's going on, Jun?

644
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,920
Tell us.

645
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,800
- Come on.
- What's going on?

646
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,680
Tell us.

647
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
General Chu just fell in battle,

648
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,720
and Young General Chu is injured.

649
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,960
Lady Chu is trying to help

650
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,720
hold up the family.

651
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,560
That's no easy task.

652
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,720
That

653
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,880
doesn't sound right.

654
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,560
You actually praise her so much?

655
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,920
Father, Mother,

656
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,040
Lady Chu

657
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,920
is blunt by nature,

658
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,640
but

659
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,920
I find her interesting,

660
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
and

661
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,080
she suits Jun well.

662
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,080
Yes.

663
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,040
I agree with Feng.

664
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,880
Right.

665
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,240
I can't imagine how lively

666
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,720
it would be if Lady Chu joined

667
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,640
the Wei household.

668
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
Exactly.

669
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,600
I've always hoped for

670
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,640
a big sister-in-law

671
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,480
to help Mother

672
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,680
manage the household.

673
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,160
But

674
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,320
Lady Chu

675
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,280
is indeed different.

676
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,240
She's born

677
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,600
to a military family

678
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,440
and raised on the frontier,

679
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,320
naturally she's unlike

680
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
Huajing women.

681
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,720
As a woman

682
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
she eloped for love

683
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,560
and caused a scandal,

684
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
regardless of private morals.

685
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,240
Our military house must not

686
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,480
intermarry with such a family.

687
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,040
Eat more.

688
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Stop playing. Eat properly.

689
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,240
Father, Mother, I'm full.

690
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,600
I have some official business to attend.

691
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,440
Excuse me.

692
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,120
You barely eat anything.

693
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,400
- Jun! Jun!
- Jun,

694
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
you're not eating?

695
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,480
- Jun.
- Enjoy your meal.

696
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,200
- Look at him.
- Jun,

697
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,160
where are you going?

698
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,190
- Where are you going?
- Leaving now?

699
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,640
You are not eating?

700
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,780
I deliberately chose this

701
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,180
at the market.

702
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,060
Do you like it?

703
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,100
(Jiang Chun, Wei Shu's Wife)

704
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,940
I do.

705
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,960
(Zhang Han, Wei Qin's Wife)
look, what's different about me today?

706
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
You've gotten chubbier.

707
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,550
I can't believe a blockhead like you

708
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,070
actually got a wife.

709
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,700
(Yao Jue, Wei Feng's Wife)

710
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,420
The sky was fine earlier.

711
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,580
Why did it suddenly rain?

712
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,740
You heard it.

713
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,500
Second Brother bought her wife jewelry.

714
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,420
Why didn't you buy me anything?

715
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,470
Tomorrow night,

716
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,190
we'll taste tea

717
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,870
and watch the moon.

718
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,510
Did I hurt you?

719
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,910
No.

720
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,800
You bad boy!

721
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,000
This was my favorite pastry.

722
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,800
Try it.

723
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,220
(Xie Jiu, Wei Ya's Wife)

724
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,860
(Wang Lan, Wei Rong's Wife)

725
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,020
He kicked me.

726
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,820
Naughty boy,

727
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,700
when I return victorious next time,

728
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,060
you should be out already.

729
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,980
By then, you and your mother will come

730
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,940
to the city gate to welcome me,

731
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,980
understand?

732
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Yes, Daddy.

733
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,110
The Arsenal Bureau's octagonal crossbow

734
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,150
harms both enemy and user,

735
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,030
so it's never been used by our

736
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,870
Great Sui army.

737
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,280
Then how

738
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,360
did North Qi

739
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,190
obtain the design?

740
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,220
(Qinxi Valley)

741
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,220
Qinxi Valley

742
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,660
is the Eldest Princess's garden.

743
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,780
Unlike the outside chill,

744
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,020
spring flowers

745
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,220
bloom here now.

746
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,020
If not for the Eldest Princess's

747
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,180
special flower-viewing event,

748
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,620
we wouldn't be allowed in

749
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,460
to enjoy

750
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,620
the blooms

751
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,500
with you,

752
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,700
Mr. Gu.

753
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,120
You are considerate, Linlang.

754
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,220
(Cao Yan, Minister of the Court
of Judicial Review; Young Master Sun)

755
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,540
(Miss Zheng; Miss Zhou)

756
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,880
Everyone in Huajing says

757
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,880
Academician Gu is handsome and talented,

758
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,200
(Wang Linlang, Daughter of Duke of Ning)
and

759
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,760
now highly favored by court.

760
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,440
You guys

761
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,240
have been outshone.

762
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,240
Academician Gu first won
the General's daughter's following,

763
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,950
then the Duke of Ning's daughter's favor,

764
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,860
such "luck"

765
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,500
we truly envy.

766
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,820
General Chu's daughter?

767
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,500
I heard Lady Chu

768
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,780
grew up on the frontier.

769
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,860
In the army

770
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,100
she never flaunted her status

771
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,980
and joked freely with soldiers,

772
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,540
ignoring gender taboos.

773
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,420
It's almost unimaginable.

774
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,340
I feel ashamed

775
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,700
for General Chu.

776
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,420
You lot!

777
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,700
Don't go too far!

778
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,580
Shut up!

779
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,460
How rude!

780
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,580
Whose maid are you?

781
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,740
She's my maid.
