=Episode 10=

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,400
Did Young Master Sun drug you

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,830
to get revenge

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,230
for what you did at Qinxi Valley?

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,640
Not really.

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,150
He was also trying to please Jin.

26
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,910
What?

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
You don't think family members

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,310
would hurt their own?

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know about other families.

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
But in this family,

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
nothing like that

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
would ever happen.

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,310
I wouldn't allow anyone

34
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,310
to do anything like that.

35
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,550
After all,

36
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,030
family members

37
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,030
should be honest.

38
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,430
Now,

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
we are a family.

40
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,430
Right?

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,870
Of course.

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,910
I even told you

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,280
my sister and I don't get along,

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,360
which is our dirty laundry.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
What else would I keep from you?

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,990
Is that so?

47
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,630
I'll remember what you said.

48
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,520
And I hope you will

49
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
keep your word.

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,590
Is my house really this far?

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
It's taking so long.

52
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,960
Are you teasing me by taking me

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,430
on a detour?

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,750
If you want to get down and walk,

55
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,590
I won't stop you.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
Linyang.

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,430
My sisters caused some trouble.

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,190
Sorry for that.

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
Yu said she didn't feel well.

60
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,950
As her big brother,

61
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,430
I was really worried.

62
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,720
And I happened to know

63
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,430
Miss Song has medical skills.

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,070
So, I asked her

65
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
to check on Yu.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Tuantuan.

67
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,830
Earlier, I was drugged by mistake.

68
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,000
Right now, I feel weak all over.

69
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,190
I don't know

70
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,040
when the effect will wear off.

71
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,710
Check on me.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Can you do something

73
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,920
to help me recover faster?

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,720
Ladies in my family

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
carry some medicine

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,270
for protection

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,950
when they're away from home.

78
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,430
Yu, you must have brought

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
the wrong medicine

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,390
and then misused it, right?

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
Right.

82
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,430
The drug bottle looks almost

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
the same as the others.

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
I took the wrong one in a hurry.

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,430
Ms. Chu Yu,

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,310
that was careless of you.

87
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,630
Even the most careful person

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
can slip up sometimes.

89
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,040
Am I right, Yun?

90
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,950
Ms. Chu worked tirelessly

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
for this banquet.

92
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,310
It's understandable

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
that she was careless.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,960
Young Marquis,

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,310
you have a pretty scenic garden.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
We didn't enjoy the scenery earlier.

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,560
If the two of us stay here,

98
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
Miss Song may be distracted.

99
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,870
Why don't you

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,870
show me around for a moment?

101
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,030
Alright.

102
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,950
It's pretty strange.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,390
I think it's the first time

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
you've been visiting us.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,800
Are you actually

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,630
not happy

107
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,560
with Ms. Chu's life?

108
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,310
My sister is a woman

109
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
of her words.

110
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,310
As her big brother,

111
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,230
I will always support her,

112
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,640
not embarrass her.

113
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,230
Is that so?

114
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,040
General Chu,

115
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,040
you knew Ms. Chu Jin

116
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,240
held a grudge against Chu Yu

117
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,270
but you still brought her here.

118
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,630
I used to think

119
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,270
you didn't care

120
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,270
about Chu Yu at all.

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
Young Marquis,

122
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,270
what happened today

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
was indeed my oversight.

124
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
But it happened at your place, anyway.

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,430
What role

126
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,190
did you play in all this?

127
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,830
Today, I helped Chu Yu out of trouble.

128
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,560
Not you.

129
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,800
If you hadn't stalled me,

130
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,680
Young Master Sun
wouldn't have succeeded.

131
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,430
Do you not want to answer?

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,630
Or do you not know how to answer?

133
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,720
Alright, Ms. Chu Yu.

134
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,000
Get up and see how you feel.

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,430
I do feel much better.

136
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,680
Tuantuan, you have
remarkable medical skills.

137
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,390
Actually,

138
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,800
you flatter me.

139
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,950
When you performed acupuncture on me,

140
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,270
you were even more focused.

141
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,630
You must take practicing medicine

142
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,600
pretty seriously.

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,750
So, your medical skills

144
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,680
must be even better

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
than I said they are.

146
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,950
Thank you for the praise.

147
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,910
As her big brother,

148
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,390
I shouldn't have been negligent, but...

149
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,040
General Chu and Young Marquis.

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,680
I've neutralized

151
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,750
the drug in Ms. Chu Yu.

152
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,750
Thank you, Miss Song.

153
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,360
I really appreciate it.

154
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
But may I ask

155
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,630
if there will be

156
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,470
lingering effects?

157
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,720
No, actually.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,070
But if Ms. Chu Yu

159
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,160
can have a bowl of milk

160
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,480
before she goes to bed,

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,560
that would be great.

162
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,630
I'll go prepare it.

163
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,750
Very well.

164
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,750
It's rather late.

165
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,510
I'll escort Miss Song

166
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,720
to her own home.

167
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,320
Young Marquis,

168
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,750
let's talk another day.

169
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,840
My Lady.

170
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,510
Young Marquis suddenly

171
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,750
sent over a bowl of milk.

172
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,750
He said it was Miss Song's advice

173
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
and you could drink it

174
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
before going to bed.

175
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,030
Xiaoqi.

176
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,270
You almost pounced on the milk.

177
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,110
Xiaoqi,

178
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,840
the milk isn't for you.

179
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,230
But anyway,

180
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,150
when Wei Yun sent me back,

181
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,320
he asked me if I was hiding something.

182
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,270
I lost my mind

183
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,360
and almost let it slip.

184
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,550
Xiaoqi stopped me.

185
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,870
It really helped a lot.

186
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,110
Am I right, Xiaoqi?

187
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,670
Feed it the milk.

188
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,630
Alright.

189
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,480
Xiaoqi deserves a reward.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,230
Come on, Xiaoqi.

191
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
There you go.

192
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,590
My Lady,

193
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,390
didn't you say

194
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,510
Young Marquis Wei

195
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,510
covered for you

196
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,550
at Fragrance House?

197
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,390
In that case,

198
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
I don't think

199
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,790
he's as hostile as before.

200
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,670
If we can persuade him

201
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,870
to help you investigate

202
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,870
the crossbow case,

203
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,360
we'll get more done in less time.

204
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,790
Will he give me

205
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
the Fish-shaped Tally

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,150
just because I ask for it?

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,270
By investigating the Arsenal Bureau,

208
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm deceiving His Majesty.

209
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
He isn't a silly man.

210
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,200
How could he easily help me?

211
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,030
If I tell him about this,

212
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,960
I may get him

213
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,870
to suspect me instead.

214
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Do you remember

215
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,600
I asked you to stalk Wei Yun

216
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
for the location of the Arsenal Bureau?

217
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,440
Of course.

218
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
Don't mention it.

219
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,080
I was pretty angry.

220
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,790
I searched that mountain for so long,

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
only to find nothing.

222
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,270
That mountain

223
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,910
has always been mist-shrouded.

224
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
And the Arsenal Bureau is in the forest.

225
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,110
It's a tough job.

226
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,960
But lately, my brother

227
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,910
has been searching.

228
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,390
Finally, his hard work paid off.

229
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,870
He has found the specific location

230
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,960
of the Arsenal Bureau.

231
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,800
So,

232
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
everything is ready.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,360
All we need is the Fish-shaped Tally.

234
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,110
Is that right?

235
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,390
We only need the tally.

236
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
(Duke of Hu's Mansion)

237
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
General Chu,

238
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,960
you don't need to do this.

239
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,000
I can do such small things

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,440
like getting on or off the carriage.

241
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,680
Miss Song,

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,960
do I have something

243
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,120
on my face?

244
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
General Chu,

245
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,510
let me be your physician.

246
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,200
I do have

247
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
some old injuries.

248
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,750
But they don't bother me.

249
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,750
You don't need

250
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,790
to trouble yourself.

251
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,510
You're home.

252
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,750
I'll take my leave.

253
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,550
The dark circles under your eyes

254
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,030
indicate depression,

255
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,320
insomnia, and frequent dreams.

256
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,910
Your pale lips

257
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,270
indicate a deficient spleen

258
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,600
and poor blood circulation.

259
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,030
What's more...

260
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,440
When I saw you

261
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,480
walk along,

262
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,630
you were unsteady

263
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,550
and short of breath.

264
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,080
All this indicates

265
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,460
that your injuries

266
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,580
have recovered

267
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,910
only superficially.

268
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,590
They might have

269
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,870
caused internal damage.

270
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,470
What do you think?

271
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,510
I described all this

272
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,600
before feeling your pulse.

273
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,870
So, General Chu,

274
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
am I qualified

275
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,000
to give you a treatment?

276
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,790
Are you doing this

277
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,150
to repay my sister for dealing

278
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,870
with the Crown Prince?

279
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,790
Not at all.

280
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,480
I just think your case

281
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,910
is quite a challenge

282
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
for me right now.

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,510
I want to improve my skills

284
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,910
by treating you.

285
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,800
In that case,

286
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,480
I'll leave my health

287
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,320
in your hands.

288
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,510
It's too late now.

289
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,600
If you still linger,

290
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,360
your father will be worried.

291
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,630
Alright.

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,670
I'll go and see you soon.

293
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,560
General Chu.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Rest assured. I will cure you.

295
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,630
General,

296
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,480
do you really need Miss Song

297
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,560
as your physician?

298
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,910
Physician Li's treatment

299
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,910
has lasted six months.

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,080
You'll recover soon.

301
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,670
Miss Song's father

302
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,150
has been spoiling her.

303
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
Yet, she remains innocent.

304
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,510
Just like my two sisters.

305
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,480
When she was obsessed with medication,

306
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,840
she was eager for patients.

307
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,630
Many rich people mocked her.

308
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,790
Today, she helped Yu.

309
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,510
I'll let her do what she wants.

310
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,870
What harm can it do?

311
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,390
Why do you look at me?

312
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,600
Are you rebelling?

313
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,960
You're the father

314
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,040
while I am the son.

315
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,550
I have to obey you, anyway.

316
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
Now you can talk back, huh?

317
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,080
You're disturbing me.

318
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,080
The other day, I told you

319
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,720
to stay away from the Wei family.

320
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,320
But what did you do?

321
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
You defied me even more,

322
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,560
right?

323
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,600
Attending the banquet

324
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,440
was one thing.

325
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,200
Taking your siblings

326
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,790
was quite another.

327
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,270
Why didn't you

328
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,600
even take your father there?

329
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,910
I had planned to.

330
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,000
But I thought you were too busy.

331
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,440
And you, Song Shilan.

332
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,600
Did you advise him

333
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,960
to prepare Taishan Stone?

334
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Father,

335
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,790
I attended the banquet...

336
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,510
Father,

337
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,270
I dragged Shilan there.

338
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,390
And how could he come up

339
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,910
with that brilliant idea?

340
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,870
You sound quite proud, huh?

341
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
No, no, no.

342
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,680
No.

343
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,710
No, I don't.

344
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
I'm warning you.

345
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,240
His Majesty is wary

346
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,840
of close contact
between military families.

347
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,320
At court,

348
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,750
I pleaded for Wei Yun.

349
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,030
It would easily

350
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,510
make His Majesty suspicious.

351
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,360
You even visited Wei Yun

352
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
so blatantly.

353
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,270
Don't you know people will gossip?

354
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,480
They just will.

355
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
Do you understand?

356
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,390
Do you?

357
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,230
You.

358
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,750
And you.

359
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,990
Tuantuan.

360
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,750
You still remember you're engaged

361
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,000
to the Crown Prince, don't you?

362
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,150
Today, General Chu

363
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,320
escorted you home.

364
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,480
If this reaches

365
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,390
the ears of the Crown Prince,

366
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,200
how do you think he will feel?

367
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,320
I don't care how he feels.

368
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,630
I don't like him.

369
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,270
I have no choice

370
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,870
but to marry him.

371
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,840
But his secret concubines

372
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,390
tarnished my reputation

373
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,480
and hurt my feelings.

374
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,560
I know.

375
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
A man often has concubines.

376
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
So, I've swallowed

377
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
my dissatisfaction

378
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,480
with the Crown Prince.

379
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,680
But Father,

380
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,110
I serve as a physician

381
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,350
for General Chu.

382
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,840
What have I done wrong?

383
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,320
Tuantuan,

384
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,270
I know you feel aggrieved.

385
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,550
But you and he came back alone

386
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,270
so late at night.

387
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,030
People will easily gossip.

388
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,350
How about this?

389
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,720
I'll get some imperial physicians

390
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,720
to treat General Chu

391
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
with you.

392
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,670
What do you say?

393
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,800
Father,

394
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,160
the Crown Prince merely apologized

395
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,000
for having secret concubines.

396
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,750
But because I will treat General Chu,

397
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,070
you're trying so hard

398
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,270
to make me submit.

399
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,680
How could you be so unfair

400
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,200
just because you're also a man?

401
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,870
- Tuantuan.
- Tuantuan.

402
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,040
Tuantuan.

403
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,760
Father,

404
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,440
Tuantuan has a point.

405
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,720
She's my only daughter.

406
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,270
I certainly want her to be happy.

407
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,240
The Crown Prince has secret concubines.

408
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,240
He's just a philanderer.

409
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,550
But Tuantuan doesn't like this.

410
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,000
So, we should reconsider

411
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,000
her engagement.

412
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,880
Think of the Crown Prince.

413
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
If Tuantuan has to marry him,

414
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,790
I'll object first.

415
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,920
Let people say whatever they want.

416
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,270
Everybody gossips.

417
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,160
We can't control them.

418
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
What about I promise you

419
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,680
Wei Yun and I

420
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,350
will only meet in secret?

421
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,430
Shut up.

422
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,510
How is your copying?

423
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,510
Father, I'm done.

424
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,070
I punished you

425
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,350
to make you learn your lesson

426
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,750
and always remember

427
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,590
what I say to you.

428
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,200
If you make a mistake again,

429
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,350
the punishment will be worse.

430
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,630
I get it, Father.

431
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,350
Jin.

432
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,000
Jin, are you all right?

433
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,000
Mother.

434
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,430
Linyang,

435
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,310
Jin has been kneeling in there

436
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,480
(Chu's Ancestral Hall)
all night.

437
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,110
Even if she made a terrible mistake,

438
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,510
she realized she was wrong.

439
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,510
I know

440
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,640
you care about Chu Yu.

441
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,030
But Jin is also your sister.

442
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,790
Aren't you being too harsh?

443
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,480
Mother,

444
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,000
a son like me

445
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,960
shouldn't ask this.

446
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,430
But Jian

447
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,510
has become

448
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,310
so reckless.

449
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Does it have nothing to do

450
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,640
with your indulgence?

451
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,550
Mother.

452
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,480
Linyang.

453
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,510
I know I was wrong.

454
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,920
Please let me out.

455
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,310
Mother, please plead with him.

456
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,310
Please help me.

457
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,590
Linyang.

458
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,000
I admit

459
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,750
I've spoiled Jin a little bit.

460
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,510
But aren't you

461
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,960
being unfair?

462
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,950
Unfair?

463
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,520
Mother.

464
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,720
If you want fairness,

465
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,110
do you think

466
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,270
kneeling all night in the hall

467
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,610
will make up

468
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,110
for what she did yesterday?

469
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,070
An outsider set her sister up,

470
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,030
but she just stood by.

471
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,510
She even encouraged it.

472
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,040
In this matter,

473
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,790
even if Yu can let it go,

474
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,640
I will not.

475
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,390
Chu Shan,

476
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,310
take my mother back to her room.

477
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,200
Linyang.

478
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,480
Linyang.

479
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,040
Kneel back there!

480
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,440
Linyang!

481
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,070
Linyang.

482
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,240
I know I was wrong

483
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,960
in Young Master Sun's case.

484
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,790
I shouldn't have followed him

485
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,070
to see my sister insulted.

486
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh, no.

487
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,960
When he told me,

488
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,110
I should have stopped him.

489
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
Linyang,

490
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,920
I know I was wrong.

491
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,510
I won't do it again.

492
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,830
Clearly, you don't know

493
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,680
what you did wrong.

494
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,920
You're just saying

495
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,760
what I want to hear.

496
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,350
Anyway,

497
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
you just can't stand it

498
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,270
when my sister is aggrieved.

499
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
You think I was wrong.

500
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,830
Then tell me

501
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,440
what wrong I've done.

502
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,790
Is it because she didn't grow up

503
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,790
by Mother's side,

504
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,270
so Mother loves me more?

505
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,590
Or is it because

506
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,590
I didn't grow up

507
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,480
around you or Father

508
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,400
like she did,

509
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,400
so, you care more

510
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
about her?

511
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,240
I just want you

512
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,550
to be fair to us.

513
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,480
What is so wrong about that?

514
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
I'm talking to you

515
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,030
about what Yu suffered.

516
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,640
What does it have to do

517
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,030
with your childhood?

518
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,200
It has something to do.

519
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,790
I just want my big brother

520
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,680
to care about me

521
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,590
and trust me like he trusts my sister.

522
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,960
You keep saying

523
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,310
I don't know what she's suffered.

524
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,350
But have you tried to understand me?

525
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Sometimes, I behaved deliberately.

526
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,880
I provoked her on purpose.

527
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,310
I just wanted you

528
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,440
to pay more attention to me.

529
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,910
I admit.

530
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,750
Between you and Yu,

531
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,030
I care more about her.

532
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,920
But that's because

533
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,350
we spent more time

534
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,000
in the northwest

535
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,720
and I knew her better.

536
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,960
Glad you know you're biased.

537
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,550
Since childhood, I've followed you.

538
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,830
But what I always see

539
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,550
is that you and my sister

540
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,960
walk side by side ahead of me.

541
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,720
You never notice me

542
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,590
unless I make a scene.

543
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,840
Linyang,

544
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,160
do you remember?

545
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,030
Every time you were back from battle,

546
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,830
you took my sister out

547
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,960
for fun.

548
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,960
What you always gave me

549
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,350
was a mere doll.

550
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,160
That's because

551
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
you were too young

552
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
and Mother cared for you.

553
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,590
She didn't want you to be as rebellious

554
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,680
as your sister.

555
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
How do you know

556
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,440
I don't want to be like her?

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,480
Because what I want

558
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,030
is never about the dolls.

559
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,430
I want you

560
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,240
to stay around me

561
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,480
and care for me like you care for her

562
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,240
and treat me as an adult

563
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,400
instead of a kid

564
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,070
who only causes trouble.

565
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,960
All you know

566
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,070
is that I keep bullying my sister.

567
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,750
But you never know

568
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,400
I want to be her more than anyone else.

569
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,440
In the past,

570
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
I misunderstood you.

571
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,350
Maybe

572
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,550
I didn't give you what you needed.

573
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,510
But from this day on, I will change.

574
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,840
What about you?

575
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
Even if you felt

576
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
very aggrieved,

577
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,640
you shouldn't have hurt her

578
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,480
that way.

579
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,350
Yesterday,

580
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,440
if the trap on Yu

581
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,400
really worked,

582
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,510
how could you, as her sister,

583
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,240
remain innocent?

584
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,510
What horrible things about Yu

585
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,670
did you tell a man

586
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,790
like Young Master Sun

587
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,550
for him to be so determined

588
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,720
to please you

589
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,000
by ruining her reputation?

590
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,560
Or perhaps,

591
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,400
in his eyes,

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,160
you have actually become

593
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,110
pretty malicious.

594
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,190
Jin,

595
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,350
if Father

596
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,070
saw you like this,

597
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,270
wouldn't it break his heart?

598
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,800
I...

599
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,560
Linyang,

600
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,680
when will you

601
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,550
truly acknowledge me?

602
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,800
Not until

603
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,640
you truly grow up.

604
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,270
Mother, do you care so much about her

605
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,550
that you must wait out here?

606
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,960
When you, your father,

607
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,680
and Yu

608
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:58,310
were guarding in the northwest,

609
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,350
Jin stayed alone with me.

610
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,510
When I missed you,

611
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,400
she cheered me up.

612
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,680
When our family declined,

613
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,030
she tried every way to save money.

614
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,720
Right now,

615
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,830
is she doing everything

616
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,240
just for herself?

617
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,750
She is a naughty girl.

618
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,440
But she isn't evil.

619
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,920
So, she needs to know

620
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,960
what she can do

621
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,960
and what she can't do.

622
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,200
Or she would go down the wrong path.

623
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
Mother,

624
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,680
we both are biased.

625
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,590
I've got to know

626
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,640
Jin's feelings.

627
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,590
I will try

628
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,560
to be nice to her.

629
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,510
Will you also try

630
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,270
to be nice to Yu?

631
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
When Yu was suffering,

632
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,480
did you shed

633
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,510
even a single tear for her?

634
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,860
(Harmony Is Precious)

635
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,590
Take good care of yourselves at home.

636
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,000
I've had your luggage loaded

637
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,920
on your carriages.

638
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
If something is left behind,

639
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,270
pretend Yu and I

640
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,750
want you to come back often.

641
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,960
But your children...

642
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,790
Are you sure they'll stay?

643
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,680
The few of us

644
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,510
talked about that.

645
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,310
When we're back home,

646
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,790
we can't guarantee
their living conditions.

647
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,320
But in this family,

648
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,920
they have you.

649
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,680
You will take care of them.

650
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
When we manage

651
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,830
to live very well,

652
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,030
we'll come back for them, alright?

653
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,160
No problem.

654
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,270
According to Yun,

655
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,590
no matter where we are,

656
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,110
we're part of this family.

657
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,920
At yesterday's banquet,

658
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:27,870
you said you wanted

659
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,350
to take away Brothers' spears.

660
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,000
So, today,

661
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,920
I'm not here to see you off,

662
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,030
but to give you them.

663
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,920
You deserve the spears.

664
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,760
Here, Han.

665
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,720
Here, Jiu.

666
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,800
Yun,

667
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
I should thank you

668
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,080
for either the paper

669
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,830
or the spear.

670
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,000
Bring me my zither.

671
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,520
Yes.

672
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,000
My husband loved it

673
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,310
when I played some music.

674
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,110
Especially the "Breaking-up" song.

675
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,550
Right here,

676
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,590
I'll play it again.

677
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,300
(True Might)

678
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,590
Her music

679
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,660
reminded me of the past

680
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,590
when Feng taught me

681
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,200
to use the spear.

682
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,840
Han.

683
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,550
Jiu is expressing gratitude

684
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,510
through some music.

685
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,960
Let's not be outdone.

686
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
But I really wonder

687
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,960
if your martial arts

688
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,110
have regressed.

689
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,150
Very well, Jue.

690
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,830
Try me and you'll know.

691
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,790
I often listened to such melodies.

692
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,070
Every time I heard them,

693
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,000
I felt as if all my efforts

694
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,840
would be meaningful.

695
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,920
I wasn't as ambitious

696
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,830
as my brothers.

697
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,200
In my opinion,

698
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,720
I wielded the spear

699
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,720
and fought in battles

700
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,680
just for my family members.

701
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,590
I want them

702
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,480
to be always happy.

703
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,350
But now, hearing that music,

704
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,800
I think...

705
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
Think what?

706
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,110
All in all,

707
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,160
I wasn't able to protect them.

708
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,440
When I was little,

709
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,030
my mother kept asking me

710
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,880
to behave like my sister.

711
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,480
I should learn music,

712
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,680
dance,

713
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,030
and calligraphy.

714
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,880
But I loved none of them.

715
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,480
What I loved was martial arts.

716
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,950
Look around.

717
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,320
Here,

718
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,160
nobody needs protection.

719
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,520
Here.

720
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,030
A little flower for you.

721
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,190
Cheer up.

722
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,260
(Letter of Release)

723
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,240
I will stay here

724
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
and guard Wei Rong.

725
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,700
(True Might)

726
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,150
Mother.

727
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
Are you leaving me alone?

728
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,150
Mother,

729
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,110
don't leave me.

730
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,710
Good kid, Lingmo.

731
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,160
One day,

732
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,760
Mother will come back and get you.

733
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,990
All right?

734
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,940
(True Might)

735
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,240
Lingchun,

736
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,880
your siblings aren't like you.

737
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,110
Their parents are not here.

738
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,320
You should take good care of them.

739
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
Understand?

740
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,150
Yes, Mother.

741
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,720
Auntie.

742
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,620
(Knowledgeable and Optimistic)

743
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,070
Go get them.

744
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,360
Have they left?

745
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,110
I didn't know

746
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,110
you could be

747
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,480
so soft-hearted.

748
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,340
I can't bear to see it

749
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
when a mother has to

750
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,840
leave her children.

751
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,360
So, I just avoided it.

752
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,990
Tell me.

753
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,960
Did we do the wrong thing?

754
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,840
Some of them

755
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,190
want to be free,

756
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,880
but their children

757
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,400
may shackle them.

758
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,600
Some of them want

759
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,480
to bring their children back home.

760
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,920
But if they're asked to remarry,

761
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,230
how will a new husband

762
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,360
tolerate those children?

763
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,430
Even if someone

764
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,800
takes back her children,

765
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,510
she isn't sure if she can

766
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,440
protect them very well.

767
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,150
A normal man

768
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,400
respects some honorable people.

769
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,440
A woman respects one more, her husband.

770
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,510
Life is really hard

771
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,070
for women.

772
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,200
So,

773
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,030
this family is good enough.

774
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,110
Pretty good enough.

775
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,880
They were set free at least.

776
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,360
They had a second chance

777
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,800
to choose a life.

778
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
Am I right?

779
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,390
You're right.

780
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,630
Why is it you?

781
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,470
Look at me.

782
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
Look at you?

783
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,710
Yes. You have to.

784
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,710
Look at me and see

785
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,550
if there's something

786
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,070
on my face.

787
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,500
Right here.

788
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,400
No.

789
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,290
No?

790
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,280
No.

791
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,120
That's good, then.

792
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,070
I think a mosquito bit me.

793
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,320
It's itchy.

794
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,120
Glad nothing's wrong.

795
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,230
Ridiculous.

796
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
Why are you here?

797
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,470
You... I...

798
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,070
Yun.

799
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,480
Is it possible

800
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,720
that Xiaoqi is in your room?

801
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,140
I can't find it anywhere.

802
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,330
Get in here and get it out.

803
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,390
Alright.

804
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,470
I...

805
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,640
Xiaoqi.

806
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,150
Where are you?

807
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,150
My lovely puppy.

808
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,670
Where are you?

809
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,800
Xiaoqi.

810
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,920
Xiaoqi, where are you?

811
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,030
Answer me.

812
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,190
Xiaoqi.

813
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,280
Have you found it?

814
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
No. Your room is too big.

815
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,880
It runs everywhere.

816
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,720
Xiaoqi.

817
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,030
Stop running, Xiaoqi.

818
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,000
Does it run too fast

819
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,030
or can't you catch it?

820
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,920
That's easy for you to say.

821
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,000
How about you try?

822
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,840
I...

823
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,270
If you can't find it,

824
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,000
don't waste your time.

825
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,440
I can find it.

826
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,600
Xiaoqi.

827
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,200
Xiaoqi.

828
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,670
Xiaoqi, behave.

829
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,590
Xiaoqi, where are you?

830
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,950
Xiaoqi.

831
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,550
Got you.

832
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,120
Don't run away again.

833
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,670
If you hadn't rushed me,

834
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,150
I would have found it earlier.

835
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,800
You just made it harder.

836
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,950
Xiaoqi, behave.

837
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,280
You... Hurry.

838
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,360
Take it out of my room.

839
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
So, it's the Fish-shaped Tally
that you want.

840
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,030
Chu Yu,

841
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll have to give you a problem.

842
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,660
(Arsenal Bureau)

843
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,110
What did I promise you?

844
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,150
I would invite you

845
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,110
to the Arsenal Bureau

846
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,280
when you became the Marquis of Zhenguo.

847
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,150
Commander Lu, you're a man of your word.

848
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
Very well.

849
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,440
Your big brother set this rule.

850
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,320
No drinking during the shift.

851
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,880
So, drink some tea instead.

852
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,480
Good tea, anyway.

853
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,070
Not too bad for you.

854
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,070
Commander Lu,

855
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,320
why did you invite me for tea?

856
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,800
Is this an apology for what happened

857
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,670
at Fragrance House?

858
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,150
Come on, Wei Yun.

859
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,360
Has anyone ever told you

860
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,710
that for all your sharp wit,

861
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,630
you can be

862
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,630
a bit annoying?

863
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,710
Must I apologize?

864
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,230
In this world,

865
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,760
don't be a stickler.

866
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,590
You flatter me.

867
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
I drank the tea.

868
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,150
And you apologized.

869
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,550
Shall we get down to business?

870
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,280
I carefully studied

871
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,120
this mechanism.

872
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,110
It wasn't made in the Arsenal Bureau.

873
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,230
But it could not

874
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,630
have been manufactured

875
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,710
without our blueprints.

876
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,320
That is to say,

877
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,230
it indeed

878
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,280
came from my bureau.

879
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,760
Wei Yun,

880
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,280
do you know

881
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,880
why I didn't allow Wei Jun

882
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,360
or the army to use this

883
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,840
when I designed it?

884
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,800
My brother told me

885
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:37,670
it was defective

886
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,840
and harmful to both sides.

887
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,030
That's right.

888
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,510
At least one crossbowman

889
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,190
would be seriously injured

890
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,190
after every ten shots.

891
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,280
Your big brother and I

892
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,230
never thought

893
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,840
it was a successful design.

894
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,280
But the North Qi army

895
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,320
used it in battle first.

896
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,360
It killed General Chu Jianchang,

897
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,760
injured General Chu Linyang,

898
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,670
and was also used in Baidi Valley.

899
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,550
The North Qi army

900
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,070
would never find anything wrong

901
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,070
with this evil design.

902
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,110
Yeah.

903
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,070
So,

904
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,840
someone in my bureau

905
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,680
betrayed us

906
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,880
and caused trouble.

907
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,480
Now, you're the Marquis of Zhenguo.

908
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,400
How about...?

909
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,590
I had a rough investigation

910
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,920
and I'm getting somewhere.

911
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,430
Shall we cooperate?

912
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,280
Commander Lu.

913
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,120
Wei Yun,

914
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:45,230
