21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
Who do you think they are?

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,710
Just a bunch of people leaning on

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,760
family status

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,400
to act recklessly, calling themselves

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,790
gentlemen and ladies while only

26
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,560
gossiping behind others' backs.

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,870
So it's Lady Chu.

28
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,350
No wonder you didn't

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,520
recognize me at first.

30
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,030
What?

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,150
Rejected by Young General Wei

32
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,030
and now you come

33
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,960
to Qinxi Valley to fish for

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,430
another rich groom?

35
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,310
Mr. Cao,

36
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,800
no need for more words.

37
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,280
Academician Gu may be awkward

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,520
to step forward because of his past.

39
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,710
Ms. Wang,

40
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,520
what are you afraid of?

41
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,150
Do you expect

42
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,840
the defeated Chu Jianchang

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,800
to crawl out

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,310
of his coffin

45
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,150
and defend her?

46
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,150
Don't be rash.

47
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,470
Who?

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
Who is it?

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,000
Who hit me in the head?

50
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,710
Brother Wei.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,310
I'm late to the appointment.

52
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,750
Please forgive the delay.

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,360
Young General Wei,

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,080
both of us serve the court,

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,470
don't blame me for warning you:

56
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,590
with Lady Chu's reputation,

57
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,310
keep your distance

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
or

59
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,590
your Marquis Mansion's honor may be sullied.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,310
Cao Yan,

61
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,960
as Minister of Justice,

62
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,150
your words

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
are coarse and crude.

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,400
Wei Jun,

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,470
I give you courtesy

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,310
because of your father,

67
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,520
otherwise would I, Minister of Justice,

68
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
fear you?

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,310
Earlier, you called me a child,

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,750
and now, I'm the one

71
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,870
defending you here.

72
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,750
So it was you who hit me.

73
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
You...

74
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,240
You conspirators,

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
plotting against an imperial official!

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
How many heads will be enough?

77
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,270
I will not let you go.

78
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,110
Are you all right?

79
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,670
I'm fine.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,270
Lady Chu and my Seventh Brother

81
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,800
truly have an odd fate.

82
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,270
Chu Yu,

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
Wei Jun,

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,270
and you brat,

85
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,920
you coarse men-at-arms!

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
True,

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,240
we are soldiers,

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,000
but soldiers who protect Great Sui's

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,160
people and keep peace.

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,600
Lady Chu's family are meritous.

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,390
You shall not slander them

92
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,430
like this.

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,310
Fine, fine.

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,360
The humiliations you heaped upon me today,

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,400
I will make you

96
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,600
repay tenfold someday.

97
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
The Young General speaks rightly.

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Let this end here.

99
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,670
Let's go home.

100
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,240
I was only trying to scare him.

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
How would I know the Minister of Justice

102
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
would...

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You got your hands dirty.

104
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,470
I...

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Thank you,

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,270
Brother Wei, for your help today.

107
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,920
I will thank you properly another day.

108
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,720
Lady Chu, don't take Cao Yan's words

109
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
to heart.

110
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,560
I certainly won't take them to heart.

111
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,040
Brother Wei, let's go for a walk.

112
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,320
Alright.

113
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, got it.

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,240
I'll take my leave now.

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
Don't stray too far.

116
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,240
This is today's route for

117
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,720
Young General Wei and Wei Yun.

118
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
General,

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,040
how are you so sure

120
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,360
he'd go to

121
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,200
the Arsenal Bureau today?

122
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,750
Born to a military house,

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,080
you trust yourself,

124
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,310
the banner behind you,

125
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
and the soldiers at your side.

126
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,800
Yesterday Chu Yu

127
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,450
(Chushan, Chu Linyang's Guard)
told him the octagonal crossbow

128
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,930
(Chushan, Chu Linyang's Guard)
appeared in North Qi hands,

129
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,160
how could he not go

130
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,870
check the Arsenal Bureau

131
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
to see what happened?

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,480
So the Arsenal Bureau's true location

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,120
lies in the movements

134
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,270
of the Wei brothers.

135
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,510
(I hope Chu Yu makes progress.)

136
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
Brother Wei,

137
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
when I

138
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,390
confessed to you atop Spring Breeze House,

139
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,840
I didn't think it through.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,030
You may publicly

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,750
refuse me there another day

142
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,910
and save Wei family face.

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,910
Lady Chu, do not take it to heart.

144
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,440
I don't mind.

145
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,440
The octagonal crossbow's instant trigger

146
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,030
comes from the Arsenal Bureau's craft,

147
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,320
so I cannot be fully blameless.

148
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,910
What you said

149
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,200
matters not only

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,060
to me but tightens

151
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,550
the noose on the Wei family,

152
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,670
and for Great Sui

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
as a whole.

154
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,470
I will

155
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,720
investigate this thoroughly.

156
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,670
Can't I investigate with you?

157
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,550
If the Chu family is suspected of
colluding with the enemy

158
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,750
and the Wei family is suspected of treason,

159
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,150
the stakes are high.

160
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
You have your public plan,

161
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,960
I have my worries.

162
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,550
But I promise,

163
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,910
after I investigate,

164
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,150
I will explain everything to you.

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
I...

166
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,480
This is what I found in the grove just now.

167
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,390
Yun?

168
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,120
It was nearly frozen,

169
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,790
so I kept it warm in my arms.

170
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,840
When it revived

171
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,550
it scampered everywhere.

172
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,120
If you want it,

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,910
you can have it.

174
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,390
Why do you fall silent

175
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,600
as soon as I arrive?

176
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Lady Chu, please send my regards

177
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,390
to Young General Chu.

178
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,510
Thank you, Brother Wei.

179
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
We'll meet again another day.

180
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,990
Let's go.

181
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,350
My Lady.

182
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you find the spot?

183
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,360
I followed that General Wei

184
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,600
up a ridge.

185
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,120
He's like a rabbit,

186
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,360
extremely swift,

187
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,960
with a crafty guard.

188
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,750
I lost him when I

189
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,150
wasn't careful.

190
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,870
No matter.

191
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,030
The Arsenal Bureau is extremely important

192
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
for Great Sui.

193
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,080
It won't be easy to find.

194
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,120
Finding the exact ridge

195
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,960
is already good.

196
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,150
Tomorrow,

197
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,510
I'll scout it myself.

198
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,350
Go now.

199
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm exhausted.

200
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Today Wei Qiu and I

201
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,080
ran back and forth.

202
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,030
When I asked for personnel files,

203
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,600
do you know how the deputy commander

204
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,480
responded?

205
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,030
He's strange

206
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,000
and headstrong.

207
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,000
I suppose he refused.

208
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,350
Yes.

209
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,510
He even asked

210
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,840
whether you had time to go to the Arsenal.

211
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,360
If you cannot, he said

212
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
he could come find you.

213
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,360
Jun, are you toying with me?

214
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,030
Of course not.

215
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I sent you

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,960
because someone is watching me.

217
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
This is serious.

218
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
Lady Chu?

219
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,840
How could it be her?

220
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Of course not.

221
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,720
Jun,

222
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,630
between you and Lady Chu,

223
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,720
is this real?

224
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,590
Jun,

225
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,870
Lady Chu

226
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,510
may be odd,

227
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,090
but you mustn't

228
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,200
toy with her feelings.

229
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,270
Do you think I would

230
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,000
deceive a woman's heart?

231
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,120
Of course not.

232
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
In my eyes,

233
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,080
you're one of Great Sui's finest.

234
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,670
Ye deserve

235
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,870
the best woman.

236
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,750
I fear you may

237
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,750
fall for her beauty trap.

238
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,480
You're paying

239
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
extra attention to Lady Chu.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,390
Do you think she's beautiful?

241
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,350
I...

242
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,590
I...

243
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,150
I'm telling you business here.

244
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,200
Fine.

245
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,320
Let me ask you,

246
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,720
what is the best woman in the world?

247
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,750
There are many women,

248
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
but the one you love

249
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,750
is the best.

250
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,600
I really want to know

251
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,270
what you will be like

252
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,360
after marriage.

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Will you

254
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,390
stay as mischievous?

255
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,470
I...

256
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,230
See you later.

257
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,580
(Tong; General Wei Jun)

258
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,080
This is the instant trigger
from the octagonal crossbow.

259
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
You...

260
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,270
This was brought back

261
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,150
at great risk by my brother

262
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,270
from the Fengling battlefield.

263
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,870
It's made by North Qi.

264
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,600
Brother Wei, I know you're upright.

265
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
To investigate

266
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
you need evidence.

267
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,390
If my brother distrusts you,

268
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
I'll believe you once.

269
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,870
(If there's a traitor in the Arsenal Bureau,)

270
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,870
(who might it be?)

271
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,150
Urgent news!

272
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,960
Urgent news!

273
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,240
Urgent news!

274
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,620
(Chengqing Gate)

275
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
(Loyalty and Valor)

276
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,280
Jun,

277
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,680
if I win today,

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,840
when we next march,

279
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,110
you'll ask Father to let me

280
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,450
skip the drawing of lots for duty, alright?

281
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,050
I want to return to the battlefield.

282
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,350
Yun,

283
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,510
you know Father's rules.

284
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,240
Yun,

285
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,440
you've gone to war

286
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,280
three times in a row.

287
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
Give your brothers

288
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,070
a chance.

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,680
Qin, it's just bad luck you drew guard duty

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
three times in a row.

291
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,660
Jun, watch this move!

292
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,280
In five moves,

293
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,480
Yun will lose.

294
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,830
That's already good.

295
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,440
Previously he couldn't last

296
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
two hundred moves against Jun.

297
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,790
Now

298
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,960
it's nearly even.

299
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,110
Indeed,

300
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,590
at Yun's age

301
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,750
I could never beat Jun.

302
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,670
- Father.
- Father.

303
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:31,870
Father.

304
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,830
His Majesty commands:

305
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,750
North Qi is agitating;

306
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,550
the northern border is urgent.

307
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,110
The Wei army

308
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,440
will mobilize at once

309
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,920
to respond.

310
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,040
Yes!

311
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,790
- Jun.
- Yun,

312
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,000
I have somewhere to go.

313
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,590
I'll be back soon.

314
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,750
Go pick up some cloth later,

315
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,020
- don't forget.
- Yes.

316
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,900
(Chu Mansion)

317
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,430
Young General Wei.

318
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Please tell Lady Chu Yu,

319
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,110
Wei Jun requests

320
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
an urgent message.

321
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,790
Lady Chu is out and hasn't come home.

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,830
General Wei, perhaps you should

323
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,670
wait a while?

324
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,590
No, better not.

325
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,440
That would damage your household's reputation.

326
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,830
Please deliver this letter

327
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,070
to Lady Chu.

328
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,840
Farewell.

329
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,940
(Chu Mansion)

330
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,300
(Chu Mansion)

331
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,660
(True Might)

332
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,680
Is Xie Jiu

333
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,830
still sulking with you?

334
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,830
We're still the same,

335
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,830
familiar,

336
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
yet distant.

337
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,350
Yun,

338
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,310
believe me or not,

339
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,830
the unlucky rear-guard post this time

340
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,440
- is yours.
- Don't curse me.

341
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,920
I'm not just going to the front,

342
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,960
I'll crush North Qi completely.

343
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,310
When they hear my name,

344
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,310
Wei Yun,

345
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
they'll flee in terror.

346
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,080
First draw gets the spot!

347
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,320
Yun, don't cheat.

348
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,980
(Rear Guard)

349
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
Yun.

350
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Looks like I was right.

351
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,720
Doesn't count, let's draw again!

352
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,830
- Impossible.
- Let me draw again!

353
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,670
Yun,

354
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,270
it's already settled.

355
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,680
You can't

356
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,750
go back on it.

357
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,550
Yun.

358
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,220
(True Might)

359
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,190
Zhong,

360
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,350
why are you leaving

361
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,680
earlier than planned?

362
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,440
Don't worry,

363
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
I'll return

364
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
victorious.

365
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,350
My dear sons,

366
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,590
take care of yourselves,

367
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,440
and your father.

368
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,510
Don't worry, Mother.

369
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

370
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,150
Depart!

371
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:43,780
May you return victorious!

372
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,460
(Wei)
May you return victorious!

373
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,070
May you return victorious!

374
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,910
My Lady.

375
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,110
Chu Shan,

376
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,110
why are you standing outside?

377
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,160
Let me tell you,

378
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,310
I'm exhausted today.

379
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
If not for fear of arousing suspicion,

380
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,310
I'd have brought more men

381
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,160
to find the Arsenal Bureau.

382
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,880
- Earlier...
- I've been running all day.

383
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,350
- I...
- What's the matter?

384
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,070
What is it? Speak.

385
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,200
While you were out,

386
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,440
Young General Wei came to see you.

387
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,350
He waited,

388
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,350
then left a letter for you.

389
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,070
The first one there

390
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,070
is actually the Crown Prince.

391
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,440
This time His Highness himself

392
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
will oversee the campaign.

393
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,590
The Crown Prince is even

394
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,930
(Li Huan, the Crown Prince)
younger than Yun

395
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
and has no field experience.

396
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,240
How could His Majesty send him

397
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
(Yao Yong, the State-Supporting General)
as overseer?

398
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,110
His Majesty's mind

399
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
is not for us to guess.

400
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,630
No matter.

401
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,480
We'll just fight the enemy.

402
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,680
Jun, we are setting out today,

403
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,070
why is she not here to see you off?

404
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,440
Today's departure was sudden,

405
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,920
and earlier than planned.

406
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,030
I can understand.

407
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,310
"To Lady Chu:

408
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I hope this letter

409
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
finds you well.

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,310
I depart today for war.

411
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,680
Please be at ease.

412
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,350
I

413
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,640
never meant to hinder you,

414
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,070
but the Arsenal Bureau

415
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,550
is the empire's critical stronghold.

416
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,510
There are only two ways in.

417
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,440
Once I return victorious,

418
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,440
you shall have your answer."

(To Lady Chu)

442
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,350
Linyang.

443
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,200
It's walnut cookies from Jiqing Pastry.

444
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,590
They are still warm.

445
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Try one.

446
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,240
Still troubled by the

447
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,910
Arsenal Bureau?

448
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,030
Wei Jun mentioned it

449
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,590
in his letter—

450
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,310
there are only two ways

451
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,440
to enter:

452
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,510
a royal decree,

453
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,790
or

454
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,590
an official post

455
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,440
or token of authority.

456
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,350
We can't hope for a decree

457
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,830
or appointment,

458
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,550
but what is that "token"?

459
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,480
He didn't say.

460
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,110
Still,

461
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,680
if he told me this much,

462
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,480
then once he returns victorious,

463
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,750
we'll investigate together.

464
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,190
Linyang.

465
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
Linyang.

466
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,920
It's cold at night.

467
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,160
Why are you here instead of

468
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,240
staying in your room?

469
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,560
Put this on.

470
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
You're thoughtful, Jin.

471
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,510
You always think of her first,

472
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,720
never of me

473
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
when you have something delicious.

474
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,200
Jin,

475
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,040
yours has already

476
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,350
been sent to your room

477
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,350
by Chu Shan.

478
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,880
Really?

479
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,720
Really.

480
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,270
I knew it.

481
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,400
Brother always

482
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,920
thinks of me first.

483
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,920
What's so funny?

484
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,310
I heard

485
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,960
you went to see Wei Jun again.

486
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,790
You've really gone to great lengths

487
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,310
for this marriage.

488
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Jin,

489
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,400
Yu's contact with Wei Jun

490
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,790
is not for

491
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,750
his family status.

492
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,680
Don't speak with barbs.

493
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,880
Whether I marry Wei Jun

494
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,160
or another,

495
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,030
it will be because I love him,

496
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,270
not to climb.

497
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,960
Your confession

498
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
at Spring Breeze house

499
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,640
was showy and trying to

500
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,550
draw his attention,

501
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,200
and now you

502
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
hide behind lofty reasons.

503
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,590
I did that because

504
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,240
my nature is what it is.

505
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,240
While you,

506
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,440
with your refined airs—

507
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,290
what's under

508
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,160
your bed?

509
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,350
Pai gow, dice,

510
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,590
and that other thing...

511
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,430
You went through my stuff!

512
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,550
You just didn't hide them well.

513
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,110
Ask around the household,

514
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,280
everyone knows.

515
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,350
Stop glaring at me.

516
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,350
Why stop?

517
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,830
I won't stop!

518
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,920
Enough.

519
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Don't fight.

520
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,640
Linyang, you needn't intervene.

521
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,270
- Glare again!
- So what?

522
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,640
- I dare you!
- Try me!

523
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
You asked for this!

524
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,440
You dare hit me!

525
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,750
Come on, catch me.

526
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,270
- You can't catch me.
- Chu Yu!

527
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,240
Chu Yu!

528
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,960
Come on. I'm here.

529
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,440
- If I catch you,
- You think you can?

530
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,340
you'll regret this!

531
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,080
(Chu Mansion)
You can catch me?

532
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,480
- No way!
- Chu Yu!

533
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,420
(Wei Encampment)

534
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,140
(Wei)

535
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,860
Why did Father suddenly mobilize the army?

536
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,920
Weren't we only to defend the city?

537
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,000
Why change

538
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,840
after only a month?

539
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Report from the front:

540
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,840
North Qi forces have retreated to Baidi Valley.

541
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
They're fewer than twenty thousand.

542
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,950
The Crown Prince ordered us

543
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,000
to pursue the victory.

544
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,440
Baidi Valley is a depression.

545
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Though we have more men,

546
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
it will be a fierce battle.

547
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,830
Why not plan tactics

548
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,670
before pursuit?

549
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,310
It's a military order.

550
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,840
I...

551
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,680
Yun,

552
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,520
don't worry.

553
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,030
When we return

554
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,270
we'll teach you

555
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,200
battlefield craft.

556
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,110
I...

557
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,280
Stop that.

558
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,390
Yun,

559
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,240
stay and guard the rear.

560
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
When we return

561
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,350
we'll celebrate, drink,

562
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,320
and have reunion meals.

563
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,950
Yun,

564
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,240
guard the camp well.

565
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Believe your brothers.

566
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,240
We will return victorious.

567
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,480
Jun,

568
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
give the orders.

569
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,720
Wei soldiers,

570
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,160
out there today,

571
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,000
united we fight,

572
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,960
united we die!

573
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,400
Protect the nation

574
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,110
with no regrets!

575
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,960
Protect the nation

576
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,350
with no regrets!

577
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,830
Protect the nation

578
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
with no regrets!

579
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,960
Protect the nation

580
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,510
with no regrets!

581
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,110
Protect the nation

582
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,640
with no regrets!

583
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,390
March out!

584
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,340
(Wei)

585
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,660
(Sui)

586
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,540
(Qi)

587
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,340
(Su Cha, North Qi General)

588
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,510
Charge!

589
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,830
Charge!

590
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:16,690
Charge! Charge! Charge!

591
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:23,400
Charge! Charge! Charge!

592
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,800
Retreat!

593
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,800
Retreat!

594
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,120
Retreat now!

595
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,000
In this battle, we will

596
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,960
crush North Qi so thoroughly

597
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,120
they won't dare attack for ten years.

598
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,590
I'll take the head of

599
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,110
North Qi's war god Su Cha.

600
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,360
What bad luck!

601
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,030
When we get back

602
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,630
I'll hire a fortune-teller

603
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,550
to wipe it out.

604
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,800
Young General,

605
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,150
you've been to the front so often.

606
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,000
Take a break this time.

607
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,800
How can I rest with enemies to kill?

608
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,960
I want North Qi to quake

609
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,070
at the sound of my name,

610
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,710
earn the greatest merits,

611
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,840
and hold the highest office,

612
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,670
even higher than my father.

613
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,320
Alright, alright.

614
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,670
At this time,

615
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,550
they should have been

616
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,590
entered Baidi Valley.

617
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,000
Charge!

618
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
Halt!

619
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,580
(Wei)

620
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,280
Oh no!

621
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,120
Ambush!

622
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,840
Fall back!

623
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,680
Take cover!

624
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,510
General, the intelligence was wrong.

625
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,120
The enemy is far larger than twenty thousand.

626
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,000
There must be

627
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,070
a spy who fed false reports.

628
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,110
Spy again?

629
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,480
Charge!

630
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,960
Charge!

631
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,510
Charge out!

632
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,700
Charge!

633
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,840
Charge!

634
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,430
(An octagonal crossbow?)

635
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Shu!

636
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,150
Shu!

637
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,320
Father!

638
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,440
