was bought with thousands,

tens of thousands of lives

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,840
from our clan.

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,150
It must not,

38
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,150
and will not, fall here.

39
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,520
If His Majesty insists on condemning Wei Yun,

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,400
we will kneel here without rising.

41
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,030
Even if we freeze to death,

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,960
we will

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,750
hold him up.

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,960
(But you died for our state.)

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,870
(You are a hero.)

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,600

58
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
Eat.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
Lord Cao says

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
that you spent years on campaign

61
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,680
and is used to this food.

62
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
You'd

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
better eat.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
No one

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,750
will visit you

66
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,800
again.

Han.

Wei Qiu,

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
escort Lady Han back.

71
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,470
Yu,

72
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,830
Lan is pregnant.

73
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,950
Let her return too.

74
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,430
Wei Qiu,

75
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,430
escort Lady Lan as well.

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,840
Careful.

77
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,180
(Tablet of Wei Zhong, Marquis of Zhenguo)

78
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,820
(Chengqing Gate)

79
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,240
Look, entire Wei family

80
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,090
are still kneeling.

81
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,240
They've been kneeling a long time.

82
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
Yes.

83
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,070
And right here at the gate.

84
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,700
(Zhang An, Deputy Minister of Personnel)

85
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,590
Deputy Minister Zhang,

86
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
where are you going?

87
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,000
Mr. cao,

88
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,430
I'm going to another gate.

89
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,830
I won't enter from here.

90
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,270
Why?

91
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
Heroes rest here.

92
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,430
How could I take their path?

93
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
The side gate is enough.

94
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,360
Such pretense.

95
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,710
Lady Chu,

96
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,630
why pretending like this?

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,190
If kneeling could move His Majesty,

98
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,720
what use

99
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,710
is our law?

100
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,680
Mr. Cao is right.

101
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,720
You ignore the law and try

102
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,000
to coerce the throne.

103
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,240
The law may be rigid.

104
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,360
Our laws exist for the people.

105
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,270
Duke of Ning and Lord Cao,

106
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,790
you've reversed cause and effect.

107
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,990
Teacher.

108
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
Sincerity

109
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,270
can pierce stone.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Academician Gu,

111
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,670
what does that old man's

112
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
saying mean?

113
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,750
Mr. Cao,

114
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,080
the snow is coming.

115
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,150
Best hurry.

116
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,510
If you can't take it,

117
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,440
go rest a while.

118
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,350
I'm fine.

119
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
If you can stand,

120
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,240
so can I.

121
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Sister,

122
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,510
are you alright?

123
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,390
Just because you called me "Sister,"

124
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,000
I must hold on.

125
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,840
Since we're here,

126
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,630
there's no turning back.

127
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
Linyang, it's freezing.

128
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,270
Don't go.

129
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
Chu Linyang!

130
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,710
Chu Linyang!

131
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,150
Dressed like this,

132
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,320
are you going to the palace?

133
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,670
You returned from Fengling injured

134
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,750
and haven't attended court.

135
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,870
Now, with the Wei family in crisis,

136
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,270
you go despite illness?

137
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,440
Chu Yu is already married into the Wei family.

138
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,480
At this moment

139
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,840
you should avoid suspicion.

140
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,870
Otherwise His Majesty

141
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,030
will doubt our families' ties.

142
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,320
If we

143
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,510
anger Duke of Ning,

144
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,790
how will the Chu family survive?

145
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Mother,

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
in the wind and snow at the Chu Mansion,

147
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,360
someone can holds an umbrella for us.

148
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,200
But before the palace gates,

149
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,630
no one shields Yu from the storm.

150
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,630
I'm going today

151
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,110
not for anyone else,

152
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,030
but for her.

153
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,360
She chose to marry into the Wei family.

154
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,390
She chose to kneel at the palace gates.

155
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,390
Every bit of suffering

156
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,030
is her own doing.

157
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Linyang,

158
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
this family

159
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,910
isn't only her.

160
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,840
If something happens to you,

161
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,360
what will Mother and I do?

162
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Do you only

163
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
see Chu Yu as you sister,

164
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,120
but not me?

165
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,320
Jin,

166
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,360
if you were the one kneeling at the gate today,

167
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,840
I would go without hesitation

168
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,720
to shield you as well.

169
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,710
I don't believe you.

170
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,150
Linyang, make your choice

171
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,720
between Jin and Yu today.

172
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,630
If you step out that gate,

173
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,080
you lose me as your sister.

174
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,590
Jin,

175
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,510
stop being childish.

176
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,510
I must go today.

177
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,710
Mother,

178
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,080
Yu is holding up

179
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,030
the entire Wei family alone.

180
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,750
No one stands behind her.

181
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,840
I am her brother,

182
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,440
her family.

183
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,480
How can I do nothing?

184
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,360
Brother!

185
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,920
Your Majesty,

186
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,080
Wei Yun is now

187
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
imprisoned by the Court

188
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,560
of Judicial Review,

189
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,030
yet Minister Cao

190
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,200
has found no solid evidence

191
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,600
against the Wei family.

192
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,270
Without evidence,

193
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,720
Wei Yun should be released.

194
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,150
I beg Your Majesty to show mercy.

195
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,750
I, Chu Linyang, implore

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Your Majesty to pardon Wei Yun.

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,270
Young General Chu,

198
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,720
you came to court too today.

199
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,720
My father died for the state.

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
Now

201
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,600
I am weak in body, and

202
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,750
my younger sister bears the burden alone,

203
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,720
defending Wei family's honor

204
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,630
with all her loyalty.

205
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,720
I cannot bear it,

206
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,480
so I beg for her sake.

207
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,480
General Chu, are you trying to sway

208
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,240
His Majesty with sentiment?

209
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,380
Seventy thousand loyal souls

210
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,240
lie buried in Baidi Valley, Your Majesty.

211
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,750
This cannot be investigated

212
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,870
overnight.

213
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,910
Please give

214
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,200
the Court more time.

215
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,840
I will definitely

216
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
unveil the truth.

217
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,030
If the Wei family is truly innocent,

218
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,440
we will clear their name.

219
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,230
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,510
seventy thousand

221
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,120
died because Wei Zhong

222
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,390
sought merit and acted rashly.

223
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,480
Seven members of the Wei family died.

224
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,160
Are their lives considered lives,

225
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,670
but the seventy thousand

226
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,030
are not?

227
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,200
Duke of Ning,

228
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,480
hearing you speak

229
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,600
so confidently,

230
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,510
one might think

231
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,750
you actually

232
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,320
was there in Baidi Valley.

233
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,600
Your Highness, you jest.

234
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
I am but a civil official,

235
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,000
unfit for the battlefield.

236
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,270
Good.

237
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,240
Since you insist,

238
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,750
I will support you.

239
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,150
A war I choose to fight,

240
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,510
I never lose.

241
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,040
Changming?

242
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,600
You came too?

243
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,240
Forgive me, Brother.

244
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,550
I shouldn't be here,

245
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,910
but this concerns Huan.

246
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,840
As his aunt,

247
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,680
I cannot stay away.

248
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,360
Her Highness is right.

249
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,750
Since the Crown Prince

250
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,150
and General Yao are here,

251
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,120
let them recount

252
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,550
the events so His Majesty

253
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
may judge fairly.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Huan is grown,

255
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,870
brave and capable

256
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,960
even in the battlefield.

257
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,510
About what happened in Baidi Valley,

258
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,480
even if he says nothing,

259
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,910
I believe

260
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,510
the Court

261
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,030
will uncover the truth.

262
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,360
As crown prince

263
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,600
and His Majesty's only bloodline,

264
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,840
he knows Him best.

265
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,270
His Majesty never spares

266
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,960
a guilty man

267
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,150
nor wrongs an innocent one.

268
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,280
Am I right,

269
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Huan?

270
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,150
Father,

271
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,510
though seventy thousand died,

272
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
the Wei family

273
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,310
has always been loyal.

274
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,560
Everything they did

275
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
was for the realm

276
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
and the people.

277
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,220
Their merits outweigh faults.

278
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,400
Please spare Wei Yun.

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,280
Your Majesty,

280
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,880
if a man sheds blood

281
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,350
for the realm,

282
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,400
yet his widows and orphans

283
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,480
must still suffer cold and scorn,

284
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,960
if a family that has fought

285
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,800
for four generations

286
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,160
still leaves its descendants disgraced,

287
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,350
then the hearts

288
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,750
of those

289
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,480
seventy thousand

290
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,240
who died will freeze.

291
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,080
Your Majesty,

292
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,790
for the Wei family's

293
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,510
century of loyalty,

294
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,400
please free Wei Yun.

295
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,790
We beg Your Majesty.

296
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,070
We beg Your Majesty.

297
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,920
- We beg Your Majesty.
- We beg Your Majesty.

298
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,590
- We beg Your Majesty.
- We beg Your Majesty.

299
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,920
- We beg Your Majesty.
- We beg Your Majesty.

300
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,480
Your Majesty,

301
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,310
this case is grave.

302
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,200
Even with all these pleas,

303
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,960
the law cannot be ignored.

304
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,830
Please rule impartially.

305
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,200
You rascal,

306
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,750
speaking wildly again.

307
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,680
Your Majesty,

308
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,750
if you add my plea,

309
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,750
surely it carries weight.

310
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,190
Your Majesty,

311
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,510
since even Duke of Hu

312
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,680
begs for the Wei family,

313
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,510
you might as well visit the Madam

314
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,310
of the Wei family at the palace gate.

315
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,070
Once you see her,

316
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,440
you will understand

317
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,440
why we kneel here

318
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,240
and plea for them.

319
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,720
(Chengqing Gate)
His Majesty arrives!

320
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,540
(Chengqing Gate)

321
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,720
Still pretending.

322
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,510
If you admire them so much,

323
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,240
wait till you die,

324
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,240
you can have your descendants

325
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,920
set out your memorial tablet too.

326
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,110
Mind your step, Your Majesty.

327
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,750
Whose wife are you?

328
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,590
Your Majesty,

329
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,480
I am

330
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,270
the wife

331
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,480
of General Wei Jun,

332
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,920
the daughter of Chu Jianchang, Chu Yu.

333
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,000
You kneel here asking to see me

334
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,200
for what matter?

335
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,750
My entire family has come

336
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,830
to beg Your Majesty

337
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,830
to release Wei Yun.

338
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
The state has its laws.

339
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes,

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,840
I understand.

341
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,400
Laws

342
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,590
are not for personal desires.

343
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,400
I was born into a military family

344
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
and once followed my father to war,

345
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,240
taking the protection of home as my duty,

346
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,920
the Wei family even more so.

347
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,480
I do not know what crime
the Wei family committed,

348
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,880
nor what crime Wei Yun committed.

349
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,440
I only know the Wei family's loyalty.

350
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,350
If Your Majesty

351
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,270
insists he pay

352
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,200
for his mistakes,

353
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,200
I beg you

354
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,920
let him die on the battlefield,

355
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
not

356
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,750
in prison,

357
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,280
to honor

358
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,550
the Wei family's devotion to the realm.

359
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,860
(Spirit Tablet of Wei Jun
Spirit Tablet of Wei Zhong)

360
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,180
(Spirit tablet of Wei Ya)

361
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,900
(Spirit tablet of Wei Rong)

362
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,270
Bring Wei Yun to court.

363
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,630
Yu.

364
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,590
Yu.

365
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,200
I, Wei Yun,

366
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,160
bows before Your Majesty.

367
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,670
What...

368
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,160
How did he get hurt like this?

369
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,200
He was only jailed,

370
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
how did it become this?

371
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
Cao Yan!

372
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,270
I did not know

373
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,590
the Court was this incompetent.

374
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,550
Do you only torture confessions out of people?

375
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,680
Your Majesty,

376
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,520
I am fearful.

377
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,920
I acted strictly under orders

378
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,270
and would never overstep.

379
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,790
Was it under imperial orders

380
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,960
that you whipped my father

381
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,590
and brothers' coffins in public?

382
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,790
Whipped Lady Yu?

383
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,960
And drove my mother to her death in the street?

384
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,200
The Wei family is a family of criminals.

385
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,550
If I am a criminal,

386
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,030
my guilt should be judged by His Majesty.

387
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
I ask you:

388
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,790
did His Majesty order these things?

389
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,920
Answer me.

390
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,030
I have not yet been convicted,

391
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,830
yet you abuse private punishment

392
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,960
and mistreat an official.

393
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,030
Was that under His Majesty's orders as well?

394
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,480
Chancellor.

395
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
Your Majesty.

396
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,790
The case is not yet concluded,

397
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,720
yet Mr. Cao

398
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,590
has disgraced the entire Wei family.

399
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,560
This is a shame

400
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,110
of our dynasty.

401
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,320
Guards!

402
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,200
Cao Yan, Minister of Justice,

403
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,440
for dereliction of duty and abuse of power,

404
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,000
take him to the dungeon

405
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,070
to await judgment.

406
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,920
Your Majesty!

407
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,070
I am innocent!

408
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,590
I acted for the state!

409
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,440
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

410
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,030
Your Majesty, have mercy!

411
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,160
Your Majesty! Spare me!

412
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,510
Your Majesty!

413
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

414
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,750
Your Majesty is wise.

415
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,520
Wei Zhong was

416
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,790
my study companion in childhood.

417
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,270
Since he died for the country,

418
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,910
I must

419
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,270
show care

420
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,550
for his bloodline.

421
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,320
Wei Yun,

422
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,310
I hope you live well

423
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,960
and restore the Wei household.

424
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,240
As long as you live,

425
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,750
the Wei family's spirit lives on.

426
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,040
Yun,

427
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,790
do you understand

428
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,550
my burdens?

429
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,510
I don't understand many things.

430
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,590
I only know

431
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,720
I am of the Wei family.

432
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,590
I will protect the realm,

433
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,240
the land, and the people,

434
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,270
with no regret in life or death.

435
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,870
Good.

436
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,520
Good.

437
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,400
Go back

438
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,510
and recover well.

439
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

Good,

469
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,590
you didn't keep me waiting long.

470
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,590
You haven't come to the palace in a long time.

471
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,200
Do you still remember this centennial soup?

472
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
You used to

473
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,880
love it.

474
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,280
Thank you, Brother.

475
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,920
But time has passed,

476
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,310
and my tastes have changed.

477
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,550
I fear I'll

478
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,510
disappoint you.

479
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,920
As long as you come often,

480
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,280
I'll have them

481
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,440
prepare anything you like.

482
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,760
Thank you.

483
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,640
I came today

484
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,960
to ask something of you.

485
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
I know,

486
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,110
you're here about

487
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,830
the Wei family.

488
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,350
Yes.

489
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm here for the Wei family,

490
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,550
and for you.

491
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,480
Your rule is already unstable,

492
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,310
do you not see it?

493
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,640
Generals of Chu and Wei have fallen
one after another,

494
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,550
as if the army has lost both arms.

495
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,880
Our state has been at war year after year.

496
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,030
Now even Wei Zhong is gone.

497
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,960
If you don't release Wei Yun

498
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,030
to lead the Wei household,

499
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,960
when war breaks out again,

500
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,430
who will hold the line?

501
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,480
I know you wish

502
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,160
to balance civil and military power

503
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,110
and avoid strong military clans
growing too close.

504
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,790
And I know the Duke of Ning

505
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,000
supports peace talks with North Qi

506
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,240
to gain time to recover,

507
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,270
to win without fighting.

508
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,070
But you cannot

509
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,590
negotiate from a losing position.

510
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
My rule

511
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,200
was built with your blood and tears.

512
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,680
I won't let you down.

513
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Since you already has a plan in mind,

514
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm relieved.

515
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,590
I'll take my leave.

516
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,070
When will you visit the palace again?

517
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,920
Whenever you summons me,

518
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,630
I will come.

519
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,000
But there are some past matters

520
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,510
I do not wish to hear again.

521
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,190
Back then,

522
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,920
so I could inherit

523
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,070
the throne,

524
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,440
Changming married the Jinxi Military Governor,

525
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,360
buying his support for me.

526
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,840
But after the wedding,

527
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,190
she suffered endless torment.

528
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,280
She has

529
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,920
escaped that misery,

530
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,710
yet I know

531
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,880
my Changming

532
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,030
has never

533
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,670
truly healed.

534
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,230
Those memories remain

535
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,190
a knot between us.

536
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,070
I

537
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,590
owe her so much.

538
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,840
My Lady,

539
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,360
the way you're drinking that medicine

540
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,400
looks like you're ready to die heroically.

541
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,400
Who'd imagine

542
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,550
our fearless Lady Chu

543
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,760
is actually

544
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,030
afraid of medicine?

545
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,360
Right,

546
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
how is Wei Yun?

547
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,720
General Wei,

548
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,760
I need to press out

549
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
the pus in your leg before applying medicine.

550
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,200
Bear with it.

551
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,030
Doctor,

552
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,400
please

553
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,240
be gentle.

554
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,360
I've seen mountains of corpses

555
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,200
on the battlefield,

556
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,910
how could I fear this?

557
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,360
It's bone-deep.

558
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,030
You must rest more.

559
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,110
I'll take my leave.

560
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,200
How is she?

561
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,800
Why do you care about him?

562
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,760
You look like this—

563
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
sick and wounded—

564
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,840
because of him.

565
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,360
And this is his family's home.

566
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,840
Plenty of people care for him here.

567
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,550
My lady,

568
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,190
even in the southwest,

569
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,030
you never fell ill like this.

570
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,510
But after just days in the Wei household,

571
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,670
you're making up

572
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,960
for every sickness

573
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,800
and disaster

574
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,150
you never had.

575
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,470
I don't regret it.

576
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,960
I don't regret saving Wei Yun.

577
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,200
My Lord.

578
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,200
Linyang?

579
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,720
Yu.

580
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,150
Yu.

581
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,990
Linyang,

582
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,430
why are you here?

583
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,510
You were gravely ill,

584
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,920
so I came to bring you home.

585
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
But seeing you like this,

586
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,190
you seem to be recovering well.

587
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,640
Of course!

588
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,760
Who am I?

589
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,630
I'm Chu Yu,

590
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,160
strong as ever.

591
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,670
But I still worry.

592
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,680
Yu,

593
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,950
come home with me.

594
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,070
There are many ways

595
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,400
to find the truth.

596
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,270
You don't have to sacrifice yourself like this.

597
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,070
- I can't just watch you...
- Linyang,

598
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,440
what I'm investigating

599
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,360
isn't solved yet.

600
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,960
The road I'm walking

601
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
hasn't reached its end.

602
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,320
Besides, didn't I save

603
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,280
Wei Yun today?

604
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,880
The Wei family hasn't fallen.

605
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And I believe

606
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,280
winter's snow will melt,

607
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,480
and spring's flowers will bloom.

608
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,910
I won't give up.

609
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,360
I will keep going.

610
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,000
Young General Chu

611
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,590
wanted to take Lady Chu back home,

612
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,550
but she

613
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,590
insisted on staying.

614
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,840
The doctor visited her.

615
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
She only needs

616
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,030
a few days' rest.

617
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,860
(Duke of Ning's Mansion)

618
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
Duke.

619
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,070
Academician Gu,

620
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,880
in court today,

621
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,670
what possessed you

622
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,760
to forget

623
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,550
who granted you

624
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,590
your current success?

625
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,280
You're angry that

626
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
I didn't stand up for you?

627
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,800
Father,

628
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,510
the doctor said your liver fire is high.

629
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Please don't get angry.

630
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,280
Drink some tea please.

631
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,910
Chusheng

632
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,670
is not an ungrateful man.

633
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,280
There must be

634
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,920
a misunderstanding.

635
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,320
Here,

636
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,720
have some tea.

637
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,190
If you won't drink it,

638
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,760
I won't believe any "misunderstanding."

639
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,870
Father,

640
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,070
the tea is very hot.

641
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,360
His seat is also very hot.

642
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,070
Let him feel it.

643
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,070
Thank you for the tea.

644
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,350
Wait.

645
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,640
Let me

646
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,840
fill your cup to the brim.

647
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,150
You know it's hot now?

648
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,440
So listen.

649
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,320
Otherwise, go back to the southwest.

650
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,800
There's only cold tea there.

651
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,800
I will remember

652
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,510
your teachings,

653
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,280
Duke.

654
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:53,990
