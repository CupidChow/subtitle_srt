Father!

Chun,

25
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,310
you usually help Mother

26
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,150
with the household

27
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,910
and take care of our Chun'er.

28
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,120
It's truly hard on you.

29
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,680
Don't say that.

30
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,630
I just hope

31
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,800
you can stay a little longer this time.

32
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,430
Chun,

33
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,870
I'm not leaving this time.

34
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
I'll stay

35
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,240
with you forever.

36
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,710
Zhong,

37
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,470
why are you leaving

38
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,680
earlier than planned?

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
The Wei family protects the nation.

40
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,360
When there's war we must go.

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Don't worry,

42
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
I'll return

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
victorious.

44
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,030
I'll await your safe return.

45
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,630
No problem.

46
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,310
Shu bought Chun jewelry.

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,870
Buy me one too,

48
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,710
okay?

49
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,680
Hearing you makes

50
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,270
my hand ache again.

51
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,270
Shut up!

52
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,800
I'll beat you up!

53
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
Don't be mad.

54
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,070
Don't be mad.

55
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,360
When I return from the campaign

56
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,560
I'll buy you one

57
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
even better than Chun's.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
I can't believe a blockhead like you

59
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,920
actually got a wife.

60
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,080
Take a bite, come on.

61
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
You...

62
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,590
You blockhead!

63
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
Delicious.

64
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,000
You're still smiling!

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,510
You're annoying.

66
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,680
If one day

67
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,750
I don't return from the campaign,

68
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
find your own life.

69
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Remarry

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
or leave.

71
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't waste your youth

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,270
stuck in the Wei household

73
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,600
for my sake.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
Rong!

75
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,710
Rong!

76
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,430
I can see you,

77
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,480
don't hide.

78
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
Rong!

79
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Rong!

80
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,720
Soon you'll be a father

81
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
and still so childish.

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
Rong!

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,510
Lan.

84
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,480
Lan.

85
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,390
Lan.

86
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,560
I thought I'd never find you again.

87
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,720
Lan,

88
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,350
I'm...

89
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,270
I'm afraid you'll never find me again.

90

00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
Wei Ya!

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Wei Rong!

97
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
Wei Yun!

98
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,630
(Undying Loyalty)
Ancestors of the Wei family above,

99
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,000
your descendants

100
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,320
swear here:

101
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,480
After decades of sharpening our swords,

102
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,510
we will again slay North Qi's fiends,

103
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,000
bring welfare to Great Sui's people,

104
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,480
and protect our land

105
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,870
until peace returns.

106
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,360
We pray our ancestors

107
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,390
bless us with a victorious return.

What's that smell?

111
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,390
It's the granary!

112
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,790
Water!

113
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,630
Put out the fire!

114
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,360
- Get water!
- There's fire!

115
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,840
- This way!
- Someone help!

116
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,680
Quick!

117
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,550
Find more water!

118
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,390
Put out the fire!

119
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,200
Put it out!

120
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,680
- Put the fire out!
- Bring water!

121
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,350
- Hurry!
- Help!

122
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
Over here!

123
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Be quick!

124
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,230
Bring more people!

125
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,630
Come on! Hurry!

126
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,000
Make it quick!

127
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
That way!

128
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,470
Hurry!

129
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,670
Get more water!

130
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,030
- Here, here!
- This way!

131
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,120
Carry what's not burning away!

132
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,960
Quick!

133
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,620
Give me a hand here!

134
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,790
North Qi retreating to Baidi Valley

135
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,290
should have kept them occupied.

136
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,960
Why send men to burn our granary?

137
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
Report!

138
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,990
Young General,

139
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,960
all our generals

140
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,360
are trapped in Baidi Valley.

141
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,870
Please send urgent rescue.

142
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,600
Weren't we supposed to have the advantage?

143
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,960
The intelligence was wrong.

144
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
North Qi's forces

145
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,510
are over four times

146
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,350
our estimate.

147
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,510
Our army is hard-pressed

148
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,870
and cannot break out.

149
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
Leave some to continue fighting the fire,

150
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,350
the rest,

151
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,000
follow me to reinforce Baidi Valley.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,320
- Yes!
- Young General!

153
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,920
(Octagonal crossbow?)

154
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,260
Charge!

155
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,870
(Wei)
Charge!

156
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Jun!

157
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,510
Protect the general!

158
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,150
Brothers, come on!

159
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,630
Jun.

160
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,200
I told you to guard the camp,

161
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,030
why didn't you listen?

162
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
I...

163
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,320
Jun.

164
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,580
(Wei)

165
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,180
(Wei)

166
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,420
(Wei)

167
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,590
And,

168
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,750
there's a mole in the Arsenal Bureau.

169
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,150
They gave the octagonal crossbow plans

170
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,320
to North Qi.

171
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,350
Find...

172
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,750
Find him.

173
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,310
Find him.

174
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,000
Yun,

175
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,040
I'm sorry.

176
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,440
From now on

177
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,680
we will leave you

178
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,350
to face what comes alone.

179
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200
No, Jun!

180
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,790
I'm sorry.

181
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,320
No!

182
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,630
No!

183
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
Jun!

184
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,350
Sir!

185
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
The Marquis of Zhenguo has fallen!

186
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,440
General Wei Shu has fallen!

187
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,350
Captain Wei Qin has fallen!

188
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,400
Captain Wei Feng has fallen!

189
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,510
Deputy Captain Wei Ya has fallen!

190
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,680
Deputy Captain Wei Rong has fallen!

191
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,790
Retreat.

192
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,480
Fall back to Tianshou Pass

193
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
to prevent North Qi from

194
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,750
attacking Huajing again.

195
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,310
Yes!

196
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,860
(Great Sui Imperial Palace)

197
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,110
Father,

198
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,640
this was not my fault.

199
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,270
It... It was Wei Zhong.

200
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,110
He was greedy for glory

201
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,080
and reckless in pursuit.

202
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,510
He ignored my advice

203
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,830
and chased the fleeing enemy,

204
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
falling right into North Qi's ambush.

205
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,720
(Emperor Chunde of Great Sui)
He caused Great Sui

206
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,050
to lose seventy thousand elite soldiers!

207
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,800
Advice?

208
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,880
How did you advice him?

209
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,510
When Wei Zhong proposed the pursuit,

210
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,310
I told him again and again:

211
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Never block a retreating army.

212
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
Don't chase a cornered foe.

213
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,590
But he...

214
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,040
But he

215
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,680
dismissed me

216
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,070
as too young

217
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,000
and inexperienced.

218
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,000
General Yao...

219
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,510
He can testify.

220
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,590
Yao Yong,

221
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
is this true?

222
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,160
Your Majesty,

223
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,920
every word His Highness said

224
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,270
is true.

225
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Duke of Ning,

226
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,110
in your view,

227
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,960
is the Crown Prince blameless?

228
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
Your Majesty,

229
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,030
not entirely.

230
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,020
(Wang Jingzhi, Duke of Ning)
His fault lies in

231
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,920
lacking command authority

232
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,000
as the Crown Prince.

233
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,070
Though he saw danger,

234
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,920
he failed to stop it.

235
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,590
Yet, Your Majesty,

236
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,830
His Highness

237
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,680
is still young.

238
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,030
That he could sense the danger

239
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,000
is already rare.

240
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,680
You are all dismissed.

241
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,920
Father, please see my sincerity.

242
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,550
I take my leave.

243
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,760
My Lady!

244
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,910
My Lady!

245
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
The whole city's talking:

246
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,790
the Wei army's been defeated,

247
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,070
their entire clan wiped out.

248
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,550
Seventy thousand soldiers perished

249
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,040
in Baidi Valley!

250
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,720
Their whole family

251
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,280
are gone?

252
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,880
My Lady,

253
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,830
where are you going?

254
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,660
(Best regards. Wei Jun)

255
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,420
(Investigate the Arsenal Bureau.
Best regards. Wei Jun)

256
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,400
Such loyal soldiers,

257
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,070
pillars of the nation.

258
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,070
Why is there no justice for them?

259
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,510
Heaven has no eyes!

260
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Your Majesty,

261
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,440
the loss of seventy thousand

262
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,400
elite troops at Baidi Valley

263
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,510
is catastrophic.

264
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,550
The Crown Prince may be forgiven,

265
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,830
but the Wei family

266
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,480
cannot escape blame.

267
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,480
Seven great generals

268
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,830
have fallen.

269
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,070
I know Your Majesty meant well,

270
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,640
but the people won't understand.

271
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,240
This morning,

272
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,750
the Ministries of Rites,

273
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,310
Revenue, and Personnel

274
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,350
all came to discuss this matter.

275
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,830
We know Your Majesty

276
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,590
favors the Wei family too much.

277
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,830
But people will think Your Majesty

278
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,920
favors them too much.

279
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,920
Public resentment will grow.

280
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,840
And I heard

281
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,790
the General Wei Yun returns

282
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,150
to the capital today with the coffins.

283
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,920
Your Majesty should

284
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,070
decide soon.

285
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,200
About the Wei family case,

286
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,510
after the Marquis's burial, hand it over

287
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,240
to the Court of Judicial Review.

288
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,110
But...

289
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Duke of Ning,

290
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,440
what say you?

291
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,590
Wise decision, Your Majesty.

292
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm weary.

293
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,200
You may leave.

294
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,550
Does Great Sui

295
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
no longer have soldiers

296
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,510
who can guard our borders

297
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,350
and resist the enemy?

298
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Must I truly

299
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,830
make peace with North Qi?

300
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,030
The Crown Prince is useless.

301
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,200
What will become of

302
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,510
Great Sui's future?

303
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,460
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

304
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,820
(True Might)

305
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,820
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

306
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,440
- Mother!
- Mother!

307
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,390
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

308
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,150
Mother!

309
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,480
Mother!

310
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,830
I, Wei Yun,

311
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,920
have returned with my father and brothers.

312
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,800
Mother!

313
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,150
Sisters!

314
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,510
I'm sorry.

315
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,520
Yun...

316
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,320
- Mother.
- Rong!

317
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,750
Yun.

318
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,920
Yun.

319
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,510
Mother!

320
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,840
My husband

321
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,790
and my sons

322
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
died for Great Sui.

323
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
They were heroes,

324
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,400
true men of loyalty and honor!

325
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,640
All of you...

326
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,590
You did well.

327
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,980
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

328
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,640
You did well!

329
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,480
Brother Wei!

330
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:57,300
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

331
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,590
Lady Chu, are you here

332
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,640
to shame the Wei family?

333
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,720
Before Wei Jun went to war,

334
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,550
we secretly agreed we'd marry each other

335
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,720
after he returns from the battlefield.

336
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,590
Now that he's returned,

337
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,240
I've come to fulfill our promise.

338
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,790
My brother never

339
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,830
told me about that.

340
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,200
Then you don't know

341
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,510
what passed between us.

342
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,070
Thank you, Mother.

343
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,910
Jun,

344
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,110
I had hoped

345
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,920
to see you wed this time.

346
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,550
Once I return in victory,

347
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,550
you will see me marry.

348
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,830
You already have someone in mind?

349
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,880
Mother,

350
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,720
we'll talk

351
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,800
after I return.

352
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,110
Just wait for us.

353
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,670
Yun,

354
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:00,960
put down the sword.

355
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,510
My son went to the afterlife alone.

356
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,270
He failed you, Lady Chu.

357
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,680
Please, go home.

358
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,240
That day at the Spring Breeze House,

359
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
I confessed to Wei Jun.

360
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,790
Everyone mocked me for shamelessness,

361
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,720
but only he

362
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,640
understood my courage to love.

363
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,680
Lady Chu,

364
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,310
do you realize that if you marry him,

365
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,270
you'll be a widow?

366
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,200
Marriage is a lifelong matter,

367
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,960
does your mother even know?

368
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
Chu Yu!

369
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,070
Where are you going dressed like that?

370
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
I'm going to marry Wei Jun

371
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,590
to fulfill our promise.

372
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
After Baidi Valley,

373
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,550
the Wei family's defeat

374
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,270
dragged down seventy thousand men!

375
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,680
The Wei family is ruined.

376
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,720
What are you doing?

377
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,800
I said before,

378
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,880
this isn't just for me.

379
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,680
No one will stop me today.

380
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,040
Chu Yu!

381
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,160
How long will you keep making a scene?

382
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,680
Will you only stop

383
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,920
once you've completely ruined

384
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,110
the Chu family's name?

385
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,840
Chu Linyang,

386
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,350
why aren't you stopping your sister?

387
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,070
She always listens to you.

388
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,240
Linyang,

389
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,750
I don't have a choice,

390
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,270
at least not now.

391
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
Mother,

392
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,200
let her go.

393
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,880
Chu Yu,

394
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,590
if you dare step out

395
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,070
of this house today,

396
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,550
you are

397
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,680
no longer of the Chu family.

398
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,830
I've told my mother before coming.

399
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,750
I know marriage is a serious matter,

400
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,270
one decided by parents

401
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
and matchmakers.

402
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,750
But I, Chu Yu,

403
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,630
will only

404
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,510
follow my own heart in this life.

405
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,070
Lady Chu,

406
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,920
it's not that the Wei family won't accept you,

407
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
but if you enter this house today,

408
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,510
you'll be widowed.

409
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,590
How could I bear that?

410
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,710
Mrs. Wei, you were young once too,

411
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,760
and you've known the pain

412
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,070
of losing the one you love.

413
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,590
You must understand

414
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
how I feel now.

415
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,320
Today,

416
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,190
I swear by cutting my hair

417
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,030
I marry Wei Jun,

418
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,710
with no regrets, no remorse.

419
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,510
From this day on,

420
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,030
Wei Jun is my husband.

421
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,480
If no one will mourn him,

422
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,030
I will.

423
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,070
If no one will live as his widow,

424
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,550
I will.

425
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,440
The first branch of the family still stands.

426
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,110
If you refuse me entry today,

427
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,000
I'll kneel here and never rise

428
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,630
until Wei Jun

429
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,000
is laid to rest.

430
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,360
Wei Jun,

431
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,070
I remember

432
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
every promise we made.

433
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,800
I will keep them.

434
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
I must,

435
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,360
and I will.

436
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,400
Mother,

437
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
everyone in Huajing

438
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,280
knows of this by now.

439
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,000
If we turn her away,

440
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,840
her life will

441
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,000
only be harder.

442
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,150
Let her have this.

443
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Lady Chu,

444
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,150
come inside and change your clothes.

445
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,360
We'll discuss the rest

446
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,280
after the burial.

447
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,470
Mother,

448
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,030
she's really not...

449
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,760
Yun,

450
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,350
take your father

451
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,630
and brothers

452
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,920
home first.

453
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,440
Her Ladyship gifted you

454
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,400
a new inkstone.

455
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,030
I'll take this one out.

456
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,640
Put it down.

457
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,990
My Lord,

458
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,000
Lady Chu went

459
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,510
dressed in wedding clothes,

460
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,920
married into the Wei family herself.

461
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,480
Why are you still thinking about her?

462
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,350
Leave me.

463
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,400
Beat him!

464
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,240
Beat him to death!

465
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,000
Beat him to death!

466
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,320
I said it, so what?

467
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,590
I won't let anyone

468
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,430
insult her!

469
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,360
Keep hitting him!

470
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,280
Harder!

471
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,280
- Let's go!
- Go!

472
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,760
They ran off!

473
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,960
You always told me

474
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,590
to treat others with courtesy,

475
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,070
that a gentleman uses words, not fists.

476
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,920
So why are you fighting today?

477
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,590
They slandered you.

478
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,070
How could I still cling to
"gentlemanly conduct"?

479
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,350
That title means nothing if I can't defend you.

480
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,190
In that case,

481
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,360
if you truly want to protect me,

482
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,670
I'll teach you martial arts.

483
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,640
You're so skilled,

484
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,190
why should I bother learning?

485
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,990
How about this:

486
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,350
you stay

487
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,960
by my side always

488
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,680
and protect me.

489
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,840
Alright?

490
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:04,910
Alright.

491
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,230
From now on,

492
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,360
I'll stay by your side

493
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,590
and protect you for life.

494
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,710
Here, a new inkstone for you.

495
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,110
Your exams are near.

496
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,920
May your words

497
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
flow clearly,

498
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,920
your mind stay calm,

499
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,190
and your name reach the top of the list.

500
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,400
Okay.

501
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,230
I'll try to do that.

502
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,820
(Chu)

503
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,910
The "Chu" as in Chu Yu?

504
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,670
Also as in Gu Chusheng.

505
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,420
(Chu)

506
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,030
Don't worry.

507
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,710
I won't let you down.

508
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,070
Tonight is our wedding night.

509
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,590
Where are you going?

510
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
We're both tired.

511
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Let's rest early.

512
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,760
I'm never one to cling to the past.

513
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,280
How do you know

514
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,840
I came for you?

515
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,760
Today

516
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,960
I have come for

517
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Young General Wei Jun.

518
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,220
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

519
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:59,140
(In Pines and Bamboos)

520
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,550
Brother Wei,

521
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,840
forgive me

522
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,880
for entering the Wei household

523
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,840
this way.

524
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,630
This matter may be

525
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,030
graver than we thought.

526
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,320
But I promise you,

527
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,590
once I uncover the truth,

528
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,030
I'll leave and confess my guilt

529
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280
myself.

530
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,720
Who's there?

531
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,280
My Lady, it's me.

532
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,880
Why are you here?

533
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,550
Lord Linyang sent me.

534
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,960
He said you shouldn't

535
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,190
face all this alone.

536
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,880
My Lady,

537
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,670
why did you leave me behind?

538
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
Didn't I say

539
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,190
I'd follow you

540
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,360
through fire and blades?

541
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,880
Look at you!

542
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,710
You want to suffer with me?

543
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,510
Whether it's pain or joy,

544
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,400
wherever you are, My Lady,

545
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,280
that's where I'll be.

546
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,350
Alright then.

547
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,710
I'm going to the mourning hall.

548
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,550
You

549
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,720
stay here.

550
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,710
You're leaving me behind again.

551
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,840
Lady Chun!

552
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,760
Lady Chun!

553
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,510
My Lady!

554
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,510
No, My Lady!

555
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,510
