1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,560
I love you.

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,790
Takumi.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,590
I know.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,760
Stop it. Look forward.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,910
Forward.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,050
What's wrong? Don't you believe me?

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,510
- That I'm in love with Takumi.
- That's not it!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,570
Hey, Saki Giichi!

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,770
What are you whispering about with your neighbor?

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,530
Stand up.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Yes.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,940
Saki.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,370
What is the population of Moscow?

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,410
I've never been to Moscow, so I wouldn't know.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,300
Oh, is that so?

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,720
Then what places do you know?

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Well...

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,650
United States, Japan, UK, France, Ireland, Austria,

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,350
Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Sri Lanka.

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,470
And...

21
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,880
You may sit down.

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,330
But be quiet.

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,870
Yes.

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,510
Now then.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,070
Regarding population migration after World War II...

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,890
It can be broadly divided into
migration to the Americas and to Russia.

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,470
Of these, immigration to Russia...

28
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,230
because Russia shares a land border
with many European countries...

29
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,110
the circumstances were rather unique.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
(Mouthing) I love you.

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,890
This school, nestled deep in the mountains...

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,000
is an isolated, all-boys boarding school.

33
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,720
Its name is Shido Gakuin High School.

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,880
The school was founded...

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,220
in the early Showa period.

36
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,660
I hear that it once only admitted...

37
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,540
the sons of prominent families.

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,850
But now, even boys from ordinary families...

39
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,000
study here side by side.

40
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Hey, Takabayashi.

41
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,570
This is for the exhibition.

42
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,260
Ah, thanks.

43
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,820
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,300
(Student Council Room)

45
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,020
Compared to when it was first established...

46
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,100
its aristocratic atmosphere...

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,020
has faded considerably.

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
However...

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,700
among them...

50
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,070
is a transfer student from the United States.

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,020
An extraordinarily wealthy young man.

52
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,190
Saki Giichi.

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
Known as...

54
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,410
Gii.

55
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,560
That Genda...

56
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,650
he always has it out for me.

57
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,110
He calls on me at least once every class.

58
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,610
Well, maybe you shouldn't do things
that make the teacher mad.

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,690
But I just want to tell you I love you, Takumi.

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,770
You say it so often...

61
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,840
it sounds like you're kidding.

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Takumi.

63
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,020
I'm serious.

64
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,260
I know.

65
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,510
Then right here...

66
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,880
kiss me.

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,830
Huh?!

68
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Well?

69
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,270
Go on.

70
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,550
I don't want to die yet.

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,030
Why would you die?

72
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,410
Gii has absolutely no idea.

73
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,020
My high school life...

74
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,820
has already been turned completely upside down.

75
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,950
That's right.

76
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,620
It all started on that day.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
When I became a second-year...

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,090
the dorm roommate assignments were posted.

79
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,430
Huh?

80
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,940
What am I going to do?

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,330
Just by being Gii's roommate...

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,770
I'm already getting a ton of unwanted attention.

83
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,140
And on top of that...

84
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,340
if people find out that Gii and I are a couple...

85
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,210
Hey, if you don't hurry,
we'll lose our seats in the cafeteria.

86
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,600
You're right, Akaike-kun!

87
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,540
Let's go.

88
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,750
- Hey! Wait up, Takumi!
- Don't run.

89
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,860
Let's go, Takumi! Hurry!

90
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,600
I told you, don't run.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
"Takumi-kun series -Drama-"
(Episode 1)

92
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,070
This is rare.

93
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,500
You're not with Gii.

94
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,300
Well...

95
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,020
Gii and Akaike-kun are still...

96
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
You're as predictable as ever.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Never mind that.

98
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,470
You'd better not get too close to Gii.

99
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,070
Otherwise, people might get the wrong idea
about your "relationship."

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
"The wrong idea?"

101
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Friends with benefits.

102
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,020
You know, sex partners.

103
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,650
Friends with...

104
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,630
You've got to be kidding me.

105
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,470
Gii and I just happen to be roommates,
and happen to be the class and vice class presidents.

106
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,400
But you and Gii are alone in your room every night.
There's no way people will believe nothing's happening.

107
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,790
If you fooled around with every roommate you had,

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,840
things would be a total mess.

109
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,270
Gii is different.

110
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,250
Huh?

111
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
Don't tell me...

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,500
Nogawa-kun.

113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
You have a thing for Gii?

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,820
That's not what I said.

115
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,350
Hayama.

116
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
Sorry for the wait.

117
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Oh.

118
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,460
Here, this is for you, Takumi.

119
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
Thanks.

120
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,890
Thanks for the food.

121
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,050
Gii and I...

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,380
are friends with benefits...

123
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,640
Is that what everyone thinks of us?

124
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,650
Come in.

125
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,890
Excuse me.

126
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,500
Not you again, Shingyoji.

127
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,920
Working late, Arata-san.

128
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,570
I don't recall giving you permission to enter.

129
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,470
Stay back.

130
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,180
I can't let you see these documents.

131
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Sorry.

132
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,700
Working overtime again?

133
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,820
It's routine.

134
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,760
The student council has a ton of work.

135
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,260
The other members already went home for the day.

136
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,430
Oh, I see.

137
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
Arata-san.

138
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,210
Any plans for Golden Week?

139
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,090
Didn't you hear me?

140
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,270
I probably can't go home.

141
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,790
You too, right?

142
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,270
Yes.

143
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,560
I have to train hard for the summer tournament.

144
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,730
The main players are second and third-years,

145
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,910
but first-years still have a shot.

146
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,010
Don't get discouraged. Keep it up.

147
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,790
- Yes! I'll do my best!
- Stop.

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,580
Do not come within two meters of me.

149
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Ah.

150
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,190
Sorry...

151
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,630
Wait for me, Arata-san!

152
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,220
Arata-san! Arata-san!

153
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,940
Please don't ignore me, Arata-san!

154
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,900
Let's go back to the dorm together!

155
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,810
Stop.

156
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,930
Listen up.

157
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,700
From now on, do not invade my personal space. Ever.

158
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,690
Goodbye.

159
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,290
That's so harsh...

160
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,890
Arata-san.

161
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,600
By the way, what's "personal space"...?

162
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
Ah.

163
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
Hello.

164
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,580
I remember...

165
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,850
That boy...

166
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,920
He's a first-year...

167
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,150
Takumi.

168
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,270
Toshihisa.

169
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,370
I've been worried about you.

170
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,970
We were roommates during our first year,

171
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,730
so I could still look out for you.

172
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,380
Yeah.

173
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,490
I'm grateful.

174
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,030
You were the only one, Toshihisa,
who treated me kindly.

175
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,780
You were in pretty bad shape
during your first year, Takumi.

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,580
You would go ages without saying a word.

177
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,450
And you got all those weird nicknames.

178
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,850
Emotionless.

179
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,970
Apathetic.

180
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Cold-blooded.

181
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,090
Even human-hater and germaphobe, right?

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

183
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,790
Ah, sorry.

184
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,190
That was a bit blunt of me.

185
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
Bringing up things you're sensitive about.

186
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,460
It's the truth, though.

187
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,710
But you know...

188
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,510
when I heard who your roommate was this year...

189
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,020
that it was Gii...

190
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,300
I thought it was going to be a disaster.

191
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
But now, I'm actually relieved.

192
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,390
Huh?

193
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,510
Because...

194
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,220
with someone like Gii...

195
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,570
I doubt he'd be swayed by any rumors.

196
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,560
And I feel like he's someone
who can really understand you.

197
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,720
So, how is it?

198
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,580
Are you and Gii getting along?

199
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
Yeah.

200
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
I guess...

201
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
it's going okay.

202
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,490
That's a relief.

203
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,250
Takumi, aren't you going to take a shower?

204
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,900
Oh, um...

205
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,030
I still have a little homework left.
I want to finish it up.

206
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,890
Homework?

207
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,650
We have homework?

208
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,290
Oh...

209
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,560
An English essay.

210
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,650
You're so lucky your English is good, Gii.

211
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,330
I was in the US until I was 15,
so of course it is.

212
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Can I borrow your pen?

213
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Sure.

214
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,220
Here.

215
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,120
Let's see...

216
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,580
This sentence is really well-written.

217
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,090
But a different word might work better here.

218
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,010
For example...

219
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,410
Instead of "uncleanly"...

220
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,070
try something like "dirty."

221
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,020
Hey, aren't you going to bed?

222
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Hmm...

223
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,490
Pretty soon.

224
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,890
Let's get some sleep.

225
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Just a little longer.

226
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,610
I've been letting my schoolwork slide
because of club activities.

227
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,210
Well then...

228
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm going to head to bed first.

229
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
Okay.

230
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Yeah, you go ahead.

231
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
Oh, sorry.

232
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,800
You won't be able to sleep with the light on.

233
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,450
There's still some time before lights out.

234
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,820
I'll go work in the common room.

235
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,870
Good night.

236
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,220
Good night.

237
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,280
What's his deal?

238
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Yoshizawa, you idiot.

239
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Morning.

240
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,510
Good... morning.

241
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Hey, wait up.

242
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
You're...

243
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,650
You're Hayama Takumi, aren't you?

244
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,530
Yes.

245
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,550
And you know who I am, right?

246
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,690
No...

247
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,690
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,300
Well, I can't let you go
until you get to know me.

249
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,210
Whoa, hold on...

250
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,470
Relax, I'm not gonna bite.

251
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,070
See? I just wanted to ask you out.

252
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,690
It's an invitation to a date.

253
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,840
I appreciate the offer, but...

254
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,870
I'm not interested.

255
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,590
Come on, wait.

256
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,630
Hey, Takumi!

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
What's going on?

258
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:40,930
Oh.

259
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Gii.

260
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I'll ask you out again later!

261
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
That guy...

262
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,700
The captain of the third-year basketball team...

263
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Nozaki.

264
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,000
(Disciplinary Committee Room)

265
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,530
Excuse me.

266
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,030
Oh, Akaike.

267
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,050
Sorry for calling you in during your lunch break.

268
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
It's no problem.

269
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,640
So, what did you need to see me about?

270
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,000
It's about our first meeting.

271
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,320
As the committee chairman, I'd like to make a list
of things we need to do beforehand.

272
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,140
Have a seat.

273
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,080
Oh, pardon me.

274
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,850
Could you give me a hand with that?

275
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,510
Of course.

276
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,160
Ever since last year...

277
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,150
I guess I'm the only weirdo willing to do a thankless job
like the Disciplinary Committee two years in a row.

278
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,570
I suppose so.

279
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,000
Well then, let's make that list.

280
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Let's see...

281
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
First off...

282
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,020
We should probably put together
an agenda for the meeting.

283
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Right.

284
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,530
What else?

285
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,620
For the school rule patrols, we go in pairs.

286
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,740
- Right.
- It might be a good idea to decide on the pairings beforehand.

287
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,850
- I see.
- Yes.

288
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Takumi.

289
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,380
Pass me another roll.

290
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
Sure.

291
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,610
That's your fourth one, you know.

292
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,630
Thanks.

293
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,450
That guy Genda...

294
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,510
He seems to be holding a grudge,
ordering me around all the time.

295
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
I'm starving because of him.

296
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,610
Do you want this one?

297
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,530
I've already started it, though.

298
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,690
You're the best!

299
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,590
Ah...

300
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,430
Finally, I'm full.

301
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,720
Hey, Takumi...

302
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,450
Yeah?

303
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,900
Let me rest my head on your lap.

304
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,690
Huh?

305
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,840
I just want to rest a bit.

306
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,050
Wait, Gii...

307
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,170
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not asking for a kiss.

308
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,330
We're a couple, aren't we?

309
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,670
What's the big deal
about me resting my head on your lap?

310
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,090
Huh...

311
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,520
Just this is more than enough for me...

312
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,810
Mm.

313
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,580
Thanks.

314
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,870
Gii...

315
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,290
For so, so long...

316
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,870
I always felt like
he was from a world completely out of my reach...

317
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,220
For us to be like this...

318
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,460
How long can it possibly last?

319
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,670
Being a couple...

320
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,080
means that one day...

321
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,080
we'll surely take the next step...

322
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Huh?

323
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,460
Takumi...

324
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,770
Oh, is lunch break over?

325
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,620
No...

326
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
That was...

327
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,080
the bell for the end of fifth period.

328
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,260
Oh no, fifth period was English.

329
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,070
I'm already so bad at it.

330
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,950
If the teacher gets on my case again...

331
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
What am I gonna do...?

332
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,570
Takumi.

333
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,070
In that case, let's just skip sixth period too.

334
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,710
Don't be ridiculous.

335
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,590
We have to go back.

336
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,630
Everyone's probably talking about us by now.

337
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,350
Talking about what...?

338
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Isn't it obvious?

339
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,420
Us disappearing together for an hour.

340
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,170
About what Takumi...

341
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,350
and I were doing.

342
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Oh...

343
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,850
- We should go back separately.
- That'll just look more suspicious.

344
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,220
Then what are we supposed to do?

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
Good question.

346
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,070
Instead of letting them make things up...

347
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,430
why don't we give them something real to talk about?

348
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,880
What do you mean by that...?

349
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,100
Let's enjoy ourselves so much we lose all track of time.

350
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,730
See ya, Gii!

351
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,060
You've got some nerve, Hayama.

352
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,050
Grades aside...

353
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,680
I never thought someone as serious
and straight-laced as you would skip class.

354
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,870
No, it's just that...

355
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,240
By the way, where's Gii?

356
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,220
He was with you, wasn't he?

357
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
No, he wasn't.

358
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,930
Hmm.

359
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,060
So, where were you?

360
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,590
Uh, I accidentally fell asleep in the courtyard.

361
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,780
I see.

362
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
In that case...

363
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,440
I'll be sure to confirm that with Gii later.

364
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,490
I completely fell for Akaike-kun's leading questions.

365
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,710
Akaike-kun...

366
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,920
Just how much does he know about us?

367
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,650
In any case, from now on...

368
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,370
I have to be more careful.

369
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,360
Past tense...

370
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,610
Past perfect.

371
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,750
What does that even mean?

372
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,390
It's better to use "used to" here.

373
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Huh?

374
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
Oh...

375
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Oh...

376
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
I see.

377
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,190
You've got a scientific mind, Takumi.

378
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,830
Because you're such a purist, you can't be satisfied
unless there's only one right answer.

379
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,470
- That's not true...
- Yes, it is.

380
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,410
You can't help but put a label on everyone.

381
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,930
"This guy is just a classmate..."

382
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,680
"This one is just an acquaintance..."

383
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
"And this guy is just my roommate."

384
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,600
When it comes to how other people's feelings might change...

385
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,980
you choose to ignore it, don't you?

386
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,660
Gii, what are you talking about...?

387
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,180
Because your own feelings never change, Takumi,

388
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,560
you just assume no one else's do either.

389
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,840
Gii...

390
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,170
Like what happened today...

391
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,530
You hated the idea of people thinking we were together.

392
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,410
That's why you ran away, isn't it?

393
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,710
Because I do hate being misunderstood!

394
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,280
Don't be an idiot! I'm in love with you, Takumi!

395
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,210
What man in this world...

396
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,780
can stay indifferent to the person he loves?

397
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,080
Have you ever once stopped to think about how I feel?

398
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,960
I'm sorry... Gii.

399
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,030
If "sorry" is all you can say...

400
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Takumi...

401
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,030
Gii?!

402
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,630
I love you.

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Takumi.

404
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,430
Stop it, Gii!

405
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,760
Gii is always true to his own heart.

406
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,530
But I...

407
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,760
I don't even understand my own feelings.

408
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,150
Why...

409
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
Takumi...

410
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,130
Besides...

411
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,540
there's a reason...

412
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
why I can't...

413
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,090
move forward.
