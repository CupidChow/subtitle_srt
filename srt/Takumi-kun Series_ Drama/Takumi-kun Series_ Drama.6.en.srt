1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,250
Are you okay?

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Yeah...

3
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,080
Train tickets?

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
Yeah.

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,570
My mother asked me to go back
to visit the family grave.

6
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,070
Visit a grave?

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,180
Whose grave?

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,470
Hayama Naoto.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,700
My older brother.

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,060
He'd be 22 if he were still alive.

11
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,030
Three years ago,

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,210
he passed away in the hospital.

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,690
What was his illness?

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
His heart.

15
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,710
It was congenital.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,810
But...

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,440
he was still able to go to P.E. class.

18
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,270
I didn't think it was very serious.

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,570
Gii...

20
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,240
You said it before, didn't you?

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,290
That I'm terrible at expressing myself.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,540
Huh...?

23
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,070
Either that,

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,630
or I have human-touch aversion.

25
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,460
Human-touch aversion?

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,900
When you pointed that out, Gii,

27
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,130
I was honestly surprised.

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,300
Because everyone else would just say

29
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,520
I was a weirdo,

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,050
or that I hated people,

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,290
and then avoid me.

32
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,820
As for why

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,000
I became like that...

34
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,570
The reason is...

35
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,100
my brother who passed away.

36
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,750
Takumi.

37
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,210
It's okay. If it's too painful...

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,450
I want you to hear it, Gii.

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
That day,

40
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,980
for some reason,
my brother snuck out of the hospital.

41
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,550
All day,

42
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,680
in a rainy forest,

43
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,110
without even an umbrella,

44
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,330
he wandered aimlessly.

45
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,550
My brother...

46
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,580
He looked a lot like you, Gii.

47
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,980
Though you're complete opposites in personality.

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,190
He was a great student.

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Popular with everyone.

50
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,780
So handsome,

51
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,070
you wouldn't believe we were brothers.

52
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,470
My parents' attention was always on my brother.

53
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,970
They doted on him completely.

54
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,700
Were your parents cold to you?

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,020
How should I put it...

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,960
My parents were indifferent to me.

57
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,730
Whether I aced a test

58
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,850
or got a zero,

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
their reaction was always the same.

60
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,880
I can't believe it.

61
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,380
What kind of parents are they?

62
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,280
Yeah...

63
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,460
So my feelings

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,380
never reached them.

65
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,310
Being truly scolded by them,

66
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,390
or truly praised...

67
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,940
I have no memory of that ever happening.

68
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,370
The one who occupied their hearts

69
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,180
was always my brother.

70
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,030
Even though we lived together,

71
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,850
there was no place for me in their hearts.

72
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
How could they...

73
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,610
That's why

74
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,810
my brother became my savior.

75
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,110
He was the only one

76
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,650
who would listen to me seriously.

77
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,450
He was a good brother, wasn't he?

78
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,380
Yeah.

79
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,580
He was a good brother.

80
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,810
But...

81
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,830
at some point, he started acting strange.

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,500
The year my brother started junior high,

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,020
I was only in the second grade.

84
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,930
Back then,

85
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,400
I barely even understood the difference
between boys and girls.

86
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,070
From then on,

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
my brother...

88
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,890
would try to touch me
all over any chance he got.

89
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,120
You didn't fight back?

90
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,270
No.

91
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,610
I couldn't.

92
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Because...

93
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,630
my brother was supposed to be my savior.

94
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,100
It was only when my brother

95
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,860
mentioned me

96
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,290
that my parents would pay any attention to me.

97
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,510
But...

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,280
my brother took advantage of that.

99
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,670
And then...

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
that day came.

101
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Just like today,

102
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
it was a dreary, rainy day.

103
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,040
My brother had a fever that day,

104
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,990
so he was home from school.

105
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,280
My mom had just

106
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,770
stepped out to buy groceries for dinner.

107
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,900
My brother took that chance

108
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,410
to drag me into his bed.

109
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,810
But then,

110
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,280
my mom, who had forgotten her wallet,

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,510
suddenly came back.

112
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
And what do you think my brother

113
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,020
did?

114
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,370
He wasn't going to cover for me, was he?

115
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,590
He said I seduced him.

116
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,510
My brother,

117
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,270
even with tears in his eyes,

118
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,880
pleaded his case to my mother.

119
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,020
My feelings for my brother, in that instant,

120
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,800
shattered.

121
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,630
My father and mother,

122
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,620
without asking for my side of the story,

123
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,220
took me to the psychiatric ward of the university hospital.

124
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,720
We came back quickly, though.

125
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,750
So...

126
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Yeah...

127
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,450
My parents must have realized something was wrong.

128
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,970
That I wasn't the one with the problem.

129
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,110
My brother was hospitalized.

130
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
But...

131
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,570
by then, I didn't care about anything anymore.

132
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,070
Giving up on everything

133
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,360
was how I learned to survive.

134
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,990
Do you hate him?

135
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,450
Even now...

136
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,310
I guess so.

137
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,930
But...

138
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,990
Gii...

139
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,770
Do you hate me now?

140
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
You...

141
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,630
Didn't I tell you I love you?

142
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm not worth treasuring like this.

143
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Takumi.

144
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,160
You really are a terrible judge of character.

145
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,970
I love you,

146
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,770
Takumi.

147
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,270
After my brother passed away,

148
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,750
this is the first time I've come to this place.

149
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
That person...

150
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,700
He was a nurse from the hospital
where my brother was staying.

151
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,380
He said that on the day my brother died,

152
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,570
while he was wandering in the rain,

153
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,380
he was actually looking for me.

154
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,650
And that nurse was the one who found him.

155
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,420
He said that before he died,
my brother kept deliriously saying,

156
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,280
"Takumi, where are you?"

157
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
"Takumi."

158
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,800
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

159
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,790
My brother...

160
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,360
He wanted to tell me, didn't he?

161
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,670
About what happened that day...

162
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,690
He always...

163
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,640
always regretted it.

164
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
Brother...

165
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,350
I can finally

166
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,070
move on.

167
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,460
I can

168
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,560
love someone again.

169
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,780
Hey, Yamashita.

170
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,640
What are you doing, dragging Yoshizawa out here?

171
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,890
Ah, Takabayashi.

172
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,180
Oh, no, it's just...

173
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
You still have

174
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,590
that goody-two-shoes look.

175
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,750
But you've got quite a mouth on you.

176
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,820
But that contrast is also part of your charm.

177
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,410
My beautiful Schauspielerin.

178
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,480
I can't recall your name,

179
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,210
but I remember that overconfident attitude of yours.

180
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,380
I believe I told you to be more respectful to your seniors.

181
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,790
- Hey!
- Let's go, Takabayashi-kun.

182
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,300
- Wait, Yoshizawa!
- Yoshizawa.

183
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,130
We're not done talking yet.

184
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,190
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,160
We haven't even gotten to the main point.

186
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,430
Yoshizawa-kun, was it?

187
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,200
Excuse me,

188
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,360
but could you step aside for a moment?

189
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,380
Huh?

190
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,750
That thing from last time...

191
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,170
I can't forget it.

192
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,870
Kissing you.

193
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,260
We still have unfinished business.

194
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,490
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!

195
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,010
What was that for?

196
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,550
- Yoshizawa! Do you know what you're doing?!
- What do you think you're doing?!

197
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,190
- Not before the school placement exams...
- Shut up!

198
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Stop right there.

199
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,540
I'm a second-degree black belt in karate.

200
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
Is that so?

201
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,850
Then I won't hold back.

202
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,920
Itami...!

203
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,510
Itami... Itami!

204
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,740
My tooth...

205
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,980
From now on, stay away from Takabayashi-kun.

206
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,540
I get it.

207
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,500
You get that, Itami?

208
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,560
Let's go to the nurse's office.

209
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,510
- Let's go to the nurse's office.
- My tooth broke...

210
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,180
I give up.

211
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,070
Huh?

212
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,460
The thing is...

213
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,870
I'm terrified of the dentist.

214
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
Let's go.

215
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,350
Yoshizawa.

216
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,860
Takabayashi-kun.

217
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
Thank you.

218
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,620
Guess we had to fight to become friends.

219
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,570
I wonder how those two are doing...

220
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,380
Hey, Takumi.

221
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,500
Gii.

222
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,520
You're here.

223
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,020
Takumi.

224
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Let's go on a date.

225
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,370
A date?

226
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,830
We agreed to on the phone, remember?

227
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,570
I wanted to meet up with you...

228
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,010
somewhere other than school.

229
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,220
Yeah.

230
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,960
Can't sleep?

231
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,310
Yeah.

232
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,010
By the way...

233
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,780
Thank you for today.

234
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Don't mention it.

235
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,050
It was nothing.

236
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,590
You don't have to thank me.

237
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,910
No.

238
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,690
I was really glad.

239
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,370
Because I couldn't forgive...

240
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,860
Huh?

241
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,170
What he tried to do to Takabayashi-kun.

242
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,140
Yoshizawa.

243
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,410
I like you.

244
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,080
I like Yoshizawa.

245
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,770
How did it come to this?

246
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
Because I'm...

247
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,850
in love with Arata-san.

248
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,280
I don't recall accepting your confession.

249
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,870
Arata-san.

250
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,140
Do you know about Artemis?

251
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,210
The goddess of the moon, right?

252
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,480
Your name, Arata-san.

253
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,260
If you write it in Roman letters,

254
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,910
it's an anagram...

255
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,420
for Artemis.

256
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,180
It's so beautiful...

257
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,360
What's so beautiful about it?

258
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,490
What's the matter, Takumi?

259
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,570
Aren't you going to sleep?

260
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,800
Hey, Gii.

261
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,600
During summer break...

262
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,780
let's go on another date.

263
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,850
Huh?

264
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,630
I want to go somewhere with you,

265
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,190
just the two of us.

266
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,740
That's a good idea.

267
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,830
It's a little cliché, but...

268
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
how about the beach?

269
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Sounds great!

270
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,470
Takabayashi-kun,
you should eat some of your carrots.

271
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,570
I said no.

272
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,400
I hate carrots.

273
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,810
But it's a waste to leave them all.

274
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,100
They're good for you. Come on.

275
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,970
Just have one bite.

276
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,990
Come on, say 'ahh'.

277
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,990
No way.

278
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Come on.

279
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Then how about this...

280
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,160
You feed it to me with your mouth, Yoshizawa.

281
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,080
Huh?

282
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,620
U-um...

283
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,210
- U-um...
- Okay.

284
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,660
I mean...

285
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,010
Takabayashi-kun...

286
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,790
- Come on, hurry up.
- Hey, people are staring!

287
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,590
Everyone's watching us, Takabayashi-kun.

288
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,170
Arata-san.

289
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,660
You again?

290
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,020
I bought some bread. Want to share?

291
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,030
Personal space.

292
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,070
Come on, we've slept together.

293
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,090
That has nothing to do with it.

294
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,620
No, I don't get it at all.

295
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,280
Anyway...

296
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,240
Arata-san, do you have any plans for summer break?

297
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,510
Why do you ask?

298
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,580
No reason.

299
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,720
I was just wondering if we could hang out.

300
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,080
Why on earth would I go out with you?

301
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,120
Besides, I've got the Inter-High tournament.
I don't have time for that.

302
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,170
That's not what I meant.

303
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,910
I meant, like, after the tournament is over.

304
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,020
Like I said...

305
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,530
Why on earth would I go out with you?

306
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,650
Because we slept together.

307
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,820
That has nothing to do with it!

308
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,600
So I don't get it at all.

309
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,860
Why is that?

310
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,150
When I'm with him,

311
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,650
my heart feels so full.

312
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,520
The one person who can give me what I want most.

313
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,700
Arata-san.

314
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,030
I love you more than anyone.

315
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,460
We have patrols before lunch.

316
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,070
Don't you think we have too much work?

317
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,010
You can change the rules
when you become chairman.

318
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,350
I'm not as popular as Shibata-senpai.

319
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
- You think so?
- I do.

320
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,740
Well, I for one...

321
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,490
would vote for you.

322
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,650
If that wasn't totally biased,

323
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,020
I'd be genuinely grateful.

324
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,650
Of course I'm mixing business with pleasure.

325
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,170
Takumi.

326
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
Another roll.

327
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,480
This is your fifth one already.

328
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,650
- You're eating too much.
- I told you, didn't I?

329
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,130
My stomach is a bottomless pit.

330
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Sorry, but no.

331
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Takumi...

332
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
Ah, Gii! I said no!

333
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,100
Geez...

334
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,630
I'm never going on a date with you again, Gii.

335
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,070
If you love bread so much,
why don't you go to France?

336
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
France...?

337
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,130
You could just go to France
and eat all the bread you want.

338
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,520
But I want to be with you, Takumi.

339
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,640
Then give the roll back.

340
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,590
But bread tastes best
when I eat it with you, Takumi.
