1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,470
Far from the noise of the city...

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,270
nestled on a mountainside...

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,230
an all-boys boarding school...

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,010
Shido Gakuin High School.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,190
It was here that I met the person

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,500
who would change my destiny forever.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,070
Saki Giichi.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
Known as Gii.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,460
Gii was born in the U.S.
and came back to Japan.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,260
He's the heir to a fortune,
always in the spotlight,

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,660
and the heart of Shido Gakuin.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,060
To me...

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,180
he was my polar opposite,

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,340
a person from another world.

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,710
And yet...

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,890
I love you, Takumi.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,540
Gii.

"Takumi-kun series -Drama-"
(Episode 2)

19
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,100
During Golden Week,

20
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,630
most students went
home for the long holiday

21
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,330
or took trips.

22
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,410
One, two, three, four.

23
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,760
Five, six, seven, eight.

24
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:37,040
The only students left at Shido

25
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,330
were the athletes training for
the summer nationals... and...

26
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,050
the ones busy with student council,

27
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,490
like him.

28
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,850
Five, six, seven, eight...

29
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,060
Hey, sports clubs!

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,260
Can anyone help organize the storage room?

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,750
Arata-san! I'll help!

32
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,580
You again?

33
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,820
It's tough work. You okay with that?

34
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,570
Of course.

35
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,970
It's what I'm best at.

36
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,030
Leave it to me.

37
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,670
And then...

38
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,886
(Astronomy Club)
As for the culture clubs,

39
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,150
those with presentations coming up...

40
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,510
- were also swamped with preparations.
- Takabayashi-kun.

41
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,790
Let me get that.

42
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,070
No, thank you.

43
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,060
I can manage on my own.

44
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,636
It's just to the exhibition hall, right?

45
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,270
It's on my way.

46
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,060
Hey, Yoshizawa.

47
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,580
Can you carry these for me too?

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,010
Perfect.

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,876
Yoshizawa says he'll carry
everything for you guys.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,110
Hey, Yamashita.

51
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,020
Don't worry about it.

52
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,040
Yeah, I'll carry them over.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,320
We're counting on you.

54
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,290
Here we go...

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,320
Okay, you should get to your club practice.

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Got it.

57
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,650
Okay then.

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,590
I'm heading out.

59
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,290
You guys go on ahead.

60
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,850
Yes.

61
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,840
Hey, Takabayashi.

62
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,830
You're not acting like yourself today.

63
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,170
You abandoned your personal guard.

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,260
It wasn't because of him, was it?

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,230
What?

66
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,340
Of course not.

67
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,020
Morning, Captain Kado.

68
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,340
Yoshizawa.

69
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,500
Tell everyone to start without me.

70
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,650
Yes, sir.

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,560
You've got a good eye, Itami.

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,490
Noticing our beautiful 'actress'.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Beautiful... what?

74
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,130
Schauspielerin.

75
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,370
It's what we third-years call him.

76
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,219
It's German for 'actress'.

77
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,250
Just take it.

78
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,470
So, who is he?

79
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,620
Takabayashi Izumi.

80
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,620
- A second-year in the Astronomy Club.
- There's still some left.

81
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,140
Then hurry up and bring it over.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,670
As for me...

83
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,850
During the holiday,

84
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,590
I tried going home for a bit.

85
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,030
But the awkward
conversations with my parents...

86
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,380
and the feeling of not belonging in
my own house just wouldn't go away.

87
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,490
Before I knew it,

88
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,060
I was spending my days

89
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:28,052
just wandering around outside.

90
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:31,405
And with Gii...

91
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,240
Because...

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,600
- Being misunderstood is the worst.
- Don't be ridiculous.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm in love with you, Takumi.

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,450
What guy in the world...

95
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,090
wouldn't be moved by the person he loves?

96
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,130
I'm sorry... Gii.

97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,080
If all you can do is apologize...

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,110
Takumi...

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,650
Gii?!

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,540
I love you,

101
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,970
Takumi.

102
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,220
Stop! Gii!

103
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,130
Things were left awkward between us.

104
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,510
Gii went to New York on family business.

105
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,830
We...

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,380
parted ways just like that.

107
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,390
(What are you up to?)

108
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:34,262
(Nothing special.)

109
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,200
(Can I call?)

110
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,970
(Yeah.)

111
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,210
Takumi?

112
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Gii...

113
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,810
Hey, how are you?

114
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
I'm doing fine.

115
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,950
What about you, Gii?

116
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,800
You're in New York now,

117
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,870
right?

118
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Yeah.

119
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,206
What time is it over there?

120
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,230
Um...

121
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,830
9 a.m.

122
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,150
Huh, wait.

123
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,660
What about where you are?

124
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,210
The time difference is 13 hours, so...

125
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,530
It's 7 p.m.

126
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,980
Wait... yesterday?

127
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,210
Yeah, I'm a day behind you.

128
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,830
I see.

129
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,670
That feels so strange.

130
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,950
Hey, Takumi.

131
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,160
Want to meet up in a bit?

132
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Huh?

133
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
But, Gii, you're in New York.

134
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,410
I finished up my business.

135
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm on my way to catch a flight to Haneda.

136
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,310
I'll see you in 14 hours.

137
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,120
This is so sudden...

138
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,650
I see.

139
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,490
You don't want to see me?

140
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,650
That's not it.

141
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,890
It's just...

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,460
Uh, well...

143
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,550
There's stuff going on at home...

144
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,190
and a lot of other things.

145
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,830
So...

146
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,210
It's fine.

147
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,410
It's fine, I understand.

148
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,126
We'll be seeing each other at
school soon enough anyway.

149
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,350
I was getting ahead of myself.

150
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,670
Sorry, Takumi.

151
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,770
But...

152
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,670
It's okay for me to call, right?

153
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,770
I've been trying so hard to resist.

154
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,160
At least forgive me for this.

155
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,590
You're finally smiling.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
Huh?

157
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,620
Last time...

158
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,910
we parted on such a bad note.

159
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,080
And when you left for home,

160
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,760
you looked so upset.

161
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,080
I was worried about you.

162
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,670
So that's why.

163
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,430
I'm all right.

164
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm doing fine.

165
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,910
I see.

166
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,750
Then I'll call you again tomorrow.

167
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,330
Okay.

168
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,030
Okay, talk to you tomorrow.

169
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,000
Gii is so perceptive.

170
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
Looking back,

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,920
he was like that when
I first started here, too.

172
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,160
Hayama, you're really bad at
expressing yourself, aren't you?

173
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,290
Huh?

174
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,650
Or maybe...

175
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,120
it's 'human-contact-phobia.'

176
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,740
Human-contact...

177
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,350
phobia?

178
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,490
A diagnosis I just came up with.

179
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,010
Pretty fitting, don't you think?

180
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,070
I'm not good with people.

181
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,080
He didn't see me, the odd one out,

182
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,030
as a freak.

183
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,550
Instead, he said I was
bad at expressing myself.

184
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,990
He was the only one who got it right.

185
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,530
Sorry.

186
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,630
I just wanted to talk with you
a little more before I take off.

187
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,570
Am I bothering you?

188
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,140
What is it? You're smiling.

189
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,430
Because...

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Hey, Takumi.
Yeah?

191
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,130
Next time, let's go on a date.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
A... A date?

193
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,430
I want to see you somewhere

194
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,790
other than school.

195
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,750
But, where would we go?

196
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,060
Where do you want to go?

197
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,460
As long as I'm with you, Gii,

198
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
anywhere is fine.

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,020
Anywhere, huh...

200
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,780
- Someday...
- I promise I'll take you anywhere you want to go.

201
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,490
Yeah.

202
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,200
Let's definitely go on that date.

203
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,430
Gii.

204
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Arata-san.

205
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,750
Arata-san, can...

206
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,590
Can we take a break?

207
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,290
After we finish out here,

208
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,860
we still have the inside to clean.

209
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,020
Wait...

210
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,000
I know, but...

211
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,980
I just want to... rest for a bit.

212
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,870
Giving up already?

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,100
No, no, no, no, no.

214
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,530
It's not that, I'm just...

215
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
a little...

216
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,470
tired.

217
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,470
Ow...

218
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,950
I feel alive again...

219
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,090
Are you being that dramatic?

220
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,430
It is that tiring.

221
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,570
Look, my hands are shaking.

222
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,380
Thanks to you, it's been
a lot easier on my end.

223
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Really?

224
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,970
Me?

225
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,500
If it means helping you, Arata-san,

226
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,250
I'll do anything.

227
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,310
Too close.

228
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,550
Don't invade my personal space.

229
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Sorry.

230
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I...

231
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,270
I like you so much, Arata-san.

232
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,550
You know...

233
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,049
Always saying you like me.

234
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,190
Isn't it time you dropped the act?

235
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,440
I'm not joking.

236
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,540
I'm serious.

237
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
I...

238
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,400
Ever since the first time I saw you...

239
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,570
on the day of the Shido entrance exam.

240
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,190
I was...

241
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,830
so nervous the night
before, I couldn't sleep at all.

242
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,540
During the test,

243
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,070
I was incredibly tense.

244
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,800
My mind was a complete blur.

245
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,480
We were told at the beginning
not to pick up anything we dropped.

246
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,230
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,570
I was being reported.

248
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,530
I thought to myself,

249
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,410
I'm definitely...

250
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,700
going to be disqualified.

251
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,420
All right, please pass your
answer sheets to the front.

252
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,460
Number 135, Shingyoji-kun.

253
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,949
If you're not feeling well,

254
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,590
you may go to the nurse's office now.

255
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Huh?

256
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,910
That person...

257
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,900
He didn't report me.

258
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
And then...

259
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,600
after the test was over,

260
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,850
What's with you, Misu?

261
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,060
Same old Misu.

262
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
You think so?

263
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,520
For the first time...

264
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,890
at the very moment I fell in love,

265
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,990
I realized...

266
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,770
it was my first love.

267
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,790
- Well, these things happen.
- Um...

268
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Um...

269
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,060
- Um...
- What is it?

270
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,550
Misu, do you two know each other?

271
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,230
Who knows.

272
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,050
Um... um...

273
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Um... Excuse me...

274
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,450
Um... Excuse me...

275
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,690
Are you Arata Misu...

276
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,980
right?

277
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Um...

278
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,590
Th-the...

279
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,060
The... the kanji for it...

280
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
How do you write it?

281
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,010
Why the sudden question?

282
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,230
Um...

283
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,950
Go on and tell him, Misu.

284
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,390
We'll go on ahead.

285
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,520
Uh...

286
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,900
I... I...

287
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,540
I... I... I...

288
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,890
I...

289
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:27,741
My name is Shingyoji Kanemitsu.

290
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,480
Um...

291
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,870
- The kanji is...
- I didn't ask for your name.

292
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,470
Please.

293
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,100
Please tell me.

294
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,180
Please! Please! Please!

295
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,769
Please! Please! Please!

296
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,150
All right! I get it!

297
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,020
The 'Mi' for the number
three, and 'su' for sandbar.

298
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,550
Together, it's Misu.

299
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,730
Huh?

300
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,750
As for my first name...

301
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,930
If you get into our school,
I'll tell you then.

302
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,280
So then...

303
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,150
The number three...

304
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,160
And the word for sandbar...

305
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,650
Misu.

306
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,750
Misu.

307
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,370
Misu.

308
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,030
(Entrance Ceremony)
I successfully got into this school.

309
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,610
Arata Misu!

310
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,540
Arata Misu, I... I got in!

311
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,940
As promised...

312
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,746
He told me his first name is 'Arata, '
written with the character for 'new'.

313
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,850
Arata.

314
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,520
Even though I told you,

315
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,690
I never gave you permission
to call me by my first name.

316
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,750
To me,

317
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,140
the name "Arata-san"

318
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,070
is my treasure.

319
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,450
Say whatever you want.

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,530
I've liked you ever since then.

321
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,450
- Arata-san!
- You're so loud.

322
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,520
Rejected.

323
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,410
Break's over.

324
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,490
I have student council business.

325
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,730
I'm leaving the rest to you.

326
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,950
Yes, sir.

327
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Yoshizawa.

328
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,140
Is your form a little off?

329
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,440
Did you hurt your back?

330
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,540
It feels like you're
subconsciously protecting it.

331
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,010
Hitting the bullseye every time even
when you're not at your best. How annoying.

332
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,130
You're a shoo-in for the
summer tournament team.

333
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,769
No, there are only five spots.

334
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,360
Plus, there are so many upperclassmen.

335
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,960
Then I have even less of a chance.

336
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,950
Hey, Yoshizawa.

337
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,070
Come here for a second.

338
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,030
Yes.

339
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,620
Hey, you're roommates
with Takabayashi Izumi, right?

340
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,390
Ah...

341
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,530
Yes.

342
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,810
Yes... we are roommates.

343
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,370
Is he seeing anyone?

344
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,690
Even though we're roommates,

345
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,590
I don't know anything
about his private life.

346
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,030
Sorry about this morning.

347
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,530
Is your back okay?

348
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:12,782
Yeah, it's fine.

349
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,430
It's no big deal.

350
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,230
Hey.

351
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,350
Yoshizawa.

352
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,110
Do you hate me?

353
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:33,949
That's not it at all.

354
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,910
No.

355
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,050
I see.

356
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,900
That's good.

357
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,450
But...

358
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Takabayashi-kun.

359
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,110
I know that you like Saki-kun.

360
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,320
You're an exceptional person.

361
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
Saki-kun must also...

362
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,720
Why are you bringing up
something from so long ago?

363
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,090
I'm not going to apologize.

364
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,830
You idiot, Yoshizawa.

365
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
And then...

366
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,990
on the last day of Golden Week,

367
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,370
Welcome back, Takumi.

368
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,410
I'm back, Gii.

369
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,890
Thanks.

370
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,340
However...

371
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,030
the joy of our reunion was short-lived.

372
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,750
Hayama, you're studying hard.

373
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,459
These midterms...

374
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,690
I'm so screwed.

375
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,100
Especially English.

376
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,086
If it's English, you should
just have Gii teach you.

377
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,270
Right, Gii?

378
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
Anything my dear Takumi asks,

379
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,820
anytime at all.

380
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,760
- That's a little creepy.
- Huh? Sorry.

381
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,779
Nozaki.

382
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,090
You still haven't given up on that guy?

383
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,290
He's a tough nut to crack, you know.

384
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,030
No problem.

385
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,070
I just need to get him
to go out with me once.

386
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,510
Winning him over will be a piece of cake.

387
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,710
I'll get Hayama, even
if I have to play rough.

388
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,810
Well, you're certainly confident.

389
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,010
You're back, Gii.

390
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,150
Oh, they posted the
topics for the midterms.

391
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,770
Here.

392
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,370
Thanks.

393
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,510
Gii.

394
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,620
What's wrong?

395
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,390
Takumi.

396
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,530
I love you.

397
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,800
I know.

398
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,810
I've heard that plenty of times.

399
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Takumi.

400
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,470
What about you?

401
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,750
Huh?

402
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,190
Gii, what's been up with you?

403
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,520
Do you love me?

404
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,170
It was my fault.

405
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,500
Just forget what I said.

406
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,160
Gii always tells me he loves me.

407
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,160
For him to say something like that...

408
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,010
Is it because of me?

409
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,170
Well, well.

410
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,970
We meet again.

411
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,410
What is it?

412
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,580
Don't be so cold.

413
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,390
If that's all...

414
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,030
I'll be on my way.

415
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,140
That roommate of yours...

416
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,770
He's got a thing for you, doesn't he?

417
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,560
He's a player.

418
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,600
You'd better be careful.

419
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,196
Did you come all this
way just to tell me that?

420
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
No.

421
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,210
This time, I'm going to...

422
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,870
- ask you out.
- No.

423
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,720
Don't be like that.

424
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,790
I'm liking you more and more.

425
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,940
The defiant way you stand up to me...

426
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,670
It's almost as if...

427
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,220
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

428
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,490
Hayama?

429
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,960
Don't be so afraid.

430
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Excuse me.

431
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,650
During the lunch break,

432
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,480
what were you and Nozaki talking about?

433
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,450
That's none of your business,

434
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,580
Akaike-kun.

435
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,750
Yes, it is.

436
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,190
Frankly, it's becoming a problem.

437
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,330
Huh...?

438
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,540
You really are...

439
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,949
You don't understand a thing.

440
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,700
All you do is make Gii worry.

441
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,570
And you still call yourself his friend?

442
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,940
You're so hopelessly naive.

443
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,589
Akaike-kun, are you trying to pick a fight?

444
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,140
Nozaki's the one who started it.

445
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,570
No.

446
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,110
When it comes down to it, it was Gii.

447
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,070
What's that supposed to mean?

448
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,240
Gii made a bet with Nozaki.

449
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,350
The bet was about you, Hayama Takumi.

450
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,060
What?

451
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,590
A bet?

452
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,740
Gii made a bet with Nozaki... about me?

453
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,910
What in the world does that mean?
