1
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:17,124
Looks like we...

2
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,450
are trapped in here.

3
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,850
We're locked in.

4
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,209
So, where are we?

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,670
The concert hall.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,479
I'm sorry for getting you involved in this.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,940
This is all my fault.

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,859
The fact that I like Takumi...

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,310
Takabayashi found out.

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,450
Huh?

11
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:55,959
What?

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,600
But I...

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,790
can't go out with someone I don't have feelings for.

14
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,339
So...

15
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,689
he flew into a rage, and this is what happened.

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,430
But...

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,379
Compared to me, Takabayashi is...

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,740
so good-looking...

19
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,429
popular, and he doesn't have a fear of being touched.

20
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:17,453
Don't be ridiculous!

21
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,930
The one I like is Hayama Takumi.

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,250
No one else but you.

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,539
It's you I like, Takumi.

24
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,500
You don't hate me, do you?

25
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:44,979
You don't hate me, right?

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,019
Gii said he likes me.

27
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,560
Gii, who I always thought was out of my reach.

28
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,069
I don't want to lose him.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,450
Akaike-kun...

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,899
Have you ever been in love with someone?

31
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,490
- This isn't the time for that.
- Please.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Answer me.

33
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,559
At my age, of course I have.

34
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,610
The kind of person you never want to lose...

35
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,080
the one you love.

36
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:19,860
Once you fall for someone...

37
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,890
you never want to lose them.

38
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,609
What should I do?

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,960
I don't know.

40
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,340
If you're talking about Gii,
you have nothing to worry about.

41
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,939
- Just drop it.
- Tell me.

42
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,929
Akaike-kun...

43
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,020
Could you live on even if you lost Gii?

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,149
Well? What's the answer?

45
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,660
Stop trying to act tough.

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,709
Anyway, you wait here for a bit.

47
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,850
Takumi.

48
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,100
Takumi.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Gii.

50
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,790
Something's wrong with Hayama.

51
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,190
Takumi.

52
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,990
Takumi.

53
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:06,979
Takumi.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
"Takumi-kun series -Drama-"
(Episode 5)

55
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,919
Good grief.

56
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,469
This guy really knows how to worry people.

57
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,350
They say it's anemia.

58
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,520
Lately...

59
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,270
he hasn't been sleeping well.

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,059
I feel like he's been under a lot of pressure...

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Hayama.

62
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,570
I hope nothing bad happens to him.

63
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,870
Right now...

64
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,039
all I can do is wait.

65
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,486
Waiting is fine.

66
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:55,250
But what if something happens to him before then?

67
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,969
I trust he'll be fine.

68
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,759
Because I know...

69
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,809
the real Hayama Takumi.

70
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,979
Before he became who he is now...

71
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,770
long ago...

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,240
Back then...

73
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,490
when no one had even noticed Takumi.

74
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,399
Even Takumi himself...

75
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,879
probably didn't realize
what kind of person he was.

76
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,849
Takumi...

77
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:27,479
I know what Takumi is like
when he's truly himself.

78
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,800
I've loved him since then.

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,330
Shozo, you might laugh at me for this.

80
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,350
You know...

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,740
I've always admired Takumi.

82
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,689
Then Gii...

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,450
I'll make sure Hayama eats properly.

84
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,279
Okay.

85
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks, Shozo.

86
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,930
Hayama is the most important person to Gii, isn't he?

87
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Huh?

88
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,239
No.

89
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,469
It's nothing.

90
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,419
This is rare.

91
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:46,219
Seeing you in the dining hall alone at this hour.

92
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:48,619
Gii...

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,190
Is Yamashita okay?

94
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:54,689
I couldn't care less about that guy.

95
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,520
Forget about him...

96
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,229
Listen to this, Gii.

97
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,779
Itami Dokoro.

98
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,110
Oh, the third-year transfer student from April, right?

99
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,599
That guy, the other day...

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,880
he tried to kiss me.

101
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
Unforgivable.

102
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,800
Well, they say he only goes for looks.

103
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,029
Of course he'd go after someone like you.

104
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:21,429
Sigh...

105
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,180
Why does this always happen?

106
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,729
The person I like ignores me...

107
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,899
and I'm always getting hit on by guys
I'm not interested in.

108
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,410
Takabayashi-kun.

109
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:35,580
So this is where you were.

110
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,700
You didn't come back to the room,
so I was worried.

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
Sorry.

112
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,970
Excuse me.

113
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,630
Yoshizawa.

114
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,090
Don't get the wrong idea.

115
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:54,070
I know.

116
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,159
This is the worst.

117
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,519
You...

118
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,439
you really are in love with him...

119
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Yoshizawa.

120
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,219
Don't give me that clueless smile.

121
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,570
He must have gotten the wrong idea.

122
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:20,590
First, I get rejected by Gii.

123
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,479
Now it's Yoshizawa.

124
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Always getting thrown away like trash
by the people I like.

125
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,719
I've had enough.

126
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,829
When did Yoshizawa reject Takabayashi?

127
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,869
Even just now...

128
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,040
didn't he come looking for you?

129
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,319
It'll be okay.

130
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,059
Yoshizawa likes Takabayashi.

131
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,715
Even if the feelings are mutual,

132
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:47,569
things don't always go smoothly, you know?

133
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,139
If you were a real couple, he'd probably get mad.

134
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:54,850
Like, "Don't you dare cheat on me" or something.

135
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,629
He'd yell and scream.

136
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,500
When he slapped Takabayashi...

137
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,799
he was so cool then.

138
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,090
Takabayashi.

139
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,650
You need to apologize, Takabayashi-kun.

140
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,500
You owe Hayama-kun an apology.

141
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,960
He's so dependable when it counts...

142
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,000
but he's just so dense when it comes to love...

143
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,040
He can't just act on his feelings, can he?

144
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,500
If I made the first move...

145
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,860
things might be simpler.

146
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,450
But if I did that...

147
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,199
it just wouldn't feel right.

148
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Is that...

149
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,400
selfish of me?

150
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,409
No matter who it is...

151
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,069
having expectations for the person you like...

152
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,480
is inherently selfish.

153
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:10,819
Feeling that way...

154
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
isn't a bad thing.

155
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,350
Gii, you always give me the answers I need.

156
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,790
I'm so jealous of Hayama-kun.

157
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,140
I don't mean anything by that...

158
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Actually...

159
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,669
I took my anger out on Hayama-kun before...

160
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:33,509
and did something terrible...

161
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,530
I really regret it now.

162
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,330
Takumi...

163
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,830
isn't the type to hold a grudge.

164
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,020
Back then...

165
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,109
I thought I was the only one
in the world good enough for Gii.

166
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,270
In reality...

167
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,569
I was just arrogant and overconfident.

168
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,790
It's no wonder you rejected me.

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
It was...

170
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,869
Yoshizawa who made you realize that, wasn't it?

171
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Yeah.

172
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:07,869
But you know...

173
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,150
now that it's over, I can say this.

174
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,650
Even when you rejected me so completely, Gii...

175
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:18,619
it was never as painful as this
ambiguous relationship.

176
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,879
To be honest...

177
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,210
just the act of liking Yoshizawa...

178
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,950
is filled with confusion and regret.

179
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,969
This person...

180
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,540
Is it really okay for me to keep liking him?

181
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:45,280
You really don't get it...

182
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,530
do you?

183
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,669
Anyway.

184
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,900
I'll be rooting for
Takabayashi's first love to work out.

185
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,710
Huh?

186
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,409
What are you talking about?

187
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,619
- My first love is...
- I'm heading out.

188
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,950
Yoshizawa is my first love.

189
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,580
What does that mean?

190
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,570
I knew it.

191
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,230
So Takabayashi's feelings for Yoshizawa...

192
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,619
Even though I can tell Takabayashi
what he wants to hear...

193
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,919
when it comes to my own future...

194
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,230
I can't see a thing.

195
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
This place is...

196
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,100
How can I...

197
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,819
move forward?

198
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,619
Takumi.

199
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,759
Don't wake up...

200
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,780
No!

201
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
No, Gii!

202
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,034
What are you trying to do?

203
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:10,929
Stop it.

204
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,159
Mmm.

205
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,749
You say no with your mouth...

206
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:36,059
I see.

207
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:39,809
I'm done waiting.

208
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:50,070
You're so cunning, Gii.

209
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,830
You noticed, didn't you?

210
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,689
That my body...

211
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,549
was reacting.

212
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,449
This is for the best.

213
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,410
This isn't like you.

214
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,590
With me.

215
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,400
You know that, don't you?

216
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,309
Takumi.

217
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:44,909
Gii.

218
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
That's right.

219
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,170
This person...

220
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,140
is Gii.

221
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:50,789
Takumi.

222
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,859
Are you all right?

223
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,650
Was I too rough?

224
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,319
Being worried over...

225
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,860
feels surprisingly nice.

226
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,130
Hey!

227
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,709
Takumi?

228
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,290
Takumi?

229
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:18,358
Ah!

230
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,579
You did that on purpose.

231
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Because...

232
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,600
this is the first time I've ever seen you...

233
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:24,067
so worried.

234
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,729
Here.

235
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,099
Ah, this is my treat.

236
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:44,532
Oh, you don't have to.

237
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:46,260
- I'll pay for myself.
- No, don't.

238
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,029
I'm the one who dragged you out here so late, after all.

239
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,350
So please, let me.

240
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,359
Are you sure?

241
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,439
Yes.

242
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:55,209
Well...

243
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,040
Then I gratefully accept.

244
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
By the way...

245
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,019
what was the reason you asked me here?

246
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
The reason?

247
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:12,859
Um...

248
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,580
If I had to give one...

249
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,850
it's because I had a feeling
you had something to say, Arata-san.

250
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,890
Me?

251
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,839
Yes.

252
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
It's already...

253
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
gotten so dark.

254
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,930
But...

255
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,439
the days will keep getting longer
until the summer solstice.

256
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,689
That's good.

257
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,199
Heh. So you remembered.

258
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:48,000
My memory isn't that bad.

259
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Did you know?

260
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:53,769
Morning glories...

261
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:55,569
after the summer solstice,

262
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,980
once the days start getting shorter,

263
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:58,319
that's when they start to bloom.

264
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,430
Oh.

265
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,570
They're called short-day plants, right?

266
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,680
That's why...

267
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,870
whenever I see morning glories in bloom,

268
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,880
I always feel a little sad.

269
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,769
But don't blooming morning glories
mean summer has truly begun?

270
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,159
That's...

271
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,620
what a cheerful, sunny person
with happy summer memories would think.

272
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,340
Don't you have any, Arata-san?

273
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,309
I wonder.

274
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,289
If only I had someone to make those memories with...

275
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,010
You don't?

276
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,570
There is someone I want to make memories with.

277
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,220
He's right here beside me.

278
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:44,829
Akaike-kun.

279
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,139
I'm in love with you.

280
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,580
Is that so.

281
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,960
You're not surprised.

282
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,770
It takes more than that to surprise me.

283
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,009
I figured it out from your poem
in the literary club's magazine.

284
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:03,789
Oh, that one?

285
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:06,229
How?

286
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,089
The last stanza of the poem.

287
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:13,560
"The blue mark behind the ear." It meant this, didn't it?

288
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,670
I see.

289
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,350
So you knew all along.

290
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,900
The only people who knew about this mole...

291
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:25,329
were me and my late mother.

292
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,419
Your mother...

293
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,090
passed away?

294
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:30,829
A long time ago.

295
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,830
I see.

296
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:39,869
Arata-san.

297
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,000
You're irreplaceable to me.

298
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:46,469
Does that mean...

299
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,479
I can...

300
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,736
get my hopes up?

301
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:50,610
Ah, no, no.

302
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm not into guys.

303
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,559
Such a swift rejection.

304
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,130
Sorry.

305
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:01,989
Then...

306
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I guess...

307
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,290
I can't be...

308
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,010
your number one.

309
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,010
No.

310
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,889
And I suppose I can't be Shibata-san's number one either.

311
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,010
So...

312
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,480
let's be number two.

313
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:23,049
Number two?

314
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,570
Someday soon, I'm sure...

315
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,370
the perfect number one will appear for you.

316
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:32,369
You think so?

317
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,649
Being number two isn't bad.

318
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,460
It's a good place to be,
where we can just be honest with each other.

319
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,100
Number two...

320
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,010
isn't bad, huh?

321
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,810
If that's the case...

322
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:55,380
even if I can't be your number one,

323
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,350
can we still do this?

324
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,010
Go out for tea?

325
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:03,080
I'll pay next time.

326
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:08,519
Then it's a date.

327
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:23,969
I'm finished, Gii.

328
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,769
Gii.

329
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:36,659
The letter sent to me...

330
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,599
- That...
- Yes. I have it.

331
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:45,949
Here.

332
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,149
Thank you.

333
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,610
Aren't you going to read it?

334
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,380
- Then I'll throw it out.
- Wait, Gii.

335
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,199
I'll read it.

336
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
I will read it.

337
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
All right.

338
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,039
Should I give you some space?

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No.

340
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Stay by my side.

341
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,870
Shingyoji, why are you in my room?

342
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,029
I heard your roommate, Arata-san,
wouldn't be back for a while.

343
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,799
So I saw my chance.

344
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,280
You...

345
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,436
Of course, even in the same room,

346
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:29,429
I'll be sure not to invade your personal space, Arata-san.

347
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,450
Fine.

348
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,410
Mmm.

349
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,010
Are you sure?

350
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,429
You really are adorable.

351
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Arata-san.

352
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
I'll be back again.

353
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Honestly...

354
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:13,069
Are you okay?

355
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah.

356
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,050
A train ticket?

357
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,199
Yeah.

358
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,299
My mom asked me to come home to visit a grave.

359
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,929
Visit a grave?

360
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Whose?

361
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,730
Hayama Naoto.

362
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,090
My older brother.

363
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,580
He'd be 22 now if he were still alive.
