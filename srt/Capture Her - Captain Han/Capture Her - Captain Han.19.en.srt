Captain, those Internet trolls

43
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,440
are simply insane.

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,600
Miss Xu is clearly the victim,

45
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,240
yet they say
she's just acting for payment.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,119
They even send letters
to the team to insult her.

47
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
What we can do now

48
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,919

Look, among the letters
received this week,

50

You go to the office and distribute
letter papers to other teammates.

52
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,359
Let each of them

53
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,720
copy a passage I wrote

54
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,119
and put it in those envelopes.

55
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,720
Then hand them to her
along with this letter.

56
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,000
Just leave it to me.

57
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:35,296

66
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,720
and running all over the mountain.

67
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
And our whole team

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,000
couldn't catch you.

stacks of letters every few days.

74
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,119
Are you envious of me?

75
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,040
Sure.

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm so envious.

77

Well, take your time reading them.
