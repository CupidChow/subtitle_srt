00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,880
Mr. Meng.

10
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,680
- How did you sleep last night?
- Not bad.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
Sorry for the poor hospitality

12
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,040
and living conditions.

13
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:48,240
Mr. Huang.

14
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,000
You seem more cautious than yesterday.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,799
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:54,240
Let's sit and talk. Please.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,680
Here's the thing.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,200
Lin City is not my territory.

19
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,119
When doing business here,

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,040
I have to be cautious.

21
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,119
It's good for us, right?

22
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:04,239
Understood.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
Mr. Huang.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,080
Can we see the goods now?

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,400
Yes. Bring the goods.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mr. Meng, this batch of goods

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,319
was prepared in a hurry.

28
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,199
Next time you visit me,

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
as long as you have money,

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,839
I can even get you a panda.

31
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,024
Excuse me for a moment.

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,519
Mr. Huang, can we talk business now?

33
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:53,056
(Forest Note)

34
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,768
Yes.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,199
Before that,

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,919
take a look at this.

37
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,320
What is this?

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
What is this?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,080
Doesn't Mrs. Meng know?

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,919
Mrs. Meng, you're amazing.

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,320
You've followed
from the capital to Lin City.

42
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,919
Was Qixiang's factory

43
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,000
almost ruined

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,240
by you?

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,759
How lucky I am.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
If I didn't get this,

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
would I

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,119
be destroyed by you too?

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,639
Mr. Huang, is there a misunderstanding?

50
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,119
My wife and I are both from the south.

51
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,919
We came here just to do business.

52
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,919
You're acting very well. Go on.

53
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Mr. Huang.

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,800
I really don't understand.

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,199
Darling, is there someone trying

56
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,639
to sabotage our cooperation,

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,399
so they gave Mr. Huang

58
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,199
this to trick you?

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,616
Yes.

60
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,119
Is this not yours, Mrs. Meng?

61
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,000
Of course not.

62
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,399
I'll help you deal with it.

63
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,920
Watch out.

64
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,839
Mr. Meng.

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,279
Han Xizhou.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,320
Brother, Han Xizhou

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,480
often gives us trouble.

68
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,640
Our competitors will laugh at us.

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,720
Let's get rid of him.

70
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
How?

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Did you give the notebook to them?

72
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,839
Forget the notebook.

73
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,559
He cares so much about that reporter.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Why not get rid of her too?

75
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,600
That's what you can do?

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Why don't you get rid of me?

77
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,079
How many times have I told you?

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,480
All we want is money.

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,079
I know,

80
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,040
but that female reporter...

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,519
She is sent here for work.

82
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,760
Once the matter with Qixiang is settled,

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,920
she'll leave soon.

84
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,239
What if she finds out about the past?

85
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,200
Then you tell me

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,399
what she can't know.

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Pleasure working with you.

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,464
Who's that?

89
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,679
You two catch up. Go.

90
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,760
Brother, you have to save me.

91
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,320
If they find out,

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll go to jail.

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,648
Brother.

94
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:36,768
(Woodcraft of Fortune)

95
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,720
Did you get this scar

96
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,720
when patrolling the forest?

97
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,880
Nannan.

98
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,959
Are you hurt?

99
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,799
Luckily, the police arrived.

100
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:37,959
Otherwise, you'll be in danger.

101
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Why does Han Xizhou

102
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,440
always put you in danger?

103
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,200
You absolutely cannot act on your own.

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Otherwise, you'll be called back.

105
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,440
I'm afraid you'll get into danger again.

106
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,799
Nannan, Qixiang...

107
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,264
Wu Wen.

108
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:03,079
Can you tell me again how you saved me

109
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,000
when I was young?

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,000
