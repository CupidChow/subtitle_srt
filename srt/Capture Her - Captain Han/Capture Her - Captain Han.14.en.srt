(Rainbow Coffee)

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,959
So, how did you remember?

11
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,919
At Huang Youcai's place.

12
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:01,680
I didn't expect a blessing in disguise.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,519
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,919
It's bad luck.

15
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:12,720
So, all these years,
you haven't come looking for me.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,519
You even pretended
to not recognize me when you saw me.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,160
It's because of what happened
on the mountain back then?

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
If we hadn't gone up the hill,

19
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:27,639
you wouldn't have
encountered those people and...

20
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,519
What's the big deal?

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,120
Isn't it just a beating?

22
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,000
Anyway, I've remembered

23
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,519
our beautiful past.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,559
We truly see each other's hearts
in the face of adversity.

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,720
Yes, isn't it just a beating?

26
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,440
Han Xizhou,

27
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:02,160
what if I never returned

28
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,360
to Lin City?

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,279
I would have been waiting here forever.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Waiting for the gods

31
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,520
to hear my wish

32
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,360
and bring you back to me.

33
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,279
(What's the big deal?)

34
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,320
(Isn't it just a beating?)

35
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,000
(Anyway, I've remembered)

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,279
(our beautiful past.)

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,919
Mom, I'm going to school.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,839
Nannan, you're back.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,672
Wu Wen.

40
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,919
Wu Wen, you've read my letter

41
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,520
for you, right?

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,399
I'm really sorry.

43
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,279
I was selfish.

44
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,759
I lied to you

45
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,160
and took his place.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
If I didn't remember,

47
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,639
you would keep it
from me forever, right?

48
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,399
You must hate me.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,919
I don't hate you.

50
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,199
Wu Wen, you lied to me

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,880
and took Han Xizhou's place,

52
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,800
so we became good friends.

53
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,600
But over the years,

54
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,199
you have been nice to me.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,800
I won't go back to Beijing.

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
It's indeed not safe

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,320
to live here.

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,119
So, I've discussed it with Captain Han.

59
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,799
I'm going to move to his place.

60
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,839
Let's go.

61
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,736
I have to go.

62
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,776
Han Xizhou.

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,079
Wait for me outside.

64
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,968
Okay.

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,920
She has remembered everything?

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,760
Not everything.

67
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,920
I hope she never

68
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,480
remembers the worst part.

69
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,720
Nannan, actually Wu Wen was right.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,200
It's my fault I didn't protect you.

71
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,200
Perhaps going back to Beijing

72
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,799
would be better for you.

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,072
Han Xizhou.

74
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,399
Everyone

75
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,519
is an independent individual.

76
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,160
Protecting me
is never your responsibility.

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,119
Staying here is my choice.

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,279
Please respect me.

79
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,920
There's a bonfire party
in Lin City tonight.

80
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,880
Let's go back and get ready.
Don't be late.

81
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,912
Let's go.

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on. Get ready.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,312
Cheers.

84
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,880
One, two, three.

85
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,760
I can't.

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,880
One more.

87
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,279
Only four.

88
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,519
Fang Cheng, you're too weak.

89
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,119
I really can't.

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Let him do extra training.

91
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Sure.

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,288
Is it my turn?

93
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,040
Miss Xu, it's your turn.

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,880
I didn't see this coming.

95
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,000
- What's your choice?
- I choose Truth.

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,000
What do we ask?

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,440
I know. Miss Xu.

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,799
Among all of us,

99
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,119
who do you like the most?

100
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,519
Come on. I like...

101
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,320
It's my turn.

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,760
Captain.

103
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,279
It's your turn.

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,519
I choose Truth.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,559
Why didn't you choose Dare?

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
Let me think.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
Think of a harsh one.

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,440
Han Xizhou, what's your biggest regret

109
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,799
of your life?

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,679
