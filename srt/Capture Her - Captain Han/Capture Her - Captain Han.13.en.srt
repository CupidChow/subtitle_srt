The funny thing is, we're here again.

11

We first met

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,800
in the medical office, right?

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I heard

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,879
you didn't study
at a university in Lin City.

15
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,440
Your major wasn't forestry.

16
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,839
Why did you want
to become a forest ranger?

17
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:23,800
Han Xizhou, I really don't understand.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,720
Xu Nannan isn't part
of your forest rangers.

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,720
Why do you have to involve her?

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,080
Do you understand what this means?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,232
Yes.

22
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,559
I took your place.

23
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,519
But both ten years ago and now,

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,559

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,040
what else can you do?

26
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,519
I admit I did wrong with this matter.

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,919
If you really care about Nannan,

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,000
you should push her far away

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,839
and let her return to the capital

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,039

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,639
