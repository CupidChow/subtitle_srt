9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,639
Mr. and Mrs. Meng,

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,479
are you a couple?

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,799
You don't quite look like it.

12
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,240
Mrs. Meng looks familiar.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,479
Have we met before?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,199
I remember.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,720
She looks like a celebrity.

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,480
Mr. Huang, you're a good liar.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,919
But many people say

18
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,360
I look like a star.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Right, honey?

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,000
Mr. Meng,

21
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,199
Mrs. Meng is gorgeous.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,559
Absolutely.

23
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,680
Mr. Huang.

24
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,480
Do we only have hot pot today?

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,480
Isn't there anything special?

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,760
Hot pot is our specialty.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,760
You can't eat spicy food? Hey...

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,680
Mr. Huang.

29
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,879
My wife means

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
she wants to eat something special.

31
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,319
Besides doing business,

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,279
we came all the way here

33
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,839
to try something fresh

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,680
and special.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,496
Yes.

36
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,279
But today,

37
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,800
we're just eating, not talking

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,440
about anything else.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,479
So when can you deliver the goods?

40
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,279
The inspection here is so strict.

41
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,279
We want to get the goods
and go back as soon as possible.

42
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,639
As I said,

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,160
today we're just eating.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,800
Please play by my rules.

45
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,520
Well,

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,399
I've prepared a room for you two.

47
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,320
You stay for one night.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
We'll talk tomorrow.

49
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,960
Only one bed.
Obviously, they're testing us.

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,240
Anyway, we have to play.

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,000
Honey, let's go.

52
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,440
Honey, you're good.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Honey, you're so good.

54
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,912
Honey.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
Go on.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,720
Oh, honey.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
How can you be so bad?

58
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,360
Easy there.

59
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,880
The curtains aren't even drawn.

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,200
Sorry, I forgot.

61
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,559
I'll draw them now.

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Boss, the curtains are closed.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,640
I saw it. I'm not blind.

64
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Speak.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,880
Speak.

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
Honey,

67
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,600
you were so good just now.

68
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,640
I'm almost melting.

69
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll give you a massage later.

70
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,239
Why didn't you tell me?

71
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,880
I want to take a hot bath now.

72
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,200
I'll run your bath later, okay?

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,480
No, I want to do it now.

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,640
You carry me.

75
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,399
I want to bathe with you.

76
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,208
Go.

77
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,079
No sound.

78
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,279
They're taking a bath.

79
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,959
Go. Keep an eye on them.

80
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,239
The signal is blocked.
I can't call the police.

81
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,040
How did you know I was here?

82
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,399
I received a message

83
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,880
from a strange number,

84
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,640
saying there's illegal trading here.

85
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,679
I thought

86
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,279
I'd try my luck.

87
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,600
I didn't expect

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,959
to see you here.

89
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:58,640
Nannan, you know how dangerous it is.

90
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,160
If you want to leave,

91
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,320
I can take you out...

92
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,880
Han Xizhou, I won't chicken out.

93
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,440
And I won't leave you alone.

94
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,359
Moreover, we have so many things

95
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,399
to investigate.

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,040
Okay, but you have to promise me.

97
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,959
Your safety comes first in everything.

98
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,880
Mr. Meng, we're here. Please get off.

99
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Mr. Meng, thank you for coming.

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Not at all. I get it.

101
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,119
Where's your boss?

102
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,320
My boss is waiting inside.

103
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,104
Let's go.

104
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,959
My boss told me.

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,320
Since you treat your wife

106
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,880
so well,

107
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,279
Mrs. Meng must be the one

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,720
who makes decisions.

109
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,160
So, we only allow Mrs. Meng to go in

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,559
to check the goods.

111
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,160
You didn't mention this before.

112
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920
I think Mr. Huang

113
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,279
doesn't really want
to do business with us.

114
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,679
Honey, let's get out of here.

115
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Mr. Meng, don't be mad.

116
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,279
My boss sincerely wants

117
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,640
to be friends with you.

118
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,239
Later, I can

119
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,679
show you around here.

120
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,799
Mrs. Meng will definitely be safe.

121
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,079
I stake my life on it.

122
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,040
Honey, it's okay.

123
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,279
I guess Mr. Huang

124
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,880
owns this factory.

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,399
Maybe we can cooperate more

126
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,959
with him in the future.

127
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,079
You can go with him.

128
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,679
No, I can't leave you alone.

129
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,480
Let them in.
