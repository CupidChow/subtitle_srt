00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,200
Well,

10
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:42,279
they're fine.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,520
We're relieved.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,479
Wu Wen, half a year ago,
you were Captain Han's love rival.

13
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:57,159
How did you suddenly

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,560
become their love guardian?

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,479
They've gone through so much.

16
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,800
After everything,

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,959
I realized

18
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,279
what difficulties facing them.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,279
Well,

20
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:15,959
aren't you the same?

21
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,400
Yes.

22
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:23,160
I heard when the police came,

23
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,720
you were the first one to rush in.

24
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,959
What's the matter?

25
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,120
Don't you realize it?

26
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,279
If the ricin powder was real,

27
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:34,319
and you rushed in
without any protection,

28
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,839
your life would be risky.

29
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,639
Are all journalists

30
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,959
so reckless?

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,599
What are you laughing at?

32
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:43,919
Stop it.

33
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:44,839
Forget it.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,919
Yes, it's my fault.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,519
I'll try to be cautious.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,080
That's more like it.

37
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,319
Tonight, we don't need to stay here.

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,720
Shall we find a place

39
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,400
to have a drink?

40
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,120
Okay, let's drink.

41
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,119
But I need

42
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:10,960
to change clothes first.

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,040
Wu Wen.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,520
What's wrong?

45
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,160
It doesn't look good?

46
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,039
I'm not used to dressing like this.

47
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,559
But the clothing store owner said

48
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,720
it looked good.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,520
I'll go up and get changed.

50
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,520
Wait for me.

51
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:02,880
It looks great. Wait for me.

52
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,679
Wait for me.

53
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:07,720
For the past six months,

54
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,800
I've been like this,

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
working hard on reports

56
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,080
and do interviews.

57
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,399
I don't have to tell you
about each of my interviews, do I?

58
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,320
No need. I've seen them all.

59
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,440
Your every video report

60
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,520
and news article,

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,479
I've seen or read them all.

62
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,520
It's a pity you're not a host
and don't broadcast news.

63
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,399
Otherwise, I could see you every day.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,639
When you were not around,

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
I always imagined

66
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,520
what you were doing

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,320
without me.

68
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,520
I worked hard every day,

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,839
filling up my schedule

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,479
to stay busy.

71
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,199
In this way,
I won't have the time to miss you.

72
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,559
But I failed.

73
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,399
When I took a 10-minute nap,

74
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,679
I dreamed about you.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,119
I'm scared.

76
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm scared of not overcoming obstacles,

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,720
letting us live in guilt

78
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,160
and pain.

79
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,839
I'm sorry. I've brought you more sorrow

80
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,520
than happiness.

81
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,760
So in the days to come,

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
let's live in happiness, okay?

83
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,920
Sorry to barge in.

84
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,399
Can I borrow the flowers

85
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,519
on your table?

86
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,160
It's too late now, and I can't buy any.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,679
- Of course, you can.
- Of course, you can.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,760
When did it happen?

89
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,200
What's going on with Wu Wen?

90
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,320
Why hasn't he come back yet?

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
Xiya, I'm really sorry.

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,040
It's too late,
and the flower shop is closed.

93
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:18,880
You look so beautiful today.

94
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,839
You should receive flowers.

95
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,200
I remember you like yellow.

96
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,079
So I picked out all the yellow ones

97
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,040
from Nannan's flowers

98
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,279
for you.

99
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,016
Let's go.

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,936
Here.

101
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
Thank you.

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
Cheers, come on.

103
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,160
What's going on with them?

104
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,160
Something must be going on.

105
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,399
They're all here for the party.

106
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,440
Why haven't you come yet?

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
I haven't finished my report yet.

108
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,239
Are you drinking?

109
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,600
A bit.

110
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,040
Send me the address.

111
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,320
I'll come to pick you up now.

112
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,640
Han Xizhou.

113
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,079
Come on. I won't get drunk

114
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,200
after only one beer.

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,040
I know,

116
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
but I miss you.

117
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,399
I want to see you right now.

118
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,160
So can you tell me the address now?

119
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,679
Okay.

120
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,720
Wait for me.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,360
You're here.

122
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,119
Did you drink a lot?

123
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,320
No, just a bit.

124
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,279
Really?

125
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,320
Nannan, I really missed you tonight.

127
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,399
But we saw each other in the daytime.

128
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,920
But you wasted so much time.

129
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,040
Let's go. They are waiting for us.

130
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,519
Cheers.

131
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,399
Han Xizhou.

132
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,399
I came back in a hurry,

133
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,920
so I didn't pack many things.

134
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,200
What do you need?
I'll take you to buy it.

135
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
I know a place

136
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,000
where it has everything I need.

137
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,576
Where?

138
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,399
Your house.

139
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,519
So, are you taking me home?

140
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,512
