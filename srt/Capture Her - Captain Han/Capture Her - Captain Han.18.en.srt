00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,439
Miss Xu,

10
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,759
you've made an awful lot of enemies.

11
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,799
Cheng Jianghe,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
you told me

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,799
you just wanted her
to leave Lin City and Captain Han.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
You never mentioned

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,599
breaking the law.

16
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,720
Now you're playing the good guy?

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,360
Will Han Xizhou even look at you

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,400
with her staying here?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,480
Don't forget it.

20
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,319
You had a part in tricking her here.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,080
If she goes back,

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,639
what would your captain

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,919
and your teammates

24
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,480
think of you?

25
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,120
Will they still treat you as a teammate?

26
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,992
Take this.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
You told me

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,480
the pictures were blurry, right?

29
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,239
Today, let's take a clear one.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,959
Let go of me.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,120
Do it. Why are you hesitating?

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,680
With those pictures in my hand,

33
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,839
she will never return to Lin City again,

34
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,400
let alone see your captain.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Isn't that what we both want?

36
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,608
Do it!

37
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,480
If you don't do it now,
I'll kill you too.

38
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,520
I told you to leave, but you refused.

39
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,119
So don't blame me now.

40
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,119
I didn't know he would do this to you.

41
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,199
I've already called the police.

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Go! The police will be here soon.

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,919
Get lost!

44
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,752
Xu Nannan.

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,264
Are you okay?

46
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:34,720
Xu Nannan, you will regret this.

47
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:41,880
Wait for my big gift.

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,520
Xu Nannan, you'll see.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,119
Han Xizhou.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,919
You're awake. Are you okay?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,279
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,279
Where's Xiya?

53
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,839
She's fine. Don't worry.

54
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,520
Be careful.

55
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,119
And Cheng Jianghe.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,399
Your voice recording
is the best evidence.

57
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,919
He has already confessed.

58
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,960
That's great.

59
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
It's been ten years.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,240
My return to Lin City this time

61
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,679
was not in vain.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,559
I'm sorry. I went there late.

63
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,960
Han Xizhou,

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,000
you don't need to apologize to me.

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,679
This time, it's truly over.

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,720
From now on,

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,639
we need to look forward

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
and never look back.

69
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,279
Miss Xu is trending on social media.

70
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,959
Can't believe
that actually happened ten years ago.

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,399
Yeah, it's pretty sad
for Miss Xu and Captain.

72
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,624
Captain.

73
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,464
Captain.

74
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,856
Nannan.

75
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,799
You walked so silently and scared me.

76
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
I spilled the soup.

77
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,959
You must have stewed it for a long time.

78
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,359
I'm sorry I spilled it all.

79
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,119
Sit down.

80
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,119
I'll clean up.

81
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,799
It's just a bowl of soup.
I can stew it again.

82
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,600
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,399
It was my fault.

84
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
I saw you working,

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
so I didn't want to disturb you.

86
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,839
Nannan,

87
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,160
are you sure
you can appear on camera now?

88
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm fine.

89
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,640
No need to worry about me.

90
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,519
The live broadcast is about to start.

91
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,040
Where did Editor Wu go?

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
He was just here.

93
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,519
These have been neatly organized.

94
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,559
Nannan, I won't interfere
with your decision.

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,119
You can share your worries

96
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,160
with me.

97
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,080
Han Xizhou.

98
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,559
The live broadcast is about to start.

99
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,839
You should go out.

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,839
Even though I really hope

101
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,959
she can face the camera again

102
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,000
and regain her confidence,

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,119
there are too many rumors
about her on the Internet right now.

104
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,160
It might be better for you
to persuade her to give it up this time.

105
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,399
What do you think Nannan

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,160
is like?

107
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,039
So I think

108
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,960
we should respect her decision.

109
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
But after all, she's a girl.

110
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,559
No matter how strong she is,

111
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,359
those negative comments

112
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,280
would hurt her a lot.

113
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
What if she sees those comments

114
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,359
during the live broadcast?

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,039
Han Xizhou,
do you care about her or not?

116
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,640
If you won't say it to her, I will.

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
I do care about her.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,039
So I should

119
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
listen to her opinion.

120
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,880
I have faith in her.

121
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,960
Wu Wen, loving someone
is not about interfering.

122
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,320
It's about support

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
