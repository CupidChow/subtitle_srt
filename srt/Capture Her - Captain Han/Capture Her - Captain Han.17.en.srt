What is it?

You got in my car, and you're afraid
I've poisoned the water?

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,919
No need. Just say it.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,799
You like your captain.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,200
I didn't guess wrong, did I?

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,400
Yes, I like him.

15
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,200
So I won't help you against him.

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,599
When did I ask you to do that?

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,239
I just want you to get rid of

18
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,319
the female journalist by his side.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,480
Once she's gone,
you'll have a chance. Understand?

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,559
What's in it for you by doing this?

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,279
Just tell me if you'll do it or not.

23
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,400
Han Xizhou,

24
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,000
if you keep

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,480
staring at me like this,

26
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:42,919
you might cut your hand.

27
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,319
You've been staring at me a lot lately.

28
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,879
Did you suddenly discover my charm?

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,319
Not suddenly.

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
I've always known you're charming.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,279
You're making me blush

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
by saying that.

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
I feel like I'm in a dream

34
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,119
these days,

35
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,160
and sometimes I'm afraid

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,559
to wake up

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,960
from it.

38
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,759
This is not a dream.

39
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,759
I'm here.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm not going anywhere.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,399
Xiya, how come you're here?

42
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,000
Just now, I was told

43
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,880
that someone got hurt
when catching someone.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,919
They told me to hurry over.

45
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,160
I was just passing by

46
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
and came to tell you.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,320
Why didn't they notify me?

48
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,839
I told them

49
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,000
I'd do it.

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,520
Do you want me to go with you?

51
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,800
No need. Just wait for me at home.

52
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,320
Then, you guys be careful.

53
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,120
Let's go.

54
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,839
- Dad.
- Why are you guys here?

55
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,520
- Some bad guys are after us.
- Nannan, go.

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,488
Dad.

57
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,799
Let go of me.

58
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,279
(Let go of me.)

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,839
(Help!)

60
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,359
(Han Xizhou!)

61
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,040
Nannan.

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,359
(Let go!)

63
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,752
(Let her go!)

64
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,408
(Nannan!)

65
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,320
Miss Xu, did you get the photos?

66
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,839
Who are you?

67
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,519
What matters isn't who I am,

68
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,720
but what is shown in the photos.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,959
You don't want it to go public, do you?

70
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,519
Let's meet.

71
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:25,920
Otherwise, not only you

72
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,160
will see the photos.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,720
Miss Xu, what do you think
of the photos?

74
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,200
Do you like them?

75
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,519
Go over there, now.

76
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
Just a few photos.

77
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,880
They're so blurry.
Who can tell what's in them?

78
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,200
If you called me here
just to show me photos,

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,959
then that's too boring.

80
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,000
Xu Nannan, think about it.

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,399
What will the forest rangers
think of you

82
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
when they see the photos?

83
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,959
Even if that Han guy doesn't care,

84
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,359
aren't you afraid

85
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,920
of others gossiping behind your back?

86
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,480
I believe

87
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,959
he will protect me.

88
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,320
And,

89
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
no matter what you want,

90
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,119
I won't make deals with poachers.

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,519
Leave Lin City,

92
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,600
and I'll delete all the photos.

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,679
Just this one condition.

94
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Just that simple?

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,279
Cheng Jianghe,

96
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,119
you're so eager
to drive me out of Lin City.

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Is it because you're afraid
I'll discover something?

98
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,119
I just can't stand

99
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,359
you journalists.

100
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,160
How are we supposed to do business

101
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,920
with you here?

102
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,519
It's been ten years

103
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,119
since those pictures were taken.

104
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,559
Why are they in your hands now?

105
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,720
Or

106
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,600
you're actually in cahoots
with those people?

107
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,959
My brother said you lost your memory.

108
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:12,079
Seems you didn't forget completely.

109
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,359
You split up into two groups,

110
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,880
one chasing me and Han Xizhou

111
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,519
and the other luring my dad away.

112
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,200
You were one of them, right?

113
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,000
T-T-This is just your guess.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Where there's a guess,
there's the truth.

115
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,719
Ever since you saw my notebook in my bag

116
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,119
and found my real identity,

117
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,080
you've been scared.

118
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,919
You guessed I was here
because of my dad.

119
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,840
You're so smart,

120
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,919
and I really like it.

121
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,479
But you're too smart

122
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,919
for your own good.

123
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,719
The clue about Huang Youcai
was given by you.

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,479
The purpose was
to use him to get rid of me.

125
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,799
Everything you've done only proves

126
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:11,479
my dad's death wasn't an accident.

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
That's right.

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,679
What can you do about it?

129
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,520
How did my dad die exactly?

130
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,559
Give it back to me.

131
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,000
- Give it to me.
- Give it back.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,119
Give me back my bag.

133
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,119
Give it back to me.

134
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,000
Playing this trick with me?

135
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,119
I gave you the chance to leave.

136
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,119
It's you who didn't want it.

137
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,840
Let go.

138
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:56,479
Cheng Jianghe,

139
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,000
I will make you pay.

140
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,080
Letting me pay the price?

141
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,679
See if you have the chance.
