00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,599
Let go.

10
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:51,720
Han Xizhou.

11
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,599
Han Xizhou.

12
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,680
Captain Han, you seem worried.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
This time, we caught Huang Youcai.

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,879
Your report

15
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,199
made Qixiang...

16
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,720
If you keep worrying

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
about things that haven't happened,

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
wouldn't that be too tiring?

19
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,000
Right? Smile.

20
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:53,959
Smile.

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,400
That's right.

22
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,080
Han Xizhou,

23
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,880
let go of me.

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,320
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

25
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,759
Captain Han,
did you sleep well last night?

26
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you looking at?

27
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,639
Our captain is getting
more and more attached.

28
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,199
Shady tricks.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,839
Xiya, how is your EQ
even lower than mine?

30
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,520
Do you understand? It's called romance.

31
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,080
You...

32
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,240
- Xiya.
- Xiya.

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,399
Don't be angry.

34
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,479
Calm down.

35
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
Don't be mad.

36
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
That dumb guy really has no filter.

37
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
Xu Nannan.

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,119
Don't call my name.

39
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,119
Can I change my name now?

40
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,679
It's okay. I didn't know
they would come.

41
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,679
Change into thicker clothes

42
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,720
before you go downstairs, okay?

43
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,880
Can I

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,360
skip

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
this meal?

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
Are you being shy?

47
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,440
Who's shy?

48
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,399
I'm just not hungry.

49
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,799
It's my stomach growling.

50
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,119
I'm hungry.

51
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,440
So

52
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,920
change into something thicker right away

53
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,320
and come down to eat with me, okay?

54
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,200
Fine,

55
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,480
just for your sake.

56
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,079
Come on, next round.

57
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,920
I'll draw.

58
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,640
- It must be you.
- Reveal the card.

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,559
Not me.

60
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,600
Not me either.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,559
Not me either.

62
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,119
Reveal it now.

63
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,640
Is it you?

64
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,279
Not me either.

65
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,119
Captain.

66
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,279
It's our captain.

67
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,000
Right after talking about punishment,
Captain Han drew a K.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,119
Come on,
drink cross-cupped wine with Xiya.

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,920
- Come on, fill it up.
- Pour.

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,079
I'll fill one for the captain too.

71
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,880
It's just a game.

72
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,920
Our captain has no feelings for Xiya,
just brotherly.

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,359
Come on, drink.

74
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,119
Drink.

75
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:56,480
- Drink.
- Drink.

76
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,399
Drinking is bad for girls.

77
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,519
This way you don't have to drink.

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
This game is not fun at all.

79
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,480
Let's change to another one.

80
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,000
- Yes.
- Change it.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,504
Be careful.

82
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,799
- Awesome.
- Next one.

83
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:38,920
Captain, it's your turn.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,320
- Go, Captain.
- Go.

85
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,880
- Come on.
- Go, Captain.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
- Easy.
- Go.

87
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
- Be careful.
- Keep it up.

88
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
- Yes!
- Awesome, Captain.

89
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,480
- Next.
- Next.

90
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,600
It's my turn.

91
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
Go.

92
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,000
Let me show you.

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,424
Come on.

94
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,584
Come on.

95
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,760
I'm no match.

96
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,559
Whatever the punishment,
you guys decide.

97
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,399
Eat cookies

98
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,119
with the oldest person here.

99
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,920
Who's the oldest among us?

100
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,720
Captain.

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,119
I'm two years older than him.

102
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,920
What does age matter?

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,679
If you want to compare,
compare strength.

104
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
- Go.
- 17.

105
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,519
- Keep going.
- 18.

106
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,720
- Come on, Captain.
- 19.

107
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,760
Go, one more.

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,679
Go, Captain.

109
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,720
- Keep it up, Captain.
- One more.

110
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,880
Captain, one more.

111
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,519
Go.

112
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,559
You're awesome, Captain.

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,880
I knew you were better.

114
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,960
