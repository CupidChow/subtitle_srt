28
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,720

I was thinking about something.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,000

Aren't you going to confess to Miss Xu?

39
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,520
I need fireworks.

40
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720

Captain, the fireworks
can't be seen clearly during the day.

Yes, we can only hear the sound.
