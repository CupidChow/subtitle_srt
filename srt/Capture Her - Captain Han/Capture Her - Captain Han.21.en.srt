Go.

00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,959
for you.

56
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,600

Captain.

63
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,959
Call an ambulance.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,488
Quick.

65
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,239
This powder is toxic, isn't it?

66
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,519
Don't be scared. Do as I say.

67
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,000

69
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,320
You haven't touched much.

70
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,320
You get out quickly.
Don't stay here with me.

71
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,920
No way. I told you.

72
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,760
No matter what happens,

73
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,559
I will always be there.

74
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,920
What is this?

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,920
Ricin powder.

76
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,200
It can remain
in the human body for several hours.

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,559
Han Xizhou.

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,519

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,519
My hands go numb.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,959
Hold on.

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,920
It's from Cheng Dahai, right?

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,119
This is probably fake.

83
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,600
This stuff is hard to find.

84
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,279
Whether it's real or fake,

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
at least I saw you.

86
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,559
So, I have no regrets.

87
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,959
Okay, don't talk anymore.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,200
Thankfully, it's not ricin.

89
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,079
False alarm.

90
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,119
Xiya, how is he? Is he awake?

91
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,519
He got a cut on his leg yesterday.

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,959
Today it's even worse.

93
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,720
But it has been stitched.

94
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you okay?

95
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm okay.

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,519
That is not ricin at all.

97
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,200
Cheng Dahai just fooled us.

98
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,799
The police are handling it.

99
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,279
They let him go after a warning.

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,720
Why did you pull out the needle?

101
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,399
You haven't finished the fluids yet.

102
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,760
Does it hurt?

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Yes.

104
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,119
I'll call Xiya over.

105
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,528
Don't leave.

106
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,679
