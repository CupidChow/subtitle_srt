[Street interview from Chuckle Channel]

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,630
Although we are in the era of free love,

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,670
love between teachers and students has always been a taboo on campus.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,000
Today let's hear about adolescents' opinions.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,940
I don't think it's appropriate.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,910
I don't think it's OK.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,840
Cradle-snatcher love works for me,

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,340
and I don't think there's much difference between these two.

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,480
In my opinion, the teacher may take the student's side,

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,640
which is not fair to others.

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,040
It depends on the physical appearance of the teacher.

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,850
It's OK if they are aesthetically appealing.

14

[Nod]

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,550
You are such a pervert.

16
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,310
It's pure bliss when the person's hot.

17
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,450
It's harassment when the person's ugly.

18
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,890
Are you sure you've never ever had any fantasies about your teacher?

19
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,080
Can I be censored?

20
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,830
[Yes]

21
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,850
Then which teacher is your favorite?

22
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,390
Math, I guess.

23
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,230
Because of my struggling in the subject.

24
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,220
What about physical education?

25
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,420
-If we're talking about swimming class…
-Swimming class.

26
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,930
Teacher, I'm wet.

27
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,370
Next, we come across a group of good-looking students.

28
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,300
Would you like a quick interview with us?

29
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:48,800
You want an interview with us?

30
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,970
Do I look OK?

31
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,210
May I have your opinion on love between teachers and students?

32
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,050
It wouldn't take long.

34
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,840
Miss Chen,

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,240
I love you.

36
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,949
My goodness.

37
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,620
It's excessive.

38
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,950
They kissed.

39
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:24,370
Chairwoman, what brings your sudden arrival?

40
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,630
Where is Miss Chen?

41
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,970
Chairwoman, what happened in the morning was a prank.

42
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,240
What do you mean a prank?

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,910
So you mean what happened in the morning

44
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,370
is Yixiang's fault?

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,240
No, Chairwoman, what I mean is that...

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,870
I don't want to listen to what you mean.

47
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,280
I introduced you to work here because you were obedient,

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,910
and you knew how to read the atmosphere.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,880
And what about now?

50
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,579
You feel so great being the director?

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,620
Ask Chen Mengyun to come to my office.

52
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,590
Chairwoman.

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,730
Chair…

54
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,640
Did I do something wrong?

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,800
The video is already widespread.

56
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,950
You seduced my son on stage,

57
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,910
and now you are the one asking me:

58
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,910
"Did I do something wrong"?

59
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,710
What qualifications do you have to be a teacher?

60
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,720
You are not qualified to teach my son.

61
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
Chairwoman,

62
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,650
what happened in the morning

63
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,720
really has nothing to do with Miss Chen.

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,690
It was Zhang Yixiang who suddenly...

65
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,160
And you are still blaming Yixiang right now.

66
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,329
You are still harboring her.

67
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,390
If you have already watched the video,

68
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,670
then in my opinion,

69
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,230
you should know the situation well.

70
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,230
It was your son who made the offensive behavior.

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,970
If you want to ask for responsibility,

72
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,210
please stick to the current affair.

73
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,540
Can you please tell me how Yixiang

74
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,010
offended you?

75
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,280
You've been picking on him

76
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,910
since you worked at Tainan First Senior High.

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,850
Or did you intend to aim at me instead?

78
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,280
I didn't know you,

79
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,480
then why would I aim at you?

80
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,220
Don't you think I can do nothing to you.

81
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,090
Teachers like you

82
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,960
specialize in shamelessly seducing students.

83
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,050
You can pack your things and get lost then and there.

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,620
I know you have great authority in Tainan First Senior High,

85
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,860
but not great enough to fire teachers.

86
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,600
I'll leave if the school asks me to.

87
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,670
However, I'll not leave because of a mere sentence from you.

88
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,670
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,330
I'm not under the control of the parent association's chairwoman.

90
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,540
Stop right there! Who said you can leave?

91
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,050
Director,

92
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,980
are you alright?

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Yixiang,

94
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,430
don't worry, I knew everything.

95
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,159
Mom will seek justice for you.

96
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,460
What justice to seek?

97
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,230
What's this? What's going on here?

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,610
It's normal for adolescents to do pranks.

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,310
As long as they will be guided,

100
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,010
I don't see it as a severe problem as well.

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,280
But you specifically came

102
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,950
to pick a bone with me,

103
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,340
claiming that I seduced Zhang Yixiang.

104
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,150
Why were you getting so worked up

105
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,060
and saying that I'm targeting you?

106
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,890
Do I have any reason to target you?

107
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,030
What did my mom say to you?

108
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,470
Say something!

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,630
Is that important?

110
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,540
I originally thought that you did those nasty things

111
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,310
to show passive resistance against your mother.

112
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,010
But I was wrong.

113
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,210
You are simply a nasty person,

114
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,540
just like your mother.

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,430
So, currently Miss Chen has been completely

116
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,800
transferred out of the senior year teaching position.

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,100
She's only in charge of freshmen and sophomores.

118
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,760
The floors which freshmen and sophomores occupied

119
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,300
are totally different from the ones for senior students.

120
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,270
So fundamentally, they

121
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,200
hardly have any opportunity to interact.

122
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,370
Chairwoman,

123
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,510
I'm concerned that it's midterm right now,

124
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,180
and if Miss Chen is suddenly unemployed,

125
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,350
we need to report it to the top.

126
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,360
The Board of School Directors

127
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,150
will also demand a good reason.

128
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,260
Chairwoman,

129
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,660
you may not want to make a big deal and

130
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,360
let School Director Zhang knows either, do you?

131
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,660
Is this a threat?

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,170
No, Chairwoman,

133
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,990
I...

134
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,830
Chairwoman.

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
Teacher's coming.

136
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,450
The teacher's here.

137
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,560
Last week we studied Love Letters for Mei,

138
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,360
which is a collection of letters

139
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,970
between Xu Zhimo and Lu Xiaoman.

140
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,100
Someone who's read the collection once described that

141
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,630
it was Xu Zhimo who freed Lu Xiaoman's

142
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,010
bound soul.

143
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,110
So we can see from

144
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,680
the expressions of Lu Xiaoman that...

145
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,440
Miss Chen,

146
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,950
did Zhang Yixiang

147
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,820
free your bound soul this morning?

148
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,190
It's more of your body instead.

149
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,320
Miss He and Mr. Fang, have some beverages.

150
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,650
Thank you, Mr. Qiu.

151
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,659
Thank you.

152
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,300
You are really thoughtful.

153
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,830
I'm flattered.

154
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,100
It's a shame that someone is so oblivious to how great you are.

155
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,040
It turns out that she likes little fresh meats,

156
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,370
no wonder you don't stand a chance.

157
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,870
I just think that she's a newcomer,

158
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,340
and I want to be nice,

159
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,480
not because I fall for her.

160
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,510
But... I didn't expect her to be this kind of person.

161
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,710
Really.

162
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,780
It's awful.

163
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,120
She has the ability to do so.

164
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,250
What, are you jealous?

165
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,290
Come on, it's a shame to

166
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,420
seduce male students.

167
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,490
But she's young.

168
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,650
So she can seduce th-

169
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm full, let's go.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,940
Miss Chen.

171
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,000
Director.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,110
I just happened to be looking for you.

173
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,770
These...

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,710
These are the withdrawal forms from the club

175
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,010
[Application Form for Withdrawal]

176
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,950
Miss Chen Mengyun is in charge of.

177
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,370
Miss Chen.

178
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,540
Director.

179
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm sorry for you about what happened in the morning.

180
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,070
I think...

181
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,280
I think that Chairwoman

182
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,250
really was being unreasonable.

183
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,350
It's not your fault.

184
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,650
Is your wound OK?

185
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,960
Oh.

186
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,820
It's nothing.

187
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,590
Don't worry, it's just a minor injury.

188
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,400
These are for you.

189
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,800
That's a lot for one morning.

190
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,240
Director,

191
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,250
I want to quit the club.

192
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,110
What happened?

193
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,320
Haven't you been clamoring all year

194
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,750
about wanting to learn how to bake a cake for someone?

195
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,590
Isn't it a bit out of the blue to quit now?

196
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,090
It's not the same club advisor anymore.

197
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,360
I don't wanna attend a class

198
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,330
offered by a teacher who seduces students.

199
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,560
What if she seduces Gu Haoxiang as well?

200
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,340
How can you say something so disrespectful?

201
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,970
Apologize to Miss Chen immediately.

202
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,070
Zeng Wanling.

203
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,640
Zeng Wanling.

204
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,110
And you said not to mind.

205
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
I'll have that.

206
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,390
Miss Chen.

207
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,800
There's another issue.

208
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,900
What is it?

209
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,230
The students in Bakery Club

210
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,970
are all conveniently transferred to Chinese Cuisine Cooking Club.

211
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,730
So they need to use

212
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,110
the cooking classroom.

213
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,540
I understand.

214
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll find another place.

215
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,070
Thank you.

216
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,450
Miss Chen,

217
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,890
why are you packing these things by yourself?

218
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:46,520
Didn't you ask students for help?

219
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,130
No need to do that. It's not much to pack and carry, either.

220
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,530
Let me help you.

221
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,530
Does this go in here?

222
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,070
Yes.

223
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,070
Miss Chen,

224
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,770
sorry for asking you to change classrooms.

225
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,770
One moment, please.

226
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,340
Hello.

227
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,110
I'm coming.

228
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,280
Gimme a minute.

229
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,350
Alright.

230
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,290
Bye.

231
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,250
You have a meeting to attend, you'd better go.

232
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,350
OK, Miss Chen, I'll go now.

233
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,890
-Bye.
-Bye.

234
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,450
Teachers like you

235
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,290
specialize in shamelessly seducing students.

236
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,160
You can pack your things and get lost then and there.

237
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,030
It turns out that she likes little fresh meats,

238
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,890
no wonder you don't stand a chance.

239
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,160
Did Zhang Yixiang

240
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,030
free your bound soul this morning?

241
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,790
I don't wanna attend a class

242
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,600
offered by a teacher who seduces students.

243
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,170
Hey.

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,570
I'm not hungry.

245
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,610
Really?

246
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,640
It turns out that even you have a day on which

247
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,200
you lose your appetite because of a prank.

248
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,680
What about it?

249
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,380
Are you feeling regretful?

250
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,670
Mom knows you are trying your best.

251
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,630
Don't cry, Yun, it's OK.

252
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,070
Grade doesn't mean everything.

253
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,170
Let's keep trying next time, OK?

254
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,140
How about Mom plays the piano for you?

255
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,910
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,180
I shouldn't have used you.

257
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,140
I shouldn't have used you against the school,

258
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,380
and my mom.

259
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,990
I admit that I went a bit far.

260
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,370
But I'm really not like my mom.

261
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,970
I went overboard and lost my mind.

262
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,970
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,800
Miss Chen,

264
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,370
can you forgive me?

265
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,170
You used me against the school,

266
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,170
and your mom.

267
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,170
Are you happy by doing that?

268
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,910
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,840
Just say whether you feel happy

270
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,550
or unhappy.

271
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:30,990
I feel happy,

272
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,820
and unhappy at the same time.

273
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,260
I admit that when I first saw

274
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,400
my mom, Principal,

275
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,140
and Director like that,

276
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,940
I did feel happy.

277
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,270
When I first got you,

278
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,850
I also felt ecstatic.

279
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,080
But then,

280
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,650
it doesn't seem to make me happy anymore.

281
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,130
I don't want to see you cry.

282
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,640
When you cry, I'll...

283
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,070
I'll be upset.

284
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,030
You got my phone, right?

285
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,970
Where did you go just now after skipping school?

286
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,000
Nowhere.

287
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,070
I saw you going to see Miss Chen.

288
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,010
By accident.

289
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,050
I saw you two inside a glass room.

290
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,890
Then why do you ask?

291
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,150
Why did you go to her place?

292
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,320
To apologize?

293
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm surprised that you would apologize to a person

294
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,730
you bullied,

295
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,630
did you really develop a crush on her?

296
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,370
Do you live by the sea?

297
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,170
Nonsense.

298
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,140
Don't have a crush on her.

299
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,990
Miss Chen.

300
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,030
I came to her for my phone and bag.

301
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,560
She kept them for me.

302
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,530
We are just friends.

303
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,140
Won't it affect her study to work on weekdays?

304
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,110
She's been doing that since freshman year.

305
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,940
Don't stay out late.

306
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,880
Miss Chen.

307
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,550
[Yuxin]

308
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,050
Stay away from her.

309
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,170
Yixiang.

310
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,260
I prepared some fruits.

311
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,940
Yixiang.

312
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,210
Come out and have some fruits.

313
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,380
Why are you still wearing school uniform? Didn't you take a shower?

314
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,090
Hmm.

315
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,760
I'm too busy studying.

316
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,060
Yixiang,

317
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,840
let me ask you something.

318
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,010
That Miss Chen,

319
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,810
did she tell you something?

320
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,410
What is it?

321
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,040
Anyway,

322
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,620
she won't harass you from now on.

323
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,590
She did not harass me.

324
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,590
It was me who harassed her. OK?

325
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,160
What in the world did she tell you?

326
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,660
How did you get brainwashed like this?

327
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,500
She did not brainwash me.

328
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,370
It's...

329
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,180
Please mind your own business.

330
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,980
Will you?

331
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,340
Can you leave me alone?

332
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,350
What do you mean by leaving you alone?

333
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,350
You are my son.

334
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,220
I'm responsible for you.

335
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,050
You are responsible for me?

336
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,690
Yes.

337
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,190
You are responsible for forcing me to study for

338
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,490
the university you want me to enroll in.

339
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,660
Then you can brag in front of all your friends and relatives

340
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,490

341
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,030
which satisfies your vanity, am I right?

342
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,130
How could you say that to me?

343
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,840
Zhang Yixiang.

344
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,340
You are already smart

345
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,910
and incredible,

346
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,540
and you are great in my heart.

347
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,610
Yes.

348
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,150
I'm great enough that you thought my scientific project

349
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,350
wasn't good enough to win the first place, so you bribed the judges.

350
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,760
As I already said, that wasn't bribery, it was actually...

You don't even understand, do you?

356
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,100
I do.

357
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,540
No, you don't.

358
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,340
Of course I do.

359
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,500
OK, you do.

360
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,380
Of course I believe in your strength.

361
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,910
But we should always work hard

362
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,210

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,880
Didn't anyone teach her that slapping others

379
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,250
is something only a despicable woman would do?

380
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,920
Who does she think she is? What a nutcase.

381
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,020
If she likes to slap others that badly,

382
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,820
she can ask her husband

383
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,490
-to spank her twice more at night in bed.
-Please enjoy.

384
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,260
No, it would be too joyful.

385
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,170

Hmm?

How else do you say... Say that her husband

388
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,830
should spank her twice?

389
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,640
What's so mortifying to talk about this?

390
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,770
It's a piece of cake to be familiar with her husband.

391
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,740
Pick up the phone.

392

How come you have his phone number?

It won't hurt to sleep with him.

00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,090
The philosophy of nurturing citizens who are capable of thinking independently,

507
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,890
telling right and wrong,

508
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,260
and being responsible for themselves.

509
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,300
I believe you held the same philosophy

510
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,540
when you chose to work for Tainan First Senior High.

511
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,580
I've never ever seen

512
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,080
the look on Principal's face before.

513
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,660
When talking to him,

514
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,280
you even brought out the founder,

515
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,460
as if firing you

516
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,400
would betray the entire educational community.

517
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,700
Is it because Miss Chen...

518
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,830
I grew up in the educational community,

519
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,130
and I've seen a lot of people in this field.

520
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,200
No matter how sinister and despicable

521
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,210
their minds are,

522
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,510
they cannot tolerate being called unethical

523
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,870
or that they lost educational philosophy.

524
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,970
Labeling

525
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,040
is the most efficient solution.

526
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,280
Do you think I'm scary?

527
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,150
I appreciate your daring attitude.

528
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,460
Miss Chen, did you

529
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,730
grew up in the educational community,

530
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,670
so you became a teacher at a young age?

531
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,000
My father was a university professor.

532
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,410
When I was little, we lived in

533
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,480
the dormitory assigned by the institution.

534
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,930
We were surrounded by teachers.

535
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,010
I see.

536
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,770
How about next time

537
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,350
you teach me one or two of your tricks

538
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,550
that I can use against the principal?

539
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,050
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

540
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,590
It's not necessary. I almost got you fired from school.

541
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,980
It should be me who treats you.

542
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,230
I'll do it.

543
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Alright.

544
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,860
How about we both treat each other once?

545
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,520
[Language and Literature Zhang Yixiang]

546
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,380
Stop messing around.

547
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,310
The class is about to begin.

548
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,790
Everybody, let's get started.

549
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:25,990
Come on.

550
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,430
Wake up the sleeping ones.

551
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,430
Morning everybody, I'm Miss Hong.

552
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,760
I'll take over from Miss Chen since today.

553
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,730
With which chapter did your last class end?

554
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,430
What about Miss Chen?

555
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,440
She's transferred to another class.

556
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,510
Hey.

557
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,340
Hey, Zhang Yixiang,

558
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,940
what are you doing?

559
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,970
We are having a class right now.

560
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,810
Gimme the key.

561
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,340
The key?

562
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:47,910
Yes.

563
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,120
Aren't you the teacher in charge of the cell phone storage room?

564
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,940
The key.

565

[My girlfriend gave me the cold shoulder while my colleague shows affections to me.]

568
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,600
Miss Xinyi.

569
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,580
What's the matter?

570
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,710
The spot where I bumped last time

571
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,140
still hurts slightly.

572
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,640
You didn't go to the hospital?

573
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,280
No. I suddenly had another seizure.

574
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,220
Lie there and take off your trousers so I can see what's wrong.

575
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,990
No. I mean go over there and...

576
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,860
pull up your trouser leg and lemme have a look.

577
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,240
Miss Xinyi, I've seen the article that you are reading.

578
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,740
In one of the paragraphs, it says that

579
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,560
his girlfriend hadn't had physical intimacy with him for a long time,

580
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,340
and the man was in distress.

581
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,840
Then at work one of his female colleagues

582
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,410
constantly implied that she craved for...

583
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,880
-Well...
-Then they...

584
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,510
Choose your words wisely.

585
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,710
Moreover,

586
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,410
why do you spoil the plot like that? I haven't read it myself.

587
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,020
Sorry, I thought you've read it.

588
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,390
Do you know this side of you looks

589
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,860
really amazing?

590
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,190
No. Really, lemme tell you.

591
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,060
On my way here, it stung like crazy.

592
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,700
And it's also burning.

593
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,660
No kidding.

594
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,520
I believe after a certain amount of time, it'll bruise.

595
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,320
Don't try to slack off over here.

596
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,890
Cold compress for 15 minutes.

597
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,620
Return it after class.

598
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,330
OK.

599
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,760
Hey,

600
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,370
I'll read the article,

601
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,070
and we'll discuss during recess.

602
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,770
No problem.

603
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,080
I'm sorry.

604
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,170
Be careful.

605
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,480
So right now, you can even

606
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,010
transfer teachers now. Right?

607
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,880
I don't want to listen.

608
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,680
You just need to transfer her back.

609
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,220
OK, never mind, I'm just an idiot.

610
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,700
What?

611
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,130
Rely on your mom to get the key before irritating her.

612
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,700
Senior, you are really unique, unprecedented and unrepeatable.

613
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,670
You are truly awesome.

614
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,360
Here comes our ciambotta.

615
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,350
Thank you.

616
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,530
Didn't we agree to dine together another day?

617
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,770
Why it must be today?

618
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,140
If you insist on treating me no matter what,

619
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,540
then it's fine to dine here.

620
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,510
I'll benefit more this way.

621
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,680
I just saw you e-shopping.

622
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,820
Yeah, I accidentally

623
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,410
broke our clock yesterday.

624
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,150
Your clock?

625
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,680
Yeah.

626
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,520
You mean the tall clocks which are usually put in living rooms?

627
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,350
The grandfather clocks?

628
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,730
Pardon me.

629
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,300
It's forty.

630
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,470
You just arrived?

631
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,070
I took half a day off this morning.

632
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,580
Hello, what's the matter?

633
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,360
I'm already at school.

634
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,800
What? I refuse.

635
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,560
You've been selling broken merchandise to customers,

636
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,300
and this kind of thing never crosses your mind?

637
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,700
I have classes to attend to.

638
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,040
Are you alright?

639
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,340
Xia Yuxin.

640
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,680
You don't need to worry about my business.

641
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,680
Mind your own business.

642
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,290
Moreover, I don't want to be harsh,

643
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,650
but please stay away from Zhang Yixiang.

644
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,660
Really?

645
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,960
Really.

646
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,000
Senior really used the key

647
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,600
to open the cell phone storage room's lock.

648
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,930
What a powerful being.

649
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,970
Awesome.

650
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,400
I know, right?

651
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,810
I can't believe he broke into Tainan First Senior High's phone raising farm.

652
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,740
And?

653
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,310
And Senior called Ms. Chairwoman,

654
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,920
saying something about Ms. Chairwoman transferring teachers.

655
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,510
And also...

656
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,920
So it's about Chen Mengyun.

657
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,390
Wait a second, wait a second.

658
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,320
I don't understand.

659
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,690
He did a bit of this and a bit of that,

660
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,220
what in the world is he up to?

661
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,790
I guess...

662
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,490
Something's going on between him and Chen Mengyun.

663
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,930
What...

664
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,060
No, I'm telling you, it's ridiculous.

665
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,630
I shouldn't tell you this. It's just a rumor.

666
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,200
It's just that one day,

667
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,430
Ms. Chairwoman personally came to school

668
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,270
to beat Miss Chen up specifically.

669
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:12,970
She beat her up?

670
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,300
Yeah.

671
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,170
Really?

672
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,980
Somebody else told me this, I dunno.

673
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,770
So what on earth does Zhang Yixiang

674
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,580
plan to do to his mom?

675
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,480
No.

676
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,780
What we should ask here is that

677
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,950
what in the world does he want to do to Chen Mengyun.

678
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,180
Senior can't be serious about having a crush on Miss Chen, right?

679
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,550
Excuse me, young people.

680
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,320
I'm a Youtuber called Younger.

681
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,330
I've watched your channel.

682
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,820
-Hello…
-Hello…

683
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,460
May I ask you a few questions?

684
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,250
A few que…

685
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:36,860
No problem.

686
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,390
It's totally fine!

687
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,800
What are you gonna ask?

688
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,260
Our topic for today is

689
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,230
your opinions on love between teachers and students.

690
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,100
What?

691
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,430
May I have your opinions on love between teachers and students?

692
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,780
It wouldn't take long.

693
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,810
Only about three minutes.

694
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,380
Thank you.

695
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,580
Two minutes, only two minutes.

696
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,450
I have to go now, Mr. Fan.

697
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,090
Bye.

698
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,690
I'll see you in the bakery classroom.

699
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,550
Why do you ask me to come here?

700
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:06,610
I need you to help me with my study.

701
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,890
I need you to help me every day after school

702
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,360
for the ninth class.
