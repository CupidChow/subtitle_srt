[Memorial Art Exhibition of Chen Shize]

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,270
We came here to see the exhibition?

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,140
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,580
It's in memory of Mr. Chen

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,770
and we can appreciate his works again.

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,510
Yixiang, don't run around.

9
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,740
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,240
Did you tell the lady

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,650
you're sorry for hitting her?

12
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,680
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,410
Sorry.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,650
Let me straighten your clothes.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,690
Did you know Professor Chen Shize well?

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,660
No.

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,460
I just took a few of his lessons.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,160
Many distinguished people are here for the opening ceremony.

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,190
Come on.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,060
Let's go say hello.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,910
Mr. Li, long time no see. I'm Xie Shufen.

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,539
Is that the professor himself?

23
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,610
Is the woman next to him his wife or mistress?

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,440
Mr. Chen had a mistress?

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,370
You didn't know?

26
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,810
His wife once committed suicide because of this.

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,950
Really?

Grandma.

30
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,720
What a mess.

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,100
I don't get it.

32
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,590
Me neither. Let's go check the others.

33
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,729

[Lesson in Love, Episode 8]

35
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,620
I like you.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,740
Aren't you afraid I'll use you?

37
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,920
Even if you are just using me,

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,900
it does not matter.

39
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,010
I'm afraid of nothing.

40
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,080
Dad, here's some tea for you.

41
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,100
Have some tea.

42
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,760
Do you remember why I agreed to

43
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
you marrying Guoyang?

44
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,000
Because I was pregnant.

45
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,470
I thought I was old and had a bad memory.

46
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,160
Turns out your memory's worse than mine.

47
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,320
It's because you threatened me

48
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,010
that if I disapproved of the marriage,

49
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,150
you'd tell the press

50
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,830
that our family is treacherous

51
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,810
and deceived a young girl like you.

52
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,880
Dad, I was in a panic.

53
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,160
I got pregnant before graduating college.

54
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
I dare not tell my family

55
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,030
or my friends.

56
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,170
In the end, I broke off the engagement of Guoyang

57
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,680
and Commissioner Wang's…

58
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,420
Well, he's the Secretary General now.

59
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,900
I broke off the engagement of Guoyang and the secretary general's daughter

60
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,290
and accepted your marriage

61
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,320
only on one condition.

62
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,010
Do you remember what it was?

63
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,970
Don't make trouble for you.

64
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,620
Since you still keep it in mind,

65
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,140
why did you not discipline your son

66
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,530
and made a scene to expel the teacher?

67
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,550
Now, the whole board

68
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,100
thought it was my idea.

69
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,550
They say the Zhang family throws our weight around

70
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,190
and bullies a female teacher.

71
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,380
Miss Chen is the one to blame.

72
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,530
She broke the rules

73
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,120
and tutored Zhang Yixiang in private.

74
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:32,960
We…

75
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,680
She broke the rules

76
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,410
for tutoring Yixiang,

77
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,720
and got him first place in school.

78
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,890
So,

79
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,410
you want her fired?

80
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,270
It's your choice

81
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,750
how to handle it.

82
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,310
Yes.

83
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,990
Zhong.

84
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,790
Yes, sir.

85
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,060
Give it to your wife.

86
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,110
Thank you, boss.

87
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,840
Thank you, Mrs. Zhang.

88
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,570
Did I just commit a crime?

89
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,240
Then why are you smiling?

90
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,010
Did you regret it?

91
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,550
I have some good news for you.

92
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,030
I turned 18, just eighteen hours ago.

93
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,420
It's your birthday?

94
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,690
Happy birthday.

95
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,460
But I didn't get you any birthday present.

96
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,470
You did.

97
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,590
You're the best birthday present I've ever had.

98
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Are you

99
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,600
really using me?

100
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,910
Never mind. It's okay.

101
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,970
Don't answer that.

102
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,580
Actually, when I saw your mom

103
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,230
in the school hallway that day,

104
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,220
I recognized her immediately.

105
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,540
It felt so weird.

106
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,660
I can't believe how clearly I remember

107
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,060
someone I had met so long ago.

108
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,070
She keeps telling me

109
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,320
that she didn't know her teacher was married.

110
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,690
She was fooled by your father.

111
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,340
What do you mean, nothing?

112
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,480
I saw it with my own eyes!

113
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,610
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

114
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,830
There's nothing going on between us.

115
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,420
I was just drawing. Creating.

116
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,640
I need inspiration, that's all.

117
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,730
Creating?

118
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,080
I don't care what you are creating

119
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,830
in your studio every day.

120
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,600
But how could you bring her to our home?

121
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,360
In my bed where I sleep every day?

122
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,710
I can't go back now, you know?

123
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,760
Don't walk away.

124
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,940
Don't walk away.

125
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,010
I need to talk to you.

126
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,820
Don't go back.

127
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,950
Don't go back.

128
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,810
I don't really know what was going on.

129
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,170
Did my dad lie to your mom

130
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,740
or did your mom seduce my dad?

131
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,310
All I know is,

132
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,590
after my mom found out he's having an affair, she tried to suicide with pills.

133
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,450
Then when Dad was taking my mom to the hospital,

134
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,710
they had a car accident.

135
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,110
My mom died on the spot.

136
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,600
And my dad was sent into the E.R.,

137
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,200
but he didn't make it.

138
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,940
So since that day,

139
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,180
I've been wondering

140
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,030
what kind of woman she is?

141
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,010
The woman who made my mother so miserable

142
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,580
and made me an orphan,

143
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,240
I wonder what her life is like.

144
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,599
She's really lucky.

145
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,490
Who?

146
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,920
Xie Shufen.

147
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,650
Such an arrogant woman

148
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,790
raised such a good son.

149
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,130
Do you fight so valiantly for everyone?

150
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,010
Only for the one I like.

151
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,630
I'll get you a beer.

152
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,030
I'll go with you.

153
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,310
What's wrong?

154
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,270
I think I've seen this painting.

155
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,850
Is Zhang Yixiang in there?

156
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,700
I came to see Miss Chen.

157
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,000
It has nothing to do with her.

158
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,430
Come out, now!

159
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,980
This is child seduction, you know?

160
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,780
I'm calling the police.

161
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,800
Everyone will know what you did.

162
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,430
Why don't you just start a live stream?

163
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,620
I don't mind being open about it anyway.

164
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,790
Now, Miss Chen is fired,

165
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,430
and we're no longer teacher and student.

166
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,780
Get out of there.

167
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,160
Go back with your mother.

168
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,770
Are you

169
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,560
really using me?

170
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,420
We were not going to sacrifice so much for you

171
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,690
to be so willful

172
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,760

00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,650
that I realized she was right all along.

512
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,890
Turns out I had fallen for you long ago.

513
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,910
I thought you guys were separated because of your personalities.

514
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,650
Yeah, that's part of the reason.

515
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,950
-But we've always had some…
-It's okay.

516
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,170
You don't have to explain.

517
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,820
I'm not trying to explain. I just don't want you

518
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,580
-to take this the wrong way. You're not…
-It's not going to happen

519
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,020
between us.

520
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,770
Sorry.

521
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,990
But I think I need to

522
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,380
make it clear.

523
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,400
You are a good colleague.

524
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,170
Thank you so much for helping me since my first day in

525
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,770
Tainan First Senior High School.

526
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,710
But we're just colleagues.

527
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,450
Is it Zhang Yixiang?

528
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,290
I never asked

529
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,280
what's going on between you and him.

530
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,210
Because I believe

531
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,950
you know your obligation

532
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,020
and won't do anything out of line.

533
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,370
We're teachers.

534
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,770
We should take the responsibility to…

535
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,330
It has nothing to do with Zhang Yixiang.

536
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,370
Thank you so much for today.

537
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,420
I have to go back now.

538
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,850
Good night.

539
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,730
Why are you blocking the camera?

540
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,460
You didn't reply to my messages.

541
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,850
I don't want you to see me now.

542
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,290
Then why you're calling?

543
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,550
All right. I'm hanging up.

544
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,070
Hey, don't hang up.

545
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,070
What have you been doing today?

546
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,940
I cooked for my grandma,

547
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,180
and took a walk on a full stomach.

548
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,160
Life in the country is simple.

549
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,630
There's nothing much to do.

550
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,390
Hey, ask me the same question.

551
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,290
What have you been doing today?

552
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,570
Missing you...

553
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,770
I've been missing you all day.

554
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,920
Say you miss me, too.

555
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,500
Come on, say you miss me, too.

556
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,430
If you don't,

557
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,290
I'll go to your grandma's right now.

558
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,680
Do you know where my grandma's house is?

559
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,870
I can ask Sister Xinyi.

560
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,060
I miss you.

561
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,880
Why don't you put the envelope away?

562
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,110
You're unsatisfied

563
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,500
without taking a look?

564
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,890
You're getting greedy.

565
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,120
The film is well shot,

566
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,980
but it's only worth that much.

567
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,020
As for the video I sent you earlier,

568
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,410
can I watch it?

569
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,420
Hello, Mrs. Zhang.

570
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,560
Long time no see.

571
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,070
Yeah, Mr. Lin, long time no see.

572
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,910
I'm a little busy over my gallery lately.

573
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:04,750
I see.

574
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,400
I didn't want to keep a record before

575
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,040
so I deleted the film.

576
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,550
Can I watch it again?

577
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,410
I heard your gallery has opened.

578
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,410
Congratulations.

579
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

580
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,280
Come over when you have time.

581
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,660
Of course.

582
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,090
Mrs. Zhang, you're so busy.

583
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,980
Remember to relax a little sometime.

584
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,490
Okay.

585
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,960
Our hotel is having

586
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,640
an early autumn beauty revival housing project.

587
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,490
Free Thai massage and skin care services

588
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,470
are offered whenever you check in.

589
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,280
It really suits you, Mrs. Zhang.

590
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,200
Okay.

591
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,150
I'll send you a brochure about it later.

592
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:39,950
I'll leave you to it.

593
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,080
Thank you.

594
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,100
Zhang Yixiang knows all about it.

595
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,630
You're not on good terms, right?

596
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,780
Do you need my help?

597
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,070
He knew that you were sent by me?

598
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,370
You used to hate this job

599
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,970
and wanted to quit several times.

600
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,610
What happened?

601
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,120
How come you're being super positive now?

602
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,860
I need money.

603
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,070
Finally, you know the job

604
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,470
is easier than any other jobs.

605
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,660
Now, even if you help me,

606
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,420
everyone knows you're the snitch.

607
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,320

610
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,470
why did you suddenly come back?

611
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,580
Did something happen in Taipei?

612
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,400
No.

613
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,510
I was a little tired and wanted to take a few days off.

You're tired.

00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,490
Yeah.

617
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,290
Just quit then.

You and Dawei…

619
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,750
Grandma, I told you we were just colleagues.

620
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:17,300
We did not come together.

621
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,560
Only met at the station.

622
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,630
Okay, okay. I'll stop.

623

Grandma.

624
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,890
There's something I need to ask you.

625
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,320
What is it?

626
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,240
Why was my mother so upset that day?

627
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,710
She had become accustomed to

628
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,390
father's frequent cheating.

629
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,140
Why did my mom suddenly lose it that day?

630
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,080
Before the accident that day,

631
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,030
I got a call from your mother.

632
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:08,840
What did she say?

633
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,860
The woman who your father had the affair with was pregnant,

634
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,390
and he wanted a divorce.

635
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,230
Pregnant?

636
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,850
Was she the one in my dad's class?

637
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,090
I think so.

Was the child born?

I've never met that woman.

00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,750
Are you home?

682
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,170
Not yet.

683
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,630
Yeah?

684
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,980
What time is your train?

685
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,990
Do you want me to meet you at your place?

686
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,550
The train's delayed.

687
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,150
I don't know when I'll be home.

688
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,330
Don't wait up for me.

689
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,880
See you at school tomorrow.

690
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,550
I see.

691
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,820
Bye-bye.

692
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,010
Hello?

693
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,410
Are you asleep?

694
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,050
Not yet.

695
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,230
Are you home?

696
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:40,550
Yeah, just now.

697
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,120
I see.

698
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:47,770
Let me ask you something.

699
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,590
Last time, at my place,

700
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,450
you said your birthday was November 25th.

701
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,140
Is your date of birth correct?

702
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,490
Of course.

703
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,610
Who would forget something like that?

704
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,180
[Brother?]
