Yes. Right?

116
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,760
A student

117
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,000
said his teacher often asked him out alone

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,130
after class.

119
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,860
They met

120
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,290
in the activity room

121
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,260
or tutoring room.

122
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,550
The teacher told him to

123
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,480
help him with his study

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,590
or have a pep talk with him.

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,790
After a simulated exam, the teacher even

126
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,100
asked him to meet outside school.

127
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,880
They went cycling in the park,

128
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,450
went rock climbing,

129
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,430
and grabbed plush toys.

130
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,560
The student started to feel a little confused.

131
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,460
He thought he was not treated

132
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,560
as a student.

133
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,130
The teacher seemed to think of him

134
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,280
as her boyfriend.

135
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,700

this is a normal relationship between lovers?

140
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,350
Or as Ms. Lyu just said,

the student to date him.

143

what do you think?

145
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,670
As a teacher,

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,040
do you approve of the teacher's behaviors?

147
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,790
She seduced the student.

148
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,640
Do you think

149
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,090
she is qualified to be a teacher?

150
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,120
[Someone took dating photos of a teacher and a student of our school]

151
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,070
Last time you said I framed her.

152
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,140
Now, with so much evidence,

153
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,150
what do you say?

154
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,770
How dare we said that?

155
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,950
Well...

156
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
this time, we will

157
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,660
handle it properly.

158
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,180
Everyone,

159
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,910
you probably already knew what happened.

160
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,900
In my opinion,

161
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,050
these photos

162
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,450
can only show

163
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,560

If we just conclude

166
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,890
they're in love only based on these photos,

167
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,110
it will be...

168
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,340
a little far-fetched.

169
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,060
And as we can see,

170
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,530
due to the shooting angle

171
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,550
of these photos,

172
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,400
they seem...

173
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,420
to be

174
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,300
very close.

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,550
met outside in private.

177
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,570
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

178
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,130
It's unavoidable.

179
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,440
In the same school district,

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,450
maybe they'll meet

181
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,840
after school.

182
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,480
If this had happened to me,

183
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,580
instead of a young female teacher,

184
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,510
I would've been sued by the girl student.

185
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,040
I saw them alone in the Western Pastry Room

186
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,960
once.

187
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,200
Zhang Yixiang is a member of the club

188
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,720
and Miss Chen is the adviser.

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,240
It's normal for her to be there.

190
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,180
Remember,

191
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,370
they kissed in school

192
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,380
at the beginning of the semester.

193
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,360
We have

194
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,780
talked about this, haven't we?

Zhang Yixiang

196
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,190
was messing with Miss Chen.

197
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,240
So I think

198
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,100
Miss Chen is very kind.

199
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,330
Despite being tricked repeatedly,

200
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,190
she is still nice to him.

201
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,800
If it were me, I wouldn't care about him.

202

Unlike me,

203
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,880
Miss Chen tutored him and even went sightseeing with him

204
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,690
when he got first place in the exam.

205
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,800
Miss Chen is indeed

our role model.

OK. I agree.

219

It's a self-study class,

348
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,880
But he treated me differently.

349
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,550
In his eyes, I was different.

350
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,300
At least, I thought so.

351
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,850
You and he...

352
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,220
Did you go out on a date?

353
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,080
But later I knew

354
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,650
he had already married

355
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,010
and had a kid.

356
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,630
So you didn't know.

357
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,570
If I had known,

358
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,290
I wouldn't have been with him.

359
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,210
I really liked him.

360
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,600
I longed for

361
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,830
the happy days to come.

362
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,390
I dreamed

363
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,000
we would get married

364
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,480
and live happily

365
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,170
together forever.

366
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,480
We would…

367
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,980
For him, I even…

368
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,770
Mom,

369
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,770
Miss Chen

370
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,210
is different.

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,720
She has never…

372
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,810
I mean

373
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,260
it's me

374
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,740
who ran after her.

375
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,110
You're still young.

376
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,300
She's an adult

377
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,400
and a teacher.

378
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,920
Her responsibility is

379
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,240
to lead you on the right path

380
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,260
and teach you to distinguish right from wrong,

381
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,380
instead of dating you.

382
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,530
Zhang Yixiang,

383
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,140
you're my son.

384
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,410
Protecting you

385
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,230
is my duty.

386
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,250
I won't let you get hurt

387
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,640
as I did.

388
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,870
Miss Chen is different.

389
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,200
She is not that type.

390
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,490
She will never cheat me

391
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,130
or hurt me.

392
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,540
I will never cheat you

393
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,440
or hurt you.

394
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,870
That's what my teacher told me,

395
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,860
but he still hurt me.

396
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,130
Yixiang, breakfast is ready.

397
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,190
I'll pass.

398
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,430
He doesn't want to eat. Don't force him.

399
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,370
Do you want me to wrap it up for you? You can eat it on your way.

400
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,090
Yes.

401
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,930
OK.

402
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,480
I'll eat it on my way.

403
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,490
Take it.

404
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,570
Go.

405
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,570
Did you poison our son?

406
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,110
What? I'm not finished yet.

407
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,960
Wanna continue?

408
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,720
Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?

409
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,680
What's new about yesterday's Education Conference?

410
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,500
If they ask you to quit,

411
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,840
don't listen to them.

412
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,370
What the chairwoman did is really despicable.

413
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,050
She washed your face in public.

414
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,940
I believe she was afraid

415
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,590
that firing you would irritate the board.

416
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,760
She didn't want her father-in-law to know

417
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,060
what Zhang Yixiang did,

418
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,000
so she just started by forcing you to quit.

419
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,660
What kind of person

420
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,010
would hire a private detective to tail her son?

421
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,240
Do you think it's a private detective?

422
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,340
What else could it be?

423
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,060
Some teachers of our school

424
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,200
do like flatter parents and the chairwoman, and snitch on others.

425
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,010
But I don't think they would sneak photos.

426
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,690
As for students,

427
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,420
their phones are taken away after the morning self-learning.

428
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,590
It can't be them.

429
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,300
Hey.

430
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,110
What are you looking for? Can I help you?

431
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,120
I thought you wouldn't come today.

432
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,770
I'm here to tell you

433
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,790
that I will never come again.

434
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,970
You've improved a lot in the recent mock exam of Language and Literature..

435
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,530
I don't need to teach you anymore.

436
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,770
Did the school's Education Conference punish you yesterday?

437
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,950
It's none of your business.

438
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,460
I'll tell the principal that you were forced by me.

439
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,850
If you really want to help me,

440
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,610
just don't do anything.

441
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,540
Otherwise, things will get worse.

442
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,460
Then… What about the phone for kids?

443
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,690
Can I still message you with it?

444
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,530
Teacher, my stomach is aching. I need to relieve myself.

445
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,560
All right. Hurry back!

446
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,270
Thanks.

447
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,430
Hey.

448
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,650
When is Xia Yuxin's birthday?

449
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,290
What's up?

450
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,760
Is today her birthday?

451
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,370
If today is her birthday, why would I ask you?

452
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,500
Do you know?

453
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,360
Well, what do you want to do?

454
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,630
None of your business. Just tell me if you know.

455
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,340
What are you talking?

456
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,950
Would you like to speak up and chat with others?

457
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,930
Xu Shuqi, what did you just hide?

458
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,360
Nothing.

459
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,040
Nothing?

460
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,090
Hasn't the school talked about it many times?

461
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,860
During the night self-study,

462
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,500
you can't use your phone.

463
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,270
Come on. Give it to me.

464
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,040
Give your phone to me.

465
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,510
I'll keep it for you.

466
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,110
When the night self-study is over, I'll return it to you.

467
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,929
The night self-study is coming to an end. Hang in there.

468
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,770
Carry on.

469
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,159
OK.

470
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,429
It's all your fault.

471
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,989
Sorry.

472
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,170
Mr. Li, my phone.

473
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,220
Next time…

474
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,720
Xu Shuqi!

475
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,990
Give it back to me!

476
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,660
No!

477
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,010
Are you a spy?

478
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,180
Give it back to me.

479
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,110
I saw you sneak photos of Miss Chen and Zhang Yixiang

480
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,460
outside the classroom for baking many times.

481
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,390
Hey. Did Zhang Yixiang's mom ask you to sneak photos?

482
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,990
Or it upset you that he was in love with Miss Chen

483
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,330
so you snitched on them?

484
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,140
I said give it back to me! Don't you understand?

485
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,860
No! I won't give it back to you unless you tell me.

486
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,040
No!

487
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,230
Did you take those photos?

488
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,340
Did Yixiang attend today's night self-study?

489
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,660
[Did Yixiang attend today's night self-study?]

490
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,630
[Zhang Yixiang]

491
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,180
Your call will be forwarded to voice mail.

492
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,560
Please leave a message after the beep.

493
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,470
I went to pick you up from school before.

494
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,370
I saw you getting on a bus,

495
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,220
but the bus was not going in the direction of our house.

496
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:23,800
I was curious, so I followed you.

497
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,940
Sorry.

498
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,190
Can I have a word with Miss Chen?

499
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,170
Since Yixiang attended high school,

500
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,150
he has never finished top in the school's mock exams.

501
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,590
He always comes second.

502
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,360
This time, with your guidance,

503
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,620
he finished top.

504
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,940
I haven't expressed my gratitude to you yet.

505
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,700
Sorry, it's my bad.

506
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,010
Chairwoman, don't mention it.

507
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,480
Zhang Yixiang worked hard.

508
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,740
It has nothing to do with me.

509
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,260
Miss Chen, you're too modest.

510
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,530
All right. Mom, I'll go back with you.

511
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,390
No rush. I'm not finished yet.

512
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,570
What on earth do you want to do?

513
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,880
I just want to express my gratitude to Miss Chen.

514
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,450
Miss Chen.

515
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,940
Are you free this weekend?

516
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,470
Come to our house. Let's have a meal together.

517
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,360
My teacher is busy.

518
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,370
OK.

519
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,940
Do you still feel sick?

520
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,720
Do you feel dizzy?

521
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:08,800
All right.

522
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,460
Yun.

523
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,060
You felt sick just now, didn't you?

524
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,420
Why did you begin to play with toys as soon as you arrived home?

525
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,560
Go wash your hands now!

526
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,270
OK.

527
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,460
After dinner, do your homework first.

528
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,180
OK.

529
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,660
I thought Yun had classes all day today.

530
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,230
She felt sick in the middle of the P.E. class.

531
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,020
The teacher called me,

532
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,280
so I took her home.

533
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,000
She felt sick?

534
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Yeah.

535
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,420
Then what about your piano class?

536
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,390
I'll just take a leave this afternoon.

537
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,030
Don't you have class this afternoon?

538
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,250
You usually have lunch at the school canteen.

539
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,470
Why did you suddenly come home?

540
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,940
I suddenly had a headache,

541
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,330
so I wanted to take a rest at home.

542
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,680
I felt sick as our daughter did.

543
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,070
There's a special bond between father and child.

544
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,880
All right. Do you feel better now?

545
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,970
Are you going back to school this afternoon?

546
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:13,640
Yeah.

547
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,530
I took a snap. Now I feel better.

548
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,670
I'll go back to school soon.

549
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,310
Yun and me haven't eaten anything yet.

550
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,290
I want to cook noodles. Let's eat together.

551
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,260
It's OK. I'll pass. I'm not hungry.

552
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,480
OK.

553
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,170
Yun.

554
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,270
Yun.

555
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,190
What's up?

556
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,830
Put your schoolbag in your room before having lunch.

557
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,580
OK.

558
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,260
Hurry up.

559
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,270
OK.

560
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,590
Mom!

561
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,850
What's going on?

562
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,290
Mom!

563
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,700
Mom!

564
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,750
What's going on?

565
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,100
Madam.

566
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,960
Excuse me. I'm here to hand in my report to my teacher.

567
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:11,430
Is he here?

568
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,210
How did you come in just now?

569
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,050
It seems that I haven't heard the doorbell.

570
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,610
I knocked on the door just now.

571
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,010
Yun opened the door for me.

572
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,750
Shize, is this your student?

573
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,020
Mr. Chen.

574
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,660
Didn't I tell you to put it in the department office?

575
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:34,070
I couldn't find the teaching assistant, and I thought

576
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,540
I don't have a class this afternoon.

577
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,050
Maybe I could give it to you by myself.

578
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,300
Thanks.

579
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,450
I gotta go.

580
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,330
OK.

581
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,460
Bye, Mr. Chen.

582
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:47,970
Bye, madam.

583
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,940
Bye.

584
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:25,390
What?

585
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,220
It was weird that my mom invited you.

586
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,030
But it was weirder that you came here.

587
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,430
The chairwoman invited me in person.

588
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,990
How could I refuse to come?

589
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,250
I cooked a few simple dishes.

590
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,310
Hope you don't mind, Miss Chen.

591
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,710
They're not simple.

592
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,550
The food I eat alone is really simple.

593
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,730
Alone?

594
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,170
Miss Chen, you're not married?

595
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,240
I believe you already know.

596
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,670
There's no need to ask.

597
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,360
How could I know Miss Chen's personal affairs?

598
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,920
Come on. Try the soup.

599
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,400
You even know how many times the principal fart

600
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,780
a day,

601
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,760
so you don't need to ask her about that.

602
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,960
His father and I have spoiled him,

603
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,320
so he's rude while speaking.

604
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,010
Mr. Zhang is not here?

605
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,700
Yes, he went to play basketball. Don't wait for him.

606
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,940
Let's eat.

607
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,950
Miss Chen, your parents don't live in Taipei?

608
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,560
My parents are gone.

609
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,740
I've got no family besides my grandma.

610
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,310
She's not used to Taipei, so she lives in the countryside.

611
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,910
But you told me you've got an aunt, right?

612
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,470
The chairwoman was asking about my family.

613
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,360
She's just a relative.

614
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,600
You're so clear about

615
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,110
her relatives.

616
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,010
Miss Chen, do you always treat students

617
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,580
in this way?

618
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:15,600
Which way?

619
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,480
In my spare time, I chat with students

620
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,030
to learn more about them.

621
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:25,550
Probably, my father has influenced me.

622
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,440
He's a teacher, too.

623
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,570
After classes,

624
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,000
his students often come to our house.

625
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,430
Your father is also a teacher?

626
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,330
He's a professor. He teaches art.

627
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,240
My mom majored in art, too.

628
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,920
Chairwoman, where did you graduate from?

629
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,860
Huaqing, right?

630
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,560
Is it your dad's school?

631
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,630
Yes, they're schoolmates.

632
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,390
They were from different departments.

633
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,240
What a coincidence!

634
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,130
Maybe the chairwoman really knows my father.

635
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,020
My father is a teacher there.

636
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,740
Really?

637
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:04,910
What's the name of your father, Miss Chen?

638
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:08,810
Chen Shize.

639
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,150
I can't remember.

640
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,140
I don't remember this teacher of our department.

641
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,570
I wish I could say I don't remember, either.

642
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,350
He's not my father anymore.

643
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,670
He had an affair with his student. They murdered my mom.

644
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,920
But you told me they had a car accident.

645
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,660
Yixiang, don't be so rude.

646
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,890
You brought up Miss Chen's painful memory.

647
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,160
Sorry, Miss Chen.

648
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,510
So did you see

649
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,490
your father's student later?

650
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,130
Yes.

651
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,820
But she said she couldn't remember.

652
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,300
She even forgot his name.

653
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,460
A woman doesn't even remember the man she loved.

654
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,020
She probably strung my father along.

655
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,070
Then she forgot everything.

656
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,920
However, she doesn't know

657
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,850
that she has ruined my family and my life.

658
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,060
When a teacher falls in love with a student,

659
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,080
the one who forgets after the relationship is over

660
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,270
is usually not the student.

661
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,270
I thought the soup would taste good.

662
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,440
However, it's bland.

663
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,260
Yixiang, there's no salt left.

664
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,480
Go downstairs to buy a bottle of salt.

665
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,650
Miss Chen is talking about her family.

666
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,170
Yeah.

667
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,520
It's a little bland.

668
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,760
It would be better if you added some salt.

669
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,620
OK.

670
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,680
I'll be right back.

671
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,850
Miss Chen.

672
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,880
Ssh.

673
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:38,370
Hi, madame.

674
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,430
I'm here to hand in my report to my teacher.

675
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,360
Is he here?

676
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,300
Bye, Mr. Chen.

677
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,850
Bye, madam.

678
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,710
When did you find out?

679
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,890
Chairwoman, now you remember who my father is.

680
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,340
I'm so sorry. I misunderstood you just now.

681
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:56,640
Many years have passed,

682
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,660
but you never forget about him.

683
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,340
As his daughter, I should feel delighted.

684
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,320
This is a warning for you. Stay away from Zhang Yixiang.

685
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,330
So you're worried that Zhang Yixiang

686
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,810
and the whole school will know

687
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:09,740
that you were a home-wrecker.

688
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,260
Is that the reason why you always single me out

689
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,890
and try your best to kick me out?

690
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,350
Seriously?

691
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,230
I wondered

692
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,170
what kind of teacher would be so warm-hearted

693
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,110
that she only picked some thankless jobs to do

694
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,380
and she even taught her student in spare time.

695
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,760
So before you started to work at the school,

696
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,230
you made a plan.

697
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,290
You deliberately seduced Zhang Yixiang

698
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,720
to retaliate against me.

699
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,690
Don't think that everyone is as shameless

700
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:46,790
as you.

701
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,890
No one is more shameless

702
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,410
than your family.

703
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,020
As a teacher, you seduced your student.

704
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,500
No wonder you're his daughter.

705
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,600
You killed my parents!

706
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,040
You knew he had got a family and a kid.

707
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,800
Why did you try to get close to him?

708
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:05,850
Wait a minute.

709
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,250
Here's a correction.

710
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,400
You're more like your mother.

711
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,630
When she saw your father bring me home,

712
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,730
she looked exactly

713
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,370
like you.

714
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,820
There are many kinds of salt.

715
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,000
I don't know which one I should buy.

716
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,180
Miss Chen, are you leaving?

717
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,420
What did you say to Miss Chen?

718
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,450
Zhang Yixiang!

719
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,920
Don't go, Zhang Yixiang!

720
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,970
What did my mom say to you?

721
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,070
Did she tell you what happened between her and her teacher?

722
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,540
Listen. Don't be mad.

723
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,630
Her teacher lied to her.

724
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,770
Her teacher said he didn't have a girlfriend.

725
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,820
However, she was already married.

726
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,330
My mom fell into his trap.

727
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,810
Do you believe everything your mom says?

728
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,460
Then can you tell me

729
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,640
what's going on?

730
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,240
You deliberately seduced Zhang Yixiang

731
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,460
to retaliate against me.

732
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,360
As a teacher, you seduced your student.

733
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,950
No wonder you're his daughter.

734
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,530
Let's go.

735
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,370
Where are we going?

736
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,390
My home

737
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,200
or a motel.
