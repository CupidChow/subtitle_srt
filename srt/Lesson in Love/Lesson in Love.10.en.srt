When you shape the dough later,

pay attention to the thickness.

I admit

47
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,140
Yixiang's been

48
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,300
a little grumpy lately.

49
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,570
But he has apologized,

50
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,320
and we've paid his medical bills.

Ma'am, you misunderstood me.

55
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,280
I didn't ask you to come because of

56

Why did you still do it?

80
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,920
What did I do?

81
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,790
I have no idea what you are saying.

82
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,890
How dare you report me?

83
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,070
And you threatened the principal that you'd report to the Ministry of Education.

84
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,610
What the hell were you thinking?

85
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,150
Do you think if you take me down

86
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,340
and get me out of here,

87
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,580
then I won't be able to control you?

88
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,680
Or if Yixiang gets expelled from this school,

89
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,310
you'll no longer be his teacher,

90
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,720
then you can start dating?

91
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,190
Chen Mengyun,

92
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,250
are you out of your mind?

93
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,960
You're biological siblings.

94
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,090
Is this the accusation letter?

95
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,860
Can I see it?

96
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,300
Don't tell me it wasn't you.

97
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,200
I won't buy it.

98
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,610
The principal got this in his email?

99
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,750
Can I make a copy of this?

100
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,620
Just drop the act.

101
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,420
I also want to know who did this.

102
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,530
I will not be brought down by a letter.

103
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,320
What exactly is your plan?

104
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,060
If I had wanted to be with Zhang Yixiang,

105
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,590
I wouldn't have cared what you say.

106
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,600
After all, only the two of us

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,700
know the real relation between Yixiang and me.

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,210
As for the violation of teachers' ethics,

109
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,170
I can give up being a teacher.

110
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,870
Anyway, I didn't send that email.

111
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,180
Better not let me find out

112
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,020
that you did it.

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,060
You okay?

114
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,630
It's nothing.

115
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,570
It doesn't look like nothing

116
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,920
Did you hear about the letter?

117
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,310
I knew the chairwoman was looking for you

118
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,710
because of that.

119
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,820
We've got some history,

120
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,290
of course she suspected me out of the whole school.

121
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,690
Well, what you don't know is

122
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,160
in this school, many people have issues with her,

Is this really her?

133

Isn't she the one who…

134
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,900
Yes.

135
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,830
Actually, I asked you all to come here today

136
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,570
because I want to

137

set up a book club.

138

help your children with their studies.

142
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,210
But being good at studying doesn't mean she's a good tutor.

143
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,280
Mrs. Liu, I understand your concerns.

Please take a look.

Miss Xia Yuxin

155
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,400
I asked her

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,040
to come and tutor Keren.

157
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,140

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,310
She's really making some big progress.

are you available to come over

and tutor my son sometime?

164

I heard Xia Yuxin has never attended any tutoring class.

165
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
She got this grade all by herself.

166
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,460

Hello.

If it's okay,

170
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,500
I want you to be Keren's tutor.

171

Why me?

172
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,110
Because you're the best student in the school.

173
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,280
And you're the only one

174
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,340
who has never been defeated by Zhang Yixiang.

175
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,550
You're the one I'm looking for.

176
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,780
He defeated me once.

177
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,780
That was an accident,

178
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,820
and you bounced back in no time, right?

179
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,820
You said you're the vice chairwoman of the parent association.

180
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,990
So you want me to help you defeat Zhang Yixiang

181
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,790
or Xie Shufen?

182
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,130
You are a very smart girl.

183
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,070
I like you.

184
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,480
It seems you have no choice but to let me help.

185
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,890
[Dear Mr. Principal of Private Tainan First Senior High School]

186
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,190
The principal put you in charge of the investigation?

187
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,120
The email was sent from inside the school.

188
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,530
So,

189
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,920
it's someone in the school.

190
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,130
Maybe.

191
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,200
But it could also be other outsiders.

192
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,960
Our security

193
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,340
usually keep the others out,

194
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,640
but,

195
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,340
the email was sent from an IP address inside the school.

196
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,410
Trust me.

197
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,050
I won't let you be falsely accused.

198
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,320
My mom interrupted your class. What did she want?

199
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,030
Did Liu You tell you that?

200
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,940
Did she threaten you again?

201
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,130
She told you not to be with me, right?

202
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,970
I knew it. That's the reason

203
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,870
you've been ignoring me.

204
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,040
Would you stop that?

205
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,610
No one gets to threaten me.

206
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,540
If I had been afraid of your mother,

207
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,180
I wouldn't have cared about you in the first place.

208
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,450
No need to wait until now.

209
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,450
Then why did you…

210
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,560
I've told you it's not about anyone else.

211
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,720
It was me.

212
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,690
I regret my actions.

213
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,320
I don't want to waste my time on you.

214
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,460
Which part can't you understand?

215
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,530
Is it so difficult to be rejected?

216
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,790
Ma'am, thank you for today.

217
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,220
You're welcome.

218
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,200
Take care.

219
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,090
Got it.

220
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,060
The venue's all set.

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,600
The book club starts next week.

222
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,670
You have my word.

223
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,400
Let me tell you something.

224
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,670
I don't care who will be

225
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,480
nominated as the chairwoman,

226
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
you have my vote.

227
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,840
Oh, don't put it that way.

228
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,180
It's like I've been doing these things

229
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,420
just to get your votes.

230
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,810
That's not true.

231
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,680
Don't get me wrong.

232
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,620
I just can't get over it.

233
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,990
Why does she get to offer the chairwoman's

234
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,250
position to Mrs. Feng

235
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,660
and pave the way for her husband?

236
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,700
What does she take us for?

237
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,260
Does she think we can't see what she's up to?

238
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:58,210
[From someone who won't sit back and let that happen]

239
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,170
No wonder Zhang Yixiang's mother

240
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,500
suspected it was you.

241
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,440
You do have the motive.

242
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,740
I didn't know you have become

243
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,180
Sherlock Holmes

244
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,280
There is always only one truth!

245
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,810
That's Detective Conan.

246
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,050
I know. It's my son's favorite.

247
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,790
Except for the server,

248
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,390
did Li Dawei find anything else?

249
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,790
It's not going to be that easy.

250
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,230
Tell him to call the police.

251
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,500
That might be easier. The net police

252
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,030
will definitely find something.

253
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,070
Do you think the principal and the chairwoman

254
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,100
want to get everything out of hand?

255
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,770
That makes sense.

256
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,140
That's okay.

257
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,380
Relax.

258
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,980
No matter what happens to you,

259
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,240
Li Dawei will always serve you

260
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,550
justice to clear your name.

261
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,330
Don't tell me you can't see

262
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,120
Li Dawei has feelings for you.

263
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,360
Avoiding eye contact?

264
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,370
there's something fishy.

265
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,270
You did not break up with Zhang Yixiang

266
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,510
because of Li Dawei, did you?

267
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,270
We were not together.

268
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,640
If you rejected him because of Li Dawei,

269
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,080
that's okay.

270
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,720
Zhang Yixiang is nice,

271
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,720
but you can't wait till he's of age.

272
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,990
Dating him is fine,

273
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,460
but seriously,

274
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,560
can you imagine Xie Shufen being your mother-in-law?

275
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,070
It's horrible.

276
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,230
That's what I'm talking about.

277
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,870
So, nothing to regret.

278
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,370
But to be honest,

279
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,810
it seems Zhang Yixiang's

280
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,480
quite devastated lately.

281
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,380
He kept coming to ask me

282
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,220
if I know why you broke up with him.

283
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,710
I feel bad for him.

284
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,330
Drink up.

285
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,160
Come on.

286
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,510
I don't want to waste any more time.

287
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,440
We have to break up.

288
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,420
Break up?

289
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,650
You don't even admit that we've been together.

290
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,890
You only did all that for fun.

291
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,990
What am I

292
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,720
to you?

293
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,090
Have you really loved me?

294
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,790
We're closing in three minutes.

295
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,810
You get off in half an hour.

296
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,370
What now?

297
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,310
Are you pursuing me?

298
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,080
Then get out of here.

299
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
I don't want to go home.

300
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,650

Yeah, I'm home.

310
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,030
And you?

311
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,520
What is in it?

312
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,090
What's that?

A new flower shop just opened near my home.

I don't know what you like,

318
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
so I talked to the florist.

319
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,290
Somehow, we talked about

320
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,930
what eleven blue roses means.

321
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,370
I think it's quite suitable.

It's not my birthday. What are the flowers for?

342
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,190
What's up?

343
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,120
Please don't send me anything in the future.

344
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,460
Why not?

345
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,660
Because

346
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,970
you've been through a lot lately

347
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,680
and you don't want to hear rumors.

348
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,310
But it seems

349
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,770
you didn't have that concern

350
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,270
when you're with Zhang Yixiang.

351
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,180
People will talk and I know it well.

352
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,860
I just don't want you to get involved.

353
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,230
You know how I feel about you.

354
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,290
I'll prove it to you.

355
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
I'm not just saying that.

356
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,080
There's been a lot going on lately because of that letter,

357
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,280
and it breaks my heart to see you

358
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,070
suffer so much for no reason.

359
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,840
I really want to protect you

360
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,880
and take care of you.

361
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,120
You can reject me.

362
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,790
That's your right.

363
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,360
And it's my right to continue to pursue you.

364
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,270
I'll be waiting for you

365
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,440
to change your mind.

366
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,420
That is all.

367
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,510
I'm going to do my rounds.

368
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,350
Hold on.

369
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Here.

370
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,080
There you go.

371
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,230
Win his heart, and then dump him

372
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,470
The best way to get back at Xie Shufen

373
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,470
is to torture Zhang Yixiang.

374
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
For that matter,

375
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,620
I think you're doing a great job.

376
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,480
Knowing that you are using him,

377
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,220
he's still so obsessed with you.

378
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,550
If I'd known Zhang Yixiang's so gullible,

379
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,490
I would've made my move first.

380
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,490
I want to get back at Xie Shufen?

381
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,890
Did she tell you that?

382
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,140
The Internet is a good tool.

383
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,850
It has everything.

384
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,550
Your father was Xie Shufen's teacher.

385
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,110
You hate her so much, and she's so afraid of you.

386
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,080
Besides the fact that it has something to do with Zhang Yixiang,

387
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,160
your father's part of the reason, right?

388
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,330
Have you read the brochures I sent you?

389
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,760
Will you participate in this year's International Olympiad in Informatics?

390
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,700
Looks like I got it right.

391
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,770
So what was their relationship?

392
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,010
I look forward to your performance.

393
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,250
Even if you don't tell me,

394
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,180
I will find out if I want to.

395
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,760
Now proceed to the nomination for the next chairwoman

396
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,370
of the parent association.

397
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,940
Any nominees?

398
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,650
If not,

399
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,410
I nominate Mrs. Feng.

400
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,520
Now, it's time to vote.

401
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,580
If you agree that

402
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,920
Mrs. Feng will be the next chairwoman, please raise your hand.

403
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,760
Hold on. Hold on.

404
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,200
I want to nominate

405
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,300
our vice chairwoman,

406
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,570
Keren's mom.

407
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,770
As the current vice chairwoman,

408
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,800
it'll be my great honor

409
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,170
to serve everyone as

410
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,800
chairwoman in the future.

411
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,040
Good.

412
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,350
Any more nominees?

413
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,320
Now, let's vote.

414
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,650
Please raise your hand if you agree

415
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,250
that Mrs. Feng will be the next chairwoman.

416
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,200
Those in favor of Keren's mom,

417
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,600
raise your hand, please.

418
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,700
You went behind my back.

419
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,760
Good for you.

420
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,210
Ma'am, how can you say that?

421
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,770
They deserted you because of

422
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,100
the despicable things you've done.

423
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,540
Am I the one to blame?

424
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,240
I heard your son intentionally scored a zero

425
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,550
on the test just to make you angry.

426
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,720
Why don't you take it out on me, too?

427
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,290
Yixiang knew the answer to every question

428
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,450
and did it on purpose.

429
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,890
Not everyone can do that.

430
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,490
I'm afraid

431
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,290
even if Keren wants to get a zero on the test,

432
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,460
she may even get a few questions right by accident.

433
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,370
That's right.

434
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,570
You do have a good son.

435
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,900
Good enough to have a student-teacher relationship

436
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,630
and turned the whole board

437
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,970
upside down.

438
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,140
I also heard that

439
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,680
someone wanted to fire a teacher just because

440
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,240
she has some connections in the board.

441
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,170
Unfortunately,

442
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,870
the world does not revolve around you,

443
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,080
ma'am.

444
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,890
So it's you.

445
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,450
What do you mean?

446
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,990
You sent the letter to the principal to threaten me.

447
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,240
I didn't expect you

448
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,770
to fight so dirty.

449
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,730
What letter? I don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,430
I'll find the evidence.

451
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,140
Don't be so arrogant.

452
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,480
What's more,

453
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,150
you didn't win.

454
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,520
I didn't lose, either.

455
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,520
Let's wait and see.

456
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,170
Unbelievable! What's that all about?

457
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,810
I went behind her back?

458

What did Zhang Yixiang's mother do again?

460

Hi, Xia Yuxin.

461
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,820
The election is today.

462
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,260
Did you lose?

463
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Don't say that.

464
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,400
It's a 9-9 tie. We'll have another vote.

465
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,600
Why are you so angry if you didn't lose?

466
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,740
Of course I am.

467
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,840
Do you know how ridiculous she was?

468
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,240
She said I went behind her back

469
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,980
and sent a letter to the principal to threaten her.

470
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,170
You sent a letter?

471
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,440
What was it about?

472
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,420
How could I know?

473
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,280
At least, I still have

474
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,950
a reputation in the media business,

475
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,520
okay?

476
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,560

the location of the server, right?

481
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,640
Why do you ask?

482
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,540
Is that right?

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,440
Basically, yeah.

But not necessarily.

485
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,020
Maybe it's a floating or rerouted IP address.

486
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,220
So how can I

487
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,090
find out who the sender is?

What are you doing here?

495
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,790
I asked a student who's a computer expert.

496
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,750
She said although the server

497
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,920
is the same,

498
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,520

00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,620
Even so,

511
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,530
you need to know the exact time.

512
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,360
Twenty-four hours a day.

513
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,390
It's going to be difficult.

514
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,130
Computers are easy to find

515
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,440
in the computer lab, the principal's office, and the activity rooms.

516
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,940
Many teachers also bring their laptops

517
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,300
and connect to our school's WIFI.

518
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,540
You're right.

519
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,640
Why are you here?

520
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,070
Return the file.

521
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,980
I was also thinking about what you just said.

522
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,020
So I came yesterday to get the footage from Jiang.

523
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,560
In fact, I also found the time

524
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,020
and IP info of that email,

525
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,090
but the question is…

526
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,430
See?

527
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,860
It's lunch time.

528
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,730
Everyone can go there

529
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,600
to use the computer freely

530
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,900
without any registration.

531
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,400
That person must have anticipated we'd check the footage,

532
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,010
that's why the email was sent during that time.

533
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,380
Lunch time is only half an hour.

534
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,510
There were not so many people.

535
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,580
It won't be that difficult to check them one by one.

536
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
That's too inefficient.

537
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,590
As for the IP,

538
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,690
since that person was so careful,

539
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,270
even if we find the source,

540
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,130
it might not from inside the school.

541
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,030
Most likely a VPN

542
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,100
or some overseas springboard.

543
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,639
But we have to try.

544
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,980

Because besides the chairwoman,

553
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,699
that letter also mentioned Zhang Yixiang

554

did inappropriate things to you.
