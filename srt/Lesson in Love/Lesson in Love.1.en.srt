Of course not.

Why? Right.

337

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,570
and caused you some trouble with your students.

515

I'm sorry about that.

So, I want to invite you to dinner

In the morning...

In the morning I saw Zhang Yixiang

523
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,290
was not very friendly to you.

524
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,030
Which teacher was he friendly to?

525
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,640
No.

526
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,840
I'm really fine.

Instead,

If there's something going on,

529
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,610
you can ask me to discuss it with you.

530
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,750
Next time if there comes some order

531
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,180
from the chairwoman or the principal

532
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,420
that you don't know what to do

Sato Ryuta, you too.

This is a pop quiz.

559
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,200
It's about what you learned from the 1st and 2nd grades.

560
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,000
It's also a review test that I gave you.

So, this time the results

563
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,740
can give me a better idea of

your mastery levels.

this score

Yeah.

What kind of person makes a pop quiz score 40% of the final grade?

Sister!

The benefit of working in a high school

589
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,330
is that you have a lot of cuties to look at.

590
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,030
The shortcoming is that

591
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,199
why nurses in hospitals are called sisters

592
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,969
and I'm the nurse’s office auntie.

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,870
That's it.

684
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,090
From now on you'll be looked after by us.

685
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,900
Xu Keren won't dare to bully you anymore.

686
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,020
Although this is a lame club

687
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,790
that nobody wants to join.

688
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,260
But at least here we won't bully you.

689
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,720
Thank you.

690
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,220
At first, I thought

691
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,320
you are another arrogant high school student.

692
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,170
But behind those actions,

693
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,230
your intention is all about helping your friends

694
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,790
That's why I think you're very kind.

695
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,360
Although I don't approve of these actions,

696
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,510
your motives are not wrong.

697
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,400
You're so funny.

698
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,630
Did I say I needed your approval?

699
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,120
It's about time today.

700
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,220
We'll see you here tomorrow at the same time.

701
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,070
Miss Chen,

702
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,470
do you know why

703
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,280
I'm gonna keep picking on you?

704
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,490
Because I already like you.

705
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,710
You want me too, don't you?

706
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,970
Staring at me every day,

707
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,700
aren't your desire needs to be fulfilled?

708
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,840
Wouldn't you want me to do something to you?

709
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,430
What are you laughing at?

710
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,670
You've never been in love before, have you?

711
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,330
Same time tomorrow.

712
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,400
Welcome Miss Chen to join Tainan First Senior High School.

713
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,130
Xie Shufen, Chairwoman of PTA

714
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,790
Mr. Li?

715
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,960
Miss Chen,

716
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,960
the chairwoman ought to want you to cancel the tutoring.

717
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,660
Zhang Yixiang

718
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,560
Zhang Yixiang

719
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,510
Give this back to the chairwoman for me.

720
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,110
Tell her I appreciate her kindness.

721
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,320
[Devil]

722
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,570
Dear Ms. Xie Shufen,

723
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,680
is there no other way but to give gifts and bribes?

724
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,740
I'm sorry to tell you

725
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,750
this trick doesn't seem to work with Miss Chen.

726
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,640
Do you have anything else to say? If not, bye!

727
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,800
Sofa, tea table, desk, chairs,

728
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,610
and bookcases.

729
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,780
Move them all out.

730
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,790
Madam,

731
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,350
it's really because the video is already out there.

732
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,950
Many parents are protesting,

733
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,460
and the school has no other choice.

734
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,190
This wine cabinet…

735
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:18,820
What?

736
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,680
I remember when Yixiang entered the 1st year of high school,

737
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,020
I asked someone to send it here.

738
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,870
What are you doing?

739
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,970
Why so troublesome wrapping these things?

740
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,870
It's all going to be thrown away. Just take them out and throw them away.

741
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,170
Sure.

742
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,930
Madam, but…

743
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,320
What are you doing?

744
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,210
How did you carry out the things I hand over to you?

745
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,720
You made Ms. Xie unhappy!

746
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,980
What were you thinking?

747
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,560
Sorry, sir.

748
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,070
Wait a moment.

749
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:45,780
Don't move yet.

750
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,210
You guys go take a break.

751
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,680
Excuse me. Please have a drink and take a break.

752
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,520
We'll have a discussion.

753
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,610
Thank you.

754
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,390
Ms. Xie,

755
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,090
I think... There's some kind of misunderstanding here.

756
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,550
Yixiang, he…

757
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,270
Misunderstanding?

758
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,140
As for his cheating, we are now…

759
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,900
Yixiang didn't cheat.

760
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,450
There is no evidence of that at this moment.

761
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,920
So, the school will take no further action.

762
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,410
But for the other two matters as of

763
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,720
trespassed to the pool and underage drinking.

764
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,850
If the school lets that go too,

765
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,320
this may not be fair

766
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,330
for other students.

767
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:23,920
Our school is still…

768
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,760
Fair?

769
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,410
Mr. Li,

770
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,900
do you think I've contributed to the school for so many years

771
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,800
in order to get my son

772
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,320
to be treated as fairly as other students?

773
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,950
And you want him to go to tutoring?

774
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,960
Okay.

775
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,730
Since you're going to be so fair to him,

776
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,060
I'll be fair to you too.

777
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,450
Except for this broken chair,

778
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,230
I want everything else out of here.

779
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:58,110
-Yes.
-Madam.

780
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,870
You, apologize to Ms. Xie now!

781
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,090
Apologize!

782
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,150
What I want is not an apology.

783
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,050
I'm just asking

784
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,740
now how is this thing going to be handled.

785
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,610
Well, we'll withdraw the minor demerit.

786
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,800
But at least a warning must be cited.

787
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,970
Do you think these stains can be washed out?

788
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,580
Can the stains in life be washed out?

789
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,230
There's no room for any stain

790
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,490
on my son.

791
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,480
Ms. Xie did this?

792
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,050
Miss Chen,

793
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,360
the ladies' room is next door.

794
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,080
The ladies' room…

795
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,140
I've heard she may go overboard.

796
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,460
But this is way too much.

797
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,400
No,

798
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,240
nothing.

799
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,710
I just need to wash it.

800
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,310
You can't wash it up this way.

801
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,450
Let me take it to the laundry for you.

802
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,710
No need.

803
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,690
It might cost more to have it cleaned than buy another one.

804
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,500
If it can't be washed up,

805
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,550
I'll just throw it away.

806
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,810
It's okay. It's okay.

807
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,400
Is there any request by the chairwoman

808
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,590
for coming to see you in particular?

809
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,620
[Demerit Withdrawal Announcement]

810
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,140
Trying to fight with the chairwoman,

811
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,110
I'll bet you won't live to see next semester.

812
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,880
Chairwoman is awesome!

813
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,610
Luckily, my parents haven't received the minor demerit notice yet.

814
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:02,970
Hoo-hoo!

815
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,030
What's going on with you two?

816
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,130
Don't you think it's cool to get rid of the minor demerit?

817
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,350
It's the same for me.

818
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,290
Yeah, anyway, you can enter any competition you want.

819
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,940
and get some credits to make up for it.

820
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,280
Hey, you!

821
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,180
What are you so upset about?

822
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:21,700
What is he upset about?

823
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,050
You wouldn't understand if I told you.

824
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,740
You'll understand?

825
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,590
What is it?

826
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,890
Come on, tell me!

827
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,950
The minor demerit is withdrawn.

828
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,880
And you don't need to meet me in the tutoring room in the future.

829
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,020
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

830
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,250
Who told you I was in a bad mood?

831
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,560
So, the look on your face right now is

832
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,500
an expression of good mood.

833
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,750
I'm curious that

834
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,520
you don't seem like the kind of kid who would listen.

835
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,620
Why are you willing to be controlled by your mother?

836
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,340
I'm not.

837
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,700
Is it not very obedient or not very willing?

838
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,210
None of your business.

839
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,060
Don't you think you talk too much?

840
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,230
Why don't you fight back?

841
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,380
Are you going to be like this for the rest of your life?

842
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,980
Living in the shadow of your mother?

843
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,150
Forever under control?
