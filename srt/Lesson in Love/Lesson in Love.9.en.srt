Even if Li Dawei spoke up for Mengyun,

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,420
Can you tell us how sad you are

155
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,520
and say something to your girlfriend.

156
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,480
Maybe she'll get back with you.

157
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,790
Really?

158
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,800
Is that really gonna happen if I say something?

159
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,330
I don't know what you're talking about, but yes.

160
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,730
Wait a minute.

161
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,100
Who is your girlfriend?

162
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,200
Yeah. Who?

Okay, now pour the milk into

the egg mixture slowly.

165
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,610
You can keep beating the eggs.

166
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,290
Slowly.

167
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,110
And pour the milk slowly.

168
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,520
If you finish this step,

169
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,750
you can proceed to sift.

170
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,710
Stop being mad at me.

171
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,410
Clean it up yourself.

172
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,680
All right. Now, we're going to

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,330
and Yixiang?

344
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,780
In fact, I really can't imagine

345
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,210
what you're capable of

346
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,890
just to get back at me.

347
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,810
Your heart's been blinded by revenge.

348
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,090
Yixiang, why are you home so early.

349
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,170
I thought you had night self-learning at school,

350
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,480
so I didn't prepare dinner.

351
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,800
If you want something to eat, just let me know.

352
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,700
Yixiang?

353
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,020
I ordered your favorite sushi.

354
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,950
Take a little break.

355
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,460
You should eat first.

356
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,980
Have some while it's still fresh.

357
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,580
I'm not hungry.

358
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,500
What?

359
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,640
If it's all right, I have to study now.

360
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,670
What happened to you and Miss Chen?

361
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,280
She just got reinstated.

362
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,420
Did you have a fight?

363
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,030
So it was you who had Miss Chen reinstated?

364
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,360
Right?

365
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
You threatened me with that score,

366
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,310
what else could I do?

367
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,040
So it's not Li…

368
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,320
Forget it.

369
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,050
… What you're capable of

370
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,020
just to get back at me.

371
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,850
Your heart's been blinded by revenge.

372
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:45,050
[Zhang Yixiang]

373
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,070
If it were possible,

374
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,590
I would hope no one in the world

375
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,110
knowns the truth.

376
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,650
Do you know

377
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,040
how petty I am as a mother?

378
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,150
I'm afraid

379
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,050
my husband

380
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,560
and my child

381
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,880
would loathe me.

382
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,560
I'm afraid

383
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,810
their future will be disgraced because of me.

384
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,590
No matter how hard I try to love them,

385
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,370
I couldn't hide

386
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,630
the guilt in my heart.

387
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,730
You know what's worse?

388
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,890
I can never get rid of this guilt all my life.

389
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,380
Miss Chen, do you know what time it is?

390
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,310
Why are you moving so late?

391
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,130
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Liang.

392
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,560
It's late. You can move tomorrow.

393
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,760
Chen Mengyun,

394
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
you are still young.

395
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,640
You have your whole life ahead of you.

396
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,710
You have the right to choose

397
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,400
your life and future.

398
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,140
Can you leave me alone?

399
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,210
Let go of Yixiang.

400
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,210
Let go of your brother.

401
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,930
Hi.

402
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,580
Why are you here?

403
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,470
It's still early.

404
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,530
Let's go have breakfast in the park and then go to school.

405
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,370
I'm not hungry.

406
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,480
I know you take the bus to school. There are a lot of students,

407
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,870
and you don't want to be seen.

408
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,510
So I'm not going with you.

409
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,100
I'm just saying…

410
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,860
Fine. Let's go upstairs and eat.

411
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,450
There'll be no one up there, right?

412
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,050
That's enough.

413
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,480
I'm late for work.

414
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,030
You don't have to be there for morning self-study,

415
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,420
and you don't have a first period today.

416
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,930
But you, have to be there for morning self-study

417
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,150
and you have your first period.

418
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,490
My problem is none of your concern.

419
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,620
My stuff is none of your concern, either!

420
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,130
Whatever.

421
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,440
Tell me what to do.

422
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,870
What can I do to make you feel better?

423
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,900
Nothing.

424
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,540
Sorry, I'm late.

425
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm not buying you breakfast.

426
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,620
But can I have breakfast with you on the roof?

427
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,650
Open your books to page 120.

428
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,210
First, No.71.

429
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,050
You.

430
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,480
The woodcutter's axe

431
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,820
begged for its handle from the tree.

432
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,340
[My surname's Zhang. I'm happy to meet you.]

433
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,280
Next.

434
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,510
[I want to write a set of code to get to your heart.]

435
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,540
[What's your zodiac? I'm yours.]

436
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,360
The ninth period. Meet me at our spot.

437
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,949
Practicing baseball can heal

438
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,580
your broken heart.

439
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,389
What are you talking about?

440
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,340
Liu You, what do you think?

441
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,690
Don't say you're not heartbroken, either.

442
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,510
Senior, I know I'm not

443
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,770
as handsome as you are,

444
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,590
and I don't have a wealthy family,

445
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,400
or a mom ruthless as yours,

446
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,670
but I am sincere towards Sister Xinyi.

447
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,520
Senior, please don't

448
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,909
toy with her emotions.

449
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,710
What?

450
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,350
What are you talking about?

451
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,620
Who's toying with Sister Xinyi?

452
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,219
You used to call her Infirmary Lady,

453
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,230
why do you call her Sister Xinyi now?

454
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,460
What are you saying?

455
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,970
I saw it.

456
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,520
What did you see?

457
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,670
I saw him with her.

458
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,190
He was in the Infirmary with Sister Xinyi.

459
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,570
What about Infirmary Lady?

460
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,640
He's in bed, and Sister Xinyi…

461
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,360
Idiot.

462
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,540
The bed in the infirmary is for lying.

463
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,850
What else could it be for?

464
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,810
Have you laid in it?

465
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,740
No.

466
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,370
Have you?

467
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,010
No.

468
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,030
Okay. I have.

469
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,600
But there's nothing between us, okay?

470
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,710
Then why did you go for her?

471
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,140
I was there talking to her about Miss Chen.

472
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,650
So, Senior,

473
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,840
there's nothing going on between you and Sister Xinyi?

474
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,870
Liu You, I thought you were kidding.

475
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,090
I didn't expect you to be so serious.

476
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,910
What do you mean? Ugly boys don't have human rights?

477
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,920
He likes Miss Chen,

478
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,260
why can't I like Sister Xinyi?

479
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,600
They are different.

480
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,860
How?

481
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,590
She has a husband and a child.

482
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,310
Will you give up if

483
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,610
Miss Chen has a boyfriend?

484
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,330
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

485
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,010
Maybe she will in the future.

486
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,320
Miss Chen is not getting any younger.

487
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,960
Does she have to keep

488
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,840
being single and wait

489
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,480
until you graduate from college?

490
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,820
That's too cruel for her.

491
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,410
Let me tell you,

492
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,670
they're not interested in younger boys, okay?

493
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,760
All right, all right.

494
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,020
Stop talking.

495
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,100
In fact, Liu You was right.

496
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,990
We are only in senior high.

497
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,020
How old will she be when you're of age?

498
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,920
I don't think Miss Chen will keep waiting for you.

499
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,220
Seems she and Director Li are perfect for each other.

500
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,480
Yeah, I think so, too.

501
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,490
Right?

502
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,300
Hey.

503
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,840
Senior.

504
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,890
Where are you going?

505
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,690
How did you know I was here?

506
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,790
Did I say I'm here to see you?

507
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,410
What happened to you and Miss Chen?

508
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,300
You wouldn't understand.

509
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,600
And you do?

510
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,870
[Devil]

511
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,640

00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,200
On that day you two had dinner at your grandma's,

681
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,090
Nothing else happened?

682
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,060
Right? Answer me!

683
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,240
Do you know

684
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,410
what the women my age are doing?

685
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,220
Getting married and having a family.

686
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,400
Even if they are not,

687
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,120
they're planning to do so.

688
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,640
I don't know why I even bothered to be with you.

689
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,010
How old will I be when you graduate from college?

690
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,810
How long can I afford to wait?

691
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,240
Then let's get married now.

692
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,720
Anyway, I'm 18. I don't have to ask anyone.

693
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,640
Let's do it now.

694
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,740
Are you kidding me?

695
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,070
I don't want to waste any more time.

696
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,240
We have to break up.

697
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,680
Break up?

698
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,660
Didn't you say sleeping together doesn't mean a thing?

699
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,100
Miss Chen,

700
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,080
You don't even admit that we've been together.

701
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,090
You only did all that for fun.

702
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,870
What am I

703
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,130
to you?

704
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,940
Have you really loved me?
