00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,390
If the chairwoman's crushed just like that,

171
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,050
it might as well save me some effort

172
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,150
for the votes.

173
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,220
Tell me about it.

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,260
Have some fruit.

175
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,530
Did your husband buy it for you?

176
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,160
Of course. Who else?

177
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm so jealous.

178
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,500
Mrs. Huang.

179
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,940
This is…

181
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,150
Oh my God!

182
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,720
Oh, God!

183
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,980
Its' a recommendation letter written by Principal Zhu!

184
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,890
But the academic test's not even taken yet.

185
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,790
Ma'am, how did you get the recommendation letter?

186
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,390
You're so lucky.

187
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,260
A recommendation letter.

188
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,060
Ma'am, you are really capable!

189
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,770
My daughter prefers accounting of Central University.

190
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,270
Could you please do me a favor?

191
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,300
I want it, too.

192
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,370
Ma'am, please.

193
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,440
Ladies,

194
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,610
test scores are still the most important,

195
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,710
okay?

196
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,720
As long as it's someone I have access to,

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,250
I'll help you get the recommendation.

198
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,180
I'll try my best, but no promise here.

199
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,020
Thank you, ma'am.

200
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,120
Ma'am, you are the best.

201
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,260
So nice!

202
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,490
Really.

203
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,320
Yixiang,

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,660
you're home.

205
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,190
Come and say hello.

206
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,770
Long time no see.

207
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,430
Yeah.

208
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,430
Getting better-looking.

209
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,890
Hi, Yixiang.

210
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,600
Hello.

211
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,640
It's been a while.

212
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,540
Hi, Yixiang.

213
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,700
Hi. Good to see you.

214
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,890
He's pretty stressed. Exams and all.

215
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Still learning to manage his emotions.

216
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
It's okay.

217
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,420
It's just puberty.

218
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,700
I'll go get some wine.

219
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,360
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

220
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,330
Thank you.

221
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,630
Look.

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,900
My baby's saved.

223
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,970
Only if we all have one.

224
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,680
Mrs. Zhang.

225
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,180
Hi, Mrs. Feng.

226
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,390
What do you need? I'll get it for you.

227
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,190
How's it going with your son lately?

228
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,220
Well, Yixiang's

229
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,560
been acting out lately.

230
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,970
He blames me for not having time for him.

231
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,870
Actually, I've been a little busy.

232
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,040
You know, the election and

233
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,670
school anniversary celebration…

234
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,740
This morning,

235
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,740
I saw him walking into school with Miss Chen.

236
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,910
Looks like they're quite close.

237
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,580
There are rumors all over school

238
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,450
that the two of them are…

239
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,490
Oh, dear.

240
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,390
The school is always

241
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,960
buzzing with rumors.

242
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,290
Yixiang is cute.

243
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,760
A lot of people are jealous of him.

244
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,630
It is natural for them to make up

245
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,370
such things that do not even exist.

246
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,670
Mrs. Feng,

247
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,870
now we just have to wait for you to be the chairwoman.

248
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,470
I promise

249
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,310
I'll do my best to assist you in the handover.

250
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,380
As for Wenhui,

251
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,080
I'll do everything I can to get her

252
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,150
the possible resources at school.

253
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,480
Good.

254
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,080
I've convinced my husband

255
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,290
to formally introduce Mr. Zhang

256
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,090
to all bureaus

257
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,730
after the next municipal meeting.

258
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,330
Mrs. Feng,

259
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,930
you're a pro.

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
'Cause I know you won't let me down.

261
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,170
Of course.

262
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,670
I won't let you down.

263
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,850
-Thank you.
-Bye.

264
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,380
Ma'am, thank you so much.

265
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,450
No problem.

266
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,660
It's nothing.

267
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,120
Bye.

268
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,290
Bye.

269
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,560
Thank you for having us.

270
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,290
Get it done.

271
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,000
It's up to you.

272
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,920
Bye.

273
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,440
Why did you lie to me yesterday

274
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,140
that Zhang Yixiang slept at Ryuta's?

275
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,920
You don't believe me, do you?

276
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,480
No. I don't buy it.

277
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Sato Ryuta,

278
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,730
I need you to cover for Zhang Yixiang.

279
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,340
Just say he's staying at your place tonight.

280
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,700
I'll text you later.

281
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,270
Yeah, just say he's sleeping.

282
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,510
I need the screenshot for his mom.

283
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,740
Zhang Yixiang's at my place, sleeping.

284
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,880
What's up?

285
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,820
Hello?

286
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,690
Mrs. Xu.

287
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,670
What do you want to show me?

288
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,000
I'd like to ask you a question first.

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,280
As a wife and a mother,

290
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,080
which identity is more important

291
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
for a woman?

292
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,850
What do you mean?

293
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,120
Let me be clear.

294
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,150
The Mother's Someone's Mistress

295
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,190
or The Wife's Having an Affair,

296
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,580
which one do you think makes a more eye-catching title?

297
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

298
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,560
No wonder you're giving Miss Chen a hard time.

299
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,670
It's because of your feelings of guilt.

300
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,010
Miss Chen's father was my professor in college.

301
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,920
I admit it.

302
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,110
So what?

303
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,780
Nothing.

304
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,320
I just want to remind you

305
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,790
that in this circle,

306
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,990
impression matters.

307
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,660
I wonder what other parents would think

308
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,260
of someone used to be a mistress.

309
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,960
Everyone in the school knows

310
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,900
how much I've contributed over the past two years.

311
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,800
You're just a vice chairwoman.

312
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,770
The president doesn't even know you.

313
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,040
You're one to talk about impression?

314
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,680
Dear Mrs. Zhang,

315
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,109
who doesn't know your contribution

316
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,640
is for getting Zhang Yixiang resources?

317
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
And who doesn't know

318
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,710
the reason you're making Mrs. Feng

319
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,020
the chairwoman of the parent association

320
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,390
is to pave the way for your husband?

321
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,820
It's just an old photo.

322
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,390
It doesn't mean anything.

323
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,360
No one's going to believe you.

324
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,900
If you don't have anything else to say,

325
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,500
excuse me.

326
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,140
I'm busy.

327
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,010
Miss Chen.

328
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,010
More than 100 sets of IP data,

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,580
I got it all figured out.

330
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,950
It might still need some screening.

331
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,280
But I think I can get it done

332
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
in a couple of days

333
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,290
as I have a lot of time after work lately.

334
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,590
It's similar to the results of my investigation.

335
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,730
Your investigation?

336
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,740
You asked Zhang Yixiang for help,

337
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,810
right?

338
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,250
Zhang Yixiang is a bit reckless.

339
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,360
I don't think

340
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,060
you should get him involved.

341
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,590
He's also a victim of that email.

342
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,500
Don't you think he has a right to know the truth?

343
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,860
Do you remember what that email was about?

344
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,500
He was sexually harassing you.

345
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,630
But you're still getting

346
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,810
so close with him.

347
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,170
Is this really appropriate?

348
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,540
Those words are not true.

349
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,680
And either is the part that

350
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,040
the chairwoman is bullying you?

351
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,410
Miss Chen.

352
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,660
I understand

354
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,230
that you care about Zhang Yixiang's feelings.

355
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,330
But because of this matter,

356
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,870
the reputation of the school is at stake.

357
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,570
Even your safety.

358
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,100
Don't you think

359
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,570
it's time

360
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,870
to make it clear to him?

361
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,980
What do you mean?

362
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,770
Make it clear that you're not together.

363
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,310
That you can't be together.

364
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,210
If he keeps bothering you,

365
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,280
just tell him

366
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,610
that I'm pursuing you.

367
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,420
He's not just a student to me.

368
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,530
We're not just teachers and students.

369
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,540
Do you know

370
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,000
how serious the consequences will be

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
if what you just said gets out?

372
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,490
Director Li told me about the investigation.

373
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,260
Why did he tell you?

374
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,190
You're not a victim.

375
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,260
Oh, I see.

376
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,090
He wants to feel important.

377
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,400
Miss Chen,

378
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,010
you look really good in that dress.

379
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,240
It suits you.

380
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,340
Thank you for the handmade cookies.

381
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,110
Grow up already.

382
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,750
So you like maturity.

383
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,250
Sure.

384
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,680
Miss Chen.

385
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,190
This dress really suits you.

386
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,950
Not funny.

387
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,700
It felt like I'm your mom

388
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,000
when I was preparing your lunch today.

389
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,600
I can't eat this that way.

390
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,370
Dig in.

391
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,520
Yummy!

392
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,760
Keep your voice down.

393
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,860
What?

394
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,590
Are you afraid that Li Dawei will come and grab my lunch?

395
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,690
Zhang Yixiang.

396
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,600
What?

397
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,210
I think you're funny.

398
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,220
Did Li Dawei find

399
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,450
anything I didn't find?

400
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,820
Forget it.

401
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,320
I know he got nothing.

402
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,330
If I can't crack the password,

403
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,960
how could he possibly solve it?

404
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,980
[Director Li]

405
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,810
Hello.

406
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,780
Where are you?

407
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,630
I'd like to speak with Miss Chen in private.

408
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,240
Ma'am,

409
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,340
the email

410
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,510
had nothing to do with Miss Chen.

411
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,240
If you'll excuse us.

412
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,730
Making Liao Xiuhua chairwoman,

413
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,970
what's in it for you?

414
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,160
Why are you helping her?

415
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,010
Liao Xiuhua?

416
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,270
You mean Xu Keren's mother?

417
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,480
You're good at acting.

418
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,750
My son was fooled just

419
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,450
because of this innocent look.

420
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,520
Am I right?

421
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,650
Chen Mengyun,

422
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
you know Yixiang is your brother.

423
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,660
You…

424
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,760
Don't you think it's gross?

425
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,390
Why can't you just stay away from him?

426
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,000
Brother?

427
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,100
I think you made a mistake.

428
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,070
Zhang Yixiang is the son of you and Principal Zhang.

429
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,800
How come he's my brother?

430
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,740
Yixiang didn't come home

431
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,610
for two nights in a row days ago.

432
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,380
Did he sleep at your place?

433
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,590
You…

434
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,820
Do you know what shame means?

435
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,520
Of course.

436
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,730
I teach Language and Literature.

437
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,090
But I still have to thank you

438
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,830
for telling me how to use this word.

439
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,030
No.

440
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,200
To be exact,

441
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,030
it's shameless.

442
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,010
That's what I learned from you.

443
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,140
If no one knows it,

444
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,750
it never happened.

445
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,010
So what happened between you and my father

446
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,550
doesn't exist at all.

447
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,810
I've told you

448
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,880
no one will know

449
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,950
as long as

450
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,350
we keep our mouths shut.

451
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,520
Are you not afraid that I'll tell Yixiang?

452
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,130
How can you be sure he doesn't know?

453
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,300
He stayed

454
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,500
at my place for these two days.

455
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,530
We talked a lot in bed.

456
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,380
He said he's a little upset about what's going on between you two.

457
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,270
Sometimes he felt like you're not alike,

458
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,420
even doubted whether he's your real son.

459
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,780
So I told him,

460
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,220
"You were definitely born by your mother.

461
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,380
No need to doubt.

462
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,220
But as for who your father is,

463
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,390
it's hard to say."

464
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,350
Chen Mengyun!

465
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,390
Sorry.

466
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm going to class.

467
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,540
How can she

468
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,410
make everyone wait for her?

469
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,840
Ridiculous.

470
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,650
How much longer do we have to wait?

471
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,920
[Where are you?]

472
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,810
Unbelievable.

473
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,080
We will not come again next time.

474
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,250
She's here.

475
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,400
Sorry.

476
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,940
I'm late.

477
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,080
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

478
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,180
Same as last time.

479
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,550
The candidates for the next chairwoman of the parent association are

480
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Mrs. Feng

481
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,790
and Mrs. Xu.

482
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,710
Do you have any objections?

483
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,450
If not,

484
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,910
let's start voting.

485
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,680
Please raise your hand if you vote for Mrs. Feng.

486
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,160
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

487
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,820
Eight votes.

488
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,560
For Mrs. Xu, please raise your hand.

489
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,270
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

490
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,540
ten.

491
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,350
Congratulations, Mrs. Xu.

492
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,560
Thank you.

493
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
It's just an old photo.

494
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,420
It doesn't mean anything.

495
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,560
No one's going to believe you.

496
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,300
If you don't have anything else to say,

497
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,700
excuse me.

498
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm busy.

499
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,300
Great.

500
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,040
Let's see

501
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,500
if people will believe it.

502
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,650
Let me find the chat group.

503
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,710
Got it.

504
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,090
What do you want?

505
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,150
One of the good things about myself

506
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,620
is that I'm not greedy.

507
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,030
Well,

508
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,330
give me five votes more.

509
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,340
Thirteen to five.

510
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,240
A decent result like that

511
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,830
won't make you look too bad.

512
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,640
What do you think?

513
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,740
Thank you.

514
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,610
Congratulations.

515
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,540
Thank you for your support.

516
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,740
Mrs. Feng.

517
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,150
I'm sorry. Please listen to me.

518
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,650
You don't have to say anything.

519
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,020
You still have a chance next year.

520
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,520
Yixiang will graduate next year,

521
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,260
but I promise…

522
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,320
What can you promise?

523
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,490
The fact that you were a homewrecker will be the same next year.

524
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,970
It's not Mrs. Xu.

525
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,140
Then how could you…

526
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,180
Who sent this to you?

527
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,910
Does it matter?

528
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,290
I don't care at all.

529
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,220
Who doesn't have a history?

530
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,920
This kind of thing doesn't scare me.

531
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,790
When I was on the way today,

532
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,260
I told myself

533
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,760
even if the photo's real,

534
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,960
as long as you're on my side,

535
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,530
I'm on your side.

536
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,440
But I didn't expect…

537
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,970
I thought you cared about Mr. Zhang.

538
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,740
Turns out that compared to his future,

539
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,500
you care more about your reputation.

540
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,170
Then why should I help you?

541

...and student Zhang are in an incestuous relationship.

542
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,560
They're even half-siblings.

543
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,990
You saw that, too?

544
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,070
Get your phone. Get your phone.

545
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,640
Wow.

546
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,880
Breaking news.

547
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,010
Female teacher Chen and student

548
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,890
Zhang are in an incestuous relationship at Nanyi.

549
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,520
They're even half-siblings.

550
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,920
Senior, there was…

551
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,930
Don't go find Miss Chen.

552
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,860
You'll only make this worse.

553
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,560
I'm not going to find her.

554
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,090
You were right.

555
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,360
If I want the truth, I can't be biased.

556
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,880
I knew it.

557
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,910
Secrets don't stay secrets.

558
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,310
What is going on here?

559
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,050
Falling in love with a student is one thing,

560
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,580
but half-siblings? That's too much.

561
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,160
Hey, be careful what you're saying.

562
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,630
Keep your voice down.

563
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,430
Miss Chen.

564
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,510
Miss Chen.

565
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,440
Miss Chen.

568
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,930
You're back.

569
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,350
Yeah.

570
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,140
You're home early.

571
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,680
I got a call from Mr. Feng.

572
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,410
He said all arrangements are suspended

573
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,080
and told me not to think about working for the government.

574
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,550
Mr. Feng

575
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,290
called me himself.

576
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,690
I'm pretty happy.

577
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,860
So I just gave myself half a day off

578
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,200
to come back early to celebrate.

579
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,070
Celebrate?

580
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,840
A successful career

581
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,770
and a family in harmony.

582
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,980
Isn't that what you've been emphasizing

583
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,180
since we got married?

584
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,910
Finally.

585
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,420
I can disburden myself all at once today.

586
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,630
Thanks to you.

587
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,200
I'll keep trying to get you into the government.

588
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,100
Don't give up so quickly.

589
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,460
Give up?

590
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,800
What am I giving up?

591
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,940
Being overwhelmed by

your pretentious efforts,

593
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,770
or continuing to believe

594
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,180
that Zhang Yixiang is my son?

595
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,520
What are you talking about?

596
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,410
Yixiang is your son.

597
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,720
Yeah?

598
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,700

[Forbidden teacher-student relationship in Nanyi]

00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,650
Schools are always buzzing with rumors.

602

It's…

603

And you believe that?

604
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,790
Yixiang is cute.

605
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,860
A lot of people are jealous of him.

606

What's this?

607

These people… Gosh.

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,570
Of course I know Zhang Yixiang is my son.

611
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,340
Then why are you still mad at me?

612
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,950
How could you make up such a lie

613
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,420
just to break up your son and Chen Mengyun?

614
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,010
Why I'm mad at you, you ask?

615
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,880
So?

616

Are you okay with Yixiang

and Chen Mengyun's relationship?

618
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,750
Is that so?

619
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,130
The two of them are so much different in age,

620
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,159
and Chen Mengyun is his teacher.

621
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,800
Chen Shize was also your teacher.

622

You knew?

623
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,510
Of course.

Does it matter?

You're right.

627
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,000
I did cheat on you back then.

628

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,870
That's why

You've been pretending for so many years.

640
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,590
You had no intention to forgive me

641

from the beginning, right?

642
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,330
I never wanted you to make it up.

643
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,130
But did you believe me when I said I don't care?

644
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,880
This is how this family works.

No one can ever change

no matter what.

648
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,280
Don't you think I know that?

649
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,110
But what I didn't know was you'd be

650
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,420
so unscrupulous to get what you want.

651
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,360
I can't believe you had the guts to say

that Zhang Yixiang is not my son.

664
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,340
I mean it.

00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,890
How selfish and cruel is a person

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,920
to hurt others in

670
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,190
such a heartless way?

671
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,520
It wasn't me

00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,990

there are no fractures in your limbs.
