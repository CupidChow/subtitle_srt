is a real beauty.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,820
Yes.

Right.

And the teacher of that Girls' High School in the north district.

10
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,210
She has really big eyes, right?

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,460
The female instructor of Qiangying School is also very beautiful.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,830
Who's she? She's pretty!

13
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,810
Can anyone tell me which school she is from?

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,620
Isn't she the Chinese teacher from the Shuzhong school?

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,380
She left there a long time ago, right?

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,590

Top beauties in top private schools.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,090
I heard she had disputes with a student.

19
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,730
Then the parents complained and she left there.

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,250
What's wrong with the parents!

21

I'm from the above-mentioned Shuzhong School.

I heard that Miss Chen caught a student stealing the class fund.

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,190
But the parents, instead, accused her of framing.

24

What's the matter with the parents?

25
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,840
Who can accuse such a beauty?

26

Do you know why

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,870
Because I've fallen in love with you.

Did you hydrate?

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,070
I made the chicken soup.

Go wash your hands and come eat.

Or the new one?

Is she your head teacher? How could she do that?

the chairwoman would help him deal with that.

What's there to be annoyed at?

But I was never involved.

I just don't understand why he's annoyed.

Since we knew him,

74

the chairwoman has been good at mediation.

Hello, all teachers and students,

I am Zhang Yixiang.

Good morning.

100
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,840
I have something to say.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,830
During the preliminary test at the beginning of this semester, you spread a swimming pool video

102
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,220
and claimed that I stole the exam paper.

103
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,000
It's true.

104
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,150
I hacked into the school website and stole the preliminary test paper,

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,490
but I didn't leak them.

106
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,960
So no one else was involved.

107
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,770
According to school regulations,

108
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,630
whoever steals school information for unlawful purposes

109
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,190
must get a major demerit.

110
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,260
Whoever cheats on a major examination

111

shall be given two demerits.

112
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,860
I ask the principal, the director and the instructors

113
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,450
to abide by the rules

114
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,800
and give me three demerits.

115
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,930
And then...

116
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,560

117
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,580

Hello!

119
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,500
Three demerits mean you will be expelled.

120
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,100
You don't want to graduate this badly?

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,870
Whatever.

122
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,420
It makes no difference.

123
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,760
Why should I care?

124
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,470
Oh, I know.

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,000
My mom has contributed so much to the school.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,470
If I get expelled,

127
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,820
she'll have no reason to continue contributing to education.

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,720
That'll be a shame for the school!

129
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,980
I'm in favor of a severe punishment.

130
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,280
Two votes.

131
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,580
Two to one.

132
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,460
Expel me. Expel me.

133
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,380
-Expel...
-Stop.

134
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,090
Miss Chen,

135
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,320
it's true that cheating is a very serious problem,

136
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,630
but our school always advocates

137
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,390
that students should be given a chance to turn over a new leaf.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,470
We've already given him the chance.

139
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,110
But not only did he refuse to admit it,

140
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,120
he even conspired with other students to lie.

141
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,520
He also interrupted the morning assembly today.

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,620
So I think he deserves three demerits.

143
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,450
One demerit.

144
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,500
Three.

145
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,880
Two.

146
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,970
Are you bargaining?

147
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,600
On account of how he requested for the punishment himself,

148
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,789
he's not completely hopeless.

149
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,940
He can make amends for that.

150
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,860
Two demerits.

151
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,160
Traitor!

152
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,730
You don't have to bargain over there.

153
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,830
The punishment has been decided.

154
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,060
What is it?

155
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,730
Mr. Qiu.

156
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,380
It's cold. You should go back now.

157
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,720
I'll sweep it up myself.

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,150
I will go back myself later.

159
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,920
Okay, I think you can go now.

160
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,350
I think that's enough.

161
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,530
Enough?

162
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,320
Enough.

163
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,420
I barely swept half the area.

164
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,040
Mr. Qiu.

165
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
You have something on in a bit?

166
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,350
Okay.

167
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,240
I'll hurry up!

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,100
If nobody instigated him,

169
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,750
how could Yixiang admit to cheating?

170
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,680
He was forced to do it.

171
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,960
He would never cheat.

172
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,810
Didn't you see his performance in the past?

173
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,520
With his level of IQ,

174
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,030
does he need to cheat?

175
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,380
What on earth is wrong with you people?

176
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,330
[Zhang Yixiang]

177
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,590
Your call will be forwarded to...

178
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,680
He won't answer it.

179
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,480
-Stop calling.
-Your call will be forwarded to...

180
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,940
Everything I do is for his own good.

181
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,500
Why can't he understand?

182
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,020
Don't overreact.

183
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,450
It's not the first time he's been like this.

184
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,970
So you're going to keep indulging him?

185
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,000
You've indulged him way more than I have.

186
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,300
Yes, it's my problem.

187
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,640
It's all my fault.

188
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,000
Not only do I indulge him, but I also indulge you.

189
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,470
Have you thought about

190
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,660
who pushed for this dinner tonight?

191
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,460
I've worked so hard

192
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,810
to pave the way for both of you.

193
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,490
Is it for my own good?

194
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm good now.

195
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,350
No one asked you to pave the way for me.

196
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,190
My son has his...

197
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,790
Whether you are good or not,

198
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,420
it is not up to you.

199
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,830
Have you forgotten how your father complains about you?

200
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,670
He...

201
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,530
Hello.

202
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,450
Dad!

203
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,600
We're on the way.

204
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah, it's all set.

205
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,270
Do you want to talk to Guoyang?

206
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,210
[Devil]

207
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,480
Welcome.

208
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,280
Table for three.

209
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,450
Dad.

210
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,700
Where's Yixiang?

211
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,250
He has an exam tomorrow.

212
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,850
He's at home today preparing for the exam.

213
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,700
Is he at home studying

214
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,100
or is he at the school detention

215
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,520
for the trouble he made?

216
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,440
Principal Liu is good.

217
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,990
He dares to punish him.

218
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,390
It's not Yixiang's fault.

219
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,230
It's the new teacher who...

220
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,380
You didn't discipline your child well.

221
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,390
Don't blame everything on others.

222
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,870
Dad.

223
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,870
What were you talking about with Dad?

224
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,570
Let's go home, okay?

225
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,000
I want to go to the department store.

226
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,010
Okay, let's go to the department store, okay?

227
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,520
Cool.

228
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,440
Where are we going?

229
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,660
Doudou, where are we going?

230
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,890
Where are we going?

231
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,620
Don't look at them.

232
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,180
The grass is always greener on the other side.

233
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,300
One spaghetti, one chicken wing,

234
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,160
one iced milk tea and one French fries.

235
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,380
You ate a lot.

236
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,300
Seriously.

237
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,860
Why did you admit to cheating?

238
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,060
I just think it's funny

239
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,950
how they work their butts off

240
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,380
trying to get me off the hook.

241
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,700
I'm not as gullible as Sato Ryuta.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,260
Keep the secret if you like.

243
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,850
But don't lie to me, okay?

244
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,210
Hey!

245
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,390
Do you think I'm a mama's boy too?

246
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,230
A mama's boy?

247
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,180
Like,

248
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,780
all I do is talk about

249
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,260
how I don't want to be controlled by my mom,

250
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,070
but I still keep making trouble

251
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,920
and let my mom deal with that.

252
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,890
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

253
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,530
So you turned yourself in

254
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,630
to keep getting your mother into trouble?

255
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,390
Or did you want to assert your sovereignty?

256
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,430
Your autonomy in life.

257
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,940
Got it.

258
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,440
Why do you want to defy your mom?

259
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,830
Someone asked me just the other day

260
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,390
why I never rebel against my mom,

261
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,360
and why I'm willing to be controlled by her.

262
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,840
But now you're asking me why I want to rebel against my mom.

263
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,330
So should I rebel or not?

264
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,640
To rebel or not?

265
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
Who asked you that?

266
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,530
Miss Chen?

267
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,850
She's the only new person we've met recently.

268
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,200
It can't be Xu Keren, right?

269
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,580
All the teachers want me to be a good boy.

270
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,810
Even after my mom make them suffer a lot,

271
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,610
and they hate her so much,

272
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,540
they would still tell me,

273
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,640
"Be good, Yixiang, and listen to your mom."

274
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,410
Only Miss Chen is different.

275
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,920
She asked me why I obeyed her.

276
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,050
Why don't I fight back?

277
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,860
Why am I willing to be controlled by her?

278
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,130
Does Miss Chen know

279
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,270
she has that much influence on you?

280
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,060
Who is it? What's wrong?

281
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,720
My mother said this preliminary test doesn't count.

282
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,580
And the scholarship will be canceled.

283
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,330
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,390
I'm sorry you didn't get the scholarship.

285
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,250
It's too late to apologize now.

286
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,350
When you turned yourself in,

287
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,110
didn't you think this would happen?

288
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,400
I can give you all my scholarships next semester.

289
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,880
The second place doesn't get as much as the first place.

290
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,110
But if I give it all to you for the whole semester,

291
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,900
that should be able to make up for it.

292
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,910
Zhang Yixiang,

293
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,310
I know your family is rich,

294
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,080
but I'm not a beggar.

295
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,490
And how can you be sure

296
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,430
next time I'll still be the first

297
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,030
and you the second.

298
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,060
It's been like this since middle school.

299
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,200
I can never beat you.

300
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,320
But in primary school,

301
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,120
you were always better than me.

302
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,690
After we got into middle school,

303
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,930
my dad left home and my mum didn't make enough money,

304
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,280
so I needed to get the scholarship.

305
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,859
Since then you haven't beaten me.

306
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,990
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

307
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,850
I didn't see any remittance in my bankbook today.

308
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,360
Did I get the date wrong?

309
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
I told you that the paychecks come at the end of the month.

310
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,900
I meant the scholarship.

311
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,890
No scholarship because someone cheated this time.

312
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,370
Are you serious?

313
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,430
Yes.

314
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,500
Freeze it.

315
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,160
Isn't this trash?

316
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,290
Someone would buy it.

317
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,570
How could you do this?

318
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,830
You always pick up the unwanted fish.

319
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,440
You're going to make someone sick.

320
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,260
If you don't want to freeze it, I'll do it myself.

321
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,150
If I had money,

322
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,120
I'd purchase that high quality fish too.

323
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,170
You think I like doing this?

324
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,150
You're back. Have you eaten yet?

325
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,380
Grandpa kept asking why you weren't there today.

326
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,850
Don't hide

327
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,950
every time you see me.

328
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,970
Did Miss Chen pick on you?

329
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,070
Did she ask you to go to the counseling room?

330
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,830
No.

331
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,890
That's good.

332
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,210
They said you have to do labor work as punishment.

333
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,810
So that it seems fair

334
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,370
to other parents.

335
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,000
I just don't understand.

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,520
What did they do?

337
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,870
Did they donate a gymnasium?

338
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,670
How much money did they donate?

339
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,980
Who cares about them?

340
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,300
Did they contribute more to the school than me?

341
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,240
I want to go back to my room.

342
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,520
If you don't like the labor work,

343
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,780
just tell me.

344
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,750
I'll go to the school tomorrow for the parent association.

345
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,600
Or we can ask your father to talk to them.

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
It's just labor work.

347
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,890
I can't imagine

348
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,450
that you're going to do cleaning for a week.

349
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,310
Zhang Yixiang!

350
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,130
Zhang Yixiang.

351
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,260
You're so early today.

352
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,830
I just went to help at the fish market.

353
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,950
You help out at the fish market every day?

354
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,640
Not always.

355
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,300
If you need to help out at the fish market,

356
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,770
what time do you have to get up?

357
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,730
Do you really want to know what time I get up?

358
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,160
Or do you want to say something?

359
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,450
For the next model exam,

360
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,460
what do you want me to do?

361
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,230
Zhang Yixiang,

362
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,280
what makes you think I can't beat you?

363
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,430
Do you really think I can only get the first-class scholarship

364
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,570
with your help?

365
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,940
I don't know.

366
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,040
Maybe you'll win.

367
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,840
But maybe I will.

368
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,530
I didn't even think about it that much.

369
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,510
I just know you need that scholarship.

370
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,850
Thank you.

371
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,560
But I'll get the scholarship I need by myself.

372
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,580
Next time, play fair.

373
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,970
Okay?

374
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,110
And you,

375
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,080
why are you here so early today?

376
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,500
Here you go.

377
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,750
But I have the large one, you the small one.

378
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,720
Go away!

379
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,570
Miss Chen.

380
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,830
Sir.

381
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,060
You didn't sleep well last night?

382
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,380
A bit.

383
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,480
I had a quarrel with my girlfriend.

384
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,770
I told her that

385
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,530
[A friendly campus starts with no bullying]

386
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,150
I was going to celebrate my friend's birthday last night.

387
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,990
And then...

388
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,970
Forget it, it's not important.

389
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,320
What about you?

390
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,460
Have you been together long?

391
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:47,970
I...

392
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,420
About two years.

393
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,050
And you?

394
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,070
I don't have a boyfriend.

395
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,180
Mr. Qiu.

396
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,610
The principal said himself

397
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,530
that I can choose the time

398
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,660
to do labor work.

399
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,600
You are my supervisor.

400
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,190
You have to take responsibility.

401
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,030
Mr. Qiu.

402
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:08,970
What happened?

403
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,110
Director.

404
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,290
Zhang Yixiang is going to do his labor work now.

405
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,220
But I have a meeting after the lunch break.

406
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,990
Zhang Yixiang.

407
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Didn't you say

408
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,390
that you can go with our schedule?

409
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,770
What are you doing now?

410
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,450
I am going with it.

411
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,430
But there's no teacher to be my supervisor.

412
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,690
Is that my problem?

413
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,400
Ms. Chen.

414
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,540
How about you supervise me?

415
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,730
What's the matter?

416
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,500
You agreed to give me punishment, right?

417
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,440
But now you won't even bother to supervise it?

418
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,810
Zhang Yixiang.

419
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,690
It's fine.

420
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,710
I don't have a meeting.

421
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,720
I can be his supervisor.

422
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,870
I can't ask you to do that, Ms. Chen.

423
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,300
Let me talk with other teachers

424
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,770
and postpone the meeting.

425
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,900
I'll be his supervisor.

426
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
Mr. Qiu.

427
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,710
It's okay.

428
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,800
I can do it.

429
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,120
Both of you want to be the hero today.

430
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,590
Ms. Chen.

431
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,360
It's time for you to choose.

432
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,580
Which one of them will be your hero?

433
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,720
Is it our director?

434
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,890
Or Mr. Qiu?

435
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,240
Make your choice.

436
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,320
Mr. Qiu.

437
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,330
Give it to me.

438
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,310
Sorry for the trouble.

439
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,120
Thank you.

440
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,830
I'm so sorry, guys.

441
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Our heroine is choosing no one today.

442
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,320
You've done your work.

443
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,880
Ms. Chen.

444
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,010
Come on.

445
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,480
Where do you need me

446
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,030
to love you today?

447
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,020
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

448
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,990
What do you mean?

449
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,230
You chose the most boring labor work

450
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,860
to make me give up early.

451
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,550
Someone was requesting labor work

452
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,950
ardently a minute ago.

453
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,750
And now he's complaining.

454
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,080
We are bringing in new air conditioners for the senior students.

455
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,190
Two air conditioners in every classroom.

456
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,460
The subsidy from the Ministry of Education is 7,000 dollars.

457
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,220
The school has 1,300 dollars.

458
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,120
And the parent association will afford the rest 20,000 dollars.

459
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,590
Does everyone approve of the decision?

460
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,200
Please raise your hand if you do.

461
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,650
Okay, pass.

462
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,750
Wait, chairwoman.

463
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,720
Why is it only for senior students?

464
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,820
Other students don't get hot?

465
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,010
It's pretty easy

466
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,480
for some people to come to the conclusion

467
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,610
that you did this because…

468
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,630
Because my son is in his senior year.

469
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,780
Right? Vice chairwoman?

470
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,290
But for many parents present here,

471
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,510
their kids are also in their senior year.

472
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,150
With the limited resource

473
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,130
and an important exam coming for the senior students,

474
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,230
I think they are the ones

475
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,950
who need air conditioning the most.

476
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,300
Next year,

477
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,230
if you still have any suggestions,

478
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,580
you can bring it up

479
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,100
when the new chairwoman comes.

480
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,990
Thank you all

481
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,130
for attending our meeting today.

482
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,570
I need to say something before you go.

483
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
My gallery is opening soon.

484
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,130
These are the invitations.

485
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,260
I want to invite you all

486
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,860
to attend the opening party.

487
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,960
Congratulations, chairwoman.

488
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,180
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

489
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,350
I waited for so long.

490
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,450
I will definitely be there.

491
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,330
Lu Xun fell in love with his student.

492
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,100
Shen Congwen did that too.

493
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,090
Ms. Chen?

494
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,930
You know what?

495
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,750
The president of France, Macron.

496
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,880
His wife was also his teacher.

497
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,200
What?

498
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,220
You didn't say a word.

499
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,860
Are you in a bad mood?

500
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,370
I'm here to supervise you,

501
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,710
not to have a chat.

502
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,490
Liar.

503
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,470
You like me.

504
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,600
Otherwise,

505
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,010
why would you volunteer to supervise me

506
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,690
when Mr. Qiu and the director were fighting for the job?

507
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,430
I'm not a princess. I don't need anyone to save me.

508
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,710
What kind of guy are you into then?

509
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,820
What about my kind?

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,810
You broke so many girls' hearts

684
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,290
by confessing to Ms. Chen.

685
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,520
Zhang Yixiang.

686
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,560
If you were just teasing her,

687
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,820
that should be enough.

688
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,760
But if you really like her,

689
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,190
don't you think that was too childish?

690
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,670
If putting up posters means I like her,

691
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,360
does it mean you like me when you ripped them off?

692
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,830
You don't really like her, do you?

693
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,140
We just have the same bangs.

694
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,610
It doesn't mean I like her, okay?

695
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,530
For real though.

696
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,010
I like her so much.

697
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,250
Do you think she can understand my feelings just through some posters?

698
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,790
The Chinese contest this year

699
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,590
will be different from before.

700
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,030
Pay attention to that if you are interested.

701
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,210
As for the details of the alterations.

702
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,480
Ms. Chen Mengyun

703
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,660
will explain to us.

704
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,410
Ms. Chen.

705
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,940
Ms. Chen.

706
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:03,160
Say yes to him.

707
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,190
Where did I leave my phone?

708
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,010
This year's Chinese contest consists of four parts.

709
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,150
A speech…

710
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,210
Zhang Yixiang.

711
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,140
What is it?

712
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,530
I want to apologize, Ms.

713
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,410
Zhang Yixiang.

714
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,210
Can I?

715
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,310
This is the morning assembly.

716
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,640
I apologize

717
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,320
for putting up posters yesterday.

718
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,480
And to the students

719
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,250
who had to clean it up with me.

720
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,600
But,

721
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,830
there is one thing

722
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,520
I'm not sorry about.

723
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:01,920
Ms. Chen.

724
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,780
I love you.

725
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,200
Zhang Yixiang.

726
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,080
What are you doing?

727
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,300
Go.

728
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,310
Help me.

729
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,540
Leave.

730
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,580
Okay.

731
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,100
Silence, everyone.

732
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,910
Okay.

733
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,320
Quiet, everyone.

734
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,040
This morning assembly is not over.

735
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,190
[Congratulations to Chairwoman Xie Shufen. From Tainan First Senior High School Parent Association.]

736
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,180
[Xie Shufen]

737
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,040
Thank you.

738
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,090
Thank you, chairwoman.

739
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,100
There's more champagne if you finished.

740
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,160
Alright. Thanks.

741
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,240
Congratulations, chairwoman.

742
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,920
Congratulations.

743
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,260
Thank you.

744
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,980
You can take your time with this series.

745
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,120
There are lots of details.

746
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,630
Okay. Thank you.

747
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:39,950
Mrs. Feng.

748
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,370
You are here.

749
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,590
Congratulations, Mrs. Zhang.

750
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,520
Everyone.

751
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,530
Here.

752
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,750
Let me introduce you.

753
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,890
This is the new member of our parent association, Mrs. Feng.

754
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,200
Hello, Mrs. Feng.

755
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,870
Welcome.

756
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:57,960
Nice to meet you.

757
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,640
Her daughter Feng Wenhui just enrolled

758
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,320
in class A, grade one this year.

759
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,790
Let's welcome her.

760
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,680
Welcome.

761
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,990
Thank you, everyone.

762
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,410
Thank you.

763
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:07,920
Cheers.

764
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,720
Cheers.

765
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,600
Welcome.

766
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,940
Let me show you around.

767
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,470
Who is this Mrs. Feng?

768
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,690
The chairwoman is particularly nice to her.

769
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,950
Yeah.

770
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,010
The chairwoman's rarely so nice to people.

771
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,270
She might be someone important.

772
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,360
Yeah.

773
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,210
Who is she?

774
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,350
Ms. Chen.

775
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,040
I love you.

776
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,330
You've never been in love, right?

777
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,150
Mrs. Feng.

778
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,910
You have good taste.

779
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,680
The value of this painting

780
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,200
doubles up many times in the last two years.

781
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,970
It's just my hobby.

782
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,620
You are being too modest.

783
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,090
You are professional.

784
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,370
Mrs. Feng is joining the election for the chairwoman?

785
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,470
Are you kidding me?

786
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,110
I'm the vice chairwoman.

787
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,750
I should be the next chairwoman.

788
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,170
She just came into the association.

789
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,350
What are you doing?

790
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,110
I'm going to ask the chairwoman.

791
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,880
There are so many of us here.

792
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,850
She should be the last one to be the chairwoman.

793
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:46,950
I just heard about it.

794
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,630
I don't know if it's true.

795
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,570
Why is my daughter sending so many messages to me?

796
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,660
It's weird.

797
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,680
Might be something at school.

798
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,230
What is it?

799
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,570
Oh my god.

800
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,000
What is it?

801
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,240
I'll send the clip to our group chat.

802
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,950
These young people are bold.

803
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,010
-He's kissing the teacher.
-What's he doing?

804
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,410
He kissed the teacher.

805
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,550
He was kissing her.

806
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,980
I can't believe it.

807
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,340
Which classroom is she in?

808
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,470
Chairwoman.

809
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,030
Do you want me to dig through the whole school to find her?

810
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,000
Chairwoman.

811
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,010
Her class will be over soon.

812
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,120
Chairwoman.
