In family psychology,

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,080
there's this scapegoat theory.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,020
It refers to the fact that

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,250
one person is often blamed or shamed

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,190
for all the issues that arise within

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,020
dysfunctional households.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,700
For example,

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,630
this person may become a troublemaker

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,100
and cause trouble all around.

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,370
But this problematic behavior

12
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,930
-may succeed in distracting
-It's open-mic.

13
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,230
-the entire family
-You want to major in psychology now?

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,640
from their disputes

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,430
-with each other.
-No, Senior.

16
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,940
It's about that back stabber of Miss Chen.

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,210
For example,

18
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,080
one couple's at odds for a long time.

19
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,080
The wife has a lot of frustrations,

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,280
but her husband has no way

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,550
to deal with the overflowing emotions.

22
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,480
So after they have a child one day,

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,790
when the wife is upset, she hides and falls into tears.

24
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,390
The tears fall from her eyes,

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,760
but they drip into the heart

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,220
of the child who takes everything in stride.

27
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,130
Over time,

28
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,030
the child's personality is twisted.

29
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,470
But it's all because of the parents' unhappy marriage.

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,970
I once met a family

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,930
in such a situation.

34
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,740
Can I have a moment?

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,940
So sending that email to the principal…

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,310
Exposing the fact that your mom used to be a homewrecker

37
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,440
to Xu Keren's mother…

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,579
And making it go viral that you and

39
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,950
Miss Chen are siblings…

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,380
Are all done by Xia Yuxin?

41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,090
Mengyun and I are not siblings.

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,250
The point is, she knew your mom was lying to Miss Chen like that.

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,260
How did she know?

44
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,690
I once saw her with Miss Chen

45
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,890
at the cafeteria.

46
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,329
I'm sure Mengyun didn't tell Xia Yuxin

47
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,560
about it.

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,760
But the one who messed with your mother

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,770
and kept Mrs. Feng from winning

50
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,300
might be her.

51
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,340
What do you know?

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,340
Care to explain?

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,210
Whether you have a problem with the chairwoman,

54
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,420
like you hate her and want revenge,

55
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,590
or you want to help Miss Chen out,

56

even it's for Zhang Yixiang,

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,120
you can just spit it out now.

We will help you.

59
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,290
It's not me.

60
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,830
Then how can you explain

61
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,460
that when the email's sent,

62
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,200
why you were in the activity room?

63
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,200
And why was that email sent

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,170
from there?

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,470
I don't know.

66
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,940
I don't know.

68
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,670
I don't know.

69

You can trust us, Xia Yuxin.

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,450
Director,

71
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,579
can I speak with her alone?

72
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,329
I believe you didn't

73
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,430
do those things.

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,829
But Mrs. Feng lost

75
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,940
because you threatened her with the

76
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,770
chairwoman's relationship with my dad,

77
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,710
right?

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,470
When I first saw the picture of your father and the chairwoman,

79
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,410
I never thought I could use it that way.

80
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,880
I wasn't trying to help you out.

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,180
I just wanted to see Zhang Yixiang's mom lose.

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,680
It's a shame I wasn't at the voting scene.

83
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,660
It must be fun

84
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,880
to witness her failure.

85
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,380
So when did Xia Yuxin

86
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,450
start tutoring?

87
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,450
About a month ago.

88
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,630
I overheard

89
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,790
Xu Keren and Tangtang talking.

90
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,890
But I have to say she's really good at that.

91
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,990
Xu Keren made a lot of progress in the last exam.

92
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,970
Impressive. A double spy.

93
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,130
Spying on you under the employ of your mom

94
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,440
while stabbing her as Xu Keren's mom ordered.

95
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,270
Guys, look.

96
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,280
Except for Zhang Yixiang, his gang, and me,

97
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,250
who else knows that the chairwoman bought you off?

98
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,680
You don't have a computer at home.

99
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,650
So when you need to use the computer,

100
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,850
you always go to the activity room.

101
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,060
Except for the club activities,

102
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,990
what time do you usually be there?

103
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,560
Zhang Yixiang told me

104
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,159
how the hackers do it.

105
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,930
Besides using a floating IP address

106
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,400
as a cover,

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,560
they can also set the time of sending the email in advance,

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,500
right?

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,970
You mean someone set me up?

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,200
That person knew I would be there,

111
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,340
so he or she made use

112
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,650
of the security footage

113
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,270
of my appearance at that time.

114
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,580
That person might know about your deal with the chairwoman

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,350
and thought you have a motive and took advantage of that.

116
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,680
Except for Zhang Yixiang and his gang,

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,180
who else

118
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,050
knew you're always there at a fixed time?

119
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,300
Just them.

120
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,490
Hey.

121
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,360

What's this?

123
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,500
Did someone put a price on my head?

124
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,000
Is that sarcasm?

125
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,740
Why are you the sender of that email?

126
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
I cracked the account and the password.

127

Turns out it's your mailbox.

128

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,250
Weren't you angry?

173
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,580
Mom was…

174
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,560
Of course.

175
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,590
How could I not be angry?

176
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
But I was young back then.

177
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,730
You know, hormones.

178
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,700
I thought, fine, bring it on.

179
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,100
She'd choose me in the end, anyway.

180
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,440
And I was right.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
We got married, right?

182
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,010
That's because Professor Chen was…

183
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,580
Even if Professor Chen hadn't had an accident,

184
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,840
your mom would've still chosen me.

185
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,420
Do you think

186
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,590
your mom had to marry me

187
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,220
because she was pregnant with you?

188
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,130
Yeah.

189
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,030
Am I that unattractive in your eyes?

190
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,500
That's not what I mean.

191
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,730
I just can't figure out why.

192
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,400
-She's...
-You really should

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,850
Were you two out drinking?

195
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,910
Honey,

196
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,550
you went shopping again.

197
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,290
What occasion is that for?

198
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,860
Is it my dad or Mr. Feng?

199

Don't drink if you can't handle your booze.

200

You're so drunk.

201
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,160
Help your dad take off his jacket.

202
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,140
Not like that. I'll do it.

203
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,500
Go get him some water.

204
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,040
Okay.

205
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,550
All right.

This arm.

207
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,080
Got it.

208
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,750
It stinks.

209
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,150
Don't lie down. You're filthy.

210
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,700
I'll help you change your pajamas.

211
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,900

212
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,510

What is wrong with you?

218
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,740
After what happened,

219
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,570
you still want to go to the celebration?

220
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,100
They'll give you the Distinguished Alumni Award.

221
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,940
We should be there.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,100
You didn't tell them that I'm a failure?

223
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,040
My wife is leaving me

224
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,380
and they say my son is a secret child.

Distinguished alumni?

226
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm nothing but a failure.

227

A failed alumnus.

228
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,880
My wife is never that kind of pathetic woman

229
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,110
who is led by the nose.

230
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,020
If she hadn't wanted you,

If she hadn't wanted to marry me,

234
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,850
she just wouldn't have done it

even if there is no road ahead.

Miss Chen, can you answer my question?

you're siblings before

275

Zhang kept bullying

276
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,880
and sexually harassing you.

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,920
He even kissed you at a morning meeting

and made a public display of affection with posters.

Is it true?

280

Why show this to me?

313
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,260
I didn't take any of these.

314
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,329
But my mom went to Mengyun's that day.

So you were not the snitch?

316
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,910
I did follow you, yes.

317
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,640
But none of these were taken by me.

318
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,310
I didn't tell your mom, either.

were all done by the same person.

That person has long planned to set me up.

324

You didn't take these?

325
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,160
So where did you get these?

326
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,790
I went out with the chairwoman one day,

327
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,730

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,400
I would like to introduce our club,

343
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,070

344
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,130
C'mon Play Up.

345
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,600
Our mission is to

346
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,900
have fun.

347
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,230

breaking up scene,

352
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,990
and all kinds of things at school

353
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,190
can be brought to a whole new level here at CPU.

354
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,460
Senior, you are too much.

355
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,890
Didn't you guys agree not to go see it?

356
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,960
How could you go there and take a video?

357
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,590
Over there.

358
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey, take a picture.

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,330
-Gross.
-Take a picture of the letters.

360
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,430
I saw it.

361
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,700
Wait a minute.

362
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
What's wrong with you?

363
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,240
Do you have a thing for the sex doll?

364
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,570
No, no, no. Wait.

365
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,580
Lovelyyyyy.

366
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,220
What?

367
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,920
It's the same.

368
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,190
It has the same name as the author

369
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,420
of the article I was reading.

370
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,320
See for yourself.

371
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,150
Is it?

372
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,820
With five Ys?

373
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,530
Exactly the same name with the author

374
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,660
of that article that Xinyi and I

375
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,470
usually read.

376
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,370
It can't be the same person, right?

377
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,240
The date.

378
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,740
What is the date of this video?

379
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,140
October 19th.

380

October 19th.

He broke up with his girlfriend that day.

383
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,050
"I said goodbye to her by the river.

384
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,760
I turned around and walked away

385
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,030
without looking back.

386
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,050
I know this relationship has come to an end.

387
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,350
There's no way to get it back.

388
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,760
In the river of love,

389
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,290
we're all drifting.

390
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,470
I don't know where she'll drift to."

You're going anyway.

393
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,700
They want to see me hide at home.

394
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,800
But they won't.

395
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,830
I'll lose if I don't go.

396
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,340
I will not lose to these people.

397
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,940
That's the woman I married to.

398
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,970
Wonderful.

399
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,180
What about you?

400
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,950
Are you sure you don't want to go?

401
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,840
Why should I?

402
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,050
To be the laughingstock

403
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,720
who was cheated on by his wife?

404
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,550
So humiliating. I won't do it.

405
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,860
If you have to go, do it yourself.

Welcome to the CPU Research Club.

Excuse me, sir.

412
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,040
Could you tell me how long

413
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,610
you usually keep the security footage?

414
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,570
May I see it?

415
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,750
That one?

416
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,280
It's fake.

417
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,080
What?

418
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,210
Look, there are no wires.

419
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,350
Sorry to interrupt. Thank you.

Zhang Yixiang,

423
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,960
I'm trying to get the security footage near the

424
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,300
drainage ditch where the sex doll was discovered.

425
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,340
When you hear this, give me a call.

426
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,940
Isn't she the incestuous teacher?

427
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,720
Keep your voice down.

428
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,050
Didn't you say she resigned? Why is she still here?

429
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,890
Keep it down, okay?

430
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,420
This is inappropriate.

431
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,030
Didn't you say you weren't coming today?

Hi, Yuwei's mom.

Director Li.

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:17,600
Good to see you.

437
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,340
Thanks.

438
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,640
Have you met before?

439
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,970
Let me introduce.

440
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,100
This is Miss Chen Mengyun.

441
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,110
She was a teacher of Class 2C,

442
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,380
and is also my girlfriend.

443
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,020
Recently,

444
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,650
the personal attacks

445
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,920
and rumors

446
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,260
have been causing her distress.

447
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,960
So, she resigned to rest at home.

448
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,290
I think now is the right time

449
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,290
to make it public,

450
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,800
so I can protect her better.

451
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,270
And we're getting married soon.

452
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,030
No wonder you sent flowers to Miss Chen.

453
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,300
You hid it well.

454
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,670
Miss Chen, getting married is a good thing.

455
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,810
Why did you resign?

456
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,670
Congratulations!

457
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,170
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

458
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,840
I didn't tell her I wanted to

459
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,480
announce it, so it is sort of sudden.

460
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,680
Maybe she's a little shy.

461
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,650
If you'll excuse me first.

462
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,680
Enjoy yourselves.

I'm helping you.

466

You can hide today, but you can't hide forever.

467
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,800
You're going to let people gossip behind

468
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,900
your back for the rest of your life?

469
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,430
I have resigned.

470
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,000
I will not hear these words anymore.

471
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,270
It's all over the Internet.

472
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,140
So what if you resigned here?

473
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,640
If you don't clear that up,

474
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,940
which school do you think will hire you?

475
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,110
So I have to marry you

476
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,110
to clear things up?

477
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm in a relationship with Zhang Yixiang.

478
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,910
It's not a rumor.

479
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,410
But marrying you is.

480
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,930
You said you wanted to see me.

481
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,370

Principal of Huaqing University, Mr. Zhang Guoyang,

495

496
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,110
But we invited his wife,

who is also the chairwoman of our parent association,

Please welcome Ms. Xie.

501
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,130
She had the face to receive the award?

502
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,340
So typical. She is Xie Shufen.

503

There's no way she'd miss a highlight moment like this.

-she's taking the last chance to make an appearance.
-I'd like to say a few words on his behalf

and even you now.

853
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,290
I owe you an apology.

854
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,680
I'm sorry.

855
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,900
Thank you.

856
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,070
Thank you for saving my son.

857
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,710
My only son.

858
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,690
I didn't save him because of you.

859
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,790
I know.

860
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,110
Did you love my dad?

861
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,280
I did.

862
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,160
Just like Yixiang's love for you now.

863
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,550
Pure,

864
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,190
strong,

865
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,330
and persistent.

866
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,700
But eventually, your father

867
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,470
didn't choose me.

868
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,820
In fact, we had already broken up.

869
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,790
But your mother heard

870
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,390
I was pregnant.

871
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,090
She thought it was your father's,

872
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,870
so she wanted a divorce

873
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,100
and tried to kill herself several times.

874
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,270
No matter how much he explained, she just wouldn't believe it.

875

[Tomb of Father Chen Shize and Mother Xu Liwen]

876
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,920
Your father told me several times

877
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,790
that the thing he concerned most

878
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,020
was what you think of him.

879
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,540
He was worried

880
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,780
that you'd look down on him.

881
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,450
Your father had always felt sorry about what happened.

Lift it up like a smile and swoosh.

885
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:55,960
Lift it up.

886
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,760
It's your turn.

887
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,060
Have a try.

888
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,120
Imagine this is the darkest place.

889
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,130
Then smile and swoosh.

890
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,500
Lift it up.

891
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,040
Okay.

892
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,340
-Wow. It's getting brighter.
-Okay.

893
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,780
-Then gently.
-It's lit up a little.

894
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,350
Okay, now let's imagine.

[Six years later]

896
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,250
In fact, programming and writing are alike.

897
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,290
Actually, you can think a programmer

898
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,760
as a writer.

899
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,520
So does anyone know

900
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,390
what capabilities do we need?

901
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,030
No one?

902
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,500
Fortunately, no one knows.

903
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,490
Or I wouldn't be the lecturer today.

904
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,640
We need the ability to combine and search.

905
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,140
Therefore, we need to learn the basic syntax,

906
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,940
logic syntax and how to use the kit.

907
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,210
Once you master these,

908
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,640
you'll be able to use them

909
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,080
in new programming languages easily.

910
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,260
Okay, everyone.

911
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,330
Any questions?

912
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,110
Please.

913
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:21,500
Why are spaces used

914
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,770
to indent in Python?

915
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,040
Probably because it wants some space.

916
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,480
No, I'm kidding.

917
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,080
Because when spaces are used,

918
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,610
actually it's for readability.
