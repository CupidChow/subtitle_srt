If I find out you're picking on Miss Chen again

174
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,260
you'll see.

175
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,880
Don't you hate her?

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,780
I hate her too.

177
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm on your side.

178
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Together we can...

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,020
Who wants to be together with you?

180
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,490
You'd better figure it out.

181
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,660
She...

182
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,090
She is my toy.

183
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,230
You don't get to play with her.

184
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,170
I'm not the Chinese teacher

185
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,600
of your class anymore.

186
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,660
I don't care what you do in your class.

187
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,210
But please don't harass

188
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,390
and threaten my students.

189
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,140
-Humph. Let's go.
-Liu You.

190
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,150
Come here.

191
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,330
What are you...

192
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,050
What are you waiting for?

193
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,640
Come and give me a hand.

194
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,940
Oh, yes.

195
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,130
Push it over there.

196
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,850
One, two, three.

197
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,590
Come here and push with me.

198
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,370
Come on. Try harder.

199
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,930
One, two, three.

200
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,500
Why do you stop? Go on.

201
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,900
Hello, everyone.

202
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,080
Welcome to After School with Qiqi.

203
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,560
Today, I want to introduce our club,

204
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,990
CPU C'mon Play Up,

205
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,550
which means to get playing.

206
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,980
We have lots of fun things here.

207
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,010
Board games rest area.

208
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,860
And,

209
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,280
video games area.

210
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,640
How can I play up if there's nobody?

211
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,370
Has the club been dissolved?

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,340
Baby, I'm doing a livestream.

213
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,830
Where have you been?

214
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,970
I'm exhausted.

215
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,840
Why is your coat so dirty?

216
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,270
Yeah.

217
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,830
Why is your coat so dirty?

218
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,350
Do you like the clock I gave you?

219
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,580
Does it have problems connecting to the Internet?

220
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,930
There's no problem.

221
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,690
But isn't it expensive?

222
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,820
No.

223
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,290
I'm glad it's useful to you.

224
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,430
It's a waste if I keep it at home

225
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,350
for displaying.

226
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,980
Come.

227
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,950
Thanks.

228
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,370
Didn't you say it was messy here?

229
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,590
I think it's well organized.

230
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,680
So Zhang Yixiang was cleaning

231
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,020
the bakery classroom all day?

232
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,370
It's sissy.

233
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,510
Why did he join the Bakery Club?

234
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,240
I didn't say he had joined the club, did I?

235
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,010
Then why did he clean the bakery classroom?

236
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,610
Yeah, why?

237
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,440
Today, we're going to make cookies.

238
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,990
In front of you are the materials,

239
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,430
cream, cake flour, brown sugar,

240
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,560
and eggs.

241
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,370
The cooking utensils we need are

242
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,630
motor-stirrers, biscuit molds,

243
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,940
and baking paper.

244
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,500
Let me take out the baking paper first.

245
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,210
Let's help Miss Chen to look for it.

246
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,010
OK.

247
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,180
Miss Chen.

248
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,820
Miss Chen, look.

249
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,460
Thanks.

250
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:22,110
[Placement of Items]

251
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,100
The biscuit molds are under the brown cabinet,

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,720
on the first storage box.

253
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,620
As for the cake flour you are looking for,

254
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,260
I've put it here.

255
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,420
Remember it.

256
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,780
And the most important thing is,

257
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,060
the ointment for burns.

258
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,870
I feel that you get burned very often.

259
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,000
Remember to apply it.

260
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,970
But I hope you won't need it.

261
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,740
Miss Chen.

262
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,010
Miss Chen.

263
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,250
And the next?

264
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,370
Next, put the cream in front of you

265
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,050
in the big basin.

266
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,190
And slowly press it until it melts.

267
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,870
Director Li.

268
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,510
Director Li.

269
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,270
Miss Chen, morning.

270
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,980
Morning.

271
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,790
Don't do that to the instructor,

272
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,510
and to my girlfriend either.

273
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,650
Here you are. I made it yesterday.

274
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,620
Thanks. Sorry to trouble you.

275
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,930
Take it as a return gift for the clock.

276
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,510
How do you like it?

277
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,890
Where is my cookie?

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,160
Morning, Miss Chen, Mr. Li.

279
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,130
[Miss Chen]

280
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,010
Zhang Yixiang, see you in the tutoring room at 6:00 PM.

281
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:20,900
[Tutoring Room]

282
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,980
You could have just told me

283
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,580
instead of leaving a note.

284
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,720
I learned it from you.

285
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,410
What if I didn't see it?

286
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,340
Then that's it.

287
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,460
Didn't someone say she was too busy to spare any time?

288
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,230
So you don't want my help now?

289
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,130
I'm just saying.

290
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,180
You're hot-tempered.

291
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,040
Let me make it clear. This isn't extra coaching.

292
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,970
You can ask me questions.

293
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,110
But I won't give you lessons.

294
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,080
I'll only supervise your evening study.

295
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,300
So you'll still have to take

296
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,390
your Chinese classes.

297
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,360
Don't skip them.

298
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,910
If by any chance I know you've skipped them,

299
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,420
our ninth lesson is over.

300
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,480
We'll only continue if you say yes.

301
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Fine.

302
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,690
Anyway, I have nowhere to go if I skip the classes.

303
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,290
And don't threaten my students again.

304
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,760
That was because Xu Keren was annoying.

305
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,520
Moreover,

306
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,910
don't play tricks on other teachers.

307
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,930
Why do you care about them?

308
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,440
They're not nice to you.

309
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,310
OK. I agree.

310
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
Wait.

311
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,990
Are you afraid I would tease Mr. Li...

312
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,710
Do you like him?

313
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,700
Will you start your evening study?

314
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,480
Take this seat.

315
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,700
No.

316
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,400
Am I that terrifying?

317
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,670
Why do you have to sit far away from me?

318
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,330
Thanks for helping me clean the bakery classroom.

319
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,800
You're actually easygoing.

320
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,100
Why do you

321
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,780
make yourself look so difficult usually?

322
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,900
Why do you go against your mom?

323
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,490
Forget it.

324
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,850
You give up so soon?

325
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,200
You can talk whenever you want.

326
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,180
I want to talk now.

327
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,210
In my third grade of primary school,

328
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,910
I got a chance to participate in the science exhibition

329
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,760
on behalf of the school.

330
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,650
When I was elected,

331
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,410
I was so happy.

332
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,190
I spent a whole month

333
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,620
preparing that work,

334
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,890
but you know what my mom did?

335
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,330
She...

336
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,610
She bribed the judges to get me first place.

337
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,410
And even worse,

338
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,600
the student elected by the teacher

339
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,500
to participate in the competition

340
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,180
wasn't even me.

341
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,880
It was Xia Yuxin.

342
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,970
Since then,

343
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,040
