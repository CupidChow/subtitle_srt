[Is Scorpio the sign of vengeance? Horoscope Expert Bai Yu]

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,940
I think when people hear the word Scorpio,

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,770
there is always a stereotype in their mind.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,510
That is, Scorpio people are very revengeful.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,440
They have a repressed character.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,710
They can endure harm

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,490
much better than ordinary people.

12
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,580
They will become more sensitive
when they are hurt.

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,720
The memory of being hurt in their hearts

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,230
is heavier than that in ordinary people's hearts.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,460
Therefore, Scorpio people want to
become more powerful.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,260
In this way, they look more like
avengers from hell.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,010
Hello, I'm Li Dawei, director of Office of Academic Affairs.

18
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,950
I'm Chen Mengyun.

19
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,970
-Nice to meet you...
-Nice to meet you.

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,910
In addition, Scorpio people have very
strong self-esteem.

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,350
They don't want to acknowledge that
they are hurt.

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,090
If they acknowledge that they are hurt,

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,160
it means acknowledging that they are
not powerful enough.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,330
They will definitely be hurt a second time.

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,100
When Scorpio people are hurt,

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,400
they only want to find a way out of their plight.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,970
A desperate situation will give them
a chance of rebirth.

28
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,300
In their hearts, the sufferings will

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,840
accumulate and become a volcano,

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080

Her son is Zhang Yixiang from Class A, Grade 3.

40

He is very outstanding in his studies.

41
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,539
This year, he is a top player among
the stars of our school.

42

Although he is very lively,

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,110
he is not in an urgent situation.

44

you don't have to be in such a hurry.

46

I can make a promise now.

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,990
But there are some domestic affairs
I have to deal with.

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,920
Maybe I will report for duty one week after the school starts.

50
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,590
After the school starts...

51

Yixiang didn't go home last night.

170
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,960
Did he stay at your house?

171
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,290
You seduced a high school student
who is underage.

172
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,940
Do you know what you did is against the law?

173
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,740
Are you so sure

174
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,550
that Zhang Yixiang and I had sex?

175
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,190
Well, yes.

176
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,540
You are that kind of person.

177
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,310
You will feel that other people will do the same.

178
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,030
For you, it's not a big deal

179
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,050
that a teacher and a student have sex.

180
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,990
He is just a child.

181
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,010
How can you do this to him?

182
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,320
At that time, I was also a child.

183
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,420
Didn't you ask me to conspire with you

184
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,810
and cover up your secret love affair with my father?

185
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,130
At that time,

186
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,040
could you understand what happened
between you and my teacher?

187
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,000
He was an experienced and mature male professor.

188
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,350
I was a female student who had never stepped into the society

189
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,050
and who admired him like an idiot.

190
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,740
Who was seducing who?

191
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,810
What you are doing now

192
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
is exactly the same as what your father did.

193
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
Please don't compare me with my father.

194
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,490
And don't slander the one you like.

195
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,550
You don't know at all

196
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,109
what kind of person your father is.

197
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,550
Did you try to make Zhang Yixiang believe you

198
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,020
by wearing

199
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,990
that innocent look?

200
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,930
I won't let you go on

201
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,950
sowing discord between me and my son.

202
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,180
Nor will I let you go on

203
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,319
using Yixiang as a tool to take revenge on me.

204
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,839
You can't take him away from me.

205
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,570
You are so eager to say these words to me.

206
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,880
Doesn't it mean that I have already taken him away from you?

207
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,330
List your conditions.

208
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,220
Tell me.

209
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,990
What should I do so that you can leave Yixiang alone?

210
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,870
So you've been taking advantage of me.

211
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,630
Yixiang.

212
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,150
You've been taking advantage of me,

213
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,910
haven't you?

214
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,780
You've been cheating me.

215
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,720
You were close to me only to take advantage of me?

216
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,610
You want to take revenge on my mother, right?

217
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,000
Speak!

218
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
Yixiang.

219
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,680
Senior.

220
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,080
Senior, please don't be like this.

221
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,420
Is Zhang Yixiang sorry to you?

222
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,560
Senior, let's listen to her explanation first.

223
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,370
Among us, she is in a very good
relationship with Zhang Yixiang.

224
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,540
She can't sell her friend for her own benefit.

225
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,100
There are two possibilities.

226
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,240
One is that she might be secretly in love with Zhang Yixiang,
so she is unhappy about his love affair with Miss Chen.

227
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,580
That's why she became a spy.

228
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,260
Otherwise, she is unhappy that Zhang Yixiang's score

229
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,240
was the highest in this mock examination. That's why she did this to him.

230
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,380
Why did you do this to him? Tell us!

231
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,480
I did this for the money. Okay?

232
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,910
Such a poor reason!

233
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,460
You sold a friend for money.

234
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,020
How can you do such a thing?

235
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,070
Senior, you must be joking.

236
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,170
Joking?

237
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,970
Joking about such a thing?

238
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,870
Do you really think

239
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,760
you are all Zhang Yixiang's friends?

240
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,030
What are you talking about?

241
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,920
We grew up together.

242
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,560
Have you never regarded him as a friend?

243
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,630
I'll forget it if you did this for another reason.

244
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,640
What the heck is this?

245
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,370
For money. Is there something wrong with you?

246
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,800
Are you really short of money?

247
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,220
How much money did his mother give you?

248
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,070
Does your mother know that you
debased yourself in such a way?

249
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,750
I know money might be

250
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,970
nothing for you.

251
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,020
When you know that

252
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,450
I have to earn so little money,

253
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,250
you must feel that I'm very funny.

254
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:57,880
Senior...

255
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,730
Yes, I am so funny.

256
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,290
But at least, I know I'm funny.

257
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,720
What about you?

258
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,030
Do you really think that it is your choice

259
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,710
to be friends with Zhang Yixiang?

260
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,600
It's Zhang Yixiang's choice as well?

261
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,150
Is it not?

262
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,970

of you out so that you can

265
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,600
be friends with Zhang Yixiang.

266
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,980
You became friends with him

267
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,790
because of your parents' wealth and social status.

268
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,800
As to me, it was because of my ability.

269

That's the only difference.

are thinking through quarreling.

About why he was upset yesterday.

404

Was it because he was angry with Xia Yuxin,

or he had a fight with Miss Chen?

I needed it myself,

00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,770
just to help your friends.

507
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,490
So I think you are very kind.

508
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,210
-Why are you late?
-Why didn't you answer your phone?

509
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,010
-I left my phone at home.
-They did…

510
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,930
Give me your hand.

511
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,480
I'll count to three,

512
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,950
and we'll let go together.

513
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,770
One, two, three.

514
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,590
You are amazing!

515
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,270
Hello?

516
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
Mengyun!

517
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,490
Chen Mengyun!

518
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,930
I like you.

519
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,170
I'm not afraid of being flunked out,

520
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,350
and I'm not afraid of being kicked out of my house.

521
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,950
But I can't live without you.

522
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,010
Even if you are using me, it doesn't matter.

523
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,030
Although it's painful to know the truth,

524
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,150
it makes me realize

525
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,620
how much

526
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,010
I really like you.

527
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,030
Mengyun,

528
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,680
I like you.

529
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,890
I like you

530
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,330
very, very much!

531
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,720
I'm afraid you won't talk to me anymore.

532
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,750
You've made enough trouble because of me.

533
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,850
I can't let it continue anymore.

534
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,990
Have you thought about that

535
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,500
when you were using me?

536
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,100
Why are you leaving me now?

537
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,170
It wasn't real.

538
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,900
You are merely having a hard time accepting it.

539
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,620
It's not love.

540
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,130
I started to worry, fear,

541
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,500
and escape because I fell in love with you.

542
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,010
I even tried to find excuses

543
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,690
to stop myself from falling for you.

544
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,760
But you know it clearly how special

545
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,280
and important you are to me.

546
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,830
Why are you still fooling yourself?

547
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,320
You are only a senior high student.

548
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,040
Do you know how old I am?

549
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,090
Does it matter?

550
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,980
Love is love.

551
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,710
It doesn't need any reasons.

552
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,020
I don't care what others think about me.

553
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,950
I'm not afraid of my mother.

554
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:48,750
And I'm not afraid of falling in love with you

555
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,300
or what my future will turn out to be.

556
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,740
I'm only afraid that you'd leave me.

557
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,700
I love you.

558
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,160
It doesn't bother you if I'm using you?

559
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,340
Even if you are using me,

560
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,730
I don't care.

561
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,720
I'm not afraid of anything.
