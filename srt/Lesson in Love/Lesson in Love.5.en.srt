175

it will collapse.

176

178
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,040
Nothing.

179

180

181
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,850
OK. Then I'll read the books while waiting.

mean the success of life.

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,030
what's going on here?

344
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,100
I asked Miss Chen to help me with my lesson.

345
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,940
I've already told you

346
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,140
to stay away from my son.

347
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,780
Don't you understand?

348
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,600
I said I asked Miss Chen to help me with my lesson.

349
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,150
Don't you understand?

350
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,540
Scold me if you want,

351
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,410
but keep Miss Chen out of this.

352
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,810
All you want of me is to get good grades.

353
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,480
Does it matter where I study

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,320
or who I study with?

355
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,720
Go back to the night self-learning!

356
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,620
No.

I will take first place in the mock exam.

Don't you want me to take first place?

As long as you promise that

361
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,670
you won't interfere with us,

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,670
I will do as you wish.

363
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,990
Let's look at Example 8.

Suppose there are balls of different light signs in one box

The whole school has known you took first place.

371
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,700
What did Xia Yuxin say?

372
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,670
Nothing serious.

373
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,510
We had a deal to have a fair competition,

374
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,970
so she didn't want me to reserve my strength.

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,640
So this weekend…

376
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm free this weekend.

377
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,880
Then go to practice driving with me.

378
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,480

I'm turning 18 now.

I want to get the driver's license.

383
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,530
There's no need to practice if you can drive.

I'm not good at it,

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,770
Thank you, Miss Chen.

512
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,940
Zhang Yixiang will go surfing with us.

513
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,690
You're home.

514
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,370
Didn't you have dinner?

515
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,070
I had no money.

516
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,710
I paid tuition and incidental fees this afternoon.

517
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,370
Did you receive your scholarship?

518
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,310
The exam just ended. How could I receive it so fast?

519
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,180
And…

520
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,150
Never mind.

521
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,950
What happened?

522
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,560
Well, I can't know anything unless you tell me.

523
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,350
Even if I receive the scholarship,

524
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,560
the money is not enough for us.

525
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,090
How come?

526
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,260
Don't we rely on it every semester?

527
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,790
I didn't rank number one this time.

528
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,730
How could this be possible?

529
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,270
Why was it impossible?

530
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,400
I was asked to take pictures and follow someone.

531
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,770
I couldn't even attend all my classes.

532
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,040
How could I rank first in the exam?

533
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,340
How?

534
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,740
Do you think your daughter is a genius?

535
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,340
Well, you're talking about

536
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,410
Yixiang's mother?

537
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,980
You… Didn't you say after school,

538
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,480
you just needed to message her?

539
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,880
Why did you need to take pictures and follow someone?

540
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,580
What on earth happened?

541
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,390

[Zhang Yixiang]

544
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,930
Don't you want to hang out with me?

545
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,190
I think going surfing with your classmates

546
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,200
is more interesting than hanging out with your teacher.

547
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,140
I think it's up to me

548
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,180
to decide which is better.

549
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,240
So whether to go surfing or not,

550
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,110
it's also up to you, I think.

551
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,120
So if I don't go with them,

552
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,220
you will hang out with me, won't you?

553
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,190
Then about the plan of the overseas study tour
during the summer vacation,

554
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,760
we'll take Mrs. Feng's advice.

555
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,430
Does anyone have questions?

556
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
Next, let's talk about an interim motion.

557
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,130
The original expert of the admission seminar,

558
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,300
which is going to be held next week, can't make it

559
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,710
because something just came up.

560
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,340
I've found another expert.

561
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,850
According to the expertise of that expert,

562
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
the topic of the seminar will be adjusted.

563
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,820
The seminar is going to be held next week.

564
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,120
Won't it be troublesome?

565
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,850
She just decided to change it.

566
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,860
If the expert is not available, find a new one.

567
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,090
Why do we need to change the topic?

568
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,060
What topic do you want to change, Chairwoman?

569
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,420
Senior, you have to make sure.

570
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,550
He had a stomach flu an hour before departure.

571
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,080
He'd better be honest.

572
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,390
So Senior always go back on his word.

573
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,890
Is he really going to date Miss Chen?

574
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,920
Do I need to put it straightforwardly?

575
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,860
Keep your eyes on him. Don't keep chatting.

576
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,400
Sorry, Senior, I indeed have no idea.

577
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,900
He showed up.

578
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,840

-No.

00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,450
Give me your hands.

681
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,020
Close your eyes if you're afraid.

682
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,890
After I count to three,

683
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:21,990
let go of your hands with me.

684
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,790
OK.

685
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,830
One, two, three.

686
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,360
[You got 1 new mail]

687
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,560
[Zhang Yixiang and Ms. Chen date in private]

688
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,760
What are you doing?

689
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,930
Don't worry. I won't post it online.

690
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,460
Really?

691
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,160
Yep.

692
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,270
So low?

693
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,670
It's not OK.

694
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,200
No. I think it's beautiful.

695
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,510
And there's a background.

696
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:17,680
Take another picture.

697
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,420
Alright. I'll make a concession and take another picture with you.

698
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,750
One, two, three.

699
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,390
What do you think?

700
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,260
There's a claw crane.

701
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,170
Do you think this is real?

702
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,490
Alright. Let's try another one.

703
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,250
Hey.

704
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,400
You just gave up?

705
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,600
It's impossible to get anything.

706
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,620
Amazing!

707
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,520
I never got anything.

708
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,760
Do you come here often?

709
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,090
This is my first time.

710
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,600
Seriously?

711
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,660
Yes… No.

712
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,670
What about you?

713
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,540
Open it now. Let's try it out.

714
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,840
Is this usable?

715
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,690
There's an instruction manual and numbers.

716
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,660
Let me make a call.

717
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,390
Did I get through?

718
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,120
I don't know. I'm waiting.

719
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,190
Let me take a look.

720
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:49,630
Enter.

721
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,570
Hello.

722
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,160
Hi.

723
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,300
Phones for kids could make you so happy.

724
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,900
I didn't expect you to be so childish.

725
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,940
Today I saw you in casual wear for the first time.

726
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,640
You don't look like a child anymore.

727
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,020
Let me know if you think I'm handsome.

728
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,580
Huh? What are you talking about?

729
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,890
You're so boring!

730
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,250
You're so handsome.

731
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,870
You can transfer here and go home.

732
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,140
I'll walk you home.

733
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,380
No, thanks. I can go by myself.

734
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,110
You need me.

735
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,480
Your bus is here. Bye-bye.

736
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,130
Chen Mengyun!
