1
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,220
(Previously)

2
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,701
You're the only girl who dares...

3
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:38,100
go against the Calderioz gang
and Anya's gang.

4
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,780
I don't know if it's you or I
who should be careful.

5
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,980
Sandra.

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,380
You?

7
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,860
What are you doing?

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,820
You're doing something perverted,
aren't you?

9
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,060
Taking a picture of someone
without their consent,...

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,100
is violating their privacy.

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,100
Why is Zea taking such a long time
in the bathroom?

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,540
Zea?

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,700
I'm pretty surprised
that you know martial arts.

14
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,460
Who are you actually?

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,420
(Do Not Attempt To Reenact This)

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,900
Hey!

17
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,420
Where do you think you're going?

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,620
Where do you think you're going?

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,820
Oh, my gosh.

20
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,220
Kids.

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,620
Are you okay?

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,540
Zea.

23
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,460
Zea.

24
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,980
Zea.

25
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,540
Zea, wake up.

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,420
-Zea.
-Call an ambulance. Help them.

27
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,180
Zea.

28
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,540
Are you okay?

29
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm fine.

30
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,620
Get up.

31
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,220
Kids, are you sure you're okay?

32
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,460
-May we use those chairs?
-Get the chairs.

33
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,420
Thank you.

34
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,620
-Here.
-Thank you, sir.

35
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,500
Drink this.

36
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,380
Thanks.

37
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,340
Let's go to the hospital.

38
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,740
No need for that. I'm fine.

39
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,980
Hello? Can you come here right now?

40
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,340
It's important.
I'll share my location with you. Okay?

41
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,180
Okay.

42
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,900
Who were those people?

43
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,340
Your enemies?

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,700
I don't know.

45
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,940
Did you sprain it?

46
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,260
-Sir, do you have some tissues?
-I have some.

47
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,900
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

48
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,460
It's a good thing we fell
on top of those boxes.

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,180
If we didn't, it would have been worse.

50
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,820
Are you worried about me?

51
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,500
Yes, I'm worried.

52
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,140
Ares, what happened to you?

53
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,740
Ares, tell me who did
this to both of you.

54
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,820
There were three motorcycles
that got really close to me.

55
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,380
Find out who dared to do all of this.

56
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,540
Okay, I'll look for them.

57
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,460
The license plate number is B 1775 SUB.

58
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,940
But, remember, not to accuse anyone
without proof.

59
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,740
Okay.

60
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,940
I'll take Zea home first.
Take care of my motorcycle.

61
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,020
Gan, find a taxi.

62
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,460
I can go by myself.

63
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,260
I'm taking you home. Come on.

64
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,500
You don't have to. I can go by myself.

65
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,340
-I'm taking you home.
-You don't have to.

66
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,260
I can take a taxi by myself.

67
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,140
You're so noisy
even when you're in pain.

68
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,420
What more when you are fine.

69
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,220
I'm taking you home now.

70
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,500
Okay?

71
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,100
I'm sure there's a new gang
that's looking for attention.

72
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Come on, man. Ares already told us.

73
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,020
We can't accuse anyone without proof.

74
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,420
This could be someone pitting people
against each other.

75
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,940
So that the motorcycle gangs
would fight each other.

76
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,980
Be patient.

77
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,020
-What is that?
-A license plate number.

78
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,020
We have to find information right away.

79
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,420
Okay. I want you, you, and you...

80
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,140
to gather the members.

81
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,500
What happened to you?

82
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,300
There was an accident.
She fell off a motorcycle.

83
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,460
Oh, my gosh! How did that happen?

84
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,380
-Her mother has to know about this.
-Auntie, don't.

85
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,540
Don't tell my mom and dad.

86
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,980
-But, you're...
-Don't. I'm fine.

87
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,260
Okay. Fine, come inside.

88
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,180
Be careful. Come on. Sit down, okay?

89
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,060
Slowly.

90
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,420
Thanks.

91
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,780
You can go home now.

92
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,860
You're not offering him a drink?

93
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:02,700
Why does it feel like I know you?

94
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,140
You're an artist, aren't you?

95
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,420
Seo Joon, right?

96
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,980
-Is there a first aid kit here?
-There is.

97
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,060
-I'll bring it along with the drinks.
-Okay. Thank you.

98
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,540
-You're welcome.
-Where's Zea's room?

99
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,340
-Why?
-Her room is on the second floor.

100
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,980
Oh, no.

101
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,980
You won't be able to go upstairs
by yourself.

102
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,460
It's okay.

103
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,260
Seriously, it's okay.

104
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,580
Ares, seriously.

105
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,660
Zea, I also want to be carried!

106
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,300
Don't go there. This is the room.

107
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,020
Put me down here.

108
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,540
Okay. I'm fine. I'm here.

109
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,100
Thanks. You can go home now.

110
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,540
Let me see your arm.

111
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,940
Go inside.

112
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,340
What are you doing?

113
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,700
Go inside and rest.

114
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,940
Your room is really like a boy's room.

115
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,340
There's nothing cute about it.

116
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,700
You should go home now.

117
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,140
Is this you?

118
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,060
What's the problem?

119
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,740
Here are the drinks.

120
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,100
Isn't this room...

121
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,500
I meant, if it's just going to be
the two of you in the room,...

122
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,620
don't close the door, okay?

123
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,420
-Right. It wasn't closed, right?
-Right. It wasn't.

124
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,140
That was what I meant. You're right.

125
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,860
Okay, then.

126
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm fine.

127
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,380
Seriously.

128
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,780
This is my responsibility.
You got hurt because of me.

129
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,460
Your hand...

130
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,180
My hand's fine.

131
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,020
Zea!

132
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,820
There are people out here
selling chicken noodles and satay!

133
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,340
Sorry, mister. Who called you
to come here?

134
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,180
I don't know them, miss.
But they've already paid for all of it.

135
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,460
Okay, then, call the others here too.

136
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,980
Okay, miss.

137
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,140
-Is it good?
-Free stuff is always good.

138
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,420
Who do you think ordered all of this?

139
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,300
-Oh, well.
-Let's just eat?

140
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,820
-Let's just eat.
-Okay.

141
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,380
Why is Ares so nice?

142
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,700
His body might be all macho.

143
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,580
But, his heart...

144
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,340
It's making me emotional.

145
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,180
Zea, don't be deceived
by just satay and chicken noodles.

146
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,300
Don't get affected by Ares's lame bribe.

147
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,660
Remember that you have to stand firm.

148
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,861
The person who sent all of this food...

149
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,820
is the handsome boy
who was here earlier?

150
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,100
Zea, have a drink.

151
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,980
Here's your porridge.

152
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,660
How's your leg?

153
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,660
Just ask permission to not go
to school today.

154
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,700
I already did. I'm still feeling sore.

155
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,660
-Thanks for the porridge.
-You're welcome.

156
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,900
No wonder it seemed like
I've seen him before.

157
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,420
He's more handsome
in person than in photos.

158
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:03,660
Okay, I know why you
took him to Eros's room.

159
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:10,260
Because you don't want him
to see that you're a huge fan.

160
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,060
His photos are on the wall.

161
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,900
Auntie, be careful not to let it slip
if he comes here again.

162
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,620
Okay. I'll keep my mouth zipped.

163
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,620
Do you know this one?

164
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,300
-I do.
-Okay.

165
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,020
I don't know.

166
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,060
But, it's no fun because Zea's not here.

167
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,220
Okay, then. When Zea's here,
we can make it again.

168
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,540
Let's just make it first now.

169
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,380
-Okay. One, two, three.
-I'll just follow you guys.

170
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,500
-Sorry, I said I didn't know.
-One more time.

171
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,340
-Okay.
-One more time. One more chance.

172
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,140
Okay.

173
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,740
One, two, three.

174
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,140
Cle, you're off-beat!

175
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,620
Serra! Come on, let's do TikTok!

176
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,180
Yeah, Ser. It's better
than me getting it wrong all the time.

177
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,260
Yeah, please take Cleo's place.

178
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,660
Come on.

179
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,540
I'm not interested in that anymore.

180
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm going to the restroom.

181
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,340
What's wrong with Serra?

182
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,340
Maybe she's thinking about Aiden.

183
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,460
Zea, I found this in front of the house.
I think this is for you.

184
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,660
But I don't know who sent it.

185
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,340
-Okay. Thank you, Auntie.
-You're welcome.

186
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,100
Who sent this?

187
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,940
Zea, you have to focus
on your main objective.

188
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,780
And that is to investigate
Ares and Calderioz.

189
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,740
It's okay, Zea. Get rid
of all your grudges.

190
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,220
Because it's not certain that Ares was
the one who caused Eros to get hurt.

191
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,380
Weren't you feeling emotional
when Ares carried you?

192
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm sure you were! Right?

193
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,940
I think Ares likes you too.

194
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,060
It could also be that it wasn't Ares
who gave this to you.

195
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Is there proof that it was him?
Where's the proof?

196
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,420
Hey, don't just state an opinion.

197
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,260
Then don't make an assumption.

198
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,300
Okay, Zea.

199
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,300
You have to remember
that you're getting close to Ares...

200
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,900
so that you can get the evidence
that Ares caused Eros to get hurt.

201
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,580
We'll follow Ares's little game...

202
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,140
so that we can get the evidence.

203
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,220
Oh, my God. Zea, I'm really sorry.

204
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,540
I'm really in a rush
and I'm on the phone.

205
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,100
I'll get going, okay?

206
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,340
Here, let me help you.

207
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,500
Sorry.

208
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,580
-Does it hurt?
-How sweet, Aiden!

209
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,180
Just confess to her!

210
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,140
Zea is my friend.

211
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,420
And you know that my love
is only for one person.

212
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,540
Thanks, Aiden.

213
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Ser.

214
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,060
Be careful. Usually from being friends,
it could become love.

215
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,020
But, be even more careful,...

216
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,220
because being in the friend zone
isn't a good feeling.

217
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,780
Yes, it's not a good feeling.

218
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,300
Or maybe friends with benefits.

219
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,780
That's right.

220
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,380
What are you saying?
I'm not dating Aiden.

221
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,700
Hey, don't act like children.
Don't gossip.

222
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,260
Ser, don't be jealous.

223
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,500
Who's jealous?

224
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,540
Okay, I'm going. Serra.

225
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,940
Serra.

226
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,340
If Aiden is with Zea,
will you be okay with it?

227
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,180
What are you saying?

228
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,820
What are you saying?
There's nothing between me and Aiden.

229
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,220
-Seriously. But are Serra and...
-Serra is Aiden's ex-girlfriend.

230
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,740
Really?

231
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,700
Who is that from?

232
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,620
Is it from Ares or Aiden?

233
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,461
Oh, my gosh. Zea,
you have a lot of fans.

234
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:55,140
Doesn't it make you dizzy?

235
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,700
(Love is like the wind.
You can't see it.)

236
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,180
(But you can feel it.)

237
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,980
If you like chocolate,
I could give you some every day.

238
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,620
This is from you?

239
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,980
Oh, yeah. The sketch
I sent you yesterday,...

240
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,300
do you like it?

241
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,140
That was also from you?

242
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,940
Thank you, Fino. But, I'm on a diet.

243
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,660
So it's better that you give this
to someone else.

244
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,500
So, that it won't be wasted.

245
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,420
Oh, yeah. And...

246
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,260
you don't need to send gifts
to my house anymore.

247
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,700
Again, thank you.

248
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,140
-Guys, let's go to the cafeteria.
-Let's go.

249
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Zea, let's go to the cafeteria.

250
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,620
I'm not coming
because I have a lot of assignments.

251
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,380
It's okay not to work
on assignments once in a while. Right?

252
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,620
Just enjoy your life.

253
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,700
Zea, do you want us
to bring you something?

254
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,900
No, thank you.

255
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,140
Bye.

256
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,060
Just go ahead.

257
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,860
Zea.

258
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,820
There's something I want to talk about.

259
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,300
Sorry, I'm busy working on my homework.
So, I can't talk right now. Sorry.

260
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,940
But, Zea...

261
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,140
Hey.

262
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,860
What is it?

263
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,340
-Are you scared of me?
-Who's scared of you?

264
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,660
I wanted to work on my homework here.
But, you have taken up all the space.

265
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,580
So I'm going to look for another place.

266
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,820
Sit down.

267
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,180
Do you still have a lot
of homework to do?

268
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,980
There's still a lot.

269
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,660
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,420
It's only two problems.

271
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,980
If you need a table, here.

272
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,540
It's free.

273
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,340
Hurry, before I change my mind.

274
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,940
Okay.

275
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
Don't hold it if you miss him.

276
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,180
There you go. That's how to do it.

277
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,460
-That's enough for now. That was great.
-Okay.

278
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,140
Zea.

279
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,140
This is for you.

280
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,980
Oh, my gosh. What's going on?
This rarely happens.

281
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,940
-Thank you, Fin.
-You're welcome.

282
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,260
Are you thirsty?

283
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,420
What? Here.

284
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,220
-Just have some if you want.
-Thank you.

285
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,900
Here you go.

286
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,580
Thanks.

287
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,340
(Fino)

288
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,020
Why didn't you pick that up?

289
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,820
It feels like Fino is stalking me.

290
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,980
But, in real life, not online.

291
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,780
Even though I don't think
that I gave him any sort of hope.

292
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,300
I don't know why he's like that.

293
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,460
How about we mess with Fino?

294
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,420
-That's a good idea.
-Sure.

295
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,900
Right? It'll be so much fun.

296
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,380
-Give me your phone.
-But, what if he gets mad?

297
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,100
He won't get mad.

298
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,820
How could he get mad just because
we messed around with him a little?

299
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,540
That'd be so sensitive of him.
What a boring person.

300
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,740
-I'll borrow your phone for a bit.
-What are you going to do?

301
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,540
Here.

302
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,980
"Fino, I'll wait for you
in the cafeteria at 4 o'clock."

303
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,580
-Sent!
-Sel!

304
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,020
(Fino, I'll wait for you
in the cafeteria at 4 o'clock.)

305
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,260
Guys!

306
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,060
Let's watch the girls dance.

307
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,340
-Oh, my goodness. Serra's there.
-Let's go!

308
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,100
I'm not watching.

309
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,940
-Oh, you...
-Come on.

310
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,540
Come on.

311
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,500
Oh, my gosh.

312
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,420
Serra is so pretty.

313
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,100
Watch out.

314
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,860
Okay, I'll be waiting for you here.

315
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,420
Okay, bye.

316
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,780
Fino.

317
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,740
You even brought a flower bouquet.

318
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,940
Who is this for?
Are you going to propose to a girl?

319
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,220
Who is it?

320
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,180
I'm going to meet Zea.

321
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,900
Fino.

322
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,820
Zea isn't on the same level as you.

323
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,980
Listen to me. I'll tell you this.

324
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,540
Zea is messing around with you.

325
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,060
Believe me. Zea won't come.

326
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,660
Good luck, Fino! Bye.

327
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,790
I still remember that this is
your favourite place to study.

328
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,230
I'll cover you up so you
won't get exposed to direct sunlight.

329
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,220
Ser?

330
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,420
-Cha.
-Huh?

331
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,820
The one wearing the checked shirt
is pretty cute.

332
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,900
I like the other one.

333
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,420
Dark and sweet. Exotic.

334
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,540
But, you already have Ardhan. Let me
have one. Don't take all the boys.

335
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,180
It's okay for me to admire
another boy's looks once in a while.

336
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,060
It's just for a little bit.

337
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,220
He looks so sweet.

338
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,780
Okay. Let me ask you this.

339
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,180
Who is more handsome? Him or Ardhan?

340
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,500
My boyfriend is more handsome,
of course.

341
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,820
But if it's sweet looks,
there's something about him.

342
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:53,260
Karissa, one boy is enough.
Don't try to get other boys' attention.

343
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,580
You have to remember
that you already have Ardhan.

344
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,660
Oh, my gosh. I really don't know
how to continue this.

345
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,940
Don't try to get other boys' attention.

346
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,180
-He's not...
-One boy is enough!

347
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,940
Ardhan's not here! It should be okay.
