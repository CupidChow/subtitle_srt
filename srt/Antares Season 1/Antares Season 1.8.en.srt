1
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,820
Can't sleep?

2
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,500
I know a better place to see the stars.

3
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,980
You want to go there?

4
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,700
Okay.

5
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,220
-It's so beautiful.
-I know. Just like you.

6
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,220
Drink this.

7
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,260
I don't want you to get a cold.

8
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,115
I don't want your parents
yelling at me for getting you sick.

9
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:33,616
You're not my private doctor.
Nobody's going yell at you.

10
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,750
Drink this.

11
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,740
Coffee is the best aid
for a night like this.

12
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,020
Especially when you're gazing
at the stars.

13
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,540
Do you have to drink from the spot
where my lips touched the mug?

14
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:19,001
It's called an indirect kiss.

15
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,580
Save me a little.
I spent so much time brewing it.

16
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:47,060
-Can I ask you something?
-What's that?

17
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,140
Why are you in a bike gang?

18
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,100
Initially, I was just curious.

19
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,380
I thought people fear them.

20
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:07,701
Once I dug deeper, I was hooked.

21
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:10,581
Because Calderioz
is nothing like the stereotype.

22
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,220
From then on,
I tried to change that stigma.

23
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:26,069
I'm going to show that bike gangs
are not all about parties and trouble.

24
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,220
They can also be about dignity,
morals. and helping others.

25
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:40,383
I have a big dream about Calz.

26
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,300
I want to unite all the bike gangs
in Jabodetabek and Bandung.

27
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:02,951
I know it's not going to be easy.

28
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,700
-Come on, let's play a prank on them.
-Count me out.

29
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,380
I'm out too. Come on.

30
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,460
-Don't worry. I'll back you up. Yes.
-Seriously?

31
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,540
We'd better sleep.
Leave them alone. Okay?

32
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,380
I just want to say hello to them,
that's all.

33
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,300
I'm going to protect them from satan
who looks exactly like you.

34
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,182
What are you doing?

35
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,102
Go to your tent.

36
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,060
-Anya, you're invading my space.
-No, I'm not.

37
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,140
-Move!
-In your dreams!

38
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,460
If you two keep fighting,
we won't be able to sleep.

39
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,380
-Karissa, wake up!
-Pocong!

40
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,700
Aiden?

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Ghost!

42
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,260
-What happened?
-We saw pocong.

43
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,740
-What are you doing in here?
-There's a ghost in our tent.

44
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:52,297
What's that?

45
00:05:55,736 --> 00:06:01,176
Moreo! It was you all along!

46
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,740
How could you?
You think that's funny?

47
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,140
Where am I?

48
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,301
We caught you.

49
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,631
Just stop it.

50
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:19,028
Laskar made me do it.

51
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:23,580
What? You're alone in this one.
I'm going to bed.

52
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,580
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody got hurt?

53
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,180
Would you still think it's funny?

54
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,060
-Are you okay, Serra?
-Yeah, I'd better go back to sleep.

55
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,980
But, tell Moreo to stop pranking us,
nobody's laughing.

56
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,780
-He spooked us.
-On his behalf, I apologize.

57
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,540
Bye. Good night.

58
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,140
-Babe, don't ever prank me like that.
-I will never do that to you.

59
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,020
-Promise?
-I promise.

60
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,620
-I'd better go now.
-Bye.

61
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Come here.

62
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,220
Go to your tent and don't come out
for the rest of the night.

63
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,860
-Sorry!
-Good night!

64
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,540
I love you, Selina!

65
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,980
Hello, Lio.

66
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,580
Zea, Aeros' condition last night
has become worse.

67
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,380
-How is he now?
-He's getting better now.

68
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,340
Where were you last night?
My calls couldn't get through.

69
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,420
I went hiking with my schoolmates.

70
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,380
There was no network coverage
on the mountains.

71
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,100
Zea, don't get carried away
with your feelings for Ares.

72
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,420
We don't have much time left.

73
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:18,060
I know if Aeros could speak,
he'd tell us who did that to him.

74
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,820
What are you writing? Let me see.

75
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,380
-No, Aiden.
-Just a peek.

76
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,940
-Aiden, please.
-Let me see.

77
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,980
-I'm just going to peek.
-No.

78
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,239
What's wrong? Did you guys have a fight?

79
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,359
What do you think about Ares?

80
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,719
He's the best buddy I've ever known.

81
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:29,780
He's so loyal to the gang.

82
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,220
He never lets anyone down.

83
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,162
He has done so much for us.

84
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,821
He's the opposite
of what he's showing to us,...

85
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:46,020
being solemn and cold.

86
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,566
But deep down, he has gentle heart.
That's why we respect him.

87
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:54,206
If we find any traitor,...

88
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,300
we'll end him.

89
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,300
Let's go.

90
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,740
Thank you for fighting the bike gang
who has been extorting us every day.

91
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,300
If you didn't come here to save us,
we won't have anything left.

92
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,580
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

93
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,100
Why are you asking about him?

94
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,260
Do you curious about him?

95
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
-Show it to him.
-What are you talking about?

96
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,420
How about your relationship with Serra?

97
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,660
We were talking about Ares, not Serra.

98
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,180
She knows how I feel about her.

99
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,900
But you know her.

100
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,860
What if...

101
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,700
As her best friend,...

102
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,340
can you help me
to get back together with her?

103
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,340
-Do you have any suggestions?
-Let me think.

104
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,220
How about a gift that you think
she would like?

105
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,260
It doesn't have to be expensive,
but it has to be personal.

106
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,860
Okay. Can you help me pick the gift?
How about after school?

107
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,820
Okay.

108
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,700
Did I hit her with the ball?

109
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,700
Keep playing.

110
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,340
Nurse!

111
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,860
Lay down.

112
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,860
-It really hurts.
-Really?

113
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,177
I'm going to go and find Miss Dina.
She'll know what to do.

114
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:09,937
Please don't go.
I just want you to stay with me.

115
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,460
Are you sure?

116
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,940
My head hurts.
I just want you beside me. Please?

117
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,580
I swear, it hurts and I'm dizzy.

118
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,860
I'm okay now,
but please stay here with me.

119
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,524
Sit here.

120
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:32,500
-I'd better leave since you're okay now.
-Where are you going?

121
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,580
-You don't need me.
-Wait! Stay with me! Ares!

122
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,620
This is Serra's favorite store.

123
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,460
Just go and look around.

124
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,700
Zea.

125
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,100
Found your gift already?

126
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,180
Why don't you choose a nice dress,
a bag or a hat?

127
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,140
She'll look very beautiful
when she wears this.

128
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,140
A sunflower is a symbol of faithfulness.

129
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,500
Look.

130
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,660
Yellow represents warmth and happiness.

131
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,700
Those are the things I miss in Serra.

132
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,974
Now she always looks sad,
gloomy and angry.

133
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:18,654
Unlike before.

134
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,260
I want her to be happy and cheerful.

135
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,220
I want to be by her side.

136
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,700
Waiting for her heart to melt,
so she can take me back.

137
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,180
Just like a sunflower.

138
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,100
It always faces the sun.

139
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,780
What are you doing?

140
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,340
I just wanted to see how it looks.
Don't flatter yourself.

141
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,420
I thought...

142
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,780
Thank you.

143
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,460
(I'm waiting for you in the alley.
Come now or else.)

144
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
(Okay.)

145
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,860
Do want to go to a concert with us?
I have five tickets.

146
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,820
Aiden gave them to me.

147
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,500
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

148
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,860
But, go ahead and have fun.

149
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,340
-This is for you, Ares.
-What's that?

150
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,540
It's okay, I'm giving it to you.

151
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,900
-You shouldn't have.
-Take it. I made this myself.

152
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Thanks.

153
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,260
-Why didn't you come to the alley?
-I was busy.

154
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,380
Do you really expect me to come
everytime you want me to?

155
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,900
I don't work for you.

156
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,260
-But you said, "okay".
-I did.

157
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,101
And now I have better things to do.

158
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:00,660
What I said to you earlier
no longer applies.

159
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,220
Sorry for that.

160
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,740
(I'm outside.)

161
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,020
(I want to tell you something
and also want to give you something.)

162
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,460
(It'll be quick.)

163
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,820
A sunflower is a symbol of faithfulness.

164
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,340
It always faces the sun.

165
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,620
Look at the color,
it's warm and cheerful.

166
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,420
I'm giving you this
to represent my faith in you.

167
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,820
I want to see you smile again.

168
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,700
And I will be faithful to you
just like a sunflower.

169
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,750
Till your heart melts
and you are ready to take me back.

170
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,430
Actually, I asked you to meet me
because I wanted to put it on your hair.

171
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,900
Wear it, please.

172
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:21,300
As a symbol that you want me back too.

173
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:29,180
And I know you will look prettier
wearing it.

174
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,220
-Thank you for the lunch.
-Thanks, Aiden.

175
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,060
-No problem.
-Make it everyday.

176
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,140
I'm collecting rewards from God.
I want to go to heaven.

177
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,380
Why don't I hear "amen"?
I just paid for everybody's lunch!

178
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,444
I'm very happy you eat in my cafeteria.

179
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:59,820
So many customers.

180
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,020
Keep the happy spirit.
It will help you stay young.

181
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,980
I know.
I may be old, but I'm young at heart.

182
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,620
That's the reason I hang with you boys.
I want to stay young.

183
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,340
I was once like you,
I too belonged to a bike gang.

184
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,380
I looked just like Ares, very handsome.

185
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,420
Don't compare yourself to Ares.
It's like night and day.

186
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
But it's okay if you compare him to me
because I'm as good looking as him.

187
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,421
As good looking
as a pair of flip-flops maybe.

188
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,980
Stop comparing yourself to him.

189
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,580
You're being delusional.

190
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,500
Hey, Mor, even pregnant women
are not allowed to see your face.

191
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,180
What the...

192
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,660
Do you realize
that we're in 12th grade now?

193
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,540
I remember my first day in school.

194
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:02,140
I remember Moreo came late,
wore the wrong uniform,...

195
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,820
and he looked terrible.

196
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,060
And he got punished by the seniors.

197
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,820
Admit it, you're the king of tardiness.
When will you change?

198
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,781
I don't think he will.

199
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,340
He's still waiting
for his tooth to grow.

200
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,340
Sorry, dude.
My tooth is special plug-and-play.

201
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,340
-Put it back on.
-Careful, I don't want to lose my tooth.

202
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,500
-Just put it back on.
-Okay.

203
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,460
Why are you discriminating
against my tooth?

204
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,260
That's the reality.

205
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,380
Then it's been two years
since I started dating Karissa.

206
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,620
She put a spell on you
to keep you from cheating on her.

207
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,660
-I know you want to cheat on her.
-Are you crazy? Never!

208
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:06,300
Do you remember
how romantic you were with Serra?

209
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,340
-You were the favorite couple.
-See, we're not the only couple.

210
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,060
We're in 12th grade,...

211
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,740
and Mang Oji is one of many people
who has witnessed our silliness.

212
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,701
How about we take a wefie,...

213
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:25,980
and put the printed
photo on that board,...

214
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,362
so Mang Oji can see the picture
whenever he misses us. Well?

215
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,620
-Let's do it, man.
-Let's go.

216
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,300
I'm happy I can be in the same picture
with you boys, for memory.

217
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,980
-Sit down, Mang Oji.
-Sit here.

218
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,780
-Look handsome, okay?
-I was born handsome.

219
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,460
-With or without my tooth?
-With, please.

220
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Ready? One, two...

221
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,180
Zea!

222
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:05,220
-Do you know where Serra is?
-Serra? I don't know.

223
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,060
-My pick-up's here. See you.
-Are you sure?

224
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:18,340
-I swear, I haven't seen her.
-All right.

225
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,060
-I'll go now. Bye.
-Take care. Bye.

226
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:25,232
-Take care!
-Okay!

227
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,700
You're going home or going to the club?

228
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,420
What's wrong with him?

229
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,620
Who are you?

230
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
Pull over!

231
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,180
Aiden!

232
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,820
Okay. Get up.

233
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,140
Aiden.

234
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,460
Aiden.

235
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,060
Aiden!

236
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,380
Wake up, Aiden. Look at me.

237
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,140
Aiden, wake up!

238
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,860
Please.

239
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,140
You have to know that I love you, Serra.

240
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,700
Please forgive me.

241
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,900
I failed to make you happy.

242
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,460
-Aiden...
-I love you, Serra.

243
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,780
-Aiden...
-Forgive me.

244
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,100
Wake up, Aiden!

245
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,420
Aiden!

246
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,780
Aiden!

247
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820
