00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,140
(Previously)

2
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,100
Your hand.

3
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,900
It's nothing.

4
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,060
Don't trust Ares.

5
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,060
He just doesn't want Wolves
and Calderioz together in Jakarta.

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,940
And that's the reason
why your brother is in a coma.

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,580
I want us all to be careful.

8
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,020
I know they're going to make
a bigger scene.

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,460
They might have already planned for it
and they will do it too.

10
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,700
-Are you okay?
-Sorry. It's nothing.

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,180
Focus!

12
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,300
Laskar, I want you to brief
all the Calderioz chiefs,...

13
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,060
and list all of the members.

14
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,900
Keep an eye on those new recruits.

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,780
While it's Sunday,
so you'll have more free time to do it.

16
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,580
-Who are you?
-Please, don't.

17
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,220
-What are you doing here?
-Are you from the Retro Gang?

18
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,900
-I don't think so.
-Take off your helmet.

19
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,460
I'm here...

20
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,860
-to deliver a package.
-Hey!

21
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,540
Is that a bomb?

22
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,740
A package for Moreo?

23
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,660
Let me handle it. Move.

24
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,980
Don't move.

25
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,940
Weight loss supplement?
Who ordered this?

26
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,620
For God's sake, Mor!

27
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,220
(Speedy Delivery Services)

28
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,900

from the Art Performance
on the group chat.

49
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,140
(You should tell the world about it.)

50
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,460
(She's an angel. I'm speechless.)

51
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,820
(Can't even imagine what
your future children would look like.)

52
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,300
What are you guys doing?
You look so busy.

53
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,060
What's the noises
coming from your phones?

54
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,540
Look at this picture.

55
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,260
(Have you checked yourself out
in the mirror?)

56
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,020
(Even Fiona doesn't want you,
let alone Zea.)

57
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,740
(Ares.)

58
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,500
(Look at this!!
It's National Heartbreak Day!)

59
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,500
I can't believe a picture can create
that much excitement.

60
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,140
Can somebody upload my picture?
I want to be famous too.

61
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,580
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

62
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,740
Let's take a selfie.
Stand here, I like the background.

63
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,580
One, two...

64
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,260
-So she's Ares' new girlfriend?
-She's only after his money.

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,740
Hey! What did you just say?

66
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,700
Watch your mouth!

67
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,500
-Why are they giving me that look?
-Are you that clueless, Zea?

68
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,100
The whole school is talking about you.

69
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,140
Zea, check Ares' IG.

70
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,740
(Ares is so focused.)

71
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,740
(Delete the picture, Ares!)

72
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,500
(No way!)

73
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,140
(Delete it!)

74
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,860
(No way!)

75
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,740
(Please, delete it.)

76
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,220
(No, Dear.)

77
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,340
Look who's smiling by himself.
It's a sign.

78
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,660
Congrats for making it official.
Can't wait for the celebration.

79
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,100
-Right, Mor?
-We're not officially dating. Okay?

80
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,060
I don't believe it.

81
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,420
You're a lousy liar.
Be honest. Just say it.

82
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,261
You don't have to be embarrassed
about it.

83
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,540
Well, it's not.

84
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,820
Ares.

85
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,741
Oh, man.

86
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,340
Looking at both of you
breaks my heart already.

87
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,420
There goes my chance
to make you my girlfriend.

88
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,420
Congrats
for being Ares' 100th girlfriend.

89
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,260
A hundred already?

90
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,780
Let's go. Hurry!

91
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,060
He's following her.

92
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,061
Delete the picture right now.

93
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,180
I'd rather die
than be your 100th girlfriend.

94
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,820
You're not going to be
my 100th girlfriend.

95
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,660
Then?

96
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,100
If you do become my girlfriend,
you would be the 231st.

97
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,980
What? Are you upset? Jealous?

98
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,220
Don't worry.
I don't have that many exes.

99
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,580
The correct number will be...

100
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,340
You jerk. Delete the photo.

101
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,500
I will, after you delete yours.

102
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,540
Okay.

103
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,060
Done.

104
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Now, it's your turn.

105
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,140
Nope.

106
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,900
Ares' girlfriend is so beautiful.

107
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,940
Well done.
Your attention seeking strategy worked.

108
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,940
But, don't get too excited yet.

109
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,620
Because you can't beat
our gang leader, Anya.

110
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,340
Where's she anyway?
Why isn't she here?

111
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,100
Is she too afraid
to confront me in person?

112
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,220
Or maybe she's sleeping
because she's daydreaming.

113
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,060
You're arrogant. Wait till we tell Anya.

114
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,980
Where are you going, Ares?

115
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,900
Following the love of his life.

116
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,700
Why are you following me?

117
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm looking for some reference books
for my assignment.

118
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,980
Okay. But, please keep your distance.
People are watching us.

119
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,340
If somebody dares to try to hurt you,
let me know.

120
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Why?

121
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm going to recruit them
to join the Calderioz Gang...

122
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,580
to let them know who's the leader,
and to respect me,...

123
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,100
and they wouldn't dare to hurt you.

124
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,460
Right. Now can you please leave?
I want to be alone.

125
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,460
Okay, on one condition.

126
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,500
You have to come on our touring event.

127
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,140
I'll take your silence as a yes.
Okay, see you.

128
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,020
-Hello, Zea.
-Hello, Lio.

129
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,900
Listen, the Wolves and I
are here to see Aeros.

130
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,620
Are you coming? We miss Aeros.

131
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,220
Me too.

132
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:32,260
-Okay, let me know if you're here.
-I'll entrust Aeros to you.

133
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,620
Bye.

134
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,180
Zea.

135
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,180
Zea.

136
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,180
Huh?

137
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,420
Go take a shower.

138
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,500
Wake up, Miss.
Or you're going to be late.

139
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,609
Did you think I was Ares?

140
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,900
Maybe this is what people call love.
Love is stronger when you're apart.

141
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,900
Just leave me alone.

142
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,820
I'm going to shower.

143
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,620
Do you want me to prepare
an extra lunch box for Ares too?

144
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,300
So, both of you can eat together.

145
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,940
Leave me alone!

146
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,020
♪If love is blind...♪

147
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,500
Fiona...

148
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,140
Fiona.

149
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,900
I don't like you.

150
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
Fiona.

151
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,780
Serra.

152
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,340
This is for you.

153
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,980
I don't want that bouquet.

154
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,660
Huh? Why?

155
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,180
It was someone else's.

156
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,660
But, my intention is pure. Okay.

157
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,940
There goes another chance.

158
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,774
Miss...

159
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:52,334
Happy Teacher's Day.

160
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
It's still months away.

161
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,119
Are you coming tomorrow?
Touring with Calderioz.

162
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,220
-I don't think so.
-Why not? You should.

163
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,500
It will be the first time
we're going out as a gang.

164
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,860
Aren't you tired of studying?
You need refreshing.

165
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,340
-Fine.
-There you go.

166
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,500
You're coming, right?

167
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:38,958
I think I'll pass.

168
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,140
My dad just got home
from his business trip abroad.

169
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,540
Usually, after he comes home,
We go out together.

170
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,260
But, have fun, guys.

171
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,700
Serra, you'll be the only one
from the gang who won't be there.

172
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,620
Could you come with us, please?

173
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,940
I have a great idea.

174
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,140
-What if I ask your dad's permission?
-Please don't do that.

175
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,860
-Fine, I'll go with you.
-There you go.

176
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,020
Guys, I think I want to make
a silly pose.

177
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,420
Do you think we are on the beach
or camping on the mountains?

178
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,300
Yeah, a family gathering?

179
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,180
No, it's okay.

180
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,220
Yeah.

181
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,340
I'm not pressing you. But,
it would be nice if you can make it.

182
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,701
-Hello, Anya.
-Ares,...

183
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:50,220
I'm so happy you answered my call.

184
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,540
What do you want? I'm busy.

185
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,340
Calm down.

186
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,220
I just want to make sure about the news
about your bike tour.

187
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,180
Can I come?

188
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,780
Please.

189
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,940
Sorry, all seats are filled.
Next time maybe?

190
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,580
Hey, Anya. This is Moreo.

191
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,740
-I have a free seat.
-Really?

192
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,260
-Yeah, you can ride with me. Okay?
-Okay, count me in.

193
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,420
-Great. I'll see you at 06.00.
-Okay, bye. See you.

194
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,260
Okay, bye.

195
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,700
-Why did you invite her?
-Don't you feel sorry for me?

196
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,660
You're all going to ride
with girls on the back seat.

197
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,780
And the only thing I have on my back
would be my backpack.

198
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,100
Do you know what brand my backpack is?

199
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,860
Ser!

200
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,980
-Thanks.
-Are you okay, right?

201
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Ouch.

202
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,060
Why won't you help me?

203
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,938
You want to help me,
but you also fell. Annoying!

204
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,234
-Why are you angry?
-I don't care.

205
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:19,274
Ser?

206
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,319
Ser.

207
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,207
Ser.

208
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Who ask you to chase me?

209
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Someone is playing tag.

210
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,820
No need to jump in.
That's not funny.

211
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,700
Serra!

212
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,340
It's all because of you.

213
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,260
-What are you doing?
-Well, okay.

214
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,580
Guys, before we start the tour,
let's pray together in silence.

215
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,140
Let's start praying.

216
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,100
Amen.

217
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,140
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

218
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,460
Can I ride with you?

219
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,420
Sorry. I'm going to ride with Selina.

220
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,260
Let's go, Sel.

221
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,300
(Calz Social Service 2021)

222
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,620
-Is it 60 centimeters?
-Yes, it is.

223
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,700
We collected money
to help people in need...

224
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,580
-Here you go. You're welcome.
-Thank you.

225
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,660
Thank you.

226
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,740
Here you go.

227
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
-What's wrong, Zea?
-I'm not sure.

228
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,665
-Is your foot okay?
-I think I have a splinter in my foot.

229
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,277
-Huh?
-A splinter.

230
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,420
Let me see.

231
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,900
-We're going to make a bonfire tonight.
-That's right.

232
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,980
I'm going to tell horror stories
by the fire.

233
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,100
-Why?
-Why not?

234
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,180
What if I get scared?

235
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,140
If you get scared,
I will be there with you.

236
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,620
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

237
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,860
Nothing. Never mind.

238
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,740
I'll be there to protect you.

239
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:28,060
-What's wrong, babe?
-Moreo did this to me.

240
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,460
-Why are you blaming him?
-Because he always disturbs us.

241
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,460
-Ares is looking for you.
-Speak of the devil!

242
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,660
Are you here to bother us again?

243
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,100
You always bother us
when we want to be alone.

244
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,860
And now it is messing with our minds.

245
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,900
I thought you're here with Anya.
Why don't you go and find her?

246
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,700
Let's go.

247
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,220
I'm so mad!

248
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,580
Why were we assigned to fetch water?
Why didn't they tell Anya to do it?

249
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,540
She's the unwanted member
of this tour. Why us?

250
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,100
Don't get mad. We're helping people.

251
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,580
I know, but why us, Cleo?

252
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,260
-You look so nervous.
-I need to pee.

253
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,660
-Pee? I wonder where the toilet is.
-Do you know?

254
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,980
How about behind the tree?

255
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,460
Don't forget to ask permission first.
You're not scared, are you?

256
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,940
Do you want me to guard you?

257
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,020
I think this place is spooky.
Stay close to me.

258
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,700
Okay.

259
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,260
Don't forget to ask permission.

260
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,460
Over there! Is that a river?

261
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,620
-Yes.
-Yes.

262
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,620
You go there.

263
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,980
I'm scared.
There can be crocodiles there.

264
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,140
-Crocodiles?
-You're a brave girl, aren't you?

265
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,580
I love you. Good luck.

266
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,860
-Crocodile!
-Where?

267
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,460
Hey, Cleo. You didn't see...

268
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,580
-my "crocodile", did you?
-No, I promise!

269
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,380
Maybe a little.

270
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,020
-Sit here.
-Okay.

271
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,100
Slowly.

272
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,580
-Does it still hurt?
-Just a little.

273
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,860
Let me have a look again.

274
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,820
I think I'm okay now.

275
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,838
For God's sake!

276
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,620
Will you stop imitating scenes
from a Korean drama?

277
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,980
Everywhere I look!

278
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,700
Mor, where are the others?

279
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,940
Megan!

280
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,980
Why did he run away?
Say hello maybe? "Hello."

281
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,660
Why are you closing your eyes?
Did you see a ghost?

282
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,940
I saw a crocodile.

283
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,860
A crocodile?

284
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,900
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay now.

285
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,340
-Does it sting?
-Are the ants still on my shirt?

286
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,100
Are you saying
Cleo saw your "crocodile"?

287
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,380
It was all his fault.

288
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,020
I told him to watch my six,
but he bailed out on me.

289
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,940
You can't expect Aiden
to guard your "crocodile".

290
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,140
He can't even guard a betta fish.

291
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:42,060
It was all your fault.
I was attacked by weaver ants.

292
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,940
Listen, after this,
you should have marry Cleo.

293
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,300
There's no more secret between you two.

294
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,500
-She's leaving, man.
-Cleo!

295
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:07,428
-That's too far, man. I'm out of here.
-She's leaving.

296
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:10,348
I'm going to take care
of my own "crocodile".

297
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,940
I want to thank you guys
for your participation...

298
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,954
in our social service program today.

299
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:23,620
We're going to do it
once every three months.

300
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,420
And I hope we can help more people
with this kind of program.

301
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,660
-Go, Calz!
-All the way, Calz!

302
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,540
-Go, Calz!
-All the way, Calz!

303
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,860
So, in three months,...

304
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,380
how about we help 300 orphans?

305
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,340
I'm all for it.
Round of applause for him!

306
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,140
-You're the best!
-He's my friend.

307
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,060
You've got my support.

308
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,500
Ladies and gentlemen,...

309
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:14,100
I'm going to entertain you all
with something.

310
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,780
Just tell us what is that.

311
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,860
Can you be serious
for one second, please?

312
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,220
-I'm going to recite a poem.
-A poem?

313
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,340
Let's hope it wouldn't end up
with a stand-up comedy act.

314
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,900
It's late at night.

315
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,660
But, getting your attention...

316
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,060
is oh so right.

317
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,180
Family is my number one priority.

318
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,060
Being in the Calderioz family.

319
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:06,300
And you're going to be
a part of my own family someday.

320
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:17,020
I have a dream
about the future Aiden junior.

321
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:25,500
It's going to be small in size,
about 50 millimeters inside your womb.

322
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:43,580
With you as my shore.

323
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,820
Calz is where I find joy,...

324
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:58,178
cry, and awaken from my sleep.

325
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,300
And you, are where I find comfort.

326
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,796
Someday,...

327
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,300
or later on tonight,...

328
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,780
after I have made you all speechless
with my poem.

329
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,500
I'm sure that...

330
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,661
your heart...

331
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:51,580
and your eyes are talking to the cloud.

332
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,420
To the sky and to the universe.

333
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,060
And I'm sure...

334
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:10,660
you will remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

335
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,180
But, I will always be...

336
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:22,119
a prisoner in your heart
till the day that I die.

337
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,260
That's my buddy!

338
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,700
Good job, man.

339
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,260
♪Ramadan is here♪

340
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,340
-I can't stand the mosquitos!
-Here, let me spray the repellent.

341
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,780
-Me too.
-My hands too, please.

342
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,220
What?

343
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,340
A mosquito can't ask for a repellent.

344
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,500
All right, here you go.

345
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:25,820
Now we know that Aiden
has a noble dream. How about you?

346
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,820
I'm dreaming of marrying Fiona someday.

347
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,860
You got my support.

348
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,460
I hope she would be drunk enough
to accept your proposal.

349
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,140
How could you? You're my friend.

350
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:49,300
Mor, I'll always be there for you.
Whatever you do.

351
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,180
-I love you, baby.
-I love you more.

352
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,540
-But she's out of your league, Mor.
-Why, do you like Fiona too?

353
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,140
She made a move on me...

354
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,260
when she asked me
to give her a ride home.

355
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,580
-What can I say?
-Say no more.

356
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,980
Stop it, man.

357
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,940
Can't sleep?
