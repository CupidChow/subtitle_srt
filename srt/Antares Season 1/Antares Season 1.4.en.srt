1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,660
Ares!

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,180
Ares, pick up the books.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,580
Zea. You, too.

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,460
Me?

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,940
Now!

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,780
Yes, Ma'am.

7
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,900
You should've answered my question.
We wouldn't have had to do this.

8
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,300
Why is it my fault? You're the one
who should be cleaning this mess.

9
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,540
Stop complaining.

10
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,740
Just think of it as your dedication
to this school, and to our country.

11
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,500
What is it?

12
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,460
I pricked myself.

13
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,580
Did you know that you can get
an infection if the pin is rusty?

14
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,700
Let me clean that for you.

15
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,060
Hold this.

16
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,100
Babe.

17
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,980
The view's gorgeous.

18
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,420
Feel the breeze. It's so calming.

19
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,820
And you're calming my heart.

20
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,820
Zea, watch out!

21
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,700
Sorry, Zea!

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,300
Thank God it didn't fall on her head.

23
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,300
You're too hasty.

24
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,460
No, I was not.

25
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,180
-That's crazy.
-Who did that?

26
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,500
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

27
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,740
-Sania.
-Yes?

28
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,580
Do you want to hear a poem?

29
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,340
-Sure.
-Really?

30
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,740
Go ahead.

31
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,820
"A shark goes for lunch,...

32
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,660
I love you so much."

33
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,420
That's it?

34
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,140
I can make a poem for you, too, Moreo.

35
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,820
Want to hear it?

36
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,460
Wait a minute.

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,460
Here, a poem for you.

38
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,380
I bet you'll love this.

39
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,860
Read it.

40
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,660
"Like a rainbow after the rain."

41
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,340
"Or snowflakes when the sun is high."

42
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,340
"That is the most precise
picture of us."

43
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,340
Isn't it good? Continue reading.

44
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,420
"With your attempt to create a rhyme
that you called a poem,...

45
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,620
you should just give up...

46
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,980
because we will never be together."

47
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,100
It's good, isn't it?
Don't even bother to try next time.

48
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,980
Why do you look so gloomy?

49
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,380
Why do I keep failing?

50
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,100
With Sania?

51
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,540
She's not the only girl in the world.
Forget about her.

52
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,820
Here, look at this.

53
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,700
-Isn't she cute?
-Who is she?

54
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,780
Ros Tatiana Wijaya. 10th grade student.

55
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,900
-So?
-What?

56
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,020
So, how should I approach her?

57
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,220
She loves chocolate.

58
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,660
Bring her some expensive chocolate,
not the cheap ones.

59
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,380
The ending is just going to be the same.

60
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,540
Come on, how many times
should I tell you?

61
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,260
You're one of the front men
of Calderioz.

62
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,700
You shouldn't be ashamed
to make a move on girls.

63
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,020
Quit it already.

64
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,300
If you never try,
you won't know what's going to happen.

65
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,980
Just try it.

66
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,460
So, chocolate, huh?

67
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,620
Yes, chocolate.

68
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,500
See you.

69
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,100
Hey, light or dark chocolate?

70
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,820
Light chocolate!

71
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,940
Tatiana...

72
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,580
Tatiana!

73
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,780
Want to grab the tasty dessert that we
ate together in the café the other day?

74
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,900
What was it called? I forgot.
Do you remember?

75
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,700
How long are you going to keep this up?

76
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,820
Pretending like we are fine.

77
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,300
You know we're not doing okay.
And you knew that.

78
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,940
But you know what I want.

79
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,220
Listen, Serra.

80
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,220
I love you so much.

81
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,300
You know that, right?

82
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,900
I'm prepared to marry you.

83
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,540
I'm not forcing you to do anything.

84
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm just waiting for you.

85
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,580
You still owe me two promises.

86
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,020
Fine, tell me.

87
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,180
Dress up for tonight...

88
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,820
and come with me.

89
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,420
Okay.

90
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,980
But don't you dare
try to pull another trick on me...

91
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,260
like what you did in your headquarters.

92
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,020
I won't just stay silent.

93
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,340
Ares?

94
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,460
Are you ready?

95
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,180
What do you think?

96
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,740
Thanks.

97
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,540
Whose house is this?

98
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,180
Zea?

99
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,180
Come on in, everyone is waiting for you.

100
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,020
Come on. Hurry up.

101
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,540
Okay.

102
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,020
-Hi, Sandra.
-Hurry.

103
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,060
Hi. Is this your friend, Sandra?

104
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,860
This is Ares's friend.

105
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,140
Good evening, Ma'am. I'm Zea.

106
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,620
Hi, sir.

107
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
You're so gorgeous.

108
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,180
How do you know Ares?

109
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,180
We're schoolmates.

110
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,140
How long have you known him?

111
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,740
Since I moved to Jakarta.

112
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm actually his junior.

113
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,940
-You just moved? From where?
-From Bandung.

114
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,940
No wonder.

115
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,580
Bandung girls are the prettiest.

116
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,180
-You're right.
-Honey!

117
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,340
-Come on, let's have a seat.
-Yes.

118
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,300
Zea is the one who saved me that night.

119
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,100
So it was you who saved Sandra
the other night?

120
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,060
-Thank you so much, Zea.
-It was my pleasure.

121
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,260
So when are you going to continue
your karate lessons, Sandra?

122
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,740
Come on, mom. Not that again.

123
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,420
That is for your own good,
so you can defend yourself.

124
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,860
I completely agree that you should
continue your karate lessons.

125
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,260
Excuse me for a bit.

126
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,260
-Sandra, can I use the bathroom?
-Let me take you.

127
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,460
No, I can go myself. Where is it?

128
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,020
-Over there.
-Okay.

129
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,340
-Excuse me.
-Yes please go ahead.

130
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,300
Where are you going?

131
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,180
Bathroom.

132
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,740
It's right there.

133
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,820
Zea, the dinner is ready.

134
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,540
What is it, mom?

135
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,900
Zea is pretty.

136
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,620
I like her, too.
She's very friendly and nice.

137
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,500
Look who just got an instant blessing.

138
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,180
What are you talking about?

139
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,500
-You made this, honey?
-This is special.

140
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,460
-What's the occasion, mom?
-Let's wait for Zea before we start.

141
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Hey, that's my favourite.

142
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,180
What's taking her so long?

143
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,620
Maybe she is lost in Ares' heart.

144
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,220
Honey...

145
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,260
-Let me go check on her.
-Yes.

146
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,420
So how's your school?

147
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,420
Zea?

148
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,860
Do you still need more time?

149
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,460
There she is.

150
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,540
What took you so long?

151
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,460
Sorry. But my stomach was hurting,
so I needed some time.

152
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,220
It's okay.

153
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,380
-Okay. Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

154
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,220
-You should eat a lot. Have this.
-Sure.

155
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,020
Seriously! My hobby was climbing.

156
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,100
I used to climb anything.

157
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,380
I climbed the mango tree, the banana
tree. Then, I picked the fruits.

158
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,820
-Seriously?
-Yes.

159
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,580
-What a hobby!
-Please don't tell anyone about this.

160
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,020
You're as strong as Wonder Woman.

161
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,580
Thank you so much for having me.
I have to go now.

162
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,860
You're welcome.

163
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,420
-You should come to visit us again.
-Sure.

164
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,500
-Visit us again, Zea.
-Okay.

165
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,780
-I'm going to give her a ride home.
-Okay.

166
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,700
-Bye.
-Bye.

167
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,220
I can't believe you're so good
at winning over my parents' hearts.

168
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,940
Did I?

169
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,420
But, seriously,...

170
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,740
I think my parents like you.

171
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,380
Really?

172
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,900
But, you don't, right?

173
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,620
What do you prefer?

174
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,380
Thanks.

175
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,300
For what?

176
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
For coming to my house.

177
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,260
I think my parents like you.

178
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,060
But, you don't, right?

179
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,740
What do you prefer?

180
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,140
I can't believe you're so good
at winning over my parents' hearts.

181
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,820
Did I?

182
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,980
Why can't I stop thinking about her?

183
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,940
It's already 3 a.m.!

184
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,380
Get yourself together!

185
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,460
Five, six, seven, eight.

186
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,260
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

187
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:00,340
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

188
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,260
-One, two...
-Ouch!

189
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,380
Sorry. Are you guys okay?

190
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,860
You look distracted today.

191
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,140
I saw Megan just now.

192
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,660
Megan? Where is he? Are you sure?

193
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,100
What do you want?

194
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,580
What are you doing here?
Leave me alone.

195
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,140
This is my favorite spot.

196
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,860
You're the one who should leave.

197
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,300
I was here first. Why should I go?

198
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,540
Is this your school?

199
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,820
Ever since I stepped my foot
in this school...

200
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,140
this whole spot below the tree...

201
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,420
is my territory.

202
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,540
Territory? Please.

203
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,140
Are we in a war or something?
We already got our independence.

204
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,260
Shut up.

205
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,540
I want to take a nap.
Don't you dare disturb me.

206
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,940
And wake me up in 15 minutes.

207
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,660
Wake up, Ares.
It's already been 15 minutes.

208
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,340
The class is about the start.

209
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,300
Ares?

210
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,900
What time is it?

211
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,180
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-I did, but you didn't wake up.

212
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,020
Let's go.

213
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,540
-Okay, meow!
-Let's go.

214
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,100
What's wrong?

215
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,860
What is it?

216
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,380
Have you been possessed or something?

217
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,180
Ares, is it Halloween already?
What's with the make-up?

218
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,140
What are you talking about?

219
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,260
"Let's go to the class, meow!"

220
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,980
Ares!

221
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,740
There's only one person
who could ever do this to you.

222
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,100
You mean only Zea?

223
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,380
But this makes me
even more curious about her.

224
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,340
You're curious about her?

225
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,420
You know where that leads to.

226
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,540
To your heart. Be careful.

227
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,300
Hey!

228
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,620
-Here's your order.
-Thanks.

229
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,060
-Is there anything wrong?
-You took the wrong one.

230
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,420
These are mine and Aiden's.

231
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,140
Sorry.

232
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,820
Serra.

233
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,060
-Here.
-Thank you.

234
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,980
Thank you.

235
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,860
Are you okay, Cleo?

236
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,380
Nothing.

237
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,140
Tell us. Why are you being like this?

238
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Why do I always act stupidly
whenever Megan is around?

239
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,780
I'm so embarrassed.

240
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,740
Maybe it's destiny.

241
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:04,580
Usually starting with destiny,
it ends with love. Right, guys?

242
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,020
What are you talking about?

243
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,140
Megan is watching you.
I think he has a crush on you.

244
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,700
Really?

245
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,660
I'm tired!

246
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,380
-Do you know where Regina is?
-She has typhoid.

247
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,900
She hasn't come to school
since yesterday.

248
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,740
Typhoid, really?

249
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,740
We're just a few days away
from the school festival.

250
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,980
We can't change the formation again.

251
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,540
What should we do?

252
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,140
I have an idea.
What if we find a substitute?

253
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,900
You think it's that easy.

254
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,220
I never said it was easy.
But do you have any other solution?

255
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,900
Can't you think of something
that makes more sense?

256
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Then you tell me.

257
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,500
What if we ask for Zea's help?

258
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,380
It's okay if you can't pick me up.
I can take a cab.

259
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,020
Okay.

260
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,740
Zea!

261
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,340
What is it?

262
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,820
Something's wrong?
You girls look nervous.

263
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,260
We are. Can you join us
in the dance club?

264
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,780
Please, I need you.

265
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,860
Gosh, I thought something's happened.

266
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,900
I'm sorry but I don't think I can do it.
Besides, dance doesn't suit me.

267
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,020
Zea, please. You have to help me.

268
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,100
I wouldn't ask for your help
if we're not short on people.

269
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,020
It could mess up our routine.

270
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,380
-Yeah, Zea. Please?
-Please.

271
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,740
Listen, do you still remember
when you were running away from Ares...

272
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,500
and then you ran into our practice?

273
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,420
And then you somehow danced with us.

274
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,660
Now you say dance doesn't suit you?

275
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,260
I don't want to talk
about doing a favor,...

276
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,580
but friends should help each other.
Right?

277
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,300
Do you girls remember when Anya
and her gang confronted her?

278
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,420
-I remember!
-Didn't we help her?

279
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,740
All right, fine. I'm in.

280
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,900
-Nice decision.
-Thank you, Zea!

281
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980
No one is coming to pick you up?

282
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm going home by myself.
I'm waiting for my ride.

283
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,140
Get on the back. I'll take you home.

284
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,540
No, thanks. I'll take the cab.

285
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,820
Don't be so stubborn.

286
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,140
First, take this as a way
of me saying thanks.

287
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,900
Second, you should do what I say
since you drew on my face.

288
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,220
No.

289
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,100
Get on.

290
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,740
Fine.

291
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,060
Hold on tight.

292
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,780
I said, hold on tight.

293
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,260
Hi!

294
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,620
You must be waiting for me.

295
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,820
Wear this. Let me take you home.

296
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,260
You don't have to. My driver is coming.

297
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,060
Okay, then let me
follow you from behind.

298
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,220
So you'll be safe. Okay?

299
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,980
I don't need you to do that.

300
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,700
You don't?
Then when is she going to need me?

301
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,060
Aiden.

302
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,180
If Serra doesn't want you
to take her home,...

303
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,260
then why don't you take me
to your headquarters?

304
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,860
And then you can help me to ask Ares
to see me, okay?

305
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,060
I'm not a bike taxi.

306
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,980
Aiden!

307
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,220
Stop there!

308
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,860
Where are you going?

309
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,780
Don't you run away!

310
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
This kid is looking for a fight!

311
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,580
Get him!

312
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,020
