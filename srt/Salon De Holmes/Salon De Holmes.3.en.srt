00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:42,916
Excuse me. I'm from Bo Kwang Life Insurance.

10
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:43,945
Is the shop owner there?

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,900
If you want to buy something,
quickly buy and go.

12
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:48,347
Ah, don't be like that.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,838
We have fire insurance products
which is very good this time.

14
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:53,150
Oh, listen, okay?

15
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,540
I've told you a hundred times
every time you come.

16
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:58,629
I don't want insurance!

17
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:00,980
But in this life, there is nothing
who knows what will happen.

18
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,540
If you want to trade for a long time
in one place,

19
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:06,756
have at least one
insurance is actually profitable.

20
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:10,842
Listen, ma'am.

Mrs.

22
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:15,155
If I had the money to take out insurance,
I better donate it.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,940
So please stop talking.
that doesn't make sense and leaves.

24
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:19,115
Ah, wait a minute…

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,170
Let go, let go!

26
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,146
It's just a given
for customers who take out insurance.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,423
Fire!

28
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:32,886
Fire!

29
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:34,753
Where?

30
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,066
Extinguisher!

31
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,093
Fire!

32
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,321
Today is your birthday, right?

33
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:43,073
On a happy day like this,

34
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,437
if the fire is this small
burn the shop down, then…

35
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:51,317
Madam! Are you crazy?

36
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:55,620
How can you talk?
about the fire in someone's shop?

37
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,523
And Madam,

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,197
How do you know my birthday?

39
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:00,536
That's because…

40
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:07,569
Why?
Those are all the files that you want to throw away.

41
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:08,400
CHUN YONG-MAN

42
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,416
Gwangseon Store, huh?

43
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,085
Last month Sun-ja almost succeeded
get a contract,

44
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,983
but before signing,
the person suddenly canceled.

45
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,508
That guy is really annoying.

46
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:25,982
His birthday is March 16th.

47
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:28,089
That's tomorrow, right?

48
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:31,660
That's a job secret!

49
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,946
Madam, you told me to
take out fire insurance, right?

50
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,428
Wow, I really need it!

51
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:37,182
It is absolutely necessary.

52
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,752
Because now my chest is
like it's about to burn,

53
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,457
I really need fire insurance!

54
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:44,947
But one thing is for sure.
I won't register through you. Understand?

55
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,445
Oh, you haven't heard yet.
my explanation until finished.

56
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,860
And one more thing, I'm not a mistress, okay?

57
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,852
Please don't keep doing this
calling me “madam”!

58
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,739
- But you're already a mother, right?
- No!

59
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,123
I'll come back later.

60
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:03,156
Don't come again.

61
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,502
Don't! Absolutely don't!

62
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,843
What is this? Rain?

63
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,220
What is this?

64
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,316
GWANGSEON SHOP

65
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,696
- Happy birthday, Yong-man!
- Thank You.

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,803
Finally, it's your treat tonight, okay?

67
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,902
Haphazard.
I celebrate with Chinese New Year.

68
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:41,862
But it's nice to see you guys again.

69
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,186
Hey, sit down, sit down!

70
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,229
Damn you cheap.

71
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,942
Treat us once in a while.

72
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,699
He is indeed acutely stingy.

73
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,500
Why? Because you are such a cheapskate,

74
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,099
That's why I've never had a boyfriend
and not married yet, understand?

75
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:59,961
How could a man like him
have a worthy partner?

76
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,346
- Have a partner? No way.
- He works continuously.

77
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,146
Why live like that?

78
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,986
Hey, Chun Yong-man!

79
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,025
I'm really worried about you.

80
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,512
Have you ever held a woman's hand?

81
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,999
He's the owner of Gwangseon Shop, right?

82
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,260
- Never kissed either, right?
- Enough!

83
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,338
Come on,

84
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:19,479
Which girl wants to be with the owner?
a small and stingy shop like you?

85
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,060
Good grief.

86
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,358
God damn it.

87
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:25,144
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

88
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,629
Come on out.
Do you want to duel?

89
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,239
You know what?

90
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:31,291
Lots...

91
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:34,591
...girls like me.

92
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,306
Your voice is shaking like that.

93
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:39,940
If you ever have a boyfriend,
I have four!

94
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:42,569
- Stop it.
- Geez.

95
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:44,912
If so, try to prove it now.

96
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,466
- Who are you?
- What is this?

97
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,293
I'm Yong-man's girlfriend.
What do you want?

98
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,596
My boyfriend… there are four…

99
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,116
Wow, you are so lucky.
having a boyfriend as great as this. I'm jealous.

100
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:08,903
It should have been done from the start
you invite your girlfriend like this.

101
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,956
Yes, that's right.

102
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,709
By the way,
life insurance is mandatory,

103
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:14,323
- especially nowadays.
- Correct.

104
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:19,576
If it's for car insurance,
You can contact my friend directly, okay?

105
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:20,642
I?

106
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:23,869
Coincidentally. Next month,
I will renew my car insurance.

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,335
- Are you serious?
- Yes, do you want to continue drinking somewhere else?

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,395
- Come on. That's fine.
- Come on.

109
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,737
- Okay. Let's go.
- Be careful, ok?

110
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:41,496
Thanks to you today,
I became the insurance champion this month.

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,199
Let me pay for the drink.
tonight.

112
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,553
Besides, Dad keeps working.
without holidays every month.

113
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,260
In my opinion, compared to fire insurance,
health insurance is more important to you.

114
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,856
I will try to make the best design
within reach of our office...

115
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,223
...and will contact you again.

116
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,496
Excuse me.

117
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,780
Accompany me with another glass.

118
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,320
Let me pay tonight.

119
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:21,631
Wow, if it's just one glass,

120
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,872
no problem.

121
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,070
- Come on, sit down.
- Drinking like this feels fun.

122
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:34,560
We've been like this for a long time.

123
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,590
Ji Hyun,

124
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,230
EPISODE 3: ANGRY MOMS
Why do you keep staring at that wedding photo?

125
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,264
- You remember the past, huh?
- As I thought, you're type F.

126
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,068
- Correct.
- Ouch.

127
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,180
At that time I thought I was designing
insurance for this person.

128
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,237
It turns out that it is actually designed
hell for my own life.

129
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,719
This is not yet paid off.
Insurance claims are also not possible.

130
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:51,784
Ouch.

131
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,533
Excuse me, I want to pay.

132
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,207
Min-woo, come in.

133
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:01,406
Oh, why are you eating noodles again?

134
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,480
Your father still gets drunk often?

135
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,546
How much does it cost?

136
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,753
One thousand two hundred won.

137
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:11,740
I…

138
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:19,883
Ah, never mind.
Just bring it.

139
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:21,596
Thank You.

140
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,170
I will later
return the two hundred won.

141
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,126
Good.
Come again, okay?

142
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:34,451
Ouch.
That kid is really pathetic too.

143
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,980
- So what?
- Who's he?

144
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,115
It looks like one school
with my daughter, Hyun-ji, okay?

145
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:42,780
His father used to own a big travel agency,

146
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:45,591
but everything went bankrupt during COVID-19.

147
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,575
His wife has also been having an affair for a long time
and they divorced.

148
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:52,218
She tries to raise her child on her own
while working hard on a construction project,

149
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,076
until finally a serious back injury.

150
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,683
Even now I can't work,
So I just get drunk every day.

151
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:01,798
- Poor thing, huh.
- The one who pities the most is the child.

152
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:04,692
Wow, it's already this late!
I have to pick up Min-yeo.

153
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,665
- I'll go home first, okay?
- Yes.

154
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,418
- Yes, hurry up!
- Okay, see you!

155
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:10,272
Hyun-ji also comes home from tutoring.
Ji-hyun, I'm going home first.

156
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,600
- Yes.
- Let's go together.

157
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,300
Oh, why do kids have skirts these days?
so short?

158
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,176
Gosh, you can almost see everything.

159
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,683
Yeah, right? I said that too.

160
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,687
Mother!

161
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:23,196
Noh Min-yeo, come in! Hurry!

162
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,915
I told you not to pick me up.

163
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,780
- Hello, Auntie.
- Jong-eun, hello.

164
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,580
Can I play for a while?
with Jong-eun?

165
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,243
Oh my, what time is it?

166
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:32,623
If your father finds out, he might be furious.

167
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:36,463
Mom just made something up.
We just want to take some funny photos together.

168
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,943
Do you really have to go now?

169
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,260
Today is my birthday.

170
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,870
Just taking pictures
just a souvenir. Is that okay?

171
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:42,826
- Birthday, huh?
- Yes.

172
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,940
Oh, if it's just the two of us
instead it makes you anxious.

173
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,886
But never mind, just one hour.

174
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:50,043
- Happy birthday, Jong-eun.
- Thank you, Auntie.

175
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:52,589
Good grief.
BELOVED FATHER

176
00:08:53,343 --> 00:08:54,685
Why did he call?

177
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,303
- What is it?
- Yes.

178
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:58,823
Where is Min-yeo?

179
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:01,781
I just picked him up from his tutoring place,
was on his way home.

180
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:02,850
I want to talk to him.

181
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,380
For what? It'll be later anyway
at home can also chat.

182
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,260
I just want to hear her voice.
Let's connect.

183
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,099
Oh, my goodness.
He just fell asleep, honey.

184
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,340
That fast?
Okay, try waking him up for a moment.

185
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,860
I've been here for a few days
didn't see Min-yeo's face.

186
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:18,332
Gosh, he looks so tired.
Oh my, he sleeps while snoring.

187
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,239
He's snoring really loud, darling.

188
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,765
But why is Min-yeo snoring?
exactly like you?

189
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:26,992
Very weird.

190
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,092
Anyway, take good care of Min-yeo, okay?

191
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,860
In Block 2, there is a report
two appearances of a pervert.

192
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:35,300
Min-yeo stands out like me.
Wherever he goes, he immediately stands out.

193
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:38,275
If this is the case, it's better if he looks similar.
his mother so as not to attract attention.

194
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,079
Yes. Okay, I'll hang up.

195
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,152
Do you really have to talk like that?

196
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,772
If he looks like me,
will definitely stand out even more.

197
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:50,933
Oh, I should have just gone along.

198
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:54,445
That's why I said that.
But isn't he going too far?

199
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,932
The child even complained
all to his mother.

200
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:03,725
Then his mother called
math teacher and angry.

201
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:10,203
Yes. I feel sorry too
with his teacher, I swear.

202
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:13,336
I don't know, it's so annoying.

203
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,040
Yes, but…

204
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:22,353
Of course...

205
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,559
Oh...

206
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,020
Hey, don't hang up.

207
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,716
Someone is chasing me.

208
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:49,983
Mother!

209
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,518
Earlier during math class
At the tutoring place, the material is very difficult.

210
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:08,398
Oh, Dad.
How can I sleep here? Come on, hurry up…

211
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:09,711
Min Woo.

212
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:13,724
Min-woo? Hyun-ji, do you know that kid?

213
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,020
- Yes, he is my classmate.
- Dad, come to your senses a little.

214
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,284
- Min-woo, do you want us to help you?
- No need, you guys just go.

215
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:20,704
Wait a moment.

216
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,364
Min-woo's father, can you hear me?

217
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:24,931
Pack?

218
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,664
- Hyun-ji, please call Mr. Security Guard.
- Yes.

219
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:31,583
Dad, come to your senses.

220
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,060
Hello, 119?

221
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:35,850
This is in front of Block 208 park,
Gwangseon Jugong Apartment.

222
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:37,944
Someone fainted.
Please come here immediately.

223
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,620
EMERGENCY ROOM

224
00:11:40,763 --> 00:11:43,370
Min-woo, are you sure you can be alone?

225
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,200
Yes, I'm fine.

226
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,748
- Thank you very much.
- It's okay. You must be really surprised.

227
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,701
Hurry up and meet your father.

228
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,448
If anything happens,
Call Hyun-ji or Auntie soon, okay?

229
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,821
- Good.
- See you tomorrow at school.

230
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:03,228
He'll be fine, right?

231
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,775
It must be fine.

232
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:23,521
TAE-MIN INVITES KIM MIN-WOO IN

233
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:27,183
Hey, Kim Min-woo.
Can't answer right away, huh?

234
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,980
Since I haven't been beaten lately,
That crazy guy is just showing off.

235
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,416
Gosh, he really annoys me.

236
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:34,262
He could have just been left alone.
Tomorrow we'll beat them up in the school cafeteria.

237
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,175
LET ME HIT IT,
DO YOU WANT TO DIE? SORRY, CHILD...

238
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,780
...WHO IS THIS? BITE
MOTHER FIRST!, HAHA

239
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:49,610
Hey, how about some lunch?
shall we go eat tteokbokki?

240
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,220
- Tteokbokki? It must be delicious.
- Of course. So getting hungrier.

241
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,203
Oh, why is lunch taking so long?

242
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:02,416
Get out of my way, you loser.
His face is so annoying.

243
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:05,830
Won't you move? Are you deaf?
In fact, he was told to move aside.

244
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,740
Hey, you think you're great?

245
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:12,676
- Hey, you guys.
- Do not interfere.

246
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:14,530
If they target you,
Instead, you're the one who's in trouble.

247
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:18,390
- What can that kid do?
- He's so bad.

248
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:20,476
What do you want to eat?

249
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,380
Look at the food.

250
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:31,847
Min-woo, you're hungry, right?

251
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,373
Here, eat a lot.

252
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:37,606
Why not eat it?

253
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:38,788
Let's eat.

254
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:42,852
Wow, good friends should be appreciated.

255
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,599
Come on, open your mouth.

256
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,199
Hey. What are you guys doing?

257
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,632
Min-woo apparently has a girlfriend, huh?

258
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,492
Why didn't you say so?

259
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:01,272
Park Hyun-ji, seriously.

260
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:04,248
Your taste is so strange.

261
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:06,899
Hey, Ahn Tae-min.
Aren't you being too much?

262
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:09,939
Park Hyun-ji.

263
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,392
Do you want to replace me?

264
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,699
Wow, you guys are perfect together.

265
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,373
May it last and eat delicious food, yes.

266
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,391
Kim Min-woo, are you okay?

267
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,633
- Kim Min-woo…
- Already.

268
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,140
My wife, since last year,
start avoiding intimate relationships.

269
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,060
Yeah, it doesn't mean he
openly refused, but…

270
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,140
It turns out there are many couples
who no longer do it.

271
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:43,683
We know from the expression
or their attitude, right?

272
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,500
- Sometimes I start with a kiss…
- Of course I can know.

273
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:48,553
How could you not know?

274
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,513
Wow, that sure?
It seems like you are quite experienced.

275
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,253
So, you're still doing it?

276
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:59,126
Oh, Ji-hyun.
It's midday and it's starting again. Oh my.

277
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:03,580
Well, my husband works in the field,
all his energy was spent outside.

278
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,119
But because of his physical endurance
still enough,

279
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:08,719
if it has started,

280
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:10,812
can be lit.

281
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,978
Wow, it's glowing, he said?

282
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,343
Noh Kang-sik. Prone.

283
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,243
What is this?

284
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,303
Do you know what time it is now?
It's past class time.

285
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,560
My stomach has been feeling unwell for a while now.
My body is about to collapse.

286
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:36,462
Hey. Wanna try fighting?

287
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:37,622
Lie down, quick.

288
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,242
Come on, stop it.

289
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,949
- I am the teacher and you are the student.
- Are you crazy?

290
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,195
I said I'm the teacher. You're the student.

291
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:46,636
Bones… my bones…

292
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:51,467
Bones? Which ones, honey?
Where does it hurt? Ouch, sorry.

293
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,100
- I got too carried away with the role, huh?
- Your great strength is not for this.

294
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,460
Husband comes home from work all day,
very tired, even beaten up.

295
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,020
It doesn't actually hurt.

296
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,220
Once it's in your hands, even silken tofu
can be a deadly weapon.

297
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,193
What a shameless wife.

298
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,787
Don't say such outrageous words.

299
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,540
I don't want to be happy alone.

300
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,725
I just want to create a new atmosphere
with a little role playing.

301
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,965
Why are my efforts never appreciated?

302
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,658
If you get too creative again,
my ass could be crushed.

303
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,891
Please, stop rambling.
and hurry up and cook.

304
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:18,626
Whatever. Go cook it yourself.

305
00:16:20,203 --> 00:16:21,665
If you've been beaten,
should be fed too.

306
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,152
Gosh, I just wanted to get some clothes.
It just becomes complicated like this.

307
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,660
Mi-ri, what about you?

308
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,396
Hyun-ji's father…

309
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:38,950
To be honest, he wants it every day.
But is it true, you are served every day?

310
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,063
Is that really possible?

311
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,460
Honey, do you want to hear some good news?

312
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:46,795
What's that?

313
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,020
I managed to collect
all grapes.

314
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:52,516
The fruit is full, dense,
rich in fruit juice, and premium taste.

315
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,635
Just need to harvest it.

316
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:57,463
Oh my gosh. Can't stop talking?
like eating grape seeds?

317
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,240
Get to work quickly
before Hyun-ji hears.

318
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,900
Why are you like this?
I've collected everything.

319
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,140
Washing dishes, sorting trash,
even cleaning the toilet.

320
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,226
I've been waiting for this day for so long.
Why did you reject me?

321
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,895
Last week you were drunk,
fell asleep in the car and dropped the cards.

322
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,700
You're wrong, so you get minus three points.
Here, let me get some grapes.

323
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,373
Am I a kid or what?

324
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,453
So when are the grapes harvested?

325
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:24,700
It could be too rotten.

326
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,169
Are you sure today?

327
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:30,628
Of course.

328
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:34,035
Tonight,
Spartan warriors will come to you.

329
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:39,009
He is not easily defeated.

330
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:47,353
Everything is collected.
The grapes are completely collected.

331
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,730
Sparta!

332
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
Let me help you.

333
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,700
The hot night was long gone.
Maybe, she has another man?

334
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,103
Wow, it must be about vitality.
Yes, vitality issues.

335
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,720
- Should exercise. Exercise!
- Senior, exercise alone is not enough.

336
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,596
Gosh, I feel so different now.

337
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:15,715
Yesterday my wife brought
expensive herbal medicine from traditional clinics.

338
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,436
- How much does it cost?
- One million won.

339
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,263
He said the mixture was very complete.

340
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:20,788
But the bitterness is unbearable.

341
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,808
Want to throw it away, dear.
In fact, it is said to be good for men.

342
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh my, so young
Have you drunk the herbal medicine?

343
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,876
I have never drunk herbal medicine
or lifelong aphrodisiacs.

344
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,301
Okay, don't drink it. I'll do it.

345
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,556
Try to follow me. Crouch down.

346
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:37,910
Stand up. Squat.

347
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:40,072
Straight hard.
The hard one? The thighs, of course.

348
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,459
Coach. Please teach this.

349
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,766
- Yes, I'm coming.
- Okay.

350
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:46,699
Hey!

351
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,355
Why are you bringing herbal medicine when you want to teach?

352
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,640
- Put it on the reception desk first, okay?
- Okay.

353
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,078
Don't drink it.

354
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:55,851
Who else wants a drink?

355
00:18:58,413 --> 00:18:59,298
Oh, it's bitter.

356
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,691
But the bitterness is great.

357
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:08,322
Oh my, it's so bitter.

358
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:14,491
You smile to yourself, so suspicious.

359
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:15,497
I?
- Yes.
- Yes.

360
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:17,618
It's nothing.

361
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:21,051
- What about you?
- Yes, how about you?

362
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:23,113
- My husband?
- Yes.

363
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,746
He didn't even take a shower.

364
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:27,395
The smell of old age is very pungent.

365
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,620
Oh, his stinginess is unbearable.

366
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:33,900
Water is saved, gas too,
even his wife's needs were saved.

367
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,540
Because my husband likes to save money,

368
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:41,559
my youth was also thrifty,

369
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,966
until it becomes a corpse.

370
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,150
Corpse?

371
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:47,979
What does it mean?

372
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:50,652
No, no. That's…
There's bird droppings in front of the shop.

373
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,026
Let me clean it up.

374
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,986
You just come in, lunch is ready.

375
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,825
Min-woo, huh? What do you need?

376
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,986
Um… I want to buy cigarettes.

377
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:05,303
Cigarette?

378
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:09,376
That… My father told me to.

379
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:10,456
Oh I see.

380
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,556
But I'm sorry,

381
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,358
I can't sell it.

382
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:16,936
If it gets discovered
selling cigarettes to minors,

383
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:19,086
This store could get into trouble.

384
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:21,867
Tell your father to come himself.

385
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,923
Or just quit smoking altogether.

386
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:25,863
Good.

387
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,420
- Excuse me.
- Yes. Take care of yourself.

388
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,751
- Hello.
- Hello.

389
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,100
Auntie, where is the Carbot chocolate?

390
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,936
What? There.
Let Auntie get it.

391
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,241
- Yes.
- Yes.

392
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,626
- How much do you want?
- Five.

393
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,980
Five, yes.

394
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,780
Ji-hyun, I want one too.

395
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:49,365
Okay. Lately,
This is indeed a favorite snack for children.

396
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,436
Bring the cigarettes.

397
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:53,749
If you don't bring it,
You yourself become a cigarette.

398
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,156
I will turn it on
matches on your body.

399
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:58,061
A child's tongue, huh. Ouch.

400
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,927
That snack package discount
is it finished yet?

401
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,007
Oh, it's all gone.

402
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:07,874
Oh my gosh, why did that kid run like that?
It could fall later.

403
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,501
Why Korean football
play like this?

404
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:12,241
It seems like their legs are crooked.

405
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:14,207
Ball in front, but kicked to the side.

406
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,458
Okay, you just play.

407
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,327
Hey, hey.

408
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,916
Don't throw it away
cigarette ash carelessly.

409
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:21,380
See, it's getting dirtier, right?

410
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,754
Why are you getting angry?

411
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,860
- Throw it in the ashtray, please!
- Okay.

412
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,920
Hey, ashtray.

413
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,286
Hey, ashtray, you want to smoke too, right?

414
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:35,999
If not,
Raise your right hand. Quick!

415
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,144
If the ashes fall, your history is over.

416
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:40,952
Do not move!

417
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:43,665
Hey!

418
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:47,312
What are you guys doing?
Even smoking in the park.

419
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,386
Where are the cigarettes?
Come on, where are the cigarettes? Where?

420
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,540
Uncle, you should go.

421
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,899
What do you talk to adults about?

422
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,579
Why is that? It just makes me upset.

423
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,306
Who is your uncle? Who?

424
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,252
I am an adult.

425
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,419
- Annoying. Let's go.
- Bratty kid.

426
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,506
How dare you push your parents.

427
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:16,053
- Hey, you don't want to let go?
- It was my uncle who let me go first.

428
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:18,595
- I'm an athlete. Take it off now.
- So what?

429
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,079
- I am a former PON athlete.
- Uncle...

430
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,395
Nobody asked.

431
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,286
I am a former gold medalist…

432
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:26,573
Dad? What are you doing here?

433
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,940
Hyun-ji, don't come here.
Don't! Go away.

434
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,759
Park Hyun-ji. That's your father, right?

435
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,435
- What are you guys doing?
- Let go!

436
00:22:36,466 --> 00:22:38,176
If you dare touch my child, watch out.

437
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,303
- Take it off now.
- Hey, this kid.

438
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:42,770
Come on, on the count of three, let's take off together.

439
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,436
One two three.

440
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,155
- Damn it.
- Father.

441
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,890
How dare you deceive your parents.

442
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,792
- Let go.
- Just hit it, hit it!

443
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,123
Later, Uncle will go to prison.

444
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,016
If it were us, we would definitely be free.

445
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,653
Just hit me. Dare?

446
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,379
God damn it!

447
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:04,659
Don't dare, huh?
Here, let me hit you.

448
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:05,699
Hey!

449
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,419
What an insolent kid.

450
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:14,332
How dare you grab an old man by the collar.

451
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:17,456
- Let go!
- Put that hand down now.

452
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,700
Auntie, let go of your hand!

453
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,743
Who are these fat ladies?

454
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,198
Want to get involved?

455
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:25,636
Wow, your mouth is really
don't know the order, huh?

456
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,136
That's the way kids are nowadays.

457
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,489
Geez.

458
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,869
Bro Red?

459
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:34,201
So bitter. So nostalgic.

460
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:36,621
Young adult.

461
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:39,448
You guys still smell of galangal,
already dare to smoke.

462
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:40,521
That is true.

463
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:42,668
Today's kids.

464
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:45,990
Aunt, we bought
I use my own money to buy the cigarettes.

465
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,921
Why did Auntie take it?
Mind your own business, Auntie.

466
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,203
If you dare, just hit him.

467
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:54,875
Want to see what it's like as an adult?
hitting a minor.

468
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:56,461
Good grief.

469
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,743
Over time,
I feel like exercising.

470
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:00,540
Oh, these guys can fight!

471
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:06,140
Listen, if one of you
dare to hit me first,

472
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,007
I'll treat you to a pack of cigarettes.

473
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,879
If not, let's go straight away
to the police station. Okay?

474
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:15,590
- Stop it...
- These women are looking for trouble, aren't they?

475
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:17,970
Auntie thinks we are afraid to hit women?

476
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,280
We don't care!

477
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:26,786
Geez!

478
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:37,936
What an insolent kid.
Smoking at will.

479
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,399
- What did you say to me just now?
- Fat mothers.

480
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,376
God damn it.

481
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,410
Go away!

482
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:48,252
- Come on, come on...
- Fast...

483
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,111
Get out of here quickly!

484
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:52,985
- My jacket...
- What do you want?

485
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,635
I don't know who your mother is,
but thank you very much.

486
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:01,005
Really giving
lesson for them.

487
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,212
No need.

488
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:04,350
This is because adults too
who failed to educate them.

489
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,259
- Correctly.
- Dad. Look at this bag.

490
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,393
That could be evidence.
Hurry up and take it.

491
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:12,140
I will take this case seriously.

492
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:15,620
If you report to the school and homeroom teacher,
they will be in big trouble.

493
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,220
- Take it now.
- True, but…

494
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:19,226
There must be evidence here.

495
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:21,595
Well, here's the wallet. Look.

496
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:23,163
This.

497
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:24,816
KIM MIN WOO
GWANGSEON JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

498
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:28,179
Grade 3-4? Isn't that your class?

499
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,136
- Yes…
- You know?

500
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:33,981
- Let me return it.
- No need, Dad.

501
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,633
Just me, Dad.

502
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:38,892
Wow, you guys went home together, huh?

503
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:41,195
Hyun-ji, you are enough
Just deliver the bag, okay?

504
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,692
Never play
with that Kim Min-woo.

505
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:44,157
It seems like the kid is a naughty kid.

506
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:47,022
Smoking on the street.
His social life is not good.

507
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:48,899
He's not that kind of kid.

508
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:50,537
Why? What's wrong?

509
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:51,766
It's clear he's a bad boy.

510
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:53,934
Smoking, hanging out with naughty kids.

511
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,260
I'm sure he was just asked to buy cigarettes.

512
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:58,660
Most likely he was bullied
by those thug kids.

513
00:25:58,685 --> 00:25:59,404
What?

514
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,360
If so, you have to report to the teacher,
so that action can be taken immediately.

515
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,700
There is no point.

516
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:05,620
Even though the teacher knows,
they also can't do much.

517
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:07,471
In that case,
You have to help him.

518
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,524
But if I help and get caught,

519
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:11,579
I can also be bullied.

520
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,444
Who… who dares?
bothering my child?

521
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,357
If anyone dares, tell Dad, okay?
Let Dad brush them one by one.

522
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:20,451
Darling,
Why is the neck of your shirt so stretched?

523
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:25,324
How can it stretch?

524
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:28,205
- Mom, I'm going into the room first, okay?
- Yes dear.

525
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,509
Maybe because lately,
my muscle mass has increased.

526
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:38,163
- So, the shirt stretches too.
- Are you only exercising on one side?

527
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,016
Oh, I'm so embarrassed in front of my own child.
So embarrassing, I swear.

528
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,490
Darling...

529
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,018
I've washed and hung the shirt out to dry, okay?

530
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:01,760
Just throw it away.

531
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:03,875
I don't want to see that shirt again.
Just burn it.

532
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,460
Oh, why?

533
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,759
But you're already asleep?

534
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:11,112
Where are the grapes?

535
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:15,179
Oh yeah, grapes.

536
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,553
But today it seems
My physical condition is not fit.

537
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,535
We'll harvest tomorrow.
My throat is also a bit itchy.

538
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,148
I'm afraid I'll infect you.

539
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,548
Early morning, you already made me
hoping because of the grapes.

540
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:31,040
Okay, get enough rest.

541
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:35,540
Yes. I'll take a break.

542
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,320
Later, when you have recovered,
let's harvest together, okay?

543
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,300
Where are you going?

544
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:46,595
Sleep alone.
Enjoy a good night's sleep.

545
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,227
Really? Wow, but…

546
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,209
Just tell me straight.
Don't be such a coward.

547
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:57,510
Kyeong-ja who is already 45 years old,
every night is still "hot".

548
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:00,686
What's the point of having a gym trainer husband?
if it's useless?

549
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:04,846
Where is the man who called himself "Sparta"?
The one who said "it's hard to die"?

550
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,416
It hasn't even started yet and it's already finished.

551
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,643
Sparta what?

552
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,830
Sparta he said, basic bullshit.

553
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,956
The man died tonight.

554
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:26,016
The man died tonight.

555
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:37,763
Watch out, you'll choke.
if you eat grapes like that.

556
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,090
These grapes are so sweet,
dense and full, very tasty.

557
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,030
It is delicious.

558
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,400
Ouch, my shoulder.
Why does it hurt so much? Ouch…

559
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:51,140
Gosh, why does your body ache so much?

560
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,180
I moved around a lot this afternoon.
I think I sprained my shoulder.

561
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:55,774
Lots of movement during the day?

562
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,744
What are you doing?

563
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:02,080
Oh my, maybe it's me
possessed by a perverted demon, huh.

564
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,740
This afternoon I passed in front of the park,

565
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:07,605
then there are school children
smoking in large numbers.

566
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:09,379
Why should I just keep quiet?

567
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:11,621
I came straight away
and teach them a lesson.

568
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:12,547
Cigarette?

569
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,865
Not one of them,

570
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:20,820
there are thin, tall, white-skinned children?

571
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,293
The child lives in our apartment,
his name is Min-woo...

572
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:26,106
...who bought instant noodles a few days ago.

573
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:26,915
Correct.

574
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:29,780
One of them,
someone left their bag.

575
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:33,160
When I checked,
there is a student card in the name of Kim Min-woo.

576
00:29:34,353 --> 00:29:36,704
Oh, he came to the store this afternoon.

577
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,660
He said his father told him to buy cigarettes.

578
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,870
I said I can't
selling to minors.

579
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:44,100
But as soon as I let my guard down for a moment,
a pack of cigarettes is missing.

580
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:47,125
- Oh my. What is that...
- I suspected it, it turned out to be true.

581
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:50,219
Even though her face is plain. I didn't expect...

582
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:53,052
Ji-hyun, that kid
not what you think.

583
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,932
What?

584
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:55,459
What do you mean?

585
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,852
Hyun-ji told me,

586
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:02,011
Min-woo has been here for a long time
bullied by his friends.

587
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:05,305
Because of fear, even other friends
no one dared to help.

588
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:23,409
Hey, take a photo today
homeroom teacher's panties,

589
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:26,376
then send it to us.

590
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,180
If not, your history is over.

591
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:34,555
Come on, turn to page 194, everyone.

592
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:37,860
You wrote it on the board, right?
This is the part you have to memorize, okay?

593
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:39,265
- Hey.
- We start from there.

594
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:42,279
- If you don't do it, you're finished.
- The sound is so small. Louder.

595
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:43,259
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,206
- Okay, let's talk about blood.
- Do it quickly.

597
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:52,626
Red blood cells carry oxygen,
white blood cells fight bacteria.

598
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:55,046
Platelets help blood clotting.

599
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:56,006
Tae-young?

600
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:57,919
- Sorry ma'am.
- Are you sleep deprived?

601
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,859
Don't sleep in class. Page 194.

602
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:03,933
Do you want to take the exam?

603
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,406
How far did you read it?

604
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,459
How far did you read it?

605
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,111
Teacher. Look at Min-woo, ma'am.

606
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,399
- Kim Min-woo. What are you doing?
- He took a picture of the bottom of Mom's skirt.

607
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,946
Ma'am, it's not like that, I…

608
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:20,211
Oh my gosh. Is mom okay?

609
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:22,156
Kim Min-woo. What are you doing?

610
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:23,655
- Ma'am, that's not it.
- Hand over your phone.

611
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:25,249
- That's actually…
- Mobile now.

612
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:31,261
Come to the teacher's room.

613
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,375
Come on, quickly.

614
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,103
Explain. Why did you take the picture like that?

615
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:50,866
What do you think
while doing it?

616
00:31:52,372 --> 00:31:55,708
Min-woo, Mom never
thought you were like this.

617
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,092
So answer honestly.

618
00:31:58,566 --> 00:31:59,392
Ma'am,

619
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,419
- I actually…
- Female teacher.

620
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,132
I forgot to submit
field trip registration form.

621
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:06,872
Me too, Mom.

622
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:08,059
Put it there.

623
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,359
Okay. See you, ma'am.

624
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,540
Well, tell me.
Explain it properly.

625
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:21,310
What do you think?

626
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:25,333
You know what,
how dangerous is that act?

627
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:26,615
Kim Min Woo.

628
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,556
You, you look innocent,
but it turns out that's how he behaves.

629
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:34,298
Mom, the child is like this
can't be advised well.

630
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:37,996
- You have to call his parents, then he'll regret it.
- Sir, please, don't call my father.

631
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,770
In that case,
why are you being so naughty?

632
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,346
What is your problem really?

633
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:45,773
I am wrong…

634
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:49,253
This child…
Okay, ma'am, call his parents immediately.

635
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:55,075
Min Woo.

636
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:58,069
Why were you like that just now?

637
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:01,003
The Min-woo I know is a maniac, huh?

638
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:02,783
You look gloomy, huh?

639
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:05,662
Smile.

640
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:08,354
We were just kidding.

641
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,372
Come on, let's lighten the mood again,
Let's go to coin karaoke, shall we?

642
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,027
Today, my father…

643
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,115
- Damn it.
- I have to go home…

644
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,654
Oh, don't act so important.
Come along quickly!

645
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,607
Oh my, that kid.

646
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,190
The load is bigger
from his own body.

647
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:28,542
What a bunch of brats.

648
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:30,416
They don't know themselves.

649
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:33,383
Come on, let's chase.

650
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,020
I told you,
don't lower your hands.

651
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,673
How are you?

652
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:01,946
Can't do it right?

653
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:04,073
You are crazy.

654
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,900
A moment…

655
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:07,467
How about this?

656
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:10,453
Record, record. You're recording, right?

657
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:12,887
Why don't you obey?

658
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,669
Hurry up.

659
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:20,633
Min-woo, smile. This is just true.
Straighten your arms.

660
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,829
If you frown, I'll kick you later.

661
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,578
If it's still like that,
I will step on it. Understand?

662
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:31,886
Oh, my throat is dry.

663
00:34:31,983 --> 00:34:34,115
Min-woo, time's up.

664
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,913
Min-woo, quickly put in the money.

665
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:37,793
Good grief.

666
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:40,433
Don't be stunned, enter quickly.

667
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,199
Those bastards…

668
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:44,424
Even inserting money is not working.

669
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,626
Min-woo, sing a song.
So that you can relieve stress.

670
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,519
Come on, here's the microphone. Take it.

671
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,966
Hurry up, I'm annoyed to see you.
Why are you so slow?

672
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,208
- That's enough. I'm going in now.
- Not yet.

673
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:58,184
- Let go of me, let go.
- Calm down.

674
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:01,143
- Those bastards.
- Calm down.

675
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:03,859
- Okay, I'm not coming in, okay?
- Calm down.

676
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,069
If you dare to act now,
the situation could get worse.

677
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,743
And it was Min-woo who was even more hurt.

678
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,643
In cases of school bullying,
the most important thing is clear evidence.

679
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,606
So, we have to be patient
and keep observing first.

680
00:35:13,664 --> 00:35:14,399
Hey, look at that.

681
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:29,803
Gosh, that poor kid.

682
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,723
This is too much.

683
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:34,335
So-hee, you recorded everything just now, right?

684
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,703
- That's it. Everything.
- Okay, we have to act.

685
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:37,810
Those damn kids
must be taught a lesson.
Correct.

686
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,966
Hey, why is Min-woo like that?

687
00:35:56,064 --> 00:35:56,555
What?
No…

688
00:36:05,477 --> 00:36:06,245
Geez...

689
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:11,226
Oh my gosh, Min-woo?
Oh, how is this? How…

690
00:36:11,373 --> 00:36:13,493
Mi-ri, are you okay?

691
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,020
Oh my, this kid is really…

692
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,200
Forgive me.

693
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:19,400
Oh my gosh. Hey!

694
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,020
What were you going to do just now?

695
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:28,246
Even though it's hard,
Are you really that reckless?

696
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,367
Min-woo, we know.
You must be very tired.

697
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,326
From now on, we,
the aunties here, will help you.

698
00:36:36,553 --> 00:36:37,660
Help?

699
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,530
How are the Aunts?
can you help me?

700
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:43,856
Why?

701
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:46,163
Why did Auntie save me?

702
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,239
Why don't you just let me die?

703
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:53,317
Min-woo, your father must be
it just depends on you.

704
00:36:53,342 --> 00:36:55,109
How could you say something like that?

705
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:56,115
My father?

706
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:59,702
He just drinks every day
and never cared whether I lived or died.

707
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,476
My mother? From the beginning,
can no longer be contacted.

708
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:05,626
Min-woo, now your father
is indeed having difficulties.

709
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,651
But that doesn't mean he doesn't care.

710
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,466
You are a very precious child to him.

711
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:10,539
That's right, Min-woo.

712
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:13,252
Today, we see it all
with my own eyes.

713
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:16,180
We will find a way, whatever it takes.

714
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:18,475
We will talk directly to the school,
to the teachers…

715
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,300
No need.

716
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,573
Please, don't do anything.

717
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,699
You think I've never
try anything?

718
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,600
I've told the teacher before.
I've even been to the police station.

719
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,202
But still nothing changed.

720
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,899
If I report to the teacher,

721
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:39,640
the next day,
I was beaten worse.

722
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:42,352
If I go to the police, they say:

723
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,753
"We already know,

724
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:46,952
Just go home first.

725
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:49,332
If it gets worse, then come back again."

726
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,385
Adults only know how to say,

727
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:56,712
"We will help you. Please be patient."
But for me,

728
00:37:58,418 --> 00:38:00,812
the waiting time is more torturous.

729
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:03,152
I feel like I could die at any moment
because you have to keep waiting.

730
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:07,851
How long should I wait?

731
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,543
When will you actually help me?

732
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,316
AHN TAEMIN

733
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,240
Want me to help you answer it?

734
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:33,310
No.

735
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:36,395
Don't...

736
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,926
...meddling in my business again.

737
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,839
Min Woo.

738
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,763
What should we do now?

739
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:00,993
Quickly bring cigarettes and beer here.

740
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:03,603
I told you, reply to my message quickly.
Do you want to die?

741
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:05,573
About to be hit again, just realized?

742
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:11,668
Hey, why are you ignoring my messages?
You are so rude.

743
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:14,689
You suddenly disappeared,
I thought he was dead.

744
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:19,146
Indeed, children who do not have a mother
not taught manners.

745
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:23,562
If you don't want to be hit again,
come to the park block 206 in five minutes.

746
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:26,194
If you don't come,
your girlfriend will be the one affected.

747
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:27,209
Fast.

748
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:29,542
Boyfriend?

749
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,756
What are you guys doing?

750
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,113
Wow. Min-woo has a girlfriend now, huh?

751
00:39:40,857 --> 00:39:42,508
Let go.

752
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:45,623
You think you can still go to school?
after doing this?

753
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:51,493
Who is currently
worrying about who now?

754
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:53,448
It's you who might
can't go to school tomorrow.

755
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:54,930
Worry about yourself.

756
00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:57,081
Why there is no
even a cigarette in your bag?

757
00:39:58,012 --> 00:39:59,995
If so, at least
bring money to buy it.

758
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:00,895
Unlucky.

759
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,507
Hey, he's coming.

760
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:06,981
Hey, you bastard.
What took you so long?

761
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:08,487
Hey, it's been five minutes, right?

762
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:09,781
Stop, everyone.

763
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,042
Just bother me.

764
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:14,254
Please let Hyun-ji go.

765
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,808
- Min Woo.
- Wow, so it's true you two are dating.

766
00:40:20,273 --> 00:40:22,073
Afraid of being beaten alone, huh?

767
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:24,075
Tonight, let you guys
feel it together.

768
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:25,249
So, who wants to go first?

769
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,023
New kid first?

770
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:28,439
Stop.

771
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:32,070
- Don't.
- Get up.

772
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,098
Hey, stay here.

773
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:36,256
Get up!

774
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:38,290
Hold him. Hold him!

775
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:45,858
- You said you were going to be hit, right?
- Sick?

776
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,119
He said he wanted to be hit, so we hit him.

777
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:52,030
- Stop.
- Feel it

778
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:54,119
Please, enough!

779
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,838
In that case,
Now it's your turn to get hit?

780
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,541
Stop right now!

781
00:40:58,566 --> 00:40:59,826
Oh my. It's just shocking.

782
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:07,566
Aunt!

783
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,693
Mother…

784
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:14,729
Park Hyun-ji, this time your mother appears too?

785
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,013
There are so many styles, huh?

786
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,850
Hand over the cigarettes
and the lighter now too.

787
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:25,352
What are these mothers talking about?

788
00:41:27,106 --> 00:41:29,033
Have to put out the fire first.

789
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,459
Wow, looks like I need to call.
fire engine.

790
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,810
This mother is really crazy, huh.
Want to die?

791
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:42,466
This fat mother.
What a coincidence to meet again.

792
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,299
At the same time, I'll reply to all of yesterday's comments.

793
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,860
Look at this kid.

794
00:41:45,946 --> 00:41:48,692
Smoking alone is not enough,
are you carrying a knife now?

795
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:50,065
Bad uniform.

796
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:50,999
Bad attitude.

797
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:52,435
And the worst thing is,
bad personality.

798
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,266
My aunt was even worse.

799
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:56,789
Because of Auntie,
My arms are bruised, my legs are bruised.

800
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,026
I've photographed everything, and I've
get a medical certificate.

801
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:03,315
- Oh, is that so?
- Auntie, we are still minors,

802
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,180
so willing to do anything,
will not be punished.

803
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,655
But you guys? You won't be safe.

804
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:08,599
If you do something wrong, it could be a problem.

805
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,359
It seems you have misunderstood.

806
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,266
I will never
hit first.

807
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:15,146
- But you guys started first.
- What is he talking about?

808
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,352
- Good grief.
- Geez.

809
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:20,525
Take!

810
00:42:21,153 --> 00:42:22,048
How?

811
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:24,181
Still want to try further? Can you?

812
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,869
Hey, is this a social gathering or what?

813
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:28,908
Senior!

814
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:32,428
Look at this. You guys brought
all the thugs are here apparently.

815
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:35,314
Are those the aunties you were talking about?

816
00:42:35,354 --> 00:42:36,394
Yes, it is true.

817
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,987
The history of these Aunts is over.
You won't win against my seniors.

818
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:41,315
Hey, how old are you guys?

819
00:42:41,346 --> 00:42:43,433
You guys show your ID card first.

820
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,719
Asking our age?
Do you want to give angpao or what?

821
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,120
Someone already brought a knife,
then there are adults who intervene.

822
00:42:50,506 --> 00:42:54,146
Yes, we can too
fight calmly now.

823
00:42:54,273 --> 00:42:55,633
Okay. Listen up, kids.

824
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:57,595
I have to go home soon
to marinate the ribs,

825
00:42:57,646 --> 00:42:59,686
so let's finish it
quickly. Okay?

826
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:00,955
What are you talking about?

827
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,846
Hit it!

828
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:03,051
Attack!

829
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:08,023
Come here!

830
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:24,309
Come here!

831
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,590
You are okay?

832
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,347
Mom, be careful.

833
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,700
Let go. of. her. hair.

834
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,765
Where are you running to?

835
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,820
Ah...

836
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:09,333
- Senior, where are you going?
- Son of a bitch…

837
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:12,843
You can't carry bags
properly, huh? What a jerk.

838
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,149
You guys listen carefully.

839
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:18,115
If you bother Min-woo again,
you guys are really going to be in trouble.

840
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,029
Who are you actually?

841
00:44:21,056 --> 00:44:24,769
Even his father doesn't care,
Why are you the ones interfering?

842
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:27,322
Want to know who I am?

843
00:44:27,723 --> 00:44:30,462
I am Min-woo's mother.

844
00:44:35,451 --> 00:44:37,318
I'm also Min-woo's mother.

845
00:44:41,893 --> 00:44:44,465
I'm also Min-woo's mother.

846
00:44:49,252 --> 00:44:50,671
I am Min-woo's mother too.

847
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,560
- There are four mothers, he said.
- It's all in the past.

848
00:44:55,466 --> 00:44:56,866
This is the final warning.

849
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,195
Never disturb
my son, Min-woo, again.

850
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:01,540
You will regret it.

851
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:02,821
I've recorded everything.

852
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:06,158
You guys smoke
and bothered my son, Min-woo.

853
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,751
Even carrying a knife.

854
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,291
Now the rules have changed.

855
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,720
Records of violence against junior high school children will be kept
until before entering university.

856
00:45:17,808 --> 00:45:19,646
What do you want to do now?

857
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:24,540
What a stupid kid who pretends to know everything
regarding child protection law.

858
00:45:24,593 --> 00:45:25,793
Let's see later.

859
00:45:26,046 --> 00:45:27,903
What are you looking at?
You damn brat.

860
00:45:28,206 --> 00:45:30,230
You still think that adults are
can be underestimated, right?

861
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:32,179
Okay. We'll see.

862
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,029
Tomorrow at school, the day after tomorrow too,
and the days after that.

863
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:35,936
Until you realize.

864
00:45:35,961 --> 00:45:38,630
I will wait for you guys
at school tomorrow morning.

865
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:43,726
See you tomorrow. And tomorrow again.
And so on. On. On.

866
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,694
What is this? It's all over,
then why were we called?

867
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:50,039
Oh my, that kid.

868
00:45:50,073 --> 00:45:53,600
I wanted to teach him a lesson,
it turns out it's finished.

869
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:57,953
But, who are you?

870
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,141
Perhaps
You just moved to block 213?

871
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:03,115
Yes. Nice to meet you. I'm Park Seung-ho.

872
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,419
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

873
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:06,393
You are a health-ssook coach…

874
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:08,019
- I?
- Yes.

875
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:11,207
Not Healthssook , but health.
Health trainer.

876
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,155
- That is.
- But who are you?

877
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,066
I live in block 209.
My name is Noh Kang-sik.

878
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:17,600
- The one that's always 'hot' every night, huh?
- What?

879
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,100
You heard it well, didn't you?

880
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,620
No, right? Maybe just
he himself is 'hot'.

881
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,453
Not so either.
I'm hot too. I'm great.

882
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:28,558
- Wow, you came so fast.
- Honey, are you okay?

883
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,028
- Why do you walk like a snail?
- Am I free?

884
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,580
- Have you hung out the laundry?
- That's all.

885
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,780
You have separated the white clothes,
colored clothes, and towels?

886
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,646
- Already.
- Have you used fabric softener?

887
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,920
- Already.
- Oh, yes. Organic waste, has it been thrown away?

888
00:46:39,953 --> 00:46:43,926
- Already.
- I will check one by one.

889
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:47,991
Just check. Why is your voice so loud?

890
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:50,900
Hyun-ji, let's go home. Fast.

891
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:52,496
- Hyun-ji, let's go home. Fast.
- Hyun-ji.

892
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:54,854
This kid, why is he here?

893
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:55,893
- Why are you here?
- Ouch.

894
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,580
- See you.
- See you.

895
00:46:57,645 --> 00:47:00,233
- Why did you hit someone's child?
- Come on.

896
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:04,648
If you dare to bother your friends again,
I will not remain silent.

897
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:06,780
Do you hear me? I'm a cop, you know.

898
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:09,166
I have seen all your faces.
No answer?

899
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

900
00:47:10,146 --> 00:47:11,340
I've recorded everything.

901
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:13,673
Hold your position for 30 minutes,
From now on.

902
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:14,450
- Start.
- Start.
Come on, quickly!

903
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:17,050
I am a police wife.

904
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:18,811
He will come back in 30 minutes.

905
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,444
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Teacher.

906
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,593
This is a recording
bullying case against Min-woo.

907
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:31,144
Just rude words are bad enough,
but the physical violence was very serious.

908
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:34,033
There are many witnesses too. Not just me,
but there are some other people too.

909
00:47:34,058 --> 00:47:36,780
If necessary,
we are ready to give testimony.

910
00:47:37,113 --> 00:47:39,574
According to the results of the Committee meeting
Combating Violence in Schools,

911
00:47:39,632 --> 00:47:43,046
The student perpetrator will be subject to level 8 sanctions,
namely forced school transfer.

912
00:47:43,993 --> 00:47:49,613
Principal, how is this?
Mr. Principal.

913
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:53,767
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- It doesn't matter.

914
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:55,967
Thank you very much.

915
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:58,996
I just got
regular candy on Valentine's Day.

916
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:01,123
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

917
00:48:01,155 --> 00:48:02,790
Min-woo, Hyun-ji.

918
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,193
Let's go.

919
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:09,036
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

920
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:10,620
What are they doing?

921
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:11,822
Oh my gosh, you guys.

922
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:13,719
What are you guys doing?

923
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:16,295
Smoking, huh?

924
00:48:16,379 --> 00:48:18,149
- Go, hurry.
- Hey!

925
00:48:18,202 --> 00:48:19,209
Pick up the cigarette butts first,
just left.

926
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,620
But these are not our cigarette butts.

927
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:27,100
- Tae-oh, shut your mouth.
- Okay ma'am.

928
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,426
Pick up with enthusiasm.

929
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:30,675
Chan-yeong, are you tired?

930
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:31,826
No, ma'am.

931
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:35,433
- Tae-min, pick it up more actively.
- Okay ma'am.

932
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,529
You don't need to bother like this.

933
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:47,290
Thank you very much.

934
00:48:47,836 --> 00:48:49,708
Fellow neighbors,
it's natural to help each other.

935
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,882
Sorry, may I know if you are
Have you got a job?

936
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:55,722
Yes, my old workplace asked me back.

937
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:57,656
I start coming in again next week.

938
00:48:57,713 --> 00:48:58,846
Great!

939
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,853
Oh my, thank goodness.

940
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,866
- That's very good news.
- Congratulations.

941
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,926
Thank you very much, everyone.
Thank You.

942
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:08,960
- You're welcome, don't be shy.
- Thank goodness everything went well.

943
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:18,856
Help me.

944
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,659
I really don't know anything.

945
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:25,603
I didn't see anything, really.

946
00:49:27,154 --> 00:49:29,034
Please. Help me.

947
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:34,187
- Moving, huh?
- Yes.

948
00:49:34,366 --> 00:49:35,453
What number?

949
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,179
11th floor, unit 4.

950
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:40,154
It was right above us.

951
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,755
I thought no one was occupying it
because it's been so quiet.

952
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,980
Previous owner
transferred out of town,

953
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,320
so it's been empty for a few months.

954
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,089
It looks like the unit is sold now,
so they are moving.

955
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,166
So far it has been calm.

956
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:54,906
Hopefully the residents are good people.

957
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:03,150
Lee Min-seon?

958
00:50:04,156 --> 00:50:05,403
But this is our home address.

959
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,839
Victims' Families Association?

960
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,013
Maybe it was for the previous occupants.

961
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:13,705
Previous occupants?

962
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:16,426
Sometimes letters still come
because they haven't updated the address.

963
00:50:16,486 --> 00:50:18,879
Yes, that makes sense.

964
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:20,920
Just give it to me.
I'll return it to the sender later.

965
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:22,321
Thank you very much.

966
00:50:22,346 --> 00:50:23,833
- Please get on.
- Yes.

967
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:28,563
Lee Min Seon.

968
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:31,984
I think I've heard that name before.

969
00:50:35,926 --> 00:50:37,446
BROTHER-IN-LAW

970
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:39,750
What else do you want to criticize now?

971
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:42,572
- Yes, Aunt Hyun-ji?
- Oh, Mi-ri.

972
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,826
Have you heard the news?
The house you live in now.

973
00:50:46,286 --> 00:50:48,039
He said it was a former house
place where people die.

974
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:51,145
He said there were parents
who lived alone, then committed suicide.

975
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:54,453
That's why his family rushed to sell it cheaply.

976
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,837
Who said that?

977
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,711
I met my friend earlier
who once lived in that apartment.

978
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,913
He said a few months
before you move,

979
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,155
someone jumped from the balcony of the house.
Oh, how is this?

980
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,880
That's why,
Don't just take it because it's cheap.

981
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:16,430
Wow, that must be the taste
It's not nice to live there, right?

982
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:17,589
How about this?

983
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:21,069
I already know.

984
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:23,060
What? You already know?

985
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:25,883
Auntie, let's continue another time.

986
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:35,590
- Unit 1004?
- Unit 1004?

987
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:37,976
It seems like they
the new occupant of the house, huh?

988
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:39,321
Yes, that is true.

989
00:51:39,355 --> 00:51:41,149
He said a few months
before you move,

990
00:51:41,303 --> 00:51:44,536
someone jumped from the balcony of the house.
Oh, how is this?

991
00:52:08,536 --> 00:52:11,420
Short, clear and to the point.
Unit 1004, building 213.

992
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:15,722
The person who lived before I moved in,

993
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:18,309
is it true suicide?

994
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:23,954
I said what? There is no secret.
that can be stored in this world.

995
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:25,967
So what?

996
00:52:26,374 --> 00:52:28,848
In someone's house,
It's only natural that someone died.

997
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,226
Ji Hyun.

998
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,740
Imagine how hard his life is
to choose like that?

999
00:52:33,787 --> 00:52:36,340
If it's not your own home,
it's easy to say.

1000
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:38,034
If it's not comfortable, just sell it.

1001
00:52:38,274 --> 00:52:41,948
Quick sale, moving.

1002
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,627
It's that easy, huh?

1003
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,718
Then forget it.

1004
00:52:45,978 --> 00:52:49,418
It happened long before you moved.
It has nothing to do with you.

1005
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:52,659
He's a nice person.

1006
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:58,580
After her daughter
died first, he lived alone.

1007
00:52:58,665 --> 00:53:02,058
Three days before he died,
He said he wanted to go see his son.

1008
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,979
At that time, I thought he was going to the grave.

1009
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,400
Drinking in broad daylight like this?
Are you selling it or not, shopkeeper?

1010
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,160
Drink it. Finish it.
Erase all those bad thoughts.

1011
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:21,586
Now maybe he has
happy with her daughter.

1012
00:53:23,006 --> 00:53:25,560
That's why you pray for the best
and be grateful.

1013
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,413
Where there is shadow, there must be light.

1014
00:53:29,013 --> 00:53:29,693
Correct.

1015
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:36,952
If it's because of him,

1016
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,643
I can buy this house at a cheap price,
means for me this is light.

1017
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:40,299
Well, that's it.

1018
00:53:40,346 --> 00:53:42,886
That's the right way of thinking.
Very positive.

1019
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:49,380
If you are picky about the condition of the house,
When can I have a house?

1020
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:50,732
After all the incident
also not in the house.

1021
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,251
That's it. It's different, Gong Mi-ri.

1022
00:53:57,771 --> 00:53:58,517
Moving house?

1023
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,551
Because it gives you goosebumps, right?
They say it's a house where people die.

1024
00:54:01,693 --> 00:54:03,853
Humans will surely die.

1025
00:54:03,971 --> 00:54:05,244
In the past, it was common to die at home…

1026
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:06,770
…and the funeral ceremony too
held at home.

1027
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:09,968
It was a natural death. But this is what he said,
someone jumped from the balcony.

1028
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,540
So, now your family
tell us to move?

1029
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,957
Mom knows now too.

1030
00:54:14,987 --> 00:54:18,507
He said we bought a house without
research it first, so Mom was very angry.

1031
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,403
The national team is a bunch of gossips.

1032
00:54:20,656 --> 00:54:22,620
Your family is indeed
can't keep my mouth shut.

1033
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,116
They're just worried.

1034
00:54:24,153 --> 00:54:26,846
Okay, let's just sell this house.
hurry up and move.

1035
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:30,986
In your opinion, with the money we have,
can you get a house as nice as this again?

1036
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:34,371
Besides, this house already has a reputation.
Selling it won't be easy either.

1037
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:35,537
If there is no other way,

1038
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:38,044
we just sell it
according to the purchase price and leave.

1039
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:40,077
Purchase tax, agent fees,
moving costs, wallpaper, flooring,

1040
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:42,799
- do you think all that is cheap?
- Then do you want to stay here?

1041
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,741
In a place where spirits are said to reside
do people who commit suicide still haunt?

1042
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:47,601
What?

1043
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:51,135
People say,
if there is a spirit of suicide in the house,

1044
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:53,733
There will be more to come later.

1045
00:54:55,267 --> 00:54:56,191
What could it be here…

1046
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:58,874
Are you babbling nonsense?

1047
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:03,211
Oops, sorry.
You know myself how fragile my mentality is.

1048
00:55:03,392 --> 00:55:07,355
Yes. Mental tofu silk
Even those who are beaten by junior high school students can shrink back.

1049
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,037
That's because they are still children.

1050
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,830
If I hit back, it could be serious.
For the protection of minors...

1051
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,920
What protection?

1052
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:18,140
If it wasn't for Kyeong-ja,
what is being strangled is not your shirt, but your neck.

1053
00:55:18,165 --> 00:55:19,882
You think kids nowadays
still like a child?

1054
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:21,115
Their bodies are bigger than mine.

1055
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,496
That's why you pretend to be sleeping
under the blanket, huh? Because of fear?

1056
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:29,756
That means my mentality
still plain and clean.

1057
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:30,710
Yes, it's very plain.

1058
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,860
Never mind. If you want to move,
move there by yourself.

1059
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,810
Moving alone?

1060
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:37,435
Must be together.
This is a hair-raising issue.

1061
00:55:37,473 --> 00:55:41,189
- Ah, go ahead and move with that spirit.
- Oh my. Shocked.

1062
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:45,356
Oh my, it's raining.

1063
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:48,184
Get out quickly, close the window,
then log in again.

1064
00:55:48,275 --> 00:55:49,575
- Fast.
- Lazy.

1065
00:55:49,899 --> 00:55:51,083
Okay, I'm going now.

1066
00:56:05,177 --> 00:56:07,170
Wow, the rain is really heavy.

1067
00:56:08,587 --> 00:56:12,627
Oh my gosh. What a shock.
Why did it suddenly fall like this?

1068
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:17,210
Tomorrow morning,
I have to go to the hardware store first.

1069
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:19,629
Oh, it's so cold.

1070
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:23,649
Slippers?

1071
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:25,572
It felt like there wasn't any.

1072
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,020
What are you doing?
Quickly close the lid and come in. It's freezing.

1073
00:57:06,412 --> 00:57:10,710
I die or you die?

1074
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,940
POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS

1075
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,753
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPECIAL APPEARANCE
FROM OH EUI-SIK AND BAEK YE-NI

1076
00:58:57,257 --> 00:59:01,150
If the waste has been sorted,
they couldn't possibly refuse to take it.

1077
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:03,403
It can't be left like this.

1078
00:59:04,455 --> 00:59:06,090
- Oh my gosh, I'm shocked.
- It looks like the perpetrator is a young woman.

1079
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:07,296
This is a crime.

1080
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,443
My phone has been dead for a few days now.

1081
00:59:09,488 --> 00:59:11,409
- Murder?
- If you want to cut it, just cut it all.

1082
00:59:11,434 --> 00:59:13,451
Why only some?
Half-heartedly makes things difficult.

1083
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,344
Next target.

1084
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,456
He is a man who lives alone.

1085
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:16,196
I?

1086
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,916
If I can catch the perpetrator,
will you believe me?

1087
00:59:18,203 --> 00:59:21,183
Only after his part time work
disappeared, the orders increased.

1088
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:22,449
Your order has arrived!

1089
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,550
