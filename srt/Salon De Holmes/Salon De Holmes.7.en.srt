Enjoy.

10
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,570
What?

11
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,166
Hey, excuse me.

12
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:49,080
You just got out of unit 902, right?

13
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:50,470
No.

14
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:53,460
But I clearly saw you
exit unit 902.

15
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:54,476
You're seeing things wrong.

16
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:55,789
What?

17
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,199
Excuse me, wait a minute!

18
00:00:58,626 --> 00:00:59,823
Wait!

19
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,403
Excuse me!

20
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:38,453
Oh my, you surprised me!

21
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:40,153
I was the more surprised one.

22
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,393
Why did you appear from there?

23
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:45,333
From there what do you mean? As a security guard,
I patrol here, there, everywhere.

24
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,473
Why? What's going on here?

25
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:51,219
That, please check above.
There was a suspicious man there earlier.

26
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,946
Who?

27
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,112
Come on out.

28
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,192
I count to three.

29
00:01:58,613 --> 00:01:59,539
One,

30
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,060
two,

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,187
three!

32
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:04,406
Who?

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,206
There is no one.
It seems you saw things wrong.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,820
Very weird.

35
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:15,953
I'm busy cleaning this up.

36
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,183
You know you can't be careless
stick this here, right?

37
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:19,623
I didn't stick anything.

38
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,276
Please patrol properly, okay?

39
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:39,373
Hey, where have you been?

40
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:41,723
It's been a few days,
you can't see, huh?

41
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,956
Let's eat.

42
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,988
Hungry, huh?

43
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,023
Smart kids.

44
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,683
Your necklace is still neat too.

45
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:01,063
Oh, you're hungry, huh?

46
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:05,670
Have you finished your food?

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,083
Finally,

48
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,396
EPISODE 7 - SUSPICIOUS NEIGHBORS
the threat that makes…

49
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,646
...our Gwangseon Jugong complex
scared every night...

50
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,793
The Little Mouse has been caught.

51
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:27,378
These three people are the ones once again
saved the Gwangseon Jugong complex.

52
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,620
Give applause!

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,649
Excuse me, just a moment.

54
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:35,523
As a mother raising children,

55
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:38,548
I did catch that guy
for the safety of children,

56
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,183
but I think the Block Leader
not actually Little Mouse.

57
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:44,743
- Really?
- Is it true?

58
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,235
At first we also thought
he is Little Mouse,

59
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:49,929
but it looks like he's just a copycat
who imitates the ways of the Little Mouse.

60
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,146
So, we can't relax yet.

61
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,939
You guys are too innocent, aren't you?

62
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,120
Time to believe
with that pervert's talk?

63
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,246
Yes, Yes, Yes,

64
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,578
I know he denies it as
Little Mouse just to escape punishment.

65
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,059
But believe me,

66
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,273
he is indeed the real Little Mouse.

67
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,420
Look, since he got caught,

68
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,966
there is none
another harassment case, right?

69
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,052
Even so,

70
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:18,508
could be Little Mouse
intentionally hiding for a while.

71
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,720
Oh, me too
have asked the police.

72
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:25,880
At this time, there are no other suspects,

73
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:27,873
besides the Block chairman.

74
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,539
- I'm grateful.
- Ouch.

75
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,060
- Finally…
- Stop it.

76
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,887
Now the perpetrator has been caught,

77
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:36,811
so don't spread gossip
useless...

78
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,092
...about the existence of another Little Mouse.

79
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,479
You all know, right?
Who maintains our property prices?

80
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,740
- We!
- Citizens!

81
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:45,740
The price of our house...

82
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,825
We take care of it!

83
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:00,942
Hand it over.

84
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,296
Touching other people's things
without permission is a bad thing.

85
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,864
I'm the one who allows it.

86
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:17,801
If he wants to eat, just take it.

87
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,314
Don't cry.

88
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:23,980
Auntie already said you can take it
whatever you want.

89
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,401
Auntie has given permission.
So, don't cry, okay?

90
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,260
Damn, you're defending him instead.

91
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:34,213
If he does something wrong,
must be reprimanded firmly!

92
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,906
If left alone,
Over time, his stealing habits got worse.

93
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,891
You still scold him,
even though I've allowed it?

94
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:40,930
Why are you like this?

95
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,777
Don't cry, okay? Don't cry.

96
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,104
Come here.

97
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,623
Defending is not the solution.

98
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:56,710
Please put me down.

99
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,476
I can walk by myself.

100
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:00,290
Oh, okay.

101
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,456
Here he is.

102
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,576
I am wrong.

103
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:17,006
Take this. It's a gift from Auntie.

104
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,299
Auntie really wanted to give it.

105
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,046
But from now on,

106
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,906
if you want something,
say first before taking it.

107
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:28,899
Promise?

108
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:31,632
What is this?

109
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:36,581
Kim Eun-byeol, what are you doing?

110
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,825
Did my child steal something?

111
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:41,817
Steal?

112
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:44,955
No, I don't mean that…

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,466
Kim Eun-byeol, tell the truth.

114
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,666
You stole?

115
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:50,460
Hurry up and say it!

116
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,004
I was wrong, ma'am.

117
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:55,793
Are you a beggar?

118
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,005
Why is it still small?
Have you learned to steal?

119
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,229
Did your mother teach you that?

120
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:03,936
Sorry, ma'am. I was wrong.

121
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,481
Why did you come?
starve your child like this?

122
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,133
You are too busy to be able to
feed your own child?

123
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,144
Should your child roam around at night?
just to buy noodles with small change?

124
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,487
Don't cry…

125
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:21,503
That's enough, right?

126
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,540
Mother works hard until she dies,
but you embarrass the family instead!

127
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,189
- You must be punished.
- Sorry ma'am.

128
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,698
I won't repeat it.

129
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:36,122
- What are you crying about? Don't cry!
- I was wrong. I won't do it again.

130
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,262
Cheon Aram!

131
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,395
What is this?

132
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:40,295
20 YEARS AGO
How did this happen?

133
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,173
Mother already told you
This is for your grandfather's memorial altar!

134
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:46,753
What about grandma?
and your aunts come? How is this?

135
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:48,755
Mom, I'm sorry!

136
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,740
I just want to help, really!

137
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,540
When did Mom ask for your help?

138
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,965
You're just causing Mom trouble.

139
00:07:57,035 --> 00:08:00,145
Why are you hanging around here?
and make a mess like this? Why?

140
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:04,413
Sorry, Mom. I won't do it again.

141
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:05,563
Get out there! Play outside!

142
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:07,417
Mom, I'm sorry.

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,443
Get out! Quickly!

144
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,430
I am wrong.

145
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:17,410
It doesn't matter.

146
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:20,120
Hey, Mom! What are you doing, Mom?

147
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:21,675
Mom!

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,756
You are the guardian of Cheon Aram?

149
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,490
Your daughter had a traffic accident
and is in the hospital.

150
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:27,636
Aram…

151
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:31,490
Excuse me, my daughter,

152
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,695
Cheon Aram, the little girl…

153
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:37,575
Aram… Please go there.

154
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,495
Aram!

155
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:53,021
No.

156
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,132
No.

157
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,024
No.

158
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,963
Aram, no…

159
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:10,690
No!

160
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:14,550
How about this…

161
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,412
No!

162
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,130
Aram!

163
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:38,349
Aram, forgive me, Mom!

164
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:42,135
No, Aram.

165
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,306
Move!

166
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,306
Can't you see the child is crying?

167
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,939
Wake up!

168
00:09:57,032 --> 00:10:00,845
Don't cry.
I'm sorry, Auntie. Auntie was wrong.

169
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:01,752
Don't cry.

170
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:04,499
Excuse me.

171
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,272
Auntie is wrong.

172
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,211
Are you crazy?

173
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,063
Oops, I'm sorry.

174
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:16,890
If he sees a small child crying,
he likes to lose control.

175
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,210
If you do this again, I will
report you to the police as a kidnapper!

176
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:23,103
Excuse me.

177
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,782
Sorry? Sorry what?

178
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,377
Are you just going to keep quiet?
see the child being tortured?

179
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:29,727
What do you mean tortured?
This is called educating!

180
00:10:29,969 --> 00:10:31,396
I can't educate my own child?

181
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,127
Educate what?

182
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,456
You shout at a crying child,
hit him,

183
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:38,657
let him starve,
drag him by force!

184
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,442
If that's not violence
towards children, then what?

185
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:43,213
Shall we ask the police about that?

186
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:46,073
Enough. Please, stop!

187
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:48,452
This woman is totally insane!

188
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:15,923
Want to eat your favorite tanghulu?
while drinking wine?

189
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:17,490
No need!

190
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,180
Well, it's about time
stop drinking.

191
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:24,145
Don't want to go back again
to an alcohol rehab center, right?

192
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:29,406
Smart ass.
We were both addicts back then.

193
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,940
Don't twist the facts.

194
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,003
I'm just in the early stages,
you who are already in the final stage.

195
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,840
Don't forget, you can recover,
it's thanks to my help.

196
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:39,806
Don't be pretentious.

197
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:43,711
Without me, you would have starved to death...

198
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:48,772
...because I can't eat by myself
and has long since entered the grave.

199
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,113
Yes, I admit that.

200
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,650
And now I don't like tanghulu anymore.

201
00:11:58,963 --> 00:11:59,983
I like salty bread.

202
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:03,210
Wine with salty bread?

203
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,110
What's that?

204
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,343
This is real.

205
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:38,063
Last night I dreamed of seeing feces
turns out it brings luck!

206
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,183
It's still this early in the morning, and I've already received my fortune.

207
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,505
What is a pile of money?

208
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:48,190
Wow, Park Seung-ho is going to get rich suddenly.

209
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:55,790
Hello.

210
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,457
Seung-ho, where are you?

211
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,620
He said he would help me
trying the new toast set menu.

212
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,860
Give me another 20 minutes.

213
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,260
- Okay.
- Yes, it will be here soon.

214
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,810
- Hurry up, okay?
- Okay.

215
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,116
What is this smell?

216
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:16,056
Who threw it away
littering here?

217
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,138
If Mrs. Gong Mi-ri finds out,
you're finished!

218
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,063
Oh my, why is this rubbish dumped here?

219
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,203
Geez.

220
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:23,449
Oh, it smells so bad.

221
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:24,823
Geez.

222
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,270
Where?

223
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,930
Cafe in front of school?

224
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:42,276
Are you sure that's your father?

225
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,465
Black windbreaker, black pants.
Isn't that Dad?

226
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,643
When it's time to go to school,
it was still very early in the morning.

227
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:49,450
Are there any cafes open that early?

228
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,381
Many cafes open at seven in the morning.

229
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:52,988
Dad likes morning coffee, right?

230
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:54,275
Coffee?

231
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,528
This is a cafe near the gym.

232
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:59,295
Usually he just drinks a hot Americano.

233
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,028
Why suddenly drink vanilla latte?

234
00:14:01,281 --> 00:14:02,681
Vanilla Latte?

235
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,363
Mom! My breakfast?

236
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,257
WELCOME.

237
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,226
Oh, that's right.

238
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,753
How could anyone
Who just exercised and stopped by the cafe?

239
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:25,691
Have customers?

240
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,400
Why are you like this?

241
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:32,790
How did he get here?

242
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,729
- Who?
- My wife.

243
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:37,730
But Seung-ho,
when did you tell your wife?

244
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,083
You can't keep hiding like this.

245
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,066
I will talk to him.

246
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,739
Make sure reporters don't get too close.

247
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:28,083
According to the management office,

248
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,572
occupant of unit 902...

249
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:31,293
...suddenly disappeared.

250
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,148
His phone was also completely inactive.

251
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:34,660
- Not active?
- Yes.

252
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:36,685
Did he disappear?

253
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:40,405
Even though he is missing, his family must be
You've reported it to the police, right?

254
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,137
But he lives alone.

255
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,932
It seems like his family is all in America.

256
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,985
The dog disappeared first,

257
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,218
then now his master is also missing.

258
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:55,904
What?

259
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,216
What's that?

260
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:03,509
- Oh my! Why?
- Why?

261
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:04,510
Cat.

262
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,943
I really hate humans
who torture helpless animals like this.

263
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,515
I am disgusted by people like that,
absolutely hate it!

264
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,980
This is a bag from Ji-hyun's shop.

265
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,410
Oh my gosh, that's crazy!
Why my shop bag?

266
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,534
- Friends!
- Oh, So-hee.

267
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:19,026
So-hee, don't look.

268
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:20,573
- Why?
- There's nothing for you to see here.

269
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:24,176
- Why? What's wrong?
- Oh, I told you, don't look!

270
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:31,596
Why?

271
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:44,672
This necklace…

272
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:48,545
I installed it.

273
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:50,500
What?

274
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,366
I've called the call center...

275
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,927
...and report a dead cat
to the cleaning service.

276
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
He said the officer would come.

277
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,883
I don't know
If you are a cat lover, So-hee.

278
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,380
I thought you just liked money.

279
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:10,983
Excuse me.

280
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:15,443
The mother cat
previously died in a car accident in this complex.

281
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,930
I put this necklace on for her child
not experiencing the same thing.

282
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,020
But it all came down to this.

283
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,380
If thrown away with a bag
from Gwangseon store,

284
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,770
most likely the perpetrator
one of the residents of the complex.

285
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,360
Mi-ri, about the residents of 902…

286
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,423
It looks like he lost his dog.

287
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:32,223
Perhaps…

288
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:36,138
Don't you think of dogs?
the occupant of 902 also died like this cat?

289
00:17:36,274 --> 00:17:39,988
I once saw a man pull out
lost dog search flyer.

290
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:40,921
What?

291
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:44,915
I saw from afar,
so I didn't have time to see his face.

292
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,152
But I'm sure he's a man.

293
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,999
Ah! It looks like him.
wearing a hooded jacket.

294
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,620
- Hooded jacket?
- Yes.

295
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,360
If the jacket has a hood,
means Little Mouse?

296
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,086
But why Little Mouse?
remove lost dog flyers?

297
00:17:57,253 --> 00:18:00,300
What if the man pulls out
the flyer is indeed Little Mouse...

298
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,326
...and he is also the one who killed
resident dog 902?

299
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,760
Maybe he'll stop harassing you,
but started committing other crimes.

300
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:08,939
The perpetrator...

301
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,265
...maybe not just
common animal killer.

302
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:17,698
Dead cat.

303
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,180
Missing dog 902.

304
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,670
The man who pulled out the flyer.
Hooded jacket.

305
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:23,881
Little Mouse.

306
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,276
OPEN AT 10AM,
CLOSED AT 9PM

307
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,830
Honey, would you like a snack?

308
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,309
My beautiful…

309
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,490
This morning, at Jangdae River
in Gwangseon District,

310
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:07,955
found the body of a woman
in his 20s in a black bag.

311
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:11,566
The fact that the body is bound
with the red ribbon making the police suspect,

312
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,670
this was done by the same perpetrator
with the case of a cafe employee in his 20s...

313
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,793
...found at a construction site
which was abandoned some time ago.

314
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:17,716
Black bag?

315
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:23,616
What's that smell? Ouch.

316
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,540
In that case…

317
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:29,868
There is also speculation this is a copycat crime.
from the old serial killer.

318
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,120
Seung-ho, why suddenly?

319
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:34,460
How do you see
latest serial murder case...

320
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,102
...what happened in Gwangseon District?

321
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:41,248
The similarity between these two cases is
the victim was strangled with a red ribbon,

322
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:43,977
- then the body was tied up and thrown away.
- Good.

323
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,621
Police suspect this is a copycat crime
who imitates the 'Ribbon Man',

324
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:49,028
serial killer
who killed 5 women...

325
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,348
...between 2003 and 2013,
then disappeared.

326
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:54,013
Why did it turn off? I was watching it.

327
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:56,194
Why do you watch news like that?

328
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:57,721
Hurry up and finish your homework.

329
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,734
Aren't you curious, Mom?

330
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:00,781
In our area a body was found.

331
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,094
He said he was a Ribbon Man copycat.

332
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,099
You don't need to know!

333
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:04,986
Hurry to the room.

334
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,812
Look at the serial killer victims.

335
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,340
Most are kidnapped, then disappear,
then killed.

336
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,458
The occupants of 902 suddenly disappeared.

337
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,525
His phone is also off.

338
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,421
KANG YOON-JOO, UNIT 902

339
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,060
How long has this been?

340
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:23,328
What if something happened?

341
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,396
Good grief.

342
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,150
BANG SO RAN

343
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:56,863
Hello, So-ran.

344
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,683
Yes, that's right, it was me who called.

345
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,189
I need help.

346
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:08,369
Sorry, I was too hard on you that time.

347
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,884
Indeed, all of that is true.

348
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,159
I'm the one who avoided it.

349
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:15,906
Changed numbers many times,
cut off contact with you guys.

350
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,230
Actually I don't dare
to meet Ji-eun's mother.

351
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:22,196
But even though it's late,

352
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:26,819
I still want to look for it now...

353
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,059
...to apologize.

354
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:30,645
But how, huh?

355
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:33,626
I have asked
to all our classmates,

356
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,846
No one knows
where is Ji-eun's mother now.

357
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,956
It seems I'm really too late.

358
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:45,210
Why not try searching
at the last address he lived?

359
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,497
Last residential address
before he died?

360
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,820
Even that would be hard to find.

361
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:53,276
Our teacher's wife might know the address.

362
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:56,315
But he is now
is at his son's house in Australia.

363
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,689
I will ask
when he comes home and tells you.

364
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,166
Thank you, So-ran.

365
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,281
I saw the news.

366
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:06,036
Whether the perpetrator is Ribbon Man or a copycat,

367
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:07,690
Hopefully with this,

368
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:10,420
Ji-eun's killer
can also be caught immediately.

369
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,756
Wasn't Ji-eun's mother in the end
also like being killed by that person?

370
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:16,429
Because he even committed suicide.

371
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,003
JEON JI HYUN
A moment.

372
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:24,167
Yes, Ji-hyun?

373
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:27,460
Has anyone seen the dog?

374
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:30,361
Organic waste bin?

375
00:22:32,077 --> 00:22:34,079
Do you remember what kind of dog
what do you see?

376
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:37,311
At that time, I went there
because there were reports from residents.

377
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,580
But when I came,
the carcass is missing.

378
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:39,357
What?

379
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:42,155
Who will
pick up a dead dog?

380
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,066
Disposing of dog carcasses
to the organic waste bin?

381
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,620
That guy is totally crazy.

382
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,305
Well then, do you remember who the citizens are?
who reported finding a dead dog?

383
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:55,900
Looks like the occupant of unit 701.

384
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,093
PLEASE FIND THIS DOG

385
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:58,570
Is this the dog you see?

386
00:22:58,923 --> 00:23:00,383
Small Pomeranian, white in color.

387
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:04,102
There is a lot of blood,
but it looks like a white dog.

388
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:06,928
Ah, right!

389
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,302
There is a yellow necklace.

390
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:12,948
That means this is indeed the resident dog of 902.

391
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:16,490
You believe that the dead dog
related to the disappearance of its owner?

392
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,553
This is weird, right?

393
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:21,886
The dog went missing, then was found dead.

394
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:25,356
Incidentally, the dog's owner
also suddenly disappeared.

395
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:26,433
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

396
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,523
The owner is suffering from loss syndrome
pet, then go to calm down.

397
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:33,340
Then who got rid of it?
dog carcass from the trash?

398
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,940
Maybe the owner found it first...

399
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,543
...and take it with you
to be buried in a proper place.

400
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,516
No.

401
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:41,843
If the occupant of 902 finds it
the dog's carcass, it must have caused a commotion.

402
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:44,193
He won't just keep quiet.

403
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:47,129
He must have stuck right in
flyers looking for perpetrators,

404
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,530
report to the police, maybe even
requesting a residents' meeting.

405
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,489
He loves his dog very much.

406
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:53,693
That makes sense.

407
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,685
PLEASE FIND THIS DOG

408
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,366
This is not just a case of...

409
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,706
...lost dogs or regular missing people.

410
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:13,373
This victim is a part-time cafe employee
which was discovered last month...

411
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,096
...at an abandoned construction site
in Gwangcheon District.

412
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:21,460
As you know, Gwangcheon District
only five minutes from Gwangseon District.

413
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,260
It can be said that,
The crime scene is on the border of two districts.

414
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,855
This is the victim that was found
yesterday at Jangdae River.

415
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,013
From the condition of the body, it is estimated
been dead for several days.

416
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:30,213
Take note,

417
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,800
The ribbon material on the two victims was different.

418
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:35,166
Cafe employee victim
tied with wool ribbon,

419
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,313
while the victims of the Jangdae River
with acrylic ribbon.

420
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,060
That means the perpetrator could be
are two different people.

421
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:41,153
The problem is here.

422
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,180
The ribbon knots on both victims were exactly the same.

423
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,200
That is true.

424
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:49,499
Even though the ribbon material is different,
wool and acrylic,

425
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,632
but the nodes are identical...

426
00:24:51,797 --> 00:24:53,560
...which is most likely done
the same perpetrator.

427
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:58,186
This is the first victim, a high school student, who went missing.
in an abandoned hospital in 2003.

428
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:03,086
The perpetrator was hiding at that time
in an abandoned hospital,

429
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:05,959
then kidnap the victim
when he came to test his courage,

430
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,123
after kicking out his friends.

431
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,839
I remember that high school girl. 3rd grade, right?

432
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:12,863
He was the first victim
of the five victims of Ribbon Man...

433
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,220
...and the only one underage.

434
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:18,636
Note the wool ribbon
that wrapped around Um Ji-eun's neck.

435
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,302
It's exactly the same...

436
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:22,820
...with the ribbon material used
on recent cafe employee victims.

437
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:27,260
Ribbon Man only wears
wool ribbon on the first victim.

438
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:31,773
After that, he used acrylic tape.
and even manila rope, in 2012.

439
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,540
So, the ribbon that Ribbon Man uses is also
changed since the first victim.

440
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,460
And now, in the two most recent cases,
the ribbon material is also different?

441
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:40,376
Correct.

442
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,049
We don't know the reason,

443
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:45,573
but obviously the ribbon material changed
in subsequent cases.

444
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:48,583
However, what is important is,
the knots are exactly the same.

445
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,322
Neither Ribbon Man nor his imitators,
the nodes are identical.

446
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:55,569
This knot is not a common knot
easy to make, huh?

447
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:57,780
If this knot is not an ordinary knot,

448
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:01,980
could it be that the perpetrator this time is
The real Ribbon Man?

449
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,900
Original or copycat,
what is clear is that we have to catch him.

450
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,086
If you're lucky,

451
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,656
we can find a bright spot for
the Ribbon Man case which became a cold case.

452
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,856
- Mi-ri.
- So-hee!

453
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:17,326
- I was just about to call you.
- Yes?

454
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:18,676
Here it is.

455
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,910
About the resident dog 902.

456
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:24,340
As you might suspect,
it looks like the dog is dead.

457
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,170
What?

458
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,583
Dead?

459
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,260
There are residents who found
dog carcass in organic waste bin.

460
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:33,915
But when the security guard went there after
received a report, the carcass was gone.

461
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,180
Lost? Where?

462
00:26:36,331 --> 00:26:38,213
That's the mystery.

463
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,763
Manner of death
similar to the case of cats,

464
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,248
including the method of murder,

465
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,847
then thrown in a black bag
in the trash.

466
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:47,350
Most likely, the perpetrator is the same.

467
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,386
So-hee, if you…

468
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:52,545
Wait a moment.

469
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:54,026
Yes, Sir.

470
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,560
Money refund?

471
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,565
Who said I was delivering?
leftover chicken to customers?

472
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,532
He said the chicken wings were missing?

473
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,505
Oh my gosh, seriously.

474
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,797
That house is really too much.

475
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:06,549
Okay, I'll be there soon.

476
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:09,435
How was it?

477
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,698
- Hurry up and go, it seems urgent.
- Yes.

478
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,860
This is for you!

479
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:21,230
What's this?

480
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:22,676
Why so sudden?

481
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,050
I feel bad.

482
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,140
I want to help search
cat killer,

483
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,112
but it always seems to be causing you trouble.

484
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:31,780
And who knows
I'll need your help later too.

485
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,862
Why do you say that?
We are friends.

486
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,149
Come on, eat quickly before it gets cold.

487
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,516
Enjoy, okay? I'll go first!

488
00:27:36,836 --> 00:27:40,151
Ah, the old man's birthday
It is nothing.

489
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:42,020
Your work is more important.

490
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,316
I am alright.
Just come if you have time.

491
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:47,620
The kids are okay, right?

492
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:49,616
Yes.

493
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:53,943
Okay, hurry up and finish your work.
Yes. Okay, I'll hang up first, okay?

494
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:57,472
Just got home, huh?

495
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,619
The mother from unit 1004, right?

496
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:02,726
Yes, but my child is not a baby anymore.

497
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:05,186
My daughter is in 3rd grade of junior high school.

498
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:08,619
Her name is Park Hyun-ji.
Just call me Hyun-ji's mother.

499
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:11,979
Just got back from the pharmacy, huh?

500
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:14,430
Parents like me need patches
as a medicine that must be in the house.

501
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,799
Nobody bought it,
so have to buy it yourself.

502
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,330
Oh, yes.

503
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:23,163
If I may know,
do you like fried chicken?

504
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:27,389
Sorry, but the side dishes are just like this.

505
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:30,780
Recently wanted to prepare
I feel lazy even with side dishes.

506
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:32,489
I am also like that.

507
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:36,144
Food in the refrigerator often rots
because I'm too lazy to cook.

508
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:40,504
Earlier the kids asked me what I was
eat seaweed soup on birthday.

509
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,100
But as I get older,
I often forget to eat.

510
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,249
Is it your birthday today?

511
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,242
Wow, what a coincidence!

512
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:52,355
But why are you eating this,
isn't it seaweed soup?

513
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:55,002
It's okay, I like fried chicken.

514
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:56,668
It's still warm.

515
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:58,634
Please eat first.

516
00:29:01,883 --> 00:29:03,481
Thank you, Hyun-ji's mother.

517
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,328
The occupants before you
also very caring.

518
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:16,064
You mean the occupants before me?

519
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,546
You two are very close, aren't you?

520
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,620
He's dead, right?
He is younger than you?

521
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,543
We are fellow seniors,

522
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,017
so just call each other brother and sister,
so you don't feel lonely.

523
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,630
Very delicious.

524
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,217
Mrs. Hyun-ji, let's eat too.

525
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,843
- Ah, happy birthday, yeah!
- Thank You.

526
00:29:36,036 --> 00:29:37,884
You prefer
sweet spiced chicken or original?

527
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:40,387
Hello.

528
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:44,183
You're the son of the RT mothers' chairwoman, right?

529
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:45,675
Yes.

530
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,804
I think we've met in the elevator before, huh?

531
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:50,326
Do you like chicken?

532
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,326
Want a free cola coupon?

533
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,686
- No.
- No.

534
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,359
No?

535
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:08,056
Doctor, you know how it feels.
body suddenly stiff as if frozen?

536
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,230
In the face of my friend's cries for help,

537
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:13,003
I could only cry and tremble.

538
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:15,013
I can't do anything.

539
00:30:15,216 --> 00:30:17,224
You must feel it
utter helplessness.

540
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:20,220
Guilty feeling
and trauma after the incident...

541
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,730
...which until now
still disturbing your life.

542
00:30:23,326 --> 00:30:24,456
What time is it,

543
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,817
Did you see the man's face?

544
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:30,156
Ji Eun!

545
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:31,506
Um Ji-eun!

546
00:30:31,703 --> 00:30:32,700
Ji-eun!

547
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,123
Um Ji-eun!

548
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:39,026
Ji Eun!

549
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:58,470
One more step,

550
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,430
your friend died.

551
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:03,643
Go now.

552
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:07,318
If you go,
you and your friends will be safe.

553
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,063
But if you open this door,
you both die.

554
00:31:15,547 --> 00:31:17,376
Mi-ri! Help me!

555
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,140
You decide.

556
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:26,486
Want to save your friend
or let him die!

557
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:28,566
Just report it.

558
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,946
Once you report,
your friend will be lost forever.

559
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,459
Ji Eun!

560
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:46,662
No. I didn't see his face.

561
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:51,390
He said if I come in,
he will kill my friend.

562
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,380
I'm grateful.

563
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,372
Thank goodness, how?

564
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:04,835
I mean, if at that time
you even see the perpetrator's face,

565
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,350
your trauma may be far away
more severe and difficult to cure.

566
00:32:09,383 --> 00:32:12,180
No, I don't agree.

567
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,090
I should have seen his face!

568
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:15,996
If I had seen it at that time,

569
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:19,077
I won't get trapped
in this endless regret.

570
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,156
I must have done whatever
to find it!

571
00:32:22,294 --> 00:32:23,494
I understand the weight of your feelings.

572
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,196
But now,

573
00:32:25,723 --> 00:32:27,370
you need to learn to differentiate...

574
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:30,893
...what can you improve?
and which ones don't.

575
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,993
Now, you have to decide,

576
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:37,696
will continue to be trapped
in the painful past,

577
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,893
or try to forget
and step into the future.

578
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:45,353
I'll prescribe anti-anxiety medication.

579
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,319
This might help you a little.

580
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:54,500
Hello,

581
00:32:55,454 --> 00:32:57,684
did it work?
contact the teacher's wife?

582
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,380
Yes.

583
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:00,028
He said he arrived
in Korea last night.

584
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:01,395
I spoke to him this afternoon.

585
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:04,500
Does he know?
where does Ji-eun's mother live now?

586
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:05,726
He doesn't know,

587
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,115
but it seems in the environment
where Ji-eun's mother used to live,

588
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:09,899
there are neighbors who are quite close.

589
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:11,593
He knows the neighbor's contact number.

590
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,860
Great! Please send me the contact.

591
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,636
Wow, the smell!

592
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,290
Eating noodles again, sir?

593
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,327
Autopsy results of the victim
on the Jangdae River is out.

594
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,996
Cause of death as suspected.
Suffocation due to pressure on the neck.

595
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:39,980
There are no other injuries,
besides the former resistance.

596
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,980
The victim was 26 years old.
Her name is Kang Yoon-joo.

597
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,250
Sir, what's the address?
at the Gwangseon Jugong Complex.

598
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,396
The victim's address
in Gwangseon Jugong, sir!

599
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:49,741
What? Come on, give it to me.

600
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,660
KANG YOON JOO,
GWANGSEON JUGONG BLOCK 213 UNIT 902

601
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:53,221
What?

602
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,781
This is an apartment
in the block next to our house?

603
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,980
POLICE - NO THROATING

604
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,140
Why spend a lot of money?
to renovate the garden?

605
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,201
Now this complex has been stamped
as the apartment where the murder took place.

606
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:02,887
House prices are sure to plummet.

607
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,754
This is really a loss for everyone!

608
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:07,433
That's right, there is no effect without a cause.

609
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:10,027
What is it?

610
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,346
Okay, I'll call you back later.

611
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,705
Excuse me.

612
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,146
Someone was murdered.

613
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:18,599
Killed in extreme cruelty.

614
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,896
Is it just a “loss” for you?

615
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,750
If you think about it, it's true.

616
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,835
One person died,
everyone is affected.

617
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,796
If this apartment is famous
as a place of serial murder,

618
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:27,563
who wants to move here?

619
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,083
And if the victim maintains his attitude,
How could something like this happen?

620
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:30,881
Attitude?

621
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:33,527
You said victim
killed because of his own fault?

622
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:36,411
I myself have seen him several times.

623
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,121
He never cleans
dog poop.

624
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:39,700
He is rude and impolite.

625
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,934
So, since it bothers you,
did he deserve to die?

626
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,153
If your own family is the victim,
you dare to say that?

627
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:44,833
What?

628
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:46,835
You're cursing my family now?

629
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,580
No one's safety will be guaranteed.

630
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,035
Anyone can be a victim, including you!

631
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,180
What? It's you!

632
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,060
- Ouch!
- Geez.

633
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,880
I didn't like you from the start!

634
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:55,066
Is it wrong for me to speak my mind?

635
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,859
- No, don't be like that.
- Let go.

636
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,340
Don't just badmouth people
dead person!

637
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:08,063
You, huh?

638
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,183
You who spread
gossip about Um Ji-eun?

639
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,153
Am I lying?

640
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:14,436
Everyone knows...

641
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:17,909
...Ji-eun likes to spread charm
to male students.

642
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:20,189
He's been rumored to be in school.
You must know too, Mi-ri.

643
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:21,251
Did you see it yourself?

644
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,813
Have you ever seen
Ji-eun seduces a male student?

645
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,230
If there is no smoke, there will be no fire!

646
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:31,145
He must be up to some shit
until the perpetrators are chased.

647
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:34,223
You yourself are safe,
but why is Ji-eun missing?

648
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,850
There's definitely a reason!

649
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:40,350
Maybe he is the one who is willing to go
with the perpetrator.

650
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,580
I told you, don't talk carelessly.

651
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,616
Apologize! Apologize now!

652
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,976
- I am sorry!
- Let go!

653
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,696
Never talk about it
Ji-eun is like that again!

654
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,290
I am sorry!

655
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:57,290
Oh my gosh, how is this?
There was a lot of blood.

656
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,410
Is my nose broken?
Oh my gosh, how is this?

657
00:35:59,435 --> 00:36:00,602
- Damn it!
- Are you okay, ma'am?

658
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,216
Sick!

659
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:04,749
In the manager's office, there is medicine.
Let's treat it first. Come on.

660
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,995
- Let's see later!
- You won't report it to the police, will you?

661
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,449
I…
I don't know!

662
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,352
How will it be?

663
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,786
Oh, Gong Mi-ri.

664
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,793
Why are you today?
like a possessed person?

665
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:19,469
You're like a loose bull,
attack without thinking.

666
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,808
His words were insolent,
but if this happens, you can be sued.

667
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,500
What's actually going on?
with you today!

668
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:27,738
I don't know.

669
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:31,633
He lives in the same area as me,
but I don't even know anything.

670
00:36:32,342 --> 00:36:34,014
I'm so annoyed with myself.

671
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:38,003
I only care about parking, trash
and other things that bother me.

672
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,792
- Please look at this.
- But I don't even care about him.

673
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:40,780
Thank You.

674
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,876
Ma'am, good afternoon.
Please look at this for a moment. This is my sister.

675
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,036
Please take a look at this for a moment.

676
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:48,658
- Take a look first.
- Good.

677
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,799
Thank You.

678
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,700
I just think
he's over the top about his dog.

679
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,701
Never thought of helping.

680
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,114
I didn't know he was missing,

681
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:59,082
didn't know he was dead.

682
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:00,592
You think it's just you?

683
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,315
We all live like that.

684
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,872
That's the reality.

685
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:05,946
Living behind concrete walls,

686
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:08,372
who had the chance
pay attention to your neighbors?

687
00:37:11,426 --> 00:37:14,315
Sorry, I'm going home first.
I need a break.

688
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,332
- Yes.
- Go away.

689
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:17,066
Take a break quickly.

690
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:18,239
- If you need anything, just call.
- Yes.

691
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:23,239
He said he was strangled to death.

692
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:28,086
Oh, the body was wrapped in bright red ribbon.
Crazy, that person is mentally ill.

693
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,112
RIBBON MAN

694
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:39,820
WOMAN KIDNAPPED AND STRANGLED TO DEATH?
WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS KILLER, RIBBON MAN?

695
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,043
Not here.

696
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:56,936
What's missing?

697
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,103
Scissors.

698
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,483
This one?

699
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:01,710
- Three?
- Three!

700
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:04,303
If it's scissors... This one?

701
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:05,763
This is good, right?

702
00:38:07,013 --> 00:38:08,197
- How much does it cost?
- How much does it cost?

703
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:08,996
- Jinx!
- Jinx!

704
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,232
The scissors we bought
along with the ribbon was lost.

705
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:15,228
Scissors?

706
00:38:16,857 --> 00:38:17,823
Are you sure?

707
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,504
ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE VICTIM'S FRIEND, G,

708
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,578
ON THAT DAY, THEY BOUGHT
CRAFT RIBBON AND SCISSORS

709
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,180
CHLOROFORM, GENERAL ANESTHESIA

710
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,050
READY TO DELIVER

711
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,470
The body was found
in the Jangdae River...

712
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,883
...he said the girl who lives in 902.

713
00:39:10,262 --> 00:39:11,379
Impossible.

714
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,336
Occupant 902 dead?

715
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,993
Want a free cola coupon?

716
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:17,990
No.

717
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,819
Perhaps…

718
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,145
GONG MI-RI

719
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,225
Ah, finish the delivery first.

720
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,076
GONG MI-RI

721
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:33,889
He said he was strangled to death.

722
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:36,167
They say this is the work of a Ribbon Man impersonator.

723
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:40,060
Oh, the body was wrapped in bright red ribbon.
Crazy, that person is mentally ill!

724
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,243
Hello?

725
00:41:19,712 --> 00:41:20,882
Hospital?

726
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,716
Looks like you've got the wrong number.

727
00:41:27,546 --> 00:41:28,566
Who?

728
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:38,355
Park So-hee writes down the contact
Gong Mi-ri's mother is on the emergency contact list.

729
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,393
Now we can't
contact Park So-hee.

730
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:46,913
Has it worked?
contact your primary doctor?

731
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:53,223
Maybe I'll need your help again later.

732
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:02,363
The number you are calling
is currently unreachable.

733
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,343
So-hee, why can't you be contacted?

734
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:07,335
I'm in the hospital,

735
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:10,228
Yul's condition is very bad.

736
00:42:10,253 --> 00:42:11,390
Please contact me immediately.

737
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:16,890
So-hee had time to call.

738
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:18,996
At 20.07?

739
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:22,082
Seven past eight?

740
00:42:24,986 --> 00:42:26,656
Have you been able to contact Yul's guardian?

741
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:28,242
Not yet.

742
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:30,116
How is the child?

743
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,162
His heart function is now down
below 10 percent.

744
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:35,222
We need to put in an ECMO machine immediately,

745
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:38,506
but without the consent of the guardian,
we can't do anything.

746
00:42:38,942 --> 00:42:39,995
I will find it.

747
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,735
Whatever the way, I have to find him.

748
00:42:41,817 --> 00:42:43,108
Please ASAP.

749
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:44,889
This is the first time
Park So-hee could not be contacted.

750
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:45,955
Good.

751
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:55,970
Park So-hee,

752
00:42:56,676 --> 00:42:59,869
you are always crazy about money
and persistently earn money for your child,

753
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,422
but why exactly
you disappeared today?

754
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,429
Eight o'clock at night?

755
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,803
- He delivers food?
- Yes, that's what I remember.

756
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:30,533
He said he wanted to take me to block 2,
then after that there was no more news.

757
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:33,500
So, Gwangseon Jugong is
final shipping destination?

758
00:43:33,726 --> 00:43:37,151
Could he possibly come home after that?
Maybe he was too tired and fell asleep.

759
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:39,652
Do you know where So-hee lives?

760
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,492
So-hee.

761
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,000
Are you sure he's home?

762
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:47,326
So-hee.

763
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:49,837
Looks like he's not in.
You have the key, right?

764
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,040
Oh, he's not home yet.

765
00:43:57,647 --> 00:44:01,006
Usually at this time,
He's already home. Strange.

766
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,349
He eats and sleeps here?

767
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:15,343
This is indeed a restaurant warehouse,
but he asked for a very cheap room,

768
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:17,608
so i let him wear it
just by paying for electricity and water.

769
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,760
He's not the type to turn off his phone.

770
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:27,020
Autopsy results on woman's body
surnamed Kang, in his 20s, has come out.

771
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,900
The cause of death was
suffocation due to pressure on the neck.

772
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:34,340
The victim was strangled with red acrylic tape.

773
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:36,846
Place of dumping of corpses
on the Jangdae River...

774
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,959
...known to be only 15 minutes away
from the victim's apartment...

775
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:43,200
and is an area without CCTV,
thus becoming a supervisory blind spot.

776
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,539
Police estimate the perpetrator
very familiar with the area around the crime scene,

777
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:47,006
thus expanding the investigation.

778
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:48,117
There isn't any.

779
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,110
Where is he?

780
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:51,877
Hey.

781
00:44:53,763 --> 00:44:56,259
Sir, you may do it now.
wandering around like this?

782
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,406
What is your business here?

783
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,906
If I don't come,

784
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:01,026
people can
thought Dad was dead.

785
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,680
If you have seen me
still alive, come home.

786
00:45:03,753 --> 00:45:05,757
Do you know the woman in unit 902, block 213?

787
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:08,547
Young woman who lives alone
and keep dogs.

788
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,493
The body was found
on the Jangdae River, he said.

789
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:13,701
I heard the news.

790
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:15,826
The girl is a cheerful girl.

791
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:17,926
I think the culprit is...

792
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,347
...maybe stay
in Gwangseon Jugong too.

793
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:24,120
Some time ago,
The woman's dog was found dead.

794
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:26,720
You still like to daydream.

795
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,026
Come on, go home.

796
00:45:30,384 --> 00:45:32,360
I brought pizza, sir.

797
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,756
I've stopped eating late night snacks.

798
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:35,509
Take it home and eat it yourself.

799
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:37,766
Have you forgotten?

800
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,380
Dad's last day at school,

801
00:45:41,335 --> 00:45:42,953
Dad bought pizza
and said something to me.

802
00:45:43,738 --> 00:45:45,338
I never forget.

803
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,150
This is not your fault.

804
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,363
I'm leaving because it's time.

805
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,956
So, you hurt me,

806
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:04,239
and then just leave?
Is this how you comfort me?

807
00:46:04,285 --> 00:46:06,860
I resigned due to my personal matters.
This is my decision.

808
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,723
What's the matter?

809
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,497
Tell the truth!

810
00:46:10,215 --> 00:46:11,248
You still have to pass,

811
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:12,981
even though I'm gone.

812
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:16,887
Otherwise we won't
ever met again.

813
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,428
Eat this, then live your life.

814
00:46:19,382 --> 00:46:20,648
You focus on finishing school,

815
00:46:21,222 --> 00:46:22,468
I started a new life.

816
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,016
Eat slowly.

817
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,225
I bought this while remembering that day.

818
00:46:55,018 --> 00:46:56,011
I'll eat later.

819
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:57,245
I will come again.

820
00:46:57,683 --> 00:46:58,518
Gwang-gyu.

821
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:02,460
Since you moved to Gwangseon Jugong,
the incident with the block leader…

822
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:03,851
The man got his reply...

823
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:05,585
...for his own actions.

824
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:08,904
My move to Gwangseon Jugong...

825
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:10,538
...it was destined.

826
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:12,417
Isn't all this...

827
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:14,168
...it would be even better for you, sir?

828
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:22,608
Wow, pizza?

829
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:24,072
Want to spend it?

830
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:25,512
Oh, thank you!

831
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:27,965
Usually...

832
00:47:28,827 --> 00:47:31,972
...people my age think
pizza makes stomach upset,

833
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:33,086
but I do not.

834
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:37,392
I even like to invite
my wife to the pizza restaurant.

835
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,020
Please eat as much as you like.

836
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:42,399
Why is it tied up so complicatedly?

837
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:48,163
Why is it so hard to open?

838
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:50,003
Good grief.

839
00:47:52,392 --> 00:47:53,402
It's very difficult.

840
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,115
You…
Don't you find this sad?

841
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:25,660
Oh, let me sleep.

842
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,230
GONG MI-RI

843
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:31,196
Tang-tang furu-furu.

844
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,671
GONG MI-RI, 1004
Tang-tang furu-furu.

845
00:48:32,696 --> 00:48:33,309
Oh my gosh, what a headache!

846
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:34,976
Tang-tang furu-furu.

847
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:38,864
It tastes sweet and salty. Tang-tang-furu-furu.

848
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,140
The number you are calling
is currently unreachable.

849
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,180
Why is there no one to contact?

850
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:46,716
Yes, ma'am? Have you heard anything?

851
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:49,306
Yes, he said after the last delivery.
in block 204, unit 406,

852
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,789
his phone immediately died.

853
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,116
406?

854
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:54,509
Okay, thank you.

855
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,560
Did you sleep well?

856
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:27,136
Working 12 hours non-stop...

857
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:29,756
...makes you lose sleep, right?

858
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:30,926
That's right, right?

859
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,821
The child of the RT mothers' chair?

860
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,971
The person who came out of unit 902 that night…

861
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:41,930
Excuse me!

862
00:49:43,026 --> 00:49:44,800
- Is that you?
- Yes.

863
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:47,563
Is this the shirt that's causing the problem?

864
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,049
My mother hates this dress.

865
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:54,260
He said it was ugly and shabby,
always asking me to throw it away.

866
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,973
But this is my favorite dress,

867
00:49:56,873 --> 00:49:58,079
comfortable,

868
00:49:58,793 --> 00:49:59,620
warm.

869
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,280
If I wear it like this,
it feels like no one can recognize me.

870
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,641
For me, it's like…

871
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:08,319
What is it? Armor?

872
00:50:09,293 --> 00:50:11,180
Yes, armor.

873
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:14,512
Don't tell me you…

874
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:15,499
Are you disappointed?

875
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:17,959
What if I'm the Little Mouse?

876
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:23,970
Good grief.

877
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:30,470
Or...

878
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:34,503
...shocked by the naked person
in front of women now doing this?

879
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:36,123
Funny, right?

880
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:45,156
I just took off my pants...

881
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:48,075
...and they were already scared themselves.

882
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,621
They screamed and ran away.

883
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:54,926
Even though they all usually act arrogantly.
Damn it.

884
00:50:57,626 --> 00:50:58,570
But...

885
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,610
...Yoon Joo...

886
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:02,509
...different.

887
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:09,606
He didn't scream or run away.

888
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:11,345
Why live like this?

889
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,710
You have never
totally in love, right?

890
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,590
If you love someone,
you wouldn't do something as despicable as this.

891
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,696
When you think of the person you love,
you won't be able to do this.

892
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:33,470
Freezing?

893
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,200
Don't catch a cold.

894
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:44,492
He was the first person...

895
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,100
...who really worries about me.

896
00:51:49,227 --> 00:51:50,365
It's embarrassing,

897
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,487
but here it feels nervous.

898
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,693
Pounding.

899
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,710
For the first time,

900
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:03,270
I feel alive.

901
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,570
Are you in love?

902
00:52:05,652 --> 00:52:06,860
On the occupants of 902?

903
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:08,965
What is 902? 902?

904
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:10,432
He's not '902'.

905
00:52:10,472 --> 00:52:11,772
She's Yoon-joo!

906
00:52:12,072 --> 00:52:15,992
Kang Yoon Joo!

907
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,520
Please, save me.

908
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,383
I have a sick child.

909
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:38,630
Yul would die if I wasn't around.

910
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:40,684
Please, give me a chance.

911
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,083
Please, save me.

912
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:55,535
Stay cool.

913
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:57,932
It won't kill people right away,

914
00:52:58,625 --> 00:52:59,838
except animals.

915
00:53:02,823 --> 00:53:03,995
Cat…

916
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:06,738
You killed him?

917
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:10,320
You are also the one who pulled it out
that missing dog poster, right?

918
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,327
Of course.

919
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,189
On the poster,
there is Yoon-joo's phone number.

920
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,236
If everyone knows the number,

921
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:18,950
very dangerous, right?

922
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:20,289
But why did you kill him?

923
00:53:21,973 --> 00:53:23,998
You like it.
Why kill?

924
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:28,543
Want to know something funny?

925
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:30,796
Look at that?

926
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:33,650
It's Yoon-joo's favorite aromatherapy candle.

927
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:36,610
When the candle runs out,

928
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:39,008
you will go with him...

929
00:53:40,696 --> 00:53:42,329
...so that he won't be lonely.

930
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,828
Why me?

931
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:47,874
Why did I have to die?

932
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:50,360
I never did
anything to you!

933
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:52,208
What did I do wrong to you?

934
00:53:52,598 --> 00:53:57,191
Why do I have to die?
Let me go! Please!

935
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:02,290
Damn it.

936
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,573
You also killed 902 this way?

937
00:54:18,611 --> 00:54:19,653
Why did you kill him?

938
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:23,806
Sometimes in life, we are forced to.

939
00:54:24,453 --> 00:54:25,413
Like tonight.

940
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:29,653
Do not come close!

941
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,944
You can kill other people,
but I do not.

942
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:39,296
I will not die,
don't want to die!

943
00:54:39,713 --> 00:54:41,033
I'm a mother!

944
00:54:43,273 --> 00:54:45,665
Do not come close.
I said don't come any closer!

945
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,007
It is okay.

946
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,647
Stay cool.

947
00:54:56,754 --> 00:55:00,427
I will be there soon
make you wake up again. Calm down.

948
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:02,670
Calm down first.
Calm.

949
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,287
It is okay.

950
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:27,716
Who are you?

951
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,480
That…

952
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,056
Did you order chicken from Hotdul Chicken?

953
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:34,341
Who eats chicken?

954
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:36,194
I'm on a diet.

955
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:40,807
Ah, just a moment.
I smell something strange.

956
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:42,487
What smell?

957
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:44,992
Wait.

958
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,746
Wait. I just wanted to make sure.

959
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:50,331
Mom! Hey, Mom!

960
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,826
Mom!

961
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:54,687
This is a trespassing violation
to someone's house, you know?

962
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,173
Why lie? You said earlier
didn't order chicken, but what is this?

963
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:58,880
You're hiding something, right?

964
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:01,626
Good grief!

965
00:56:02,753 --> 00:56:03,566
This.

966
00:56:04,526 --> 00:56:06,513
Take this. Just take it.

967
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:09,526
Is it just because of that chicken?
I'm being treated like a thief?

968
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,423
Earlier the chicken was hanging on the doorknob,
I think it's free.

969
00:56:14,528 --> 00:56:15,673
Is this yours?

970
00:56:16,648 --> 00:56:17,323
No.

971
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,483
- Then get out. Right now!
- Excuse me.

972
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:20,943
No need to apologize, get out!

973
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,780
- Okay, I'm out.
- Get out quickly!

974
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,556
Who deliberately ordered
chicken to someone else's house?

975
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,260
Is it just for fun?

976
00:56:36,846 --> 00:56:38,636
Or a fake order to trap?

977
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:43,956
Unit 406.

978
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:52,963
404.

979
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:13,440
I put this on so that
The street cat didn't get hit again.

980
00:58:06,325 --> 00:58:08,475
Now it's just us
who can find it.

981
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:10,622
They said the house was empty?
But the water meter is moving.

982
00:58:10,848 --> 00:58:13,820
So, units 902 and 405
both belong to the RT mothers' chair.

983
00:58:13,906 --> 00:58:15,815
The perpetrator of the 902 case is already known.

984
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:18,000
New security guard, Kim Gwang-gyu.

985
00:58:18,273 --> 00:58:19,392
You must know about Ribbon Man.

986
00:58:19,487 --> 00:58:20,527
I know everything.

987
00:58:20,606 --> 00:58:21,692
Now I will let you go.

988
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:22,985
So-hee is in danger.

989
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,512
We all need to get to the 405 now, quick!

990
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,064
Damn, you crazy psychopath.

991
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,664
He's still here.

992
00:58:31,236 --> 00:58:33,022
How about this, So-hee…
