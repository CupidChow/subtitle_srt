00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,420
What is this? Problem
what are you doing now?

13
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,649
I actually bought this cafe.

14
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:51,180

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,820
Fifty million won?
50 MILLION PURCHASE CONTRACT

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,375
Fifty million is cheap.

17
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:58,496
This place is on the rise.
The business is also very good.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,942
Trending or whatever
That, you're out of your mind, aren't you?

19
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:02,619
Just trust me once.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,139
I've tried working on
here and it turned out to be a good fit for me.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,340
He will indeed succeed.

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,939
During my internship as
barista at our cafe,

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,260
he got a lot of experience
and his abilities were recognized.

24
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:12,371
Moreover, Seung-ho is very
expert at making vanilla latte.

25
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:13,780
Vanilla latte?

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,300
What is your relationship?

27
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:19,383
Sorry, I haven't
introduce myself.

28
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:21,419
- I'm Oh Hee-soo.
- Hee-soo?

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,459
- I used to be Seung-ho's neighbor when I was little.
- Yes, just live in the same neighborhood.

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,099
So, you love
Park Seung-ho's first?

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,539
Seung-ho, why do you have to bring this up?
That? It will just be misunderstood.

32
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,942
Oh my, your relationship…

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,420
We happened to meet at the gym.

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,408
He said he had
cafe, so I stopped by.

35
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,633
The place is nice,
the visitors were crowded.

36
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,419
Then it happened that Hee-soo
said he would close the cafe,

37
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:45,740
- so I decided to take over.
- Enough with all your excuses.

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,356
- Please cancel the contract!
- Darling!

39
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:55,019
If so, you will lose
the down payment of five million won.

40
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,795
- It doesn't matter?
- You think I'll give up?

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,579
The stamp ink
it's not dry yet!

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,059
Don't embarrass me like this.

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,459
I didn't mean to take it
That's it. That's the legal rule.

44
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:08,457
You can cancel
contract or continue it...

45
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,821
...but down payment
non-refundable.

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,022
Listen, he said he can't.

47
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,491
Please feel free to chat. I
will take a call first.

48
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:18,756
Hee-soo, don't worry.
The contract is still safe, right?

49
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:23,746
Wow, almost got cancelled
because his wife came.

50
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:26,602
Before he gets suspicious, I have to
add part-time staff.

51
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,860
Don't worry, I already
advance the payment date.

52
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,569
Take care of everything yourself.

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,339
And find another gym
From now on.

54
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:39,764
I am now forty years old.

55
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,025
After several sessions
just a personal trainer, I'm tired.

56
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,099
I can't be forever
Coach. Hyun-ji is also grown up.

57
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,459
At least talk about it
first with me.

58
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,819
Am I not your wife?

59
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,317
Precisely because of me
knowing your reaction like this,

60
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:52,379
that's why I didn't talk.

61
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:57,082
We haven't separated yet,
but emotionally, we are divorced.

62
00:02:57,617 --> 00:03:00,897
I will sign, so
be happy with your first love!

63
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,540
- Darling…
- Let go!

64
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,820
Gosh, that's so scary.

Wrong! I really am
Ribbon Man!

Um Ji-eun!

186
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,118
One step forward
again, your friend will die.

187
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,329
Mi-ri, help me! Mi-ri!

188
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:18,839
You don't know the feeling that
I will bear it for the rest of my life...

189
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:22,092
...after surviving
alone...

190
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:26,130
...and leave
my friend there.

191
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:29,635
If God gives me
a chance to turn back time...

192
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,920
...I will not make
the same decision.

193
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,820
I will bite, scratch...

194
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:37,620
...anything for the sake of
save my friend.

195
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:40,340
My friend…

196
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:44,260
Please have a drink first.

197
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,684
I…please let me meet you
with Park Tae-hun just once.

198
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,371
I saw a man earlier
suspicious in the apartment.

199
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:55,556
And Park Tae-hun
smiled when she saw the man.

200
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,355
- Smile?
- I'm sure he was smiling looking at her.

201
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,580
Could be that man
is Ribbon Man.

202
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,220
We have to find out
through Park Tae-hun. I…

203
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,460
I have to find him.

204
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,099
- Hey.
- Yes.

205
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,725
- Where is Park Tae-hun?
- Still being escorted by Detective Oh, right?

206
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,169
Hello, what?

207
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,539
The child always makes
problem! We have to go.

208
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,340
- What?
- Fast!

209
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,699
- What is the problem?
- Fast!

210
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,980
Wait a minute here!

211
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,060
Hey, what's up?

212
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,979
THIRTY MINUTES AGO

213
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,520
Sir, you know this includes
human rights violations, right?

214
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:42,691
If you don't help me
urinate, just let it go for a moment.

215
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:43,733
I promise I'll be fast.

216
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,300
Get it done quickly.

217
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,154
Thank You.

218
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:10,670
Hey, are you done yet?

219
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:13,722
Not yet, still need
just a little more time.

220
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,187
Hello. Da-eun?

221
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,126
This is Dad. Dad is still working, son.

222
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:23,857
Yes dear.

223
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,684
Oh my gosh, today
your birthday huh?

224
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,320
I'm so sorry, work
today is a bit long.

225
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:34,260
Dad will be home as soon as possible
Maybe. Wait, okay?

226
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,672
Hey! What are you doing?

227
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,660
Hey, you crazy person!

228
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,049
Hey, is anyone out there?

229
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:48,720
Mother...

230
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:55,620
...now please let me go.

231
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,674
May 21, 2025, ten o'clock at night,
Park Tae-hun was declared dead.

232
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:14,044
No!

233
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,279
Hey!

234
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,008
How are things?

235
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:23,700
Already dead.

236
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:57,547
Gong Mi-ri!

237
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,447
Ouch…

238
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,459
All this time I've only been blaming
Park Sohee who is too closed off,

239
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,104
it turns out you're even worse.

240
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,240
I heard from people. They said
Ribbon Man's first victim was your friend?

241
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,263
Why is everyone
is this too much?

242
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:24,322
Makes me laugh.

243
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:26,249
But how is this?

244
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,580
The child is dead. All the clues
about Ribbon Man also disappearing.

245
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:41,035
- Hello?
- This is Hyun-ji's mother, right?

246
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,219
Who's this?

247
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:45,298
I, the resident of the unit
1204 in Block 213.

248
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:48,725
Madam? Is there something you need?
what at this time of night?

249
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,421
I got a call from Bang So-ran.

250
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:52,701
Bang So-ran?

251
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,406
He said, Hyun-ji's mother
looking for me?

252
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,449
Ji-eun's mother's friend who
what you are looking for is me.

253
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:08,623
I live on the same floor as
Min-seon, like brother and sister.

254
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,579
Lee Min-seon?

255
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,386
His only child
already dead.

256
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:15,906
He lives alone.

257
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:19,907
Three days before he died, he
said he wanted to go see his son.

258
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,131
At that time, I thought
he wants to go to the grave.

259
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,220
Min-seon lives at home
where you live now…

260
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,219
FIRE TRUCK ONLY

261
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:33,160
…until before he died.

262
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:02,606
Leave him alone for now.
It must have been very hard for him.

263
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:34,505
POLICE LINE - NO ENTRY

264
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:45,281
HUNTERS ARE NOT HUNTED.
HE'S JUST HUNTING.

265
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:47,594
Hunters are not hunted.
He was just hunting.

266
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:50,751
Hunters are not hunted.
He was just hunting.

267
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,579
HUNTERS ARE NOT HUNTED.
HE'S JUST HUNTING.

268
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,859
He who wants to be
the hunter decided to die,

269
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,820
in a way that reflects
himself as a true hunter.

270
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,178
Instead of being hunted, he chose
kill himself.

271
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:06,866
He refused to be prey and
died in a decent way.

272
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,040
Now is the time.

273
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,499
It's time for the hunter
actually shows himself.

274
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
IT'S THE HUNTER'S TIME
REALLY SHOW YOURSELF.

275
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,339
Oh spirits
guardian of heaven and earth,

276
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,979
bless my sister's cafe
this is with good energy,

277
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,099
and open the way
abundant sustenance, amen.

278
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,979
Hey! Hey, Park Soo-ji.
What are you doing?

279
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,739
This cafe is already quiet like this, you
Stick it like that, it just gets quieter.

280
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,104
This is a cafe, isn't it?
roadside shrine.

281
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:31,480
Bro, I bet
all my savings are here!

282
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:33,739
If this cafe fails,
I will never be able to get married.

283
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,259
Oh well, that's it.

284
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:36,524
Just stick it on.

285
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:39,747
Stick on the toilet, on the machine
coffee, at all tables too please.

286
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,090
- This.
- What's this?

287
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,739
I got this from
a very powerful shaman.

288
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,740
If you install this, in a month,
Guaranteed good fortune and your cafe will be busy.

289
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,298
- Are you serious?
- Guaranteed.

290
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,982
But Sis, are you sure?
Is this place strategic?

291
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,899
You're not fooled, are you?

292
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,019
What are you talking about?

293
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:02,315
I have surveyed, noted
busy times, all of them.

294
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,325
But now it's broad daylight
and not even an ant could be seen.

295
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:09,130
At exactly 12 noon, they
will come for lunch.

296
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:10,393
It's lunch time!

297
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,276
- Really?
- Starting today,

298
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:14,197
I'm on a low-carb diet
and high in protein.

299
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,819
Hey! Don't eat here.
People can see from outside!

300
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,419
Bro, there must be a woman
beautiful sitting in front of the window,

301
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,379
because that's what
attract customers.

302
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,806
Who's beautiful? Hey,
don't wave your hands!

303
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,299
Later people will think it's this person
BBQ restaurant, not a cafe!

304
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,859
That's enough. Make coffee for me.

305
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,700
- Get out of there! Go!
- America…

306
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,595
Aunt called me
to that house, yeah?

307
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:41,664
Why? Why Auntie?
call me there?

308
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:44,976
What does Auntie want me to do?
catch Ribbon Man?

309
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,746
I am also very
want to do it.

310
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:51,740
But how?

311
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:54,002
LEE MIN-SEON

312
00:19:54,003 --> 00:19:55,780
Please help me, ma'am.

313
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,747
Finally this thing
back to the owner.

314
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:13,234
Sewing box, yeah.

315
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:18,395
When my sister's relatives cleaned the house,
they almost threw it in front of the house.

316
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,521
But I took it.
Too many memories.

317
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,300
I feel like this thing is indeed
should be in your hands.

318
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,215
My sister made it.

319
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,619
She used to make dolls
like this to fill the time.

320
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:47,138
He said, it makes
her mind is calm. Beautiful, right?

321
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:58,180
How come this is here?

322
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,841
These… are the scissors that Auntie asked for…

323
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,000
These scissors are exactly the same
like the one Ji-eun bought that day.

324
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:12,860
Why these scissors?
disappeared from Ji-eun's bag?

325
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,626
Is it possible for someone to wear it?

326
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,220
If not Ji-eun,
means the perpetrator…

327
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,088
Only two possibilities, right?

328
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,820
Mi-ri, what do you think?

329
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,275
That…

330
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,713
I don't know.

331
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,831
At that time, I didn't know.

332
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:38,915
At that time, you also showed a pitiful face
the same thing while asking to be saved?

333
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,423
Forgive me.

334
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:45,056
I am really, really sorry!

335
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:47,139
Sorry, sorry! Always sorry!

336
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,585
Go away! I don't want to see your face.
again. Never come back!

337
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:02,215
That day, it should have been
I didn't do that.

338
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:06,139
What's wrong with the child?
as small as Mi-ri back then?

339
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,160
Ji-eun!

340
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,996
Even though it's late,
I want to apologize.

341
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm sorry, Mi-ri.

342
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:18,260
I… May I apologize?

343
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:26,740
Ji-eun, it's been more than two years
twenty years since you left .

344
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:32,780
Mother still lives in the world
where you are no longer there.

345
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,740
Mom is really cruel, isn't she?

346
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:46,595
Tomorrow, I will go to the flower market.
with the residents of unit 1204.

347
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,340
It's like taking care of a baby, yeah.

348
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,343
The only comfort
big that I have…

349
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:51,859
Of course.

350
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:54,857
Every time I think of Ji-eun...

351
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,826
...there are people by my side
who gives me strength.

352
00:22:58,046 --> 00:23:00,077
Our daughter
died unjustly,

353
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,019
but the police have not found it yet
not a single clear clue.

354
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,340
Now I even
have a son...

355
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,198
...who cares for me
like his biological mother.

356
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,331
This is a special service.

357
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,699
Kyung-sook from unit 1204...

358
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,998
... and Ji-hyun from Gwangseon Store
whose heart is as beautiful as her face.

359
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,300
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.
Everything got wet.

360
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,237
Mr. Kim, security officer
who always helps in emergencies.

361
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:32,906
He is a really kind person.

362
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,475
Maybe my depression is getting worse.

363
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:43,469
What my suspicions will be
will it subside if I take medicine?

364
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,871
I have to find a way to
free yourself from this sense of suspicion.

365
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:50,032
I can't go on living
in such torment.

366
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,456
Who does Aunt suspect?

367
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:57,049
FRIDAY, 2:00 PM
VICTIM FAMILY MEETING.

368
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,628
Meeting of the victim's family?
Do you mean the families of Ribbon Man victims?

369
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:04,518
What's this?

370
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:11,943
"It's hard... can't... endure..."

371
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,379
This must be writing from
previous page.

372
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:18,723
But why the page
previously there was none?

373
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:25,524
Oh, my!

374
00:24:25,738 --> 00:24:27,178
Not asleep yet?

375
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,540
Don't tell me you were waiting for me?

376
00:24:32,544 --> 00:24:36,140
Look, your favorite snack.
This is premium quality.

377
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:41,395
It's so sweet. It's a persimmon.
from Sangju. So special!

378
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,299
What is this? In this condition
our finances now?

379
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,499
Thinking about the installments
I'm already short of breath.

380
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,299
Oh my gosh, you don't
can you stop nagging?

381
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,510
Is the anger enough? I
I've also been looking for money as best I can.

382
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:53,461
Managing a cafe is tiring,
know. Where is the place quiet too?

383
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:56,576
What? He said before
famous place?

384
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,859
Don't be fooled
by your first love?

385
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,979
What are you being deceived by?

386
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,460
- Just stop before you lose more.
- Stop how?

387
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,567
Yes, no need to say anymore.

388
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,766
Earlier, my mother called and asked
do we want to sell the house?

389
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,939
I won't move.

390
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,899
Isn't this a house?
your friend's mother's?

391
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,275
The child was killed, the mother
commit suicide here too.

392
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,499
Maybe this house is full of revenge.

393
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,869
If you're afraid, stay
just at your mother's house.

394
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,018
Do you want a divorce or what?

395
00:25:23,894 --> 00:25:25,322
Oops, sorry!

396
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:28,109
That's enough.

397
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:31,616
Wait a minute, I have to
pick up the phone to call Mom.

398
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:34,795
Hello, ma'am?

399
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:36,731
What's this?

400
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:38,257
House?

401
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:39,924
Not for sale yet.

402
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,140
PUNGPA VILLA, UNIT 301, CHEOLSAM 2.
We found everything.

403
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:44,780
I am alright.

404
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,100
WE FOUND EVERYTHING–MANAGER KIM
I'm not afraid of ghosts either.

405
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:47,790
Pungpa Villa, unit 301?

406
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,851
Goodbye!

407
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,686
PUNGPA VILLA, UNIT 301,
CHEOLSAM 2, BUPYEONG

408
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:56,060
Why did Auntie keep it?
my old house address?

409
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:59,119
I made a formal request.

410
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,555
Please tell me who
ask you to look for this address,

411
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,802
and everything you know.

412
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,355
This is the only payment
to know everything?

413
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,231
Because my husband recently
rarely take home his salary in full.

414
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,019
Please. Please.
its meaning.

415
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:15,524
Ouch.

416
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:19,218
- What is the name?
- Gong Mi-ri.

417
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,484
Gong Mi-ri...

418
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:24,539
Oh, right. I
who wrote it.

419
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:27,515
Wow, I'm having a hard time
also looking for this address.

420
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,339
From Gangbuk, Dobong,
Gwanak, all the way to Bupyeong.

421
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,420
He keeps moving around.

422
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:34,420
So, you have
meet him?

423
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:38,902
No, he's dead.

424
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:42,987
- Accident?
- He committed suicide.

425
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,100
Suicide?

426
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,111
When is it?

427
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:50,100
- February this year.
- February?

428
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:56,220
I wrote this address on
January. That means exactly one month earlier.

429
00:26:56,345 --> 00:26:58,739
- Did he really commit suicide?
- What?

430
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:01,739
I mean where is there anyone who
intend to commit suicide in a month,

431
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:03,995
but instead had time to ask for help
looking for info about other people?

432
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,660
Info? That aunt?

433
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,490
Actually the time I gave
this address, he asked for one more thing.

434
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:14,603
He said he could help find it
know about one more person?

435
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:17,746
Who? Who is
did he ask to be investigated?

436
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:21,195
If you want to know about
that, minimum 100,000 won.

437
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,240
There is a lot of information.

438
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:36,595
Oh my God, killer
his son, he said?

439
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,899
Yes, right!

440
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,819
Don't worry, spray paint
it is easy to clean.

441
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,379
Don't worry too much,
Yes. Come on, let's disperse first.

442
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,819
- Oh my, there's always something.
- It's so scary.

443
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,840
Hyun-ji!

444
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:47,275
- Mom, why did you just come now?
- What is this?

445
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,859
Oh, don't ask.

446
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,899
Chairperson of the Mothers' Association
suddenly screaming hysterically.

447
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,539
He said we all
kill his son.

448
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:56,555
Luckily there was a security guard earlier
come quickly and take him away.

449
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,674
Hyun-ji, come in
in. Let Mom take care of this.

450
00:27:58,831 --> 00:27:59,911
Good.

451
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,420
MY CHILD KILLER!

452
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:10,259
Thank you for coming.

453
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:14,016
My house, Ji-hyun's house
also sprayed like this.

454
00:28:14,196 --> 00:28:15,875
He said, we have to
bring his son back to life.

455
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,500
He was screaming,
until I got goosebumps.

456
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:22,246
Then what? The victims who
Can the dead also be brought back to life?

457
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:24,775
They don't care at all
thinking about the victim's family.

458
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,944
But earlier he had time
say strange things.

459
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,969
He said, someone told him
if the real perpetrator is Kim Gwang-gyu.

460
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:35,345
- Kim Gwang-gyu?
- Yes.

461
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:37,633
Why did he say that?

462
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:38,698
That's it…

463
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:41,435
Even though he is free
without charges and living a normal life.

464
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,740
Why bring it up again?

465
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:44,307
Kim Gwang-gyu?

466
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,129
- What are you doing?
- Oh my! Oh my…

467
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,459
So, in this house no
is there any furniture?

468
00:28:58,514 --> 00:28:59,954
I have everything I need.

469
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,785
The head of the Mothers' Association suspects you
as the mastermind behind Park Tae-hun's actions.

470
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:08,435
Do you know who it might be?
want to frame you as the perpetrator?

471
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,499
If I had known, I would have
I have handed it over to the police.

472
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:15,899
I think the person who set you up was
who became Park Tae-hun's mentor.

473
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,225
What do you mean?

474
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,330
That day…

475
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:22,865
The day you were arrested
because he was accused of being the perpetrator.

476
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,279
At that time, Park Tae-hun was preparing
committed the third murder in unit 405.

477
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:30,236
Just at that moment, there was an anonymous
who reported you as the perpetrator.

478
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:34,386
With that false report, Park
Tae-hun has free time to act.

479
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:36,820
While we are looking for
So-hee becomes confused.

480
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:40,500
Wow, you really have an eye for detail.
big on Park Tae-hun's case, huh?

481
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:43,860
He said, you are a friend
Ribbon Man's first victim?

482
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,286
Maybe that's the reason?

483
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:48,861
How do you know about that?

484
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,459
When I was released,

485
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,980
I heard from the mothers.
Not intentionally eavesdropping.

486
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:56,460
More than twenty years you
living with that much burden, right?

487
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,855
If I could, I would like to catch him.
with my own hands.

488
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:03,294
Twenty one years ago...

489
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,239
...maybe Ribbon Man is aware
the student he let live...

490
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,328
...is a mistake
the biggest in his life.

491
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,755
Because he failed to finish off
the source of the problem at that time.

492
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,779
You mean, I can
just be the next target?

493
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,499
If I were Ribbon Man, I would
I think that's a logical step.

494
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,610
But we'll see, I
who died or he who died?

495
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,980
Now I'm not a little girl anymore
who is a coward and he is old.

496
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,980
I don't believe Park
Tae-hun acts alone.

497
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,699
I'm sure there's someone who
direct or order him.

498
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,555
In your opinion, the anonymous reporter
is the real Ribbon Man?

499
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,099
Whether he is Ribbon Man himself or
the person ordered by Ribbon Man.

500
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,352
What if
we work together?

501
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,260
Or rather, form a coalition.

502
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:53,420
Coalition?

503
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,540
Good grief...

504
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,259
- Sir, wait a minute!
- Yes.

505
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,099
Drink this first
before continuing work.

506
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:07,421
Wow, I'm being a bother, huh?
Thank you, I'll have a drink first.

507
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,140
This...

508
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:18,019
Mom, have you ever heard?
The late Aunt Lee suspected someone?

509
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:20,919
Even if Min-seon
I was suspicious...

510
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:24,146
...he's not the type
likes long stories.

511
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,987
Ah, but there is one thing that
it made me worried.

512
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:30,487
What?

513
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,059
It's a rainy day like this indeed
It's delicious to eat jeon kimchi.

514
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,044
He didn't stop by for a while
for a long time.

515
00:31:36,045 --> 00:31:37,630
- Why?
- But one day

516
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:41,059
- he came with a worried expression on his face,
- Your face looks so pale.

517
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,299
And suddenly he said…

518
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:47,783
Sis, if someone wants to
you kill is in front of your eyes...

519
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:49,380
...you will really
kill him?

520
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,540
Someone he wants to kill?

521
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:55,793
Why? What's the problem?

522
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,900
There is someone
the one I want to kill.

523
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:01,927
And I myself am the one
will do it.

524
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:05,164
I think he means killer
who destroyed his daughter's life.

525
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,629
So I don't
ask further.

526
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,700
Then, about a week
then, the incident happened.

527
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:14,426
If I'm not mistaken, two days
before the meeting of the victim's family.

528
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,940
Oh, no need to bother.
I can clean it myself.

529
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:24,163
You have helped me a lot.
I should be able to do something too.

530
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:27,219
She said the head of the mothers
RT is giving you trouble, huh?

531
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,300
Well, after a while he
will also stop on its own.

532
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:34,897
Speaking of residents
Previously in this house, Mrs. Lee Min-seon…

533
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,619
You mean Mrs. Lee?

534
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:40,927
It turns out she is my best friend's mother.
I just found out recently.

535
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:43,820
- Wow, this world is really small, isn't it?
- What a coincidence.

536
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,243
Are you close to him?

537
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,933
What is the person like?

538
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,798
He is a very good person.

539
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,541
I live alone, but
he often sends side dishes.

540
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,659
The person is really caring.

541
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,815
I don't know why he
choose such a difficult path.

542
00:32:57,545 --> 00:32:59,101
I want to know too.

543
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:00,820
Sorry, just a moment, okay?

544
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:07,555
Yes. Okay, I'll be there soon.
I have to go now.

545
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,220
Oh, sorry to bother you.
Thank you very much.

546
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,376
Tired... Can't do it
hold on again...

547
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:16,025
Alone... too...
cold... want to rest...

548
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:17,958
...will follow soon...

549
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,524
Will follow?

550
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:24,871
I'm tired.

551
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,717
It doesn't feel like it
able to survive again.

552
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,076
Want to rest now.

553
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:40,933
Mother will be following you soon, son.

554
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,634
Is this possible...

555
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,187
"Tired? Can't do it
holding on any longer? Want a break?

556
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:52,559
Will be following soon?”

557
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,755
What is this? Pieces
half-finished sentence?

558
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:59,784
That's the writing printed on the page
previously due to strong pressure.

559
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:02,059
I copy all
that I can read.

560
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:04,704
So you mean, it's a will?

561
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:07,306
Therefore, we need to
ensure the contents.

562
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:08,747
Well, look at this.

563
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,763
Post from previous page
leave a mark. But it's gone.

564
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:16,259
So you think, the page that
missing maybe a will?

565
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,730
But even though it is true that the letter
testament, there is something strange.

566
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:22,435
Ji-hyun, what is a will?

567
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,219
Well, last message before
someone died, right?

568
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,259
Well, take a look at this.

569
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,700
There are still notes on
the following pages.

570
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,139
If so, this is not the page
last, not written on the last day.

571
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,306
That is true.

572
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:41,979
I completely understand your concerns.
about his death and it was natural.

573
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:45,711
But you're not suspecting
there was a murder, right?

574
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,380
Why not?

575
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:50,819
If it was really murder,
there must be a trace.

576
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,979
Fingerprints, footprints,
signs of violence.

577
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,779
But there is not one
even such evidence.

578
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:57,724
Therefore, it is concluded
as suicide.

579
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,447
But now
you question that...

580
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:03,518
...means you're accusing
incompetent police.

581
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:06,179
You know that's an insult
against the authorities?

582
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,820
I'm not insulting anyone.

583
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,739
But is it possible that they
missed something?

584
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,349
So, you mean
South Korean police...

585
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,819
...including Min-yeo's father who
led the investigation at the time,

586
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,340
is a fool?

587
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:23,819
Why do you say that?

588
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,539
Oh, Kyeong-ja. Why?
Are you angry again?

589
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,019
In front of the police family, we don't
can you have rational suspicion?

590
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:35,644
Forget it! If it's not already
agree, better not to talk anymore.

591
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:38,623
Kyeong-ja, are you serious?
just want to leave like that?

592
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:43,891
Mi-ri, I know your instincts are strong.
But don't trust it too much.

593
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:46,786
If the target is wrong, instinct
it could be a deadly weapon.

594
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:50,113
- Kyeong-ja!
- Wait.

595
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:52,538
If you chase now, surely
It just gets more chaotic. Just me.

596
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:54,299
Kyeong-ja.

597
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,400
Looks like Kyeong-ja
really angry.

598
00:35:57,341 --> 00:35:59,310
It seems he misunderstood.

599
00:35:59,379 --> 00:36:02,035
Just let him be.
I really like it that way.

600
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,579
At most
I'll come back later.

601
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,150
When it comes to anger, Kyeong-ja is the type
quick to anger, but never holds a grudge.

602
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:07,470
What is this, oh my?

603
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,260
Even though I'm alone, there are many
once. Let's clap our hands first!

604
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:11,704
- Wow!
- Wow!

605
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:14,819
I have to meet a woman like that soon
such a warm and generous senior wife.

606
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,065
What are you talking about?

607
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:18,939
I know this is a bit sudden,
but you are my ideal type.

608
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,940
Oh my gosh, seriously.

609
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:21,860
I even brought it
something for senior wives!

610
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,819
Are you crazy? You are this
send a heart sign to whom?

611
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,917
Oh, how come?

612
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,223
My ideal type is
is Noh Kang-sik.

613
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,016
What is the ideal type?

614
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:34,426
At this time of night, you
what are you actually doing?

615
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:36,235
Can't focus
to just one thing?

616
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,539
Surely you want to ask for that
strange or want to threaten me.

617
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,283
Who is threatening?

618
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:43,299
I just feel sorry for
You guys, work hard day and night.

619
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,366
Come on, call everyone
who is working overtime.

620
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,339
Come on everyone,
Come here to eat first.

621
00:36:47,364 --> 00:36:50,539
Section Chief, Detective
Bro, everyone, come here.

622
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:51,940
Wills?

623
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,459
He said that when the incident occurred,
Mrs. Lee, is there a will?

624
00:36:55,555 --> 00:36:57,315
It must be recorded in
case documents, right?

625
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,579
So, that's why you made
what's so exciting in the middle of the night?

626
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,623
If not for that,

627
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:07,059
what did I come for
nights like crazy?

628
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,469
Spending money,
time and energy like this?

629
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,250
This is a matter of self-respect! Pride!

630
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,947
Otherwise, me too
won't want to get tired.

631
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:14,819
Active investigation documents
prohibited from being leaked outside.

632
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,340
You know the rules. Why even
like this? Never mind, go home!

633
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,863
It is not like that.

634
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,299
Gong Mi-ri feels death
Her friend's mother did not commit suicide.

635
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,979
Does that mean he suspects?
was there a murder?

636
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,048
Murder, you know?

637
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:30,739
Oh my, these mothers are addicted
playing detective, huh?

638
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:32,299
There is no end.

639
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,606
You think the police concluded
suicide just from a will?

640
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:38,995
We check all the conditions
Crime scene, field investigation, autopsy results,

641
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,128
- just concluded that.
- That's it! I know.

642
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:44,379
I've been there too
so detective, right?

643
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,576
That's why I'm annoyed. So annoyed!

644
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:48,761
Murder he said. Murder!

645
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:54,179
I know you very well
work hard, 24 hours, 365 days.

646
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,564
- I saw it myself!
- Do not touch me.

647
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,299
It's about self-esteem,
Got it? Self-esteem.

648
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,019
Called murder.
How can you not be angry?

649
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:03,644
- So, Gong Mi-ri said it was murder?
- Yes.

650
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:07,555
Oh, I don't
know what to say.

651
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,940
He said it was murder.

652
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:12,380
You can't either
accept it, right?

653
00:38:13,565 --> 00:38:16,179
Oh my gosh, Chu Kyeong-ja is still
know how to manipulate me.

654
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,921
This includes
gaslighting, you know?

655
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,531
That's why he's an old senior
the most dangerous! Damn.

656
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,718
CAUSE OF DEATH WAS A CRACKED SKULL,
BROKEN BONES AND ORGAN BLEEDING

657
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,879
FROM LEE MIN-SEON'S WILL AND DIRECTIONS
SANDALS ON THE BALCONY, CONCLUDED AS SUICIDE

658
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:41,609
- Yes, Ji-hyun.
- Mi-ri, Mrs. Lee ordered persimmons.

659
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,859
- Persimmon?
- I have an acquaintance in Sangju.

660
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,460
Since last year, I started
selling persimmons from there.

661
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:51,201
Well, Mrs. Lee ordered
special persimmons for gifts.

662
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:53,379
February 15th.

663
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:56,042
The date of his death was 20
February. So, 5 days before.

664
00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:01,955
Maybe he ordered it for me.

665
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,060
Maybe he really wants to meet
with me and gave it to me as a gift.

666
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:08,053
At that time he said this,

667
00:39:08,273 --> 00:39:11,313
"This is for a very special person
something I haven't seen in a long time."

668
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:14,401
He still remembers
I like persimmons.

669
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:22,617
Ji-hyun, is it true?
did he commit suicide?

670
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:25,494
Mi-ri. If it turns out...

671
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:30,731
If it turns out that it's not
suicide, how?

672
00:39:31,712 --> 00:39:33,192
I have to reveal it.

673
00:39:34,718 --> 00:39:36,198
And I will reveal it.

674
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,410
Yes, this is the guard post.

675
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,491
This is from unit 1104.
My toilet is clogged.

676
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:44,989
Call a repairman
just suck the toilet, okay?

677
00:39:45,037 --> 00:39:47,147
Well, at this time of night,
Who can I call?

678
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,175
Borrow a vacuum cleaner
Just the toilet, then.

679
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:50,875
Wow.

680
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:54,288
How long do you intend to stay?
long in this apartment?

681
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,356
There's still a month left. Rent
I have paid in advance this month.

682
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,613
This is the first time
You're going to the basement, right?

683
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,949
Why? What's going on here?

684
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:05,170
It smells damp and stuffy.

685
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:06,574
Use this, then return it.

686
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:09,168
I've been around too long
here. I'm going first.

687
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,137
Please find information
from this person.

688
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,145
He doesn't want to say
anything to me.

689
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,608
But this really has something to do with it.
with the Ribbon Man case?

690
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,218
To find out the truth,
this is a very important step.

691
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,459
Services that have not been provided
ever existed before.

692
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,379
I, Kim Sil-jang, from
We Find Everything.

693
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,379
Wow, our customers who
This one's phone call was really late.

694
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,100
Usually, the one who calls late at night
this is because of an affair case.

695
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,757
How? I want to
monitor your wife directly?

696
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:55,459
Block 213, unit 1004,
Gwangseon Jugong.

697
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:57,789
Who did Mrs. Lee ask for?
Min-seon to be investigated?

698
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,540
Oh my gosh, sir!

699
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:04,755
Why should I tell people?
stranger, whom I don't even know,

700
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,939
regarding the request for investigation
from the late Mrs. Lee?

701
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,665
I suggest you
work together well.

702
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,539
I know you're an ex-cop
who are now abusing their status,

703
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,660
to investigate people.

704
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:15,352
Want to lose
pension benefits too?

705
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:17,635
I hear you're attractive
high pay for each case.

706
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:19,570
Do you also pay?
taxes correctly?

707
00:41:20,218 --> 00:41:24,659
Hey! I have a valid business license.
I'm doing this legally, you know?

708
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,099
If it's legal, I'll find out.
how official is your business actually.

709
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,299
Maybe it's you yourself
unlicensed private investigator.

710
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,900
What if I
back to investigate you?

711
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,259
Hey! Who are you really,
How dare you investigate me?

712
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,499
Son of a bitch!

713
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,780
- I'm waiting for the results as soon as possible.
- Hey!

714
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:42,460
Oh, what a...

715
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:48,801
Recording device?

716
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:52,498
Yes. Mini recorder. He arrived.
ordered chicken just to ask that.

717
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,819
Thank you very much. There is a coupon at
in. Hope you like the food.

718
00:41:57,844 --> 00:42:02,164
Wait, can I ask for a favor?

719
00:42:02,516 --> 00:42:07,395
What does he need a recording device for?
mini? Then, can you tell me how?

720
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,660
No, he doesn't understand shopping.
online, so I just helped buy it.

721
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:13,949
I don't know what for, but
looks like he really needs it.

722
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:16,281
I'll go first, okay!

723
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:17,426
So-hee...

724
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:21,865
...you think I too
too much about this, huh?

725
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,915
If I think so, where
maybe I come at this time of night?

726
00:42:25,198 --> 00:42:27,883
If you take one more order,
I can get another three thousand won.

727
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,890
But I believe in you.

728
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:37,021
Good night, Mi-ri!

729
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:47,492
Mini recorder. He even ordered one.
chicken just to ask that.

730
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,900
Park Hyun-ji! Are you asleep?

731
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,747
Don't forget your uniform,
then have to go home again, yeah?

732
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,767
Park Hyun-ji!

733
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,784
Park Hyun…

734
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,292
What is this?

735
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:11,432
- Excuse me.
- Yes!

736
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:12,435
What is it?

737
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,099
I just ordered
latte, but it's too cold.

738
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,259
Products with milk are indeed
we don't serve it too hot.

739
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,954
But I often order latte at cafes
otherwise, it never gets this cold.

740
00:43:23,064 --> 00:43:24,064
Wait a minute, please?

741
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:29,219
It's a bit cold.
I'll reheat it.

742
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,499
- Did you drink it?
- Me? I'm so sorry!

743
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,419
Sorry, I'm new, so... I
will replace it with a new one.

744
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,059
- Ah, never mind.
- I apologize.

745
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,779
- Okay, it's okay
- I am really, really sorry.

746
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,499
If you come again, I
will serve hot.

747
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,659
No need, okay? Thank you.

748
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,412
- I am really, really sorry.
- Yes.

749
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:47,683
Oh my, this is all
because of that damn amulet.

750
00:43:48,497 --> 00:43:50,320
Be careful, you could get hit
punishment if you talk like that.

751
00:43:52,656 --> 00:43:53,716
Hyun-ji?

752
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:58,250
Wow, the temperature is just right, the foam
soft. This is so delicious.

753
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:00,795
Dad said not to go
here. Why did you come?

754
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,659
Dad hasn't had dinner yet, right?

755
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,379
This is from a minimarket,
so it's not warm.

756
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,659
Why bother? Dad
can't give enough pocket money.

757
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,291
If so, look for
more money.

758
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:15,361
Who cares about his father
indeed her daughter.

759
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:19,955
But why hasn't your wife done it once?
even come to the cafe since it opened?

760
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:21,100
Isn't that too much?

761
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:22,581
That's why I came.

762
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:23,580
Darling!

763
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,040
Park Hyun-ji,
why don't you say goodbye?

764
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:29,339
Because mother doesn't allow it,
that's why I ran away.

765
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,979
Mom told you to study, why?
do you come here at night?

766
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,499
I told him
come if you're bored.

767
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,300
What are you hiding for?
But it's still visible.

768
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:38,740
- Mom, don't you feel sorry for Dad?
- Yes, Seung-ho is such a pity.

769
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,819
Pity? That's the saddest thing
I, who have to live with this person.

770
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,939
Hurry home!

771
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,100
Enough! There are customers.

772
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,955
As a family, we
must support each other.

773
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:51,115
Father works alone without
employees to save money,

774
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,739
and Mom can't
appreciate that?

775
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,059
Taking over a quiet cafe only
waste of money. What's so pitiful about it?

776
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,044
- Just being able to attract flies is already profitable.
- Hey!

777
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,899
- I'm sorry for the fuss.
- Geez.

778
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,380
- My service will be even better.
- Existing customers also left.

779
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,139
Park Seung-ho. You want to
continue living this poor?

780
00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:15,684
I told you not to
continued, but you persisted.

781
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:20,026
Sorry. I did
useless man.

782
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:25,602
Sis, when are you at your place of business?
like this, you have to be angry?

783
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,576
Sis, where are you going?
I can't brew coffee!

784
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,834
Mom is too much! Why not?
Can you please understand a little, Dad?

785
00:45:32,903 --> 00:45:35,795
- What?
- Father serves customers for the sake of the family,

786
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,900
even holding back the shame.

787
00:45:37,297 --> 00:45:40,817
Is that wrong? Isn't that responsibility?
answer a head of family?

788
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:42,220
Father!

789
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:46,729
Everything instead
defending others.

790
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:48,540
Everything is like that.

791
00:45:57,946 --> 00:46:00,962
The man who asked to work together
does it really work or not?

792
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,700
MRS. MISERY

793
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,660
MRS. MISERY

794
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,839
Oh, why doesn't he
pick up the phone?

795
00:46:53,168 --> 00:46:54,299
It's refreshing.

796
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,659
Why did you come alone?
not with Ji-hyun?

797
00:46:57,784 --> 00:47:00,104
I interrupted
Min-yeo's father's time.

798
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:03,503
He sent Mrs. Lee's will.

799
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:05,740
Are you serious?

800
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,934
- Kyeong-ja...
- We will see.

801
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:12,905
Handwritten letter
which was found at that time,

802
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,850
the content is almost the same as the notes in
the missing notebook page.

803
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:19,355
Kyeong-ja, in the courtyard
back of the notebook,

804
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,779
Mrs. Lee writes the schedule
meeting of the victims' families' association.

805
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:25,224
It means he wants to
make sure to attend.

806
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,659
Time on the front page,
he wrote a will,

807
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,139
then in the backyard,
write a schedule of activities?

808
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,620
- It doesn't make sense, right?
- That is true.

809
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,699
What can we say with
surely it's not a will?

810
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,859
What if it's just an outpouring?
his heart is under pressure?

811
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,979
Then there is a third person who
conjuring it into a will,

812
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,946
to disguise
murder becomes suicide?

813
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,861
Kyeong-ja, a few days
before he died,

814
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,737
he had time to ask So-hee at
where can I buy a mini recorder?

815
00:47:49,156 --> 00:47:51,835
Grandmothers in their 70s
What do you think you're going to use it for?

816
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:53,216
To collect evidence.

817
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:58,131
He must have suspected someone,
but don't have enough strong evidence.

818
00:47:58,635 --> 00:48:00,155
Suspected person?

819
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:03,424
Who do you mean? What
people we know?

820
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,859
THE VIEW THAT IS SEEN
As soon as you enter the courage testing arena,

821
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,140
that is how it is
the view I saw.

822
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,579
Like a place
mice breed,

823
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,180
the atmosphere...

824
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,169
I heard you signed up to join.
Test your courage in an empty house, huh?

825
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,260
I want to come too,
but tomorrow is the try out exam.

826
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:21,526
Thank goodness. If you come too,
the competition is getting bigger.

827
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:23,459
Has the location been determined?

828
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,686
There is an acquaintance who
recommend, but a bit far.

829
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:27,820
It's just that, that place
heavyweight scary place.

830
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:31,716
Where is it? But what are you?
won't tell your mother?

831
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:34,271
Are you crazy? Where are you?
Maybe Mom will allow it?

832
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:35,690
I have to go quietly.

833
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,023
I have arrived.
In front of the apartment.

834
00:48:38,703 --> 00:48:42,484
- Yes. I'll be in in a minute.
- Mi-ri!

835
00:48:44,146 --> 00:48:45,156
So-hee!

836
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:49,475
It's exactly the same as a voice recorder.
which I bought for Mrs. Lee.

837
00:48:49,632 --> 00:48:51,468
It's already charged, just wait
turn on the button.

838
00:48:53,928 --> 00:48:55,928
Why does he need to
such a small tool, huh?

839
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,408
Did he really have time?
record something?

840
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:06,831
Hello, Kyeong-ja.
Got the information?

841
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,499
I've asked
to Min-yeo's father.

842
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,940
He said it was something left by my mother
Lee, no voice recorder was found.

843
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:13,922
If there is, definitely
has been checked from the start.

844
00:49:14,306 --> 00:49:15,366
That is true.

845
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:21,287
Kyeong-ja, sorry. There's an incoming call.
Thank you. I'll call you again tomorrow.

846
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,330
Hello? Yes, Mr. Kim?

847
00:49:23,605 --> 00:49:24,642
Oh, Miss Gong Mi-ri!

848
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:28,579
You are so rude.
This is too much.

849
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,179
What? Sorry, what do you mean, sir?

850
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,299
Oh, talking about business
illegal, tax evasion,

851
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,340
to the point of threatening
revoke civil servant pensions.

852
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,740
Who said that?

853
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,475
Anyway all the information
I have already given up what I have.

854
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,680
Please do not contact
It's me again, okay? Got it?

855
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:45,536
What the heck is this, Kim Gwang-gyu?

856
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:49,067
If we work together,
info should be shared immediately, right?

857
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:50,302
Seriously.

858
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:17,601
Suspected person
Mrs. Lee turned out to be…

859
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,942
KIM HYUN-DEOK

860
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,740
BIRTH: DISTRICT
DEOKJIN, GANGWON PROVINCE

861
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,020
DEOKJIN RESERVOIR

862
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,540
Deokjin Reservoir, District
Deokjin, Gangwon Province.

863
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,830
Kim Hyun-deok Village, the place
lived until the age of nine.

864
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,194
The place where the body is
Ji-eun was found to be...

865
00:50:56,591 --> 00:50:58,028
...Deokjin Reservoir.

866
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:28,075
This is the first time
You're going to the basement, right?

867
00:51:28,272 --> 00:51:30,343
Why? What's going on here?

868
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:01,380
FAMILY ASSOCIATION
VICTIM FOR: LEE MIN-SEON

869
00:52:22,714 --> 00:52:26,207
How come this is here?

870
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:36,658
Looks like you like it too
this place. Is there anything you want to find?

871
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,994
Just want to return
toilet plunger.

872
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,479
Speaking of tools
voice recorder, you know about that?

873
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:44,587
Voice recorder?

874
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:47,451
He said the residents of unit 1004 had time
bought the tool before he died.

875
00:52:54,723 --> 00:52:58,993
You actually want to help
Who? Me or that girl?

876
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:01,641
I want to help you, Master.

877
00:53:02,377 --> 00:53:05,532
Like before, when Teacher
saved me ten years ago.

878
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,275
You bastard! Hari
Here you die in my hands!

879
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,965
Please, that's enough.

880
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:20,447
What's up?

881
00:53:20,472 --> 00:53:21,855
You bastard!

882
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,166
Come on!

883
00:53:23,755 --> 00:53:24,765
Your story is over.

884
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,758
Teacher's hand movements when
it was very fast and skilled.

885
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,148
- Come on, quickly.
- Go!

886
00:53:44,149 --> 00:53:45,579
Teacher. It's...

887
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:47,952
To be honest, I
I felt scared.

888
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:49,700
As if the teacher often
do it...

889
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:53,239
...even if only
made him faint.

890
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:58,679
Are you okay?

891
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:00,460
Yes.

892
00:54:01,057 --> 00:54:02,857
Kim Hyun-deok, 54 years old.

893
00:54:02,882 --> 00:54:04,334
Former member of special forces.

894
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:07,539
Resign from
his profession as a teacher

895
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,356
after the case was not resolved
fun ten years ago.

896
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,459
After that, he worked odd jobs as
truck drivers, couriers, and day laborers,

897
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,419
then worked as a security guard
in Gwangseon Jugong.

898
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,462
Well, it's done.

899
00:54:19,243 --> 00:54:21,228
- Wipe the body first.
- Wow, thank you very much.

900
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,979
Oh my gosh, there's a spare shirt
no? To change clothes.

901
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,180
- No need. I'm fine.
- Wait a minute, please.

902
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:46,642
The reason why Auntie is investigating secretly
and even bought a voice recorder…

903
00:54:47,348 --> 00:54:50,418
Mr. Kim, the security guard who
always help in emergency.

904
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:52,595
Very nice person.

905
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,195
It feels like suspecting a good person
like an evil deed.

906
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:57,580
A good person who is actually getting better
As time goes by, it makes me more and more suspicious.

907
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,419
A few months before
Min-seo died,

908
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,419
he was worried
because of the letters,

909
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,500
from the Family Association
Victims often go missing.

910
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:05,973
Letter from the association?

911
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,939
Victims' Families Association?

912
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,059
Leave it to me. I'll be right there.
send the letter back.

913
00:55:10,084 --> 00:55:12,964
We did not find any
the letter was returned, ma'am.

914
00:55:13,216 --> 00:55:14,816
Nothing returned?

915
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:16,376
About the letter, sir!

916
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:21,059
At that time, there was a letter for Lee
Min-seon was the one who sent it to our house by mistake.

917
00:55:21,315 --> 00:55:24,475
Father said he would
return it. Still remember?

918
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,574
Oh yeah! I think so.
did bring it.

919
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:28,300
I thought I sent it
the next day. Why?

920
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,785
People who lie about
return the letter from the victims' association…

921
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,540
The perpetrator who actually did not
visible because it is too close.

922
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,744
The security guard in this apartment...

923
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:43,778
...Kim Hyun-deok!

924
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,059
- Mr. Kang-sik.
- Yes.

925
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,940
Park's forensic results
Tae-hoon has already left.

926
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:50,895
As usual, he always comes late.
Even though the status has been stopped for a long time.

927
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:55,012
What's this?

928
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,220
ONE MONTH AGO

929
00:56:21,196 --> 00:56:25,328
I can die. I can.
I can do it.

930
00:56:25,946 --> 00:56:27,665
I can do it.

931
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,600
With such low self-esteem, dog
and the cat will bite you.

932
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,176
What do you know, sir?

933
00:57:04,928 --> 00:57:07,528
The perfect soft target.

934
00:57:07,954 --> 00:57:11,439
What target?

935
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:16,746
If later you really
die, I will not stop you.

936
00:57:17,302 --> 00:57:21,915
But as long as you live, you should
be the hunter rather than the hunted.

937
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,860
BETTER TO DIE AS A HUNTER
RATHER THAN DIE AS PREY

938
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:48,932
Why is such an important document only
left at the door, then ran away?

939
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:54,921
The number you are calling
currently unreachable.

940
00:57:56,955 --> 00:57:58,390
Why the phone
not pick up?

941
00:58:17,586 --> 00:58:19,312
PARK HYUN-JI

942
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,577
The number you…

943
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,420
Help! Help me!

944
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,379
Mom! Help me!

945
00:58:56,665 --> 00:58:58,250
Mother!

946
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:00,110
I will kill you
with my own hands!

947
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:00,790
Hyun-ji!

948
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:02,376
You decide this time too.

949
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:05,119
Will you kill?
your child, or you save him.

950
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,282
Go to the location
right now!

951
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:08,283
Hyun-ji!

952
00:59:08,363 --> 00:59:10,559
No one can survive.

953
00:59:12,355 --> 00:59:13,199
No!

954
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,590
Now it is possible
it's time for me to die.

955
00:59:16,582 --> 00:59:18,292
Hyun-ji!

956
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:19,293
Mi-ri!

957
00:59:19,676 --> 00:59:21,457
You underestimate me.

958
00:59:22,027 --> 00:59:23,543
Hyun-ji!
