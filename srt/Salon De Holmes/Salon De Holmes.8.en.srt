Oh my, this is a big problem.

10
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:55,640
I live on rent,
but unit 902 also has no news.

11
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:58,420
If unit 405 remains empty too.
How about this?

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,980
Oh my, really…

13
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,210
It's almost like a new house, really.

14
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:08,137
Oh, oh.

15
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,677
Just tell them to come
and saw it right away.

16
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,658
The important thing is to immediately find a tenant.

17
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:18,995
Today,
where are the apartment transactions?

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,620
Many units are empty,
but just call.

19
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:24,400
Nobody really wants to
see directly.

20
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:28,055
Later, if there are prospective tenants,
I will let you know right away.

21
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,700
Yes, yes, yes, I understand.

22
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:36,587
Just say that if they are serious,
maybe you can bargain a little.

23
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,980
Oh, there's an incoming call.
Call me back later.

24
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:43,396
Yes, hello.

25
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:46,994
This is from Min-eum Mental Health Clinic.

26
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:50,396
Mr. Park Tae-hun has been here three times
cancel the consultation schedule.

27
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:52,760

29
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,020
Unit 902?

30
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:35,876
Unit 902.

31
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,021
Dear Mi-ri.

32
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,619

33
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:44,337

DECLARED LOST

35
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,595
Oh, how could this happen?
No news yet?

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,860
EPISODE 8 - PARK SO-HEE'S DISAPPEARANCE CASE
I've come!

37
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,275

Have searched everywhere,

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,075
EPISODE 8 - PARK SO-HEE'S DISAPPEARANCE CASE
but there is absolutely nothing.

39
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,303
Traffic accidents have also been checked,
but So-hee's name is not there.

40
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:57,860
Why are you silent? Come on, let's get straight to it.
report to missing persons.

41
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,741
The child is in danger!
Come on, quickly!

42
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:01,926
Ji-hyun, it's not that simple.

43
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,571
If you report it now, the police won't
linking it to the case of unit 902.

44
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:07,470
There is no evidence,
and it's not even been 24 hours since it went missing,

45
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,470
and besides, we are not his family.

46
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:12,314
Family or not,
it doesn't matter now.

47
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,994
It's about someone's life.

48
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,651
Ji-hyun, Kyeong-ja is right.

49
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,180
The police will consider this
run away from home.

50
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,901
Now it's just us
who can find it.

51
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,028
We have to find
eyewitnesses as soon as possible.

52
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:27,580
A parcel courier, huh?

53
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:30,268
INVESTIGATION BEGINS IN UNIT 204, BUILDING 402
Yes. After going to unit 406 last night,

54
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:31,540
INVESTIGATION BEGINS IN UNIT 204, BUILDING 402
He disappeares.

55
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,675
you saw him at the door
or corridor around that time?

56
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,995
Last night, many police came
and the atmosphere was chaotic.

57
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,180
I'm afraid to leave the house.

58
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:43,195
The female courier lost contact
after dropping off at Building 204.

59

The police have taken all the footage.

61
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,275
The police have taken all the footage.

62
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,035
All I need is
CCTV footage around Building 204.

63
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,755
I said all the recordings
in Block 2 has been taken by the police.

64
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,820
Truly…

65
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:58,660
How could someone be missing?
just like smoke?

68
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,319
Why did this have to happen to
same night? Oh my.

69
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,908
Everyone is panicking
because of the case of unit 902.

70
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,435
Have you seen the food delivery scooters?
at the door when you come?

71
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,602
INVESTIGATION NO.4 BUILDING 204 UNIT 404
Oh my, where did you get to see something like that?

72
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,540
Sorry, I'm cooking.
something on the stove.

73
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:19,350
Okay. Sorry for bothering you.

74
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,948
Batman is driving it!

75
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:26,269
- Batman?
- Yes, Batman!

76
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,380
LAST NIGHT AT ABOUT EIGHT O'Clock

77
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,153
It's Batman!

78
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,059
Uncle Batman is out
and ride the scooter.

79
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:41,113
The red helmet is on the scooter,

80
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:44,794
but instead he wears a black Batman helmet.

81
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,000
Mi-ri!

82
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:54,475
Uncle Batman is out
from inside the apartment?

83
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,227
Yes!

84
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:59,995
How tall is it?
His body is big? Do you remember his clothes?

85
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,995
Never mind. Little boy.
who understands about that?

86
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,510
Come on, Ja-woon, come in quickly!

87
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,010
Wait a moment!

88
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:12,997
We are also on full alert.
Where do you have time to pay attention to anything else?

89
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:16,900
INVESTIGATION NO.5-GARDEN COMPLEX BLOCK 2
Yes, early in the morning the police came again.

90
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,580
- Police?
- Yes.

91
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:20,516
Why? Because of the 902 case?

92
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:24,991
They went to the house of the RT chairwoman.

93
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
- To the house of the RT chairwoman?
- Yes.

94
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:31,121
In Kang Yoon-joo's call log,
there is Park Tae-hun's number.

95
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:32,700
He's your son, isn't he?

96
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:37,562
Oh, that. I lost my phone,

97
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:39,755
so i use
my son's cell phone to make a call.

98
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
There are rent arrears,
so i called a few times.

99
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:44,500
Can we meet your son?
His phone is off.

100
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:48,635
He is currently focusing on the civil service exam,
so often turn off his cell phone.

101
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,203
When do you think he will come home?

102
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,714
You suspect my son?

103
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,890
We are a police family.

104
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:01,860
My brother works
in the Police Human Resources Division.

105
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:04,635
Oh I see.
Sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.

106
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,740
We just want to confirm
some things. We'll contact you again later.

107
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,133
Come on.

108
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,531
ONE DAY BEFORE AT SIX P.M.
TWO HOURS BEFORE SO-HEE DISAPPEARS

109
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:49,125
Drink it.

110
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,680
It must be drunk while warm to be effective.

111
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:52,960
What are you doing?

112
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,244
In the meantime, go to Auntie's house.

113
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:22,675
Drink.

114
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,554
Forgive me. I… I was wrong.

115
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,789
From now on, stop drawing.

116
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:37,720
If you don't like it
that hospital, just say,

117
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,820
instead of stopping taking the medication.

118
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,405
I will never
missed taking medication again.

119
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,100
Please, let me continue drawing.

120
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:56,442
Tae-hun, you like
the woman in unit 902?

121
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,683
That woman
not seen lately.

122
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,080
Do you know something?

123
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:06,789
No.

124
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,480
Rather than getting involved
with such a person,

125
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,080
you better continue your old habits.

126
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:16,493
Mom will take care of everything.

127
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:23,097
Please… Give it…

128
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,700
The items in the box.
Can... can I take it again?

129
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,682
Clean that first.

130
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,860

PARK SO-HEE DISAPPEARS FOR 15 HOURS

131
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:23,875

134
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,080
There are people here!

135
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:38,960
Here! Help!

136
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,540
Shut up…

137
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:42,713
Is anyone inside?

138
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:45,758
Hello, is anyone there?

139
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,840
This house is different from other houses.

140
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,980
A few years ago, I installed
excellent soundproofing here.

141
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,940
Screaming until I was half dead,
no one heard.

142
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,785
You are crazy!

143
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:09,605
Stop this right now.

144
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,597
Let me go! Let me go!

145
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:22,340
Almost complete.
Soon you will be calm.

146
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,649
Hello. Kyeong-ja, any news about CCTV?

147
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,260
That doesn't matter now.

148
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:35,331
I just heard
from Min-yeo's father,

149
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:37,780
The perpetrator of the 902 case is already known.

150
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,940
The perpetrator? Who?

151
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:43,820
New security guard, Kim Gwang-gyu.

152
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,740
What?

153
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:47,959
- Is there a warrant?
- Check anything suspicious.

154
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:50,620
- Good!
- Can the police freely enter people's homes?

155
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:04,220
You think that as a police officer you can do whatever you want?
enter someone's house?

156
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,373
Just listen later
the reason is at the police station.

157
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:07,560
Warrant issued within 48 hours.

158
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,961
If you have to be arrested,
at least tell me the reason!

159
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:13,440
You are with Kang Yoon-joo
on the day he disappeared.

160
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:15,940
We have all the CCTV footage.

161
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:18,977
Sir, I found this.

162
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,271
- Don't! That's…
- Hold him!

163
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,084
Unlucky.

164
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860

00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:05,100
Take him!

172
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,890
Listen,
The young security guard was the perpetrator of case 902.

173
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,835
What? This apartment security guard
serial killer?

174
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,125
He said someone reported it.

175
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,414
It has not been proven that he is the perpetrator,
only as a suspect.

176
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,414
Please everyone step back.

177
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,060
Park So-hee went missing last night!

178
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:20,160
That was your doing, wasn't it?

179
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:22,265
What did you do last night?

180
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:24,243
You are so quick to accuse
innocent people.

181
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:26,220
Better find him soon,
rather than wasting time.

182
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,380
That's enough, ma'am.

183
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,640
The perpetrator or not,
We will investigate it at the police station.

184
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:31,833
Please come back. Come on, let's go.

185
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,411
The perpetrator is not Gwang-gyu.

186
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,659
I don't know what this has to do with the 902 case,
but he is not So-hee's kidnapper.

187
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,060
We don't have time.

188
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,035
Kyung-ja,
I'll go to the management office first.

189
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,920
Okay. I will look for it.
more information through Min-yeo's father.

190
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,123
That's Kang Yoon-joo, right? And this is you.

191
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:02,900
He was very drunk.
Where are you taking him?

192
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,915
Go home?
You killed him at home?

193
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,260
I didn't kill him.

194
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,420
He cried while drunk
inside the complex.

195
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:13,346
I just asked where his house was.
He said Gwangseon Block 2.

196
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:17,398
Because we live in the same complex,
I just dropped her off at home.

197
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:25,195
Wow, you're so drunk.
Go to your room and sleep immediately.

198
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,259
Then why keep quiet?

199
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:29,660
When we interrogated another security guard,
you didn't say anything.

200
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:33,180
It's not that I'm covering it up.
I just can't speak.

201
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,900
Just think, if I tell you,
I would definitely be accused immediately.

202
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,240
So what is this?

203
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:44,203
Rope, electric drill, saw, mannequin.
Explain everything!

204
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:47,300
It's properties and references
to write a novel.

205
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:48,595
- Novels?
- Yes.

206
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,836
I am writing a novel
about Ribbon Man.

207
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,500
I've been here for a long time
collect data about it.

208
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,795
Where is the novel?

209
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,641
- On my laptop that you confiscated.
- I'll take it now.

210
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:06,155
Then why is there a letter for Lee Min-seon,
Ribbon Man victims' families, in your home?

211
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,660
I told you, I'm obsessive about collecting.
everything related to Ribbon Man.

212
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,371
You must know about Ribbon Man.

213
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:18,420
I know everything.

214
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:24,908
I memorized the details of the murder.
from 2003 to 2012,

215
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:28,420
starting from the date, place,
methods, all of them.

216
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:34,263
If you are stuck in your investigation,
just come to me.

217
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,840
Don't act smart.
We won't need you.

218
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:41,021
Then who is accusing me?

219
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,420
Who reported me as a murderer?

220
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:46,300
Why? You really
don't know who the person is?

221
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,100
3 HOURS BEFORE KIM GWANG-GYU'S ARREST

222
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:53,860
Hello?

223
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,700
I know who
the murderer in the apartment.

224
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,180
What are you saying?

225
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:02,716
TENANT INFORMATION BLOCK 213 UNIT 1104

226
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:06,900
The murderer of Kang Yoon-joo?
Who's he?

227
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:10,940
The perpetrator is a security guard
at Gwangseon Apartment.

228
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,300
- Which security guard?
- The young one.

229
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,380
Security guard Kim Gwang-gyu?

230
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:33,169
Who's this?

231
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,851
Hello?

232
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,236
Hello, Gwangseon Police Department's Criminal Investigation Unit 2.

233
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,381
I know who the perpetrator is
murder in the Jangdae river.

234
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,275
Unit 405 Building 204?

235
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,740
Yes, I came to ask something,
but there was no one at home.

236
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:07,140
Do you know the contact of the unit owner?

237
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,540
It's an empty house.

238
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,195
Has anyone moved in 405?

239
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:12,872
I don't think so.
Want to ask the RT mothers' chairperson?

240
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,300
What? The head of the RT mothers?

241
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:17,652
The owner of 405 is the head of the RT mothers.

242
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,539
Hello, Ji-hyun.

243
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:28,380
Do you know who the owner is?
unit 902 in Building 213?

244
00:17:29,043 --> 00:17:30,283
Head of RT mothers.

245
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,820
Unit 902 too?

246
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,178
Ji-hyun, 405 is the same.

247
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,012
So, units 902 and 405
both belong to the RT mothers' chair.

248
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,320
But the security guards said, the relationship
they are both really bad.

249
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,580
You mean the head of the RT mothers?
and the occupants of 902?

250
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,055
According to the property agent,

251
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:52,140
occupant 902 is causing trouble,

252
00:17:52,234 --> 00:17:55,533
then the head of the RT mothers told him to move,
but he refused firmly.

253
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,820
Since then, the RT mothers' chair really hated
with 902 occupants.

254
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:01,898
What's even stranger is the child of the RT mothers' chair.

255
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,755
The police came to their house
very early in the morning.

256
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,600
When the police asked
where is the child,

257
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,515
Head of RT mothers
immediately furious.

258
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,440
He said the police accused his son.

259
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,234
- Min-yeo's father!
- What?

260
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,709
They said something happened to Min-yeo?

261
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:23,844
What happened?

262
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,774
So, now you are using
our child to call me?

263
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:31,835
So-hee's child is seriously ill.

264
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,780
He has to sign
guardian documents for care.

265
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,015
But since yesterday he has been missing.

266
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,475
It hasn't even been 24 hours yet.
Why are you overreacting like this?

267
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,840
Don't be like this, please.
Just help me once, okay?

268
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,074
I'm Noh Kang-sik.

269
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:44,580
Strictly separate
between work and personal.

270
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,620
If you want to track his whereabouts,
ask the real family to come!

271
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:50,586
Strictly separating? That's funny.

272
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:53,227
Funny?

273
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,720
You really have no heart.

274
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,795
At the time of the minimarket boss case,

275
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,035
the time of the Little Mouse case,

276
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,780
after being beaten by someone,
come home bleeding,

277
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,900
Have you ever asked me if I'm okay?

278
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:07,940
You are crueler than anchovies!

279
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:11,300
This is a workplace.
Why are you making a fuss here?

280
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:14,807
Remember when you asked,
do i regret it?

281
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,456
- Yes!
- You asked if I regret it,

282
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:19,218
take off your uniform for you?

283
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,000
Chu Kyung-ja.

284
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:22,054
What?

285
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:23,962
Are you sorry?

286
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,140
Regret what?

287
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:30,189
It's nothing. Forget it.

288
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:33,667
Because of that feeling of inferiority,

289
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,106
you keep putting me down
and always act arrogantly.

290
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:41,402
Are you satisfied now?

291
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:43,980
What medicine are you taking?
Why is this happening all of a sudden?

292
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:47,220
I have a dream too!

293
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:51,080
I want to be an officer, get promoted!

294
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,007
Taking off my uniform for you,
you think it's easy?

295
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:59,352
Okay, I see what you mean.
Let's talk about it at home.

296
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:04,563
Time of disciplinary hearing,
your mother came to the police station, do you know?

297
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:11,792
He begged me,
"Kyeong-ja, please save my child."

298
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:13,882
You don't know, do you?

299
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:19,906
Wow, Chu Kyeong-ja.
Now you're bringing my mother into the mix too?

300
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:22,220
Because of that, we can get married.

301
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,320
You only think about your pride,
while your mother always looks down on me.

302
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,525
- Do you know how much I suffer?
- Enough!

303
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:33,035
You can insult me,
but don't insult my mother.

304
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,180
I could lose my mind.

305
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:37,740
Shut up! You think I don't know,

306
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:41,675
you two put the amulet
in my wardrobe to bring me bad luck?

307
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,280
Do you want to keep ranting?
Hurry up and go!

308
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:46,100
Babbling?

309
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:51,755
Noh Kang-sik, I'm sorry!

310
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,835
People are watching! Let go!

311
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,030
So, you know shame? If so,
let's make you really embarrassed.

312
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,380
Hey, Detective Choi! Mr. Kim!

313
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:02,435
Give up! I give up!

314
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,546
Shut up! I won't accept it.
your surrender now!

315
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:14,020
- Hello.
- Have you met the female courier?

316
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,480
Not yet, we are still looking.

317
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:19,980
I happened to see something.
Want to come along for a bit?

318
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:21,160
What is it?

319
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:24,779
Not this one?

320
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:27,444
Similar to the one driven
the female courier.

321
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:30,940
- Yes!
- 1985, right.

322
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:32,716
Yes, this is So-hee's scooter.

323
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,420
I have to go upstairs first
because it's my shift. Excuse me.

324
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,140
Okay, thank you.

325
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:42,916
The scooter was left here, but the point
his last delivery at Building 204.

326
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:45,061
So-hee must have disappeared there.

327
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:46,875
That is true.

328
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,755
If the scooter is left
right in front of 204,

329
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,100
people immediately became suspicious.

330
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,700
So, the perpetrator may have done it on purpose
move it here.

331
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,260
But who is the culprit?

332
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:01,418
Ji-hyun, please check again.
around Building 204.

333
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:02,753
Good.

334
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,680
Why is he heading to the trash?
in Building 213?

335
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:41,636
There is a black bag inside.
There must be something hidden.

336
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,060
Hello, Kyeong-ja.

337
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,400
I just had a big fuss
with Min-yeo's father.

338
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,844
Because of that, he agreed
help track So-hee's position.

339
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:55,659
Seriously? Where is the last location?

340
00:22:55,851 --> 00:23:00,460
Yes, in the Gwangseon complex.
At exactly 8.15 his cell phone went dead.

341
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,515
I'm suspicious of one place.
I'll check first.

342
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,420
Kyeong-ja, come here right away, okay?

343
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,275
What? They said the house is empty?
But the water meter is moving.

344
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,791
Hooded jacket?

345
00:23:30,223 --> 00:23:31,700
Maybe it's the Little Mouse?

346
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:35,235
That person must be Little Rat!

347
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,157
The proof is, since it was discovered,

348
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:41,865
no more victims of abuse.

349
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
So, here it is?

350
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,944
He covered up his own child's abnormality?

351
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,496
KANG YOON-JO LIPSTICK,
KANG YOON-JOO'S HAIR

352
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,996
KANG YOON-JOO JEWELRY

353
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:15,099
NAILS ON THE SAME WEEK,
KANG YOON-JOO EARRINGS

354
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,540
You crazy psychopath!

355
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,260
HOTDUL FRIED CHICKEN

356
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,780
Part time courier job…

357
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,660
Come on, eat a lot.

358
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:51,440
Wednesday, pediatric ICU room.

359
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,820
So-hee's work schedule?

360
00:24:58,594 --> 00:25:00,060
What a psychopath!

361
00:25:03,313 --> 00:25:04,261
Hello, Ji-hyun.

362
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:08,593
Unit 405 does not appear to be an empty house.
The water and electricity are on.

363
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,060
The perpetrator was the child of the RT mothers' chair.

364
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,820
What? The child of the RT mothers' chairperson?

365
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:14,460
He is the stalker of resident 902
and he was also the one who kidnapped So-hee.

366
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,595
So-hee is in danger.

367
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,921
We all need to get to the 405 now, quick!

368
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:19,940
Okay, I'll be right there!

369
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,420
You already know, right? That your son
is the stalker of resident 902.

370
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,915
My son has nothing to do with it
with that woman!

371
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,460
If so, what about
the pervert who terrorizes the residents every night

372
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,260
the case of the Little Mouse?
You pretend not to know?

373
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,620
That's bullshit!

374
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:51,315
Everyone knows the Little Mouse
the block leader who was caught at that time!

375
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,275
Then what about
murder in unit 902?

376
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,740
The killer is that young security guard!

377
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:02,834
Where is your child now?

378
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,220
I don't know!

379
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:09,163
Want me to tell you?
In unit 405 Building 204!

380
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,657
You're playing detective, aren't you?

381
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:18,780
It's an empty house.

382
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,976
Female courier delivering chicken
to unit 406 went missing last night.

383
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,795
The last location is exactly on one line
with unit 405, which is yours!

384
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,700
That…
what does that have to do with my child?

385
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:35,427
Then why did your son memorize?
what is the female courier's work schedule?

386
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,828
I will report your son…

387
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,900
…as a murder suspect
occupants of 902 right now.

388
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,700
Or you open the door of unit 405. Take your pick!

389
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:57,595
Please, my son Yul
can't live without me.

390
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,133
Please, save me.

391
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:02,708
It's my fault. It's all my fault.
Forgive me.

392
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:08,100
What's the point of living if you don't even
can't accompany your child?

393
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,900
Now I will end this.

394
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:14,755
This will be more comfortable
rather than dying slowly in the water.

395
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,755
Don't! Yul only has me.
Please…

396
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,115
Too late.
You know too much about me. So…

397
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:24,475
I won't talk to anyone.

398
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,555
I swear,
I will remain silent for the rest of my life.

399
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,180
- I promise!
- Really?

400
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,594
I never trusted women.

401
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:42,697
Please!

402
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:45,136
For me, women look the most beautiful
when begging.

403
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,738
Continue!

404
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,199
Come on, just a little more!

405
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,060
Let's do it!

406
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:09,186
What?
Wait a moment.

407
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,590
What?
This is the correct key.

408
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:17,380
Why is this?

409
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,940
Open the door!

410
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,540
He had already intended,
do you think he will open the door?

411
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,900
- Let's just report it to the police now.
- Should not!

412
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,155
If So-hee dies while we wait,
You will be responsible!

413
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,922
Could your child have changed the lock?

414
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,015
Maybe he changed the locks
and hide the new key.

415
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,699
Oh, I'm going home right now.
I'll look for the key.

416
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:44,921
Please, don't report it to the police.

417
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:48,839
Give me five minutes…
No, three minutes. I'll be right back!

418
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,395
Every second counts.
We can't wait!

419
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,955
- So-hee!
- So-hee!

420
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,020
Everyone move aside!

421
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,340
- Kyung-ja!
- Kyung-ja!

422
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:05,900
- Please hold this for a moment. Heavy!
- Yes.

423
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,867
- Move aside!
- Kyeong-ja, what do you want?

424
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:10,924
This damn door, let me take care of it!

425
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:16,540
So-hee!

426
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,300
So-hee!

427
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:20,617
Looks like he's run away.

428
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,540
What's that smell? It sounds nice.

429
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:23,860
Aromatherapy candles.

430
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,820
Crazy. He burns aromatherapy
while doing what here?

431
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:27,965
Calm down, calm down first.

432
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:30,580
Batman Helmet.

433
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:32,660
This must be him.

434
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,320
Ms. Choi Sun-ja!

435
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:37,420
Ms. Choi Sun-ja!

436
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:40,536
What else is this? Not all of them
Have you finished talking about it this morning?

437
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:42,860
There are other things we need to investigate
regarding Kang Yoon-joo.

438
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,220
- Please come with us for a moment.
- Why should I come along?

439
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:47,775
The perpetrator has been caught, right?

440
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,700
But you once tailed Kang Yoon-joo.

441
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:53,541
We have testimony from private investigators.

442
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,060
Come along.

443
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:00,203
Ji Hyun!

444
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:03,812
Oh my gosh! This is crazy.

445
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:09,241
Like a ritual offering.
What is this?

446
00:30:09,835 --> 00:30:12,952
- So-hee must have been taken away.
- Shut up.

447
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:15,682
Still warm.

448
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,926
- He's still here.
- Here?

449
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,410
Friends.

450
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:31,293
Oh my, I thought it was the perpetrator's phone!

451
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:32,654
Answer! Quickly!

452
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:37,700
- Hello.
- Honey, where are you? At home?

453
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:40,780
- If it's not important, hang up!
- Where are you? You haven't come home yet?

454
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,040
- No...
- Hang up! Hang up the phone!

455
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,740
Where did you put it?

456
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,980
Can!

457
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:11,380
PROPERTY CERTIFICATE

458
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,795
You two, check the living room.
and other areas. I checked this part.

459
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,300
- Good.
- Good.

460
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,820
Ji-hyun, didn't you say
the water meter is still turning?

461
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,140
Yes, bathroom! Bathroom!

462
00:31:43,258 --> 00:31:46,058
My God! So-hee, he must be dead.

463
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:49,921
We have to… we have to call the police!

464
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,302
Good grief!

465
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:57,989
Kyung-ja.

466
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:02,595
Please, can you put your knife down?

467
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,260
You should have come
with better preparation.

468
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:11,515
Why don't you only bring one fire extinguisher?
Embarrassing! Right?

469
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,260
Where is So-hee? Where is she?

470
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:17,616
Take a guess!

471
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,146
If you are smart,
should be able to guess. Let's try.

472
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:26,344
- Damn, you really are a know-it-all.
- Correct.

473
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,300
You're the daughter of the head of the RT ladies, right?

474
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,460
How do you think your mother feels?
when he found out his son was the Little Mouse?

475
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,173
Why do you know everything?

476
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:52,945
So, you guys also know I'm a murderer?

477
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:57,955
So, you are right
who killed the occupants of 902?

478
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,860
Not 902! Her name is Yoon-joo!
Kang Yoon Joo!

479
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:01,720
You stupid.
I can only say 902 this, 902 that.

480
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,100
Go to sleep.

481
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,060
A FEW DAYS AGO

482
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,000
Mi-ri.

483
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:30,915
Please, don't scream.

484
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,189
I won't hurt you. I promise.

485
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm just worried about you.

486
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,791
Excuse me,

487
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,260
but don't bring other men home.

488
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:51,740
What if they are dangerous?

489
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:53,787
You are crazy?

490
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,399
How do you know my door code?

491
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,180
Here! This is your button, right?

492
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,620
Since when?
Since when have you been coming in and out of my house?

493
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:07,360
I just want to protect you.

494
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:10,601
If you arrive…

495
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:16,163
…doing something stupid
because of that damn dog, what?

496
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:17,520
Damn dog?

497
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,140
How dare you insult Mi-ri?
What a trashy psychopath.

498
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,424
Ah...not me...

499
00:34:28,097 --> 00:34:30,519
- You're the one who took Mi-ri, right?
- No.

500
00:34:31,057 --> 00:34:33,277
- You killed him?
- No! I didn't kill him.

501
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,355
I just found it in the trash.

502
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,430
Then I buried him well.
That's your beloved dog.

503
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,851
Nonsense!

504
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,180
You think I believe that?
What a psychopath!

505
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,860
Yoon Joo.

506
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:51,225
Yoon-joo, you shouldn't.
treat me like this.

507
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,555
You like me, don't you?

508
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:59,439
You once said
I have to fix my life.

509
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:00,940
You didn't even report it to the police.

510
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:05,739
It was the first time there was
who said that to me.

511
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:09,220
- Hey!
- What?

512
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,660
I didn't report to the police
just because of your mother.

513
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:13,151
He always collects rent.

514
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,100
I want to play with you guys.

515
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:20,415
I'll take advantage of your weakness to make your mother upset!

516
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,746
It's done.

517
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,020
I will report you.

518
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:27,500
You are the Little Mouse, the stalker,
privacy violators, everyone!

519
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,880
That's a lie, right?

520
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:38,832
You said you didn't report
because you care about me.

521
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:40,883
That's a lie, right?

522
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,980
- Give it back, you psychopath!
- Yoon Joo.

523
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:45,109
Give it back, you psychopathic piece of shit.

524
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:50,954
I'm fine.
It doesn't hurt at all.

525
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,331
You are okay?

526
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,020
You're crazy! You're a perverted psychopath!

527
00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:59,195
This… How? Why?

528
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,359
You are a monster.
You don't deserve to be born in this world.

529
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:07,103
I'll make you rot in a mental hospital!

530
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:14,129
People like you should be
never born into the world.

531
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,562
Tae-hun, enough!

532
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,484
If you don't want to practice, just stop!

533
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:30,620
Other children can complete
Bayer's book in a matter of months,

534
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,336
You've been there for years!

535
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:35,148
If your brain is dull,
move your hands more diligently.

536
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:39,523
Think carefully about what your mistake was.

537
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,620
Mom, I'm sorry.

538
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,171
I will practice the piano.

539
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:52,141
I don't know since when,

540
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:57,060
every time my mother scolds me,
I hurt myself.

541
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:01,847
It's strange, but when you see blood,
my heart felt a little relieved.

542
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,764
The urge to kill my mother also subsided.

543
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:07,156
You stupid bastard.

544
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:08,500
Have you realized?

545
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:14,500
You and your mother are both psychopaths.

546
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,940
Why are you imitating my mother?
He is not a good person.

547
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,900
You…what are you doing?
Do not come close.

548
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:40,023
You shouldn't be like this!

549
00:37:40,953 --> 00:37:42,740
I like you, Yoon-joo.

550
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:45,420
Why am I looking at my mother instead?
on your face? Why?

551
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,816
Don't order me! Beg.

552
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,780
Beg me. Come on!

553
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:53,865
Help…

554
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,260
Help…

555
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:01,323
You are so beautiful
when begging like this.

556
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:20,578
Calm down, calm down first.

557
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,195
You're a Ribbon Man impersonator, right?

558
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:28,342
Me? I'm the original Ribbon Man.

559
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:32,420
Lies! Why are you wearing it?
Ribbon Man name? What is your motive?

560
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:37,340
Mi-ri, calm down. You can't.
losing my mind now.

561
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:40,835
- Correct.
- You know who Ribbon Man is, right?

562
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,740
- Where is he?
- And if I knew?

563
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,380
If I knew?

564
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,391
Who is Ribbon Man?
Hurry up and say it!

565
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:51,760
Mi-ri, do you want to see me die?
Take it easy!

566
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:55,221
- Hey, Tae-hun. I know.
- Yes?

567
00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:59,346
You didn't really mean to
kill them, right?

568
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:04,979
You don't want to repeat your mistakes.
Please, put the knife down.

569
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:06,547
Let's talk about it nicely.

570
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:09,820
Where's So-hee? He's still alive, right?

571
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:16,242
He is dead.

572
00:39:19,388 --> 00:39:23,828
Murderer! Crazy monster!

573
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,060
What's this?

574
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:49,046
Mi-ri!

575
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:52,020
Mi-ri, wake up! Mi-ri!

576
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:55,161
Mi-ri!

577
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,556
Mi-ri!

578
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:07,542
Kyung-ja!

579
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:17,282
I used to get beaten up a lot at school.

580
00:40:17,594 --> 00:40:23,395
Mom sent me to taekwondo lessons,
hapkido, kendo, everything.

581
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,542
- I know.
- Do you know? But it's all useless.

582
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:29,672
Because one stab is enough.

583
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:36,883
How is it possible for a novel
can it be this detailed and real?

584
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:41,929
Personality, style, physical characteristics,
habits, the way the Ribbon Man speaks.

585
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,435
Even to the food he hates.
Is this really just fiction?

586
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,275
Sir! We just got a report of a kidnapping!

587
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,355
At Gwangseon Apartment,
unit 405, building 204!

588
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,023
- What?
- What?

589
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,740
You must get to the scene immediately!

590
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:55,036
Kidnapping, let's go!

591
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:58,340
- Sir, unit 405 building 204!
- I know!

592
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,829
Why didn't you pick up? Damn it.

593
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,262
You're just going to sleep for a while.
It doesn't matter.

594
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:09,215
Take it easy.

595
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:12,940
I won't kill you yet.

596
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,180
Take it easy.

597
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,620
- Why?
- I can't feel my hands!

598
00:41:22,645 --> 00:41:24,700
Ji-hyun. These are symptoms of a stroke, right?

599
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:28,635
Stroke? I'm still young!
I'm only in my early fifties.

600
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,219
Yes, it is possible.

601
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,115
Why? Why are you screaming?

602
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,425
Numb! My hands are numb!

603
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,995
Tae-hun, can you
untie us? Help…

604
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,555
No, you guys are too much trouble.
I have to sort this out first.

605
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,660
- Don't.
- No!

606
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,913
Ma'am…

607
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:03,740
This is cheating. This is not fair.

608
00:42:03,765 --> 00:42:05,557
Mi-ri, run! Hurry!

609
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:09,103
Run now!

610
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,020
Unlucky!

611
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,380
You're finished!

612
00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:25,552
I will catch you
and reveal Ribbon Man's identity.

613
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:31,540
Let go!

614
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,235
Mi-ri! Find So-hee now!

615
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,155
Let go!

616
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
So-hee!

617
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,660
You guys are really annoying.

618
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,980
- Let go…
- You!

619
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:56,180
Stop!

620
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:02,389
So-hee!

621
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:08,380
You devil! What did you do to So-hee?

622
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,385
My nose!

623
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,620
Hey!

624
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,471
Mi-ri! Front pocket of the backpack!

625
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:26,495
Okay, wait a minute!

626
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:30,781
Throw it!

627
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:39,475
So-hee, wake up! Wake up!

628
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,700
- What's this?
- Grain powder!

629
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,400
Damn it!

630
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:45,609
You bastard!

631
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:48,000
Mi-ri!

632
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,340
Hey!

633
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:16,077
Yes!

634
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:18,613
So-hee!

635
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,440
- Ji-hyun, tie it tighter.
- Good!

636
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:23,780
So-hee!

637
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,850
Mi-ri…

638
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,925
- What is this?
- Who knows.

639
00:44:34,941 --> 00:44:38,459
- What is wrong with her?
- Oh my, poor thing.

640
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:40,644
- Be careful, take it slow.
- Great!

641
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:47,300
- You guys are great!
- Very good!

642
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:56,235
Oh, my wife! Why did it turn out like this?
What is this?

643
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,075
Oh my gosh, get away for now.
Hurry up and pick up your potatoes.

644
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,608
Too bad about the potatoes.

645
00:45:35,181 --> 00:45:36,187
Doctor!

646
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:39,169
Ms. Gong Mi-ri? Why are you here?

647
00:45:40,102 --> 00:45:44,075
I live in this Gwangseon Apartment.
Why is the doctor himself here?

648
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,741
I happen to have some business around here,
then heard the sound of an ambulance siren.

649
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,843
Are you okay? You look hurt.

650
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,700
I'm fine.

651
00:45:54,191 --> 00:45:56,560
There is something worse,

652
00:45:57,414 --> 00:46:00,260
even some died
because it was too late to be saved.

653
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,560
Go to the emergency room immediately and get treatment.

654
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,613
And after you recover,
come see me.

655
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,840
Wounds in the heart if left alone
will leave a mark as trauma.

656
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:07,820
Okay, Doc.

657
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,188
Mi-ri! Come here quickly!

658
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:12,740
- Okay, Doc.
- Yes.

659
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:18,444
- Very good.
- Great!

660
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,100
FOUR WEEKS AGO

661
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:45,629
Doctor, you know what it feels like.
when someone is tamed?

662
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:51,336
I was wrong, Mom!

663
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:55,386
Please open the door!

664
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,939
Mother is an absolute figure.

665
00:46:58,093 --> 00:47:00,253
I am a loser.

666
00:47:00,788 --> 00:47:05,379
Whatever I do is never enough
to satisfy that absolute figure.

667
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:12,420
But do you know
what hurts more?

668
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:16,402
I ordered a hot drink.

669
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:18,110
Didn't you get the message wrong?

670
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,700
I don't think so, I almost did.
never drink cold drinks.

671
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,820
Yes, yes. Wait a minute,
I have to serve another order.

672
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,395
And my coffee?

673
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,860
Don't see the queue? Be patient.

674
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,811
Not just Mom.
All women make me feel defeated.

675
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,180
People like him, will drink anything,
there will be no difference.

676
00:47:44,189 --> 00:47:46,786
People like him, will drink anything,
there will be no difference.

THE CAUGHT PREY SHAKES IN FRONT OF ME.

683
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:28,920
WRIST, FEET,
AND HER WHOLE BODY WRAPPED IN RED RIBBON.

684
00:48:29,397 --> 00:48:32,522
THIS IS LIKE A GIFT FOR ME.

685
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:36,406
HIS FACE AS IF BEGGING FOR MY MERCY,
LIKE WAITING FOR GRACE FROM ME

686
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,101
MAKES ME EXCITED.

687
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:43,705
TAPE AND MURDER METHOD

688
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:46,478
RIBBON KNOT, CROSS THE ENDS OF THE ROPE,
FOLD AND INSERT INTO THE OTHER STRAP

689
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:49,509
FOLD THE ENDS TOO, PULL
BOTH FOR TIGHTENING THE KNOT

690
00:48:57,883 --> 00:49:00,176
SINCE I WAS BORN,

691
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:03,882
BETTER TO DIE AS A HUNTER
RATHER THAN DIE AS PREY

692
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:14,782
I decided to become a hunter.

693
00:49:15,555 --> 00:49:16,876
Is this the person who found my wallet?

694
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:19,540
I'm going there now.
Where should I meet you?

695
00:49:20,554 --> 00:49:23,811
A true hunter targets
his prey precisely,

696
00:49:24,005 --> 00:49:25,820
catch it as fast as lightning.

697
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:27,227
Help,

698
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,661
I don't know anything.

699
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,579
I didn't see anything, really.
Help me, please.

700
00:49:37,634 --> 00:49:38,876
Help me.

701
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,927
Help!

702
00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:51,422
Shut up!

703
00:49:52,204 --> 00:49:54,313
It doesn't matter!

704
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,876
Shut up!

705
00:50:07,328 --> 00:50:11,915
Just one breath,
the smell makes me addicted.

706
00:50:12,572 --> 00:50:13,838
Real human smell.

707
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:15,420
At that moment I realized,

708
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:19,611
humans only really become
humans when faced with death.

709
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:24,468
Mi-ri! Help me!

710
00:51:26,214 --> 00:51:27,267
Ji-eun!

711
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:32,100
You are okay?

712
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:35,460
Who is Ji-eun?

713
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:38,115
Why are you shouting his name?
as if your life was almost taken by an angel?

714
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,299
Him! I have to meet him.

715
00:51:41,324 --> 00:51:42,940
He must have something to do with it.
with Ribbon Man.

716
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:44,275
Whether he's an accomplice or what,
there must be something!

717
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,117
Oh my gosh, Mi-ri, calm down.

718
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:48,075
You almost died
and already want to go again?

719
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,436
You think a big time serial killer
will it be easy to find?

720
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:52,741
I should try talking to myself!

721
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:53,842
What are you talking about?

722
00:51:55,898 --> 00:51:58,920
What is your relationship with Ribbon Man…

723
00:52:00,508 --> 00:52:02,859
…to the point where every time his name is mentioned?

724
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:05,236
There isn't any. He is the common enemy of all of us!

725
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,586
Yes, common enemy. So, just wait.

726
00:52:07,915 --> 00:52:10,914
If he is indeed related,
the police will reveal it.

727
00:52:11,054 --> 00:52:13,026
He could have kept quiet
in front of the police, right?

728
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:16,500
You think he's keeping quiet in front of the police,
but will want to talk to you?

729
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:23,083
Kim Gwang-gyu, has he been released?

730
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,312
What's wrong with Gwang-gyu?

731
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:27,591
I wonder, when Tae-hun was arrested,
did he see anyone in the apartment?

732
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,740
When arrested,
Tae-hun sees someone and…

733
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:35,440
…he smiled, as if meeting
someone he misses.

734
00:52:35,984 --> 00:52:39,709
That person must be a neighbor,
or someone he already knows well.

735
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,120
Who was he looking at at that moment?

736
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:46,959
Oh yeah! So-hee! How are you?
Is he safe?

737
00:52:50,806 --> 00:52:53,023
He fought alone,
but holds up well.

738
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:54,828
Blood pressure, pulse,
and his breathing was stable.

739
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:56,500
Thank You.

740
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:57,859
Thank you very much.

741
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,040
Mother…

742
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:09,082
Sorry, it's been a long wait, huh?

743
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,234
Is your mother sick?

744
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:16,848
A little. The doctor said,
a few days can heal.

745
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:24,500
Mom said, if I "blow",
the pain will go away.

746
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:31,500
It doesn't hurt anymore, right?

747
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:37,860
Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore.

748
00:53:39,754 --> 00:53:40,580
Thank You.

749
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:49,275
Ji Hyun.

750
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:51,180
Why did you hide it from me?

751
00:53:51,508 --> 00:53:53,275
I am the queen of sensitive and loyal friends,

752
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,715
but you make me look like
a fool who doesn't care.

753
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,580
It's not that I want to hide…

754
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:05,061
It must be really hard, right?

755
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:11,420
Excuse me.

756
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,540
There are also mothers like me
which cannot protect healthy children.

757
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,380
How can you cope
all this alone?

758
00:54:28,874 --> 00:54:30,300
I salute you.

759
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:34,320
So, what about
father of the child?

760
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,880
I don't know the details either.
All I know is that she's a single mother.

761
00:54:37,971 --> 00:54:38,695
Geez.

762
00:54:39,244 --> 00:54:40,480
I don't know about that.

763
00:54:40,595 --> 00:54:43,412
I was busy badmouthing him instead.
Good grief.

764
00:54:43,805 --> 00:54:46,804
If you are having trouble, you should
must dare to ask for help.

765
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,349
Open up a little.

766
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:50,531
That's what living as a human being is all about...

767
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,880
- So-hee!
- What's this?

768
00:54:53,313 --> 00:54:54,399
You guys are talking about me, right?

769
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,755
- Look, everyone is quiet now.
- No!

770
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,675
How is your child?
Yul is okay?

771
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,172
Yes, he is stronger than me.

772
00:55:02,197 --> 00:55:05,335
He kept on persisting
every time there is a critical period. He's great.

773
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:08,084
Of course! Whose child was he?

774
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:10,674
Thank you, So-hee.

775
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:14,140
Thank you for sticking around
and return safely.

776
00:55:18,473 --> 00:55:23,059
Who saved me,
if not you?

777
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,660
You guys saved me and Yul.
Thank you very much.

778
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:32,680
Sorry, I just gossiped about you
behind. I'm really sorry.

779
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,540
Okay, just act like normal.

780
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:36,835
I'm not even used to it
if you suddenly become like this.

781
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:40,877
But you really broke up
with your child's father?

782
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:44,870
Stop! Come on, let's not talk about the past,
like old people.

783
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,622
Have you ever seen an old man this cute?

784
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,183
Look, he's acting cute.

785
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:55,920
Your nose is similar
the potatoes are dented like that.

786
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:58,088
Oh my, damn it!

787
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:01,520
He even attacked my nose! Ouch…

788
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,258
- What's this?
- Why?

789
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,741
Out of balance?

790
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:10,130
- Hey, Hyun-ji's father's salary hasn't come in yet?
- What?

791
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:15,315
We should have gotten paid yesterday.
I was in a mess, so I forgot to check.

792
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,774
Yes, we are all busy.

793
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:21,468
He said the morning PT class at the gym was always quiet.
Is the gym bankrupt?

794
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:22,940
Few customers, perhaps.

795
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:24,500
Ouch.

796
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:30,440
Seung-ho? He resigned last month.
He said he wanted to open his own cafe.

797
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,869
Do as you please!

798
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,450
Hyun-ji's father! Are you home? Hyun-ji's father!

799
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,140
Base…

800
00:56:51,777 --> 00:56:52,980
Don't say house certificate…

801
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:04,780
Park Seung Ho!

802
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,020
Well, here it is!

803
00:57:09,445 --> 00:57:11,540
Wow! Congratulations, Seung Ho.

804
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,140
Now call him
It has to be Director Park Seung-ho, right?

805
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:14,961
Director Park?

806
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:16,676
This is all thanks to you, you know?

807
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,920
How to find hits places
like this for this price?

808
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,080
I'm just a little worried
with your wife, Seung-ho.

809
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:23,780
Things like this should be
discuss it with your family first, right?

810
00:57:24,218 --> 00:57:25,640
What are you talking about?

811
00:57:26,188 --> 00:57:28,236
Coward Park Seung-ho has retired!

812
00:57:28,383 --> 00:57:32,220
From now on I will use the trick
"act first, take care of things later".

813
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,700
Well, I transferred the down payment straight away.

814
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:37,746
Stop!

815
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,900
This is what we need
to find out the facts.

816
00:58:04,035 --> 00:58:06,235
A good person who continues
makes me suspicious.

817
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,620
I know your instincts are good.

818
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:09,996
But if you arrest the wrong person,
it could be a weapon against you.

819
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,173
That bastard is causing trouble!

820
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:14,958
Maybe he considered letting go
the student as a lifelong mistake.

821
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:17,979
You mean, I should
die at the hands of that bastard?

822
00:58:18,612 --> 00:58:19,915
I heard you were exploring an abandoned house?

823
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,140
You should have done it quietly.

824
00:58:21,428 --> 00:58:24,588
The time has come for the hunter
to show his true face.

825
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:27,773
The real culprit is near you.
