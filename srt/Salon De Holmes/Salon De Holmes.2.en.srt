00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:30,435
SALON DE HOLMES

2
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:32,875
THE CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA
ARE PURELY FICTIONAL AND UNRELATED TO HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,108
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN SAFE CONDITIONS AND WITH COMPLIANCE

4
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:48,827
YEAR 2005

5
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,884
Wow, like the Hulk. It feels like
not a woman.

6
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,534
Yes. If Lieutenant Chu participates in the Olympics,

7
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:11,534
maybe he's the one who got it
gold medal, not Jang Mi-ran.

8
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:12,561
That is true.

9
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:15,293
Last month, time to catch
gold shop robber in Myeongdong,

10
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:18,213
The robber immediately fainted from the impact
the blow and is still in a coma until now.

11
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:23,013
Seriously? If Lieutenant Chu gets married later,
her husband must be battered.

12
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:25,333
How could it be?
It just won't happen.

13
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:28,014
Who also dares to get married?
with him?

14
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,204
Right, Sergeant Noh?

15
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,014
Hey, have you washed your faces?
Why are your faces so dirty?

16
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,534
Go take a shower first!

17
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:38,166
Hey, what are you guys doing?

18
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,093
The case file from earlier
I asked you to take care of it, is it finished?

19
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:42,326
Almost done, Mom!

20
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:44,589
Why do you always say
"almost complete"?

21
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,893
Finish it now
and report. Execute!

22
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:48,894
- Ready, ma'am!
- Ready, ma'am!

23
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:50,774
- Hey, Sergeant Noh.
- Yes, ma'am.

24
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:52,614
Come with me for a moment.

25
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:01,567
- Hey, Noh Kang-sik!
- Yes, Senior!

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,334
- Yes, Senior?
- Yes?

27
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:05,676
- You still haven't realized it, huh?
- Not yet, ma'am.

28
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,426
Looks like you need to be taught.

29
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:15,050
Honey, I told you that
just the two of us, just talking casually.

30
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:16,974
Honey, I mean Senior!

31
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,834
Oh, how is this? Honey.

32
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:22,241
I have no problem with that,
but what if it gets found out?

33
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,573
Who else saw it?
It's just the two of us here.

34
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,774
Still, we would be ashamed
if it gets caught.

35
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,894
Lieutenant Chu!
The Chief of Police isâ€¦

36
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:32,986
- What is it?
- Yes.

37
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:35,693
The chief asked for a report
regarding the case of the woman in Ssangmun-dong.

38
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:36,734
Tell him
I'll be there soon.

39
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:38,749
Well, here's how to install it
correct handcuffs!

40
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,053
- Understand, Noh Kang-sik?
- Yes, ma'am!

41
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:41,973
Hey, come out quickly.
Fast!

42
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:45,234
Honey, I'm sorry.
I was surprised too earlier.

43
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,634
Honey, my arm fell off.

44
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,134
But if you can put it back together,
I feel like I can definitely get better.

45
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,054
How about I blow first?

46
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:57,852
Darling.

47
00:03:03,374 --> 00:03:05,133
Oh my gosh, what is thisâ€¦

48
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:08,891
Sorry, the big boss of Chilseong Gang who
wanted list appears on Big Scale!

49
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,388
- Noh Kang-sik, come on!
- Ready, ma'am.

50
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:13,388
Senior.

51
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,074
Hey, come out quickly!

52
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:28,894
Okay. Team 2 remains on standby outside,
Team 1 entered with me first.

53
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,906
I'll go into the room first.

54
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:33,086
Make sure no one else comes in.
Take good care of it.

55
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,493
- Okay, got it!
- Okay, got it!

56
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:36,493
Team 2, prepare additional equipment.
If there is a signal, go straight in.

57
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:37,504
- Ready!
- Ready!

58
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,587
Wow, they are so beautiful.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,651
Okay, time to choose!
Greet from the left first.

60
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:49,894
- Why are all the women here like this?
- Okay. I'm sorry.

61
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,509
I will call soon
next group.

62
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:05,076
What is this? In this place,
the chef also appears?

63
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,355
Is it called a chef?
Sir, I'm hurt, you know.

64
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:19,514
Why?
Disappointed because he's not your type?

65
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:25,306
Even though I already
brought this especially for you.

66
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,226
I can't drink alcohol,
So I pour this soda, okay?

67
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,018
Please accept it.

68
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,509
Tell him to come out!

69
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,413
You don't like Chilseong Cider, do you?

70
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,974
I'll kick him out right away, Boss!
Hey, chef. Get out there!

71
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:57,149
You don't like Chilseong Cider
because you're part of the Chilseong gang, huh?

72
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,828
Hey, who are you really?

73
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:04,627
Me? From Serious Crimes Team 2,
Donam Police Station, Seoulâ€¦

74
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,314
What?

75
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:09,237
Lieutenant Chu Kyeong-ja.

76
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,374
Today, it's time for your revenge.

77
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:13,314
Damn it!

78
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:36,514
Good!

79
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:48,006
- Hey, what time did you call the ambulance?
- Only one.

80
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:54,324
Oh my, look at the situation! How can one be enough?
Call as many as possible!

81
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:56,320
- Call again?
- Hurry up and call, you idiot!

82
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,557
Youâ€¦

83
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,194
Enough, let's just end it.

84
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,477
- Noh Kang-sik!
- Yes, Senior!

85
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:20,253
Move! Damn it!

86
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,345
Move, quickly!

87
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,231
Move!

88
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,123
Good grief.

89
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,374
Hey, wait for me!

90
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:58,749
Hey, there's no more room
for you to run.

91
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:01,134
Get out now.

92
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:05,004
Let's go down together quietly,
before I lose my patience!

93
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,165
Stop! Put the knife down!

94
00:07:15,843 --> 00:07:16,963
Put it down right now, you bastard!

95
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,669
He's dead?

96
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,709
How about this?

97
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,534
Unlucky.

98
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:09,734
Honey, what should I do now?

99
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,103
I'll handle this.
Sergeant Noh, come down now.

100
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,037
What do you mean? Someone died.
This is not a trivial matter.

101
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:23,595
Unlucky.

102
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,253
Let me take responsibility.
You just come down.

103
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:29,367
I caused this
for trying to save you.

104
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,992
I also share the responsibility.

105
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,180
I have many achievements.

106
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:39,525
If I explain the situation,
maybe the punishment is just suspension.

107
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:42,414
So, go. Now.

108
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:46,293
Honey, this isn't just a suspension!

109
00:08:46,387 --> 00:08:48,267
This could ruin your career!

110
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:52,574
- If you get fired, what will happen?
- Noh Kang-sik.

111
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,134
If so, you just do it
who will support me later.

112
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:01,973
Darling.

113
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:23,504
I was the one who shot him.

114
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,729
Hi everybody.

115
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,500
Thank you for your hard work.
Yes thank you.

116
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,349
- What are you here for?
- Because you didn't answer my calls.

117
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:49,477
Good afternoon, Senior.

118
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:51,293
We often hear about you.

119
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:52,973
It is an honor
for me to be able to meet in person.

120
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,814
Good afternoon.

121
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:56,045
Oh my. What honor?
I retired a long time ago.

122
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,428
Hey. Come on, come out. Let's go.

123
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:00,203
See you later, Senior.

124
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,668
Keep the spirit Okay.
Thank you for your hard work.

125
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:04,533
You're going straight home, right?

126
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:08,254
Yes. Tonight, I will
cook your favorite budae-jjigae.

127
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,894
See you later, yeah.

128
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:14,047
- Chu Kyeong-ja.
- Yes?

129
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,155
You don't regret it?

130
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:17,883
Regret what?

131
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,254
No, it won't happen.
Come on, just go.

132
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:31,534
GWANGJUSEON POLICE OFFICE

133
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,923
If it puts too much strain on the joints,
you will regret it later in old age.

134
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:40,668
If you don't control your breath,
could be injured.

135
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:42,498
Good. Once again.

136
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,971
- It feels good, right?
- No, it's very heavy.

137
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:46,123
Heavy, huh?

138
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:48,773
I finished my free PT session today.
and plan to register.

139
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:52,141
- Yes.
- But can I register with another coach?

140
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:57,326
Of course you can.
But I'm the head trainer at this gym.

141
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,283
Former gold medal winner
at the national swimming championship.

142
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,068
I know what you're thinking.

143
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,974
But trust me, in the end
you will definitely come back to me.

144
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:09,894
So believe me, sign up.
I guarantee your body will change completely.

145
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:13,014
But it looks like you need it too
shape your body first.

146
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:18,179
I deliberately made this small,
so that the muscles look clearer.

147
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,461
The trainer's body is really good, huh.

148
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:23,294
Seems a bit excessive, huh?
It's just water muscle, not solid muscle.

149
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:27,133
How can you lift that much weight?
Crazy, that's awesome.

150
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,914
That's normal.
Any coach could be like that.

151
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,056
- You can too?
- Of course, I can.

152
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:35,454
- Why?
- Can you try?

153
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:41,934
Oh my. You're such a tease.
Let me show you directly.

154
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,281
- Chung-go.
- Yes.

155
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:45,757
- Alternate.
- That's heavy.

156
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,534
How heavy is it?
Look carefully.

157
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:51,114
This is called a barbell.

158
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:54,254
Hold it about the width of a palm.

159
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:56,373
If the elbow goes out, it can cause injury.

160
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,414
Maintain a 90 degree position,
then one, two, three.

161
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,574
- Let me help you a little, okay?
- Let go.

162
00:12:07,981 --> 00:12:09,221
Lift!

163
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:12,574
Well. See, right?
Lookâ€¦

164
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,894
- Coach, are you okay?
- Just register with him.

165
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,533
Oh, my goodness.

166
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,733
Here, look at this bright red car.

167
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:30,173
If you can't park like this,
why drive an imported car?

168
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:32,013
- Good grief.
- Let's see.

169
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:36,674
I can't stand the taste.
Again, this number 8279.

170
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,413
- Good grief.
- Hello, ma'am.

171
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:40,173
Oh my gosh, seriously.

172
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:43,453
What is a foreign car?
some kind of social status, yeah?

173
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:46,813
Since three weeks ago, the car
always park covering two lots.

174
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:49,614
As if this area is
private parking space.

175
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,533
Wow, this is truly the act of unethical humans.

176
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:53,294
Who dares to park like that?
In our apartment?

177
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:56,159
It turns out our apartment
also has "parking criminals".

178
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:01,174
EPISODE 2
WAR WITH PARKING CRIMINALS

179
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,053
Part time job
for housewives.

180
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:04,333
Work from home.

181
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:06,293
Income one million per month
from side business.

182
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:07,605
Income according to work.

183
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:11,715
Wow, this is a dream job.

184
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,414
Oh, the salary is small.
In fact, the location is close. What a shame.

185
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,869
Oh, there's a restless spirit that hasn't been found yet.
Have you ever worked part time?

186
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:24,253
When eating,
eat in peace.

187
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,307
When eating, I eat quietly.

188
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:30,222
I have to get going again soon.

189
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:32,534
Here, to Block 205, Unit 1002, okay?

190
00:13:32,814 --> 00:13:34,654
- Ji-hyun.
- Have you come?

191
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:37,533
- Well, you guys eat this.
- Wow, thank you.

192
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,893
- Then, I'll take the tomato one, okay?
- I ate, yes.

193
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:40,974
Yes, please.

194
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,373
- It's delicious, isn't it?
- Very sweet.

195
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:44,454
This is my own creation.

196
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,589
Wow, you're all here.

197
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,693
- Are you here yet?
- So-hee.

198
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,933
My delivery for
Today is finished.

199
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,293
- Good work.
- Here, you take one too.

200
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:56,413
It was just right when I was
need sugar. Thank you very much.

201
00:13:56,414 --> 00:14:00,733
But earlier when I passed by, I saw
The Chairwoman of the Association was very upset.

202
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:03,014
- Why?
- There are cars parked carelessly...

203
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:04,613
...covering two parking spaces.

204
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:06,854
- That red BMW, huh?
- What?

205
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:09,653
- I already guessed.
- You know? You saw it too?

206
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,813
Oh, don't ask.
That's really the parking bugger.

207
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:14,853
He said he moved three weeks ago.
and is notorious for its bad parking practices.

208
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,893
- What?
- He once parked in the driveway...

209
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:19,787
...until other cars can't get through.

210
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:23,013
Then a week ago, he double parked
and lock it with the handbrake,

211
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,414
until one big noisy environment.

212
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:26,287
- Move the car.
- How about this?

213
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:27,322
A WEEK AGO

214
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:32,733
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

215
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,333
The Chairman of the Association was late
to the wedding of his eldest son,

216
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,520
until unable to participate in the procession
family entry and candle lighting.

217
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,976
Geez.

218
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,227
Old Man's Vegetable Truck
from Block 1 No. 103 can't get out,

219
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,973
finally not selling
at all that day.

220
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,653
The child of the family in Block 2 No. 101 is sick
and have to go to the hospital,

221
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,214
but the parking attendant is being reckless
don't want to pick up the phone,

222
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,893
to the point of having to call an ambulance.

223
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:55,755
Geez. So, the ambulance came
was it because of that at that time?

224
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,034
- That's too much.
- That's totally absurd.

225
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:02,434
When delivering food,
I had a chance to see the owner of the car.

226
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,790
She was wearing a branded cardigan.
so tight that it's unpleasant to look at,

227
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:10,675
full of gold accessories on hands and neck,
and carrying a typical debt collector's bag.

228
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,492
There are tattoos on his body too.
Totally like a thug.

229
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:15,128
Wait, is he a thug or a gangster?

230
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:17,035
I hope I can face it,
let him learn his lesson.

231
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,813
- Is there food at home?
- There is. Are you hungry?

232
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:27,064
Very hungry.

233
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:28,699
Let's go in.

234
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:32,693
Damn. Who parked?
In this special place of mine?

235
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:35,014
Honey, you're late.
Just park somewhere else.

236
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:37,914
Do I have to park somewhere else?

237
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,894
This place is just the right size
for my beloved car.

238
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:45,213
Far from the tree,
so there is no fallout of bird droppings.

239
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:48,614
It's also close to the entrance, so it's practical.

240
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,683
Damn, this is just pissing me off.

241
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,133
- Darling.
- Why?

242
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:57,493
You must be MBTI J.
Very well planned.

243
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,194
- It's so cool, right?
- Very cool.

244
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,045
Where should I park now?
It just stresses me out.

245
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:09,223
Geez.

246
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:12,670
Okay, park anywhere.
Come on, let's go quickly.

247
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,059
Yes, good.

248
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:17,734
- This way.
- Yes, that way.

249
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:22,134
What?
Oh my gosh, what is this?

250
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,054
Wow.

251
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,573
You are crazy.

252
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:32,853
Who is the bastard who dares?
do this to my car?

253
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:35,933
Geez, he really has bad intentions.

254
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,533
Who did this?

255
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:39,733
- Honey, I'm hungry.
- What happen?

256
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,626
- What do you want to eat?
- Who are these people?

257
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,246
Malatang?

258
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,514
You, you keep eating malatang.

259
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,534
Wow, someone attached it
gum in your car, huh?

260
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,414
Ma'am, maybe there is
who holds a grudge against you?

261
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:55,102
Hey, do you know the guy?

262
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,373
So, don't like to look for problems.

263
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,253
Why are you complicating things?

264
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,934
Damn. Come on in.

265
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,499
- Hey, you!
- You look so beautiful today.

266
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,598
What the heck? Look at them.

267
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,295
Crazy. How can I face this?
humans without ethics like this?

268
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:18,994
Wow, this place doesn't even have CCTV.

269
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:22,374
- Wait a minute.
- Kyeong-ja, I think I know who did it.

270
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:28,114
CHEWING GUM

271
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,933
This gum is selling well, isn't it?

272
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:35,294
Not really. Look, it's so dusty.
Rarely does anyone look for it.

273
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:39,459
But if I'm not mistaken, a few days ago,
someone bought some.

274
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:42,333
Is that person big in stature,
pot-bellied,

275
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:44,934
no neck,
and have a tattoo like this?

276
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,699
How do you know?

277
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,349
That fat bastard.
Absolutely insolent.

278
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:53,272
I can't believe it
how can there be such a person.

279
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,494
Good grief.

280
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:58,100
But how could you know?
Is that the same candy?

281
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:02,894
The color of the gum that sticks
in Kyeong-ja's car it was a bit bright red.

282
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:06,253
That means it's not just any candy,

283
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:10,194
but the type of chewing gum with
many synthetic dyes such as sweet paint.

284
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:16,294
Then, I saw
The man's tongue was very red.

285
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,634
At that moment, I was immediately convinced.

286
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:24,813
Now we know the culprit.
So, what's your plan?

287
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:27,854
What else? We just have to reply.

288
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,461
Don't worry.
I already have a plan.

289
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:37,532
Wow, why the jokbal?
there are so many like this?

290
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:41,434
- You like jokbal, right?
- What? What's the event?

291
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:42,653
There is no event.

292
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,814
Earlier I passed in front of Block 3
and there is a truck of freshly cooked jokbal.

293
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:49,134
I immediately wrapped it up
the big size.

294
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:50,254
Still warm.

295
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,779
This is weird.

296
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,454
- This is suspicious. There must be something.
- Oh my gosh. This is just jokbal.

297
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,254
Okay, tell the truth.

298
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:07,214
Well, your instincts are sharp.

299
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:10,566
So, here it is.

300
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,900
There was a bastard who stuck it on earlier
gum in my car.

301
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:19,720
No need to look far to find criminals.
He is all around us.

302
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:22,189
That's why I want to ask for help.

303
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:24,673
I know the license plate number.

304
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:29,174
How about you
help ticket that person?

305
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:32,493
I already guessed.
You're causing trouble again.

306
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:37,014
I'm having a headache
with a pile of cases in the office.

307
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,853
Moreover, nowadays,
you think it's easy?

308
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:41,254
So gross.

309
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:44,653
Sometimes you are
more annoying than strangers.

310
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:49,494
Even Mi-ri, who just moved in, immediately
offers help for revenge.

311
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:54,375
Mi-ri? The one from Block 213 number 1004?
- Yes.

312
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,134
I can. One more time.

313
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:04,133
Oh my gosh, the smell.
Did you drink that much?

314
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:05,144
With members.

315
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:09,923
With members.

316
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,749
Members, members continue.

317
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,368
Good grief.

318
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,772
Get up.

319
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:18,642
Ouch.

320
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,166
Did you pay for the replacement driver?

321
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:25,403
How much did you pay?

322
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,133
I don't know... I don't know...

323
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:29,411
Don't you give it
all the money in the wallet, huh?

324
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,678
- Unlucky.
- No.

325
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,507
I already guessed!
Base!

326
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:39,300
Good grief.

327
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,768
No, no.

328
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:47,583
- Card? Where's the card?
- I don't know, maybe somewhere.

329
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:50,860
- Where is that somewhere?
- Don't know.

330
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:53,387
Good grief,
you can't live like this!

331
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:55,260
This human being!
Wake up a little!

332
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:57,024
Geez!

333
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:58,854
- Sick...
- Good grief!

334
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:01,211
Sir, it hurts...

335
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:16,854
Oh, my goodness.
Where did it fall?

336
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,734
Maybe it got lost somewhere else?

337
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:23,689
Oh, don't let that happen.

338
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:28,599
I could be really crazy.

339
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:41,002
Damn, that's crazy.
Who else is parking in my spot?

340
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:45,154
Okay.

341
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:47,450
Okay.

342
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:54,114
- Hello?
- Hey, help me out for a second.

343
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:57,341
- What?
- See that beat-up car on the left?

344
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:01,746
Found you too.

345
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:07,965
Park Seungho, you must be in trouble
so you can repent!

346
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:10,119
Gosh, it's stressing me out!

347
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,923
What's this?
Who parks this badly?

348
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:17,984
Good grief!

349
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:21,950
Oh, how is this?

350
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,418
Oh my, they're crazy, huh?

351
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,287
Oh, I left my phone behind too.

352
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:34,974
There's no way I'm kicking
car roof too.

353
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:42,149
What is this?

354
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,054
Why die?

355
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:49,694
The battery is dead?
Don't let it run out.

356
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,342
Geez.

357
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:58,474
I'm trapped? I'm really trapped?

358
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,659
Park Seung Hoâ€¦

359
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,254
Excuse me.

360
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:09,534
There's someone trapped in the car.

361
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,855
Is there anyone outside?

362
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:14,774
Oops, I'm sorry.

363
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,986
Hello. Is there anyone here?

364
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:21,375
Pack.
Thank you very much.

365
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,620
What are you doing in the car?
It is late.

366
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,794
I'm stuck in the car
and the battery is dead.

367
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:32,813
The car over here and the one in front,
everything is in the way.

368
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:36,173
Can you please help push?
car in front, sir?

369
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:37,732
Wait a moment.

370
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:39,548
Yes thank you.

371
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:48,374
Wow, looks like the handbrake is on.

372
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,213
- What?
- Yes, they often do that.

373
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,774
If so, can you help me call him?

374
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:57,074
- Oh, looks like it was rejected.
- What?

375
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:58,853
He didn't pick up the phone.

376
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:03,159
If so, can you help me with the phone?
to the next car, sir?

377
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:05,934
- No numbers are attached.
- What?

378
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:09,472
This one has a number. I'll try it, okay?

379
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,309
This looks like a store number.

380
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,773
Please, please pick up.

381
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,674
Ouch.

382
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:21,213
No answer either.
How about this?

383
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,224
Not answered?

384
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:25,708
Pack,

385
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:30,589
can I borrow your phone for a moment
to call home?

386
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:31,624
Of course.

387
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,558
Park Seung-ho, how outrageous.

388
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,279
- The number you are callingâ€¦
- Park Hyun-ji.

389
00:25:01,037 --> 00:25:03,654
Really,
The Park family is all the same.

390
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:06,213
Oh, Mi-ri.

391
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,373
- Good grief.
- Ji-hyun.

392
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:11,249
It's so cramped, oh my.
What is this?

393
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:14,413
I've never been like this before.
Very cold.

394
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:18,133
Mi-ri, hold on a little longer.
Mr. Kim is going up to your house.

395
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:21,774
- Yes.
- Those thugs are really too much.

396
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:24,894
I mean, don't touch it, right?

397
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,174
I've been up and down
pressed the bell, but there was no answer.

398
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:32,758
If so, please call
tow truck only.

399
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,169
This is private land, ma'am.

400
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:36,171
- Cannot be towed.
- What?

401
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:40,091
If parking is illegal on private property,
the police can't do much.

402
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:42,453
Oh my, the law needs to be updated.

403
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:45,453
I'll try to check first if it's possible
broadcast over loudspeakers.

404
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:47,337
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

405
00:25:47,388 --> 00:25:48,234
Yes.

406
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:54,086
Kyeong-ja, I think I'm in danger.

407
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,040
- He said he was in danger.
- Why?

408
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,707
- I can't hold it in anymore.
- He couldn't take it anymore, he said.

409
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:05,968
- I could explode.
- Explodeâ€¦ What?

410
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:10,636
Mi-ri. Behind. Look behind you.

411
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:15,774
How to use this?

412
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:19,514
Please find something better.

413
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,054
Fast.

414
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,734
- Can you still hold it?
- This is already alert level one.

415
00:26:31,814 --> 00:26:34,453
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Oh my gosh, Kyeong-ja.

416
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,214
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Come here.

417
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,013
This won't fit.

418
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,254
- It's true, I can't get in.
- Can't.

419
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:47,173
Try pulling a little, pulling a little.

420
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:48,184
Oh Lord.

421
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,013
- Wait, I'll look again.
- Hurry up, okay?

422
00:26:52,014 --> 00:26:54,384
Please, someone. Save me.

423
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:58,213
Oh, I forgot. There's still this.
Well, use this bag.

424
00:26:58,214 --> 00:27:00,773
- Is this the only way?
- What else can we do?

425
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:04,133
This is better than pants, right?

426
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:06,054
This can go in, fast.

427
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,414
The bags from our store are strong.

428
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:14,774
Oh my, damn.
I'm really sorry.

429
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,693
- Have arrived.
- This can be used.

430
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:24,679
- Well, take it.
- This is the best. Try it.

431
00:27:27,343 --> 00:27:28,234
You can.

432
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:33,213
- You can do it. Come on!
- Fast.

433
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:34,909
- You guys turn around.
- There are only three of us.

434
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:37,374
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

435
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,549
- Ji-hyun.
- Yes.

436
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,108
Mi-ri might be embarrassed.
So, we just sing a song.

437
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,294
Okay, I'll sing, okay?

Why do you always sing that song?

442
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:06,574

I won't let it happen
just passed by.

454
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:56,014
I will take revenge
to that bastard.

455
00:28:58,574 --> 00:28:59,814
Okay, I'm ready.

456
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:03,554
- You, the fat tattooed one.
- Today you will die.

457
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,614
Ready? One, two, three.

458
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,877
Why is this? Damn it.

459
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:26,439
Just a charade.

460
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,587
What? Is that your car?
Is that woman crazy?

461
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:32,453
Just look, this is just acting.
They just lie.

462
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:35,613
If true, he could be caught
charges of destruction of property.

463
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:36,674
Arrested by the police.

464
00:29:38,981 --> 00:29:40,381
Still no response?

465
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,194
It seems to have been read,
but no reply.

466
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:47,094
Mi-ri, what now?

467
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:50,013
We have to send something hot
and bite,

468
00:29:50,014 --> 00:29:51,454
which must have annoyed him.

469
00:29:52,397 --> 00:29:53,619
- Okay.
- Yes.

470
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,794
- Wait a moment. Thank You.
- Yes.

471
00:30:01,654 --> 00:30:03,334
- Ji-hyun, nice portrait, huh.
- Okay.

472
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,395
One,

473
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:09,212
two, three.

474
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,631
What kind of crazy woman is this?
Damn it.

475
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:28,594
Honey, why are you
suddenly wearing this?

476
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:31,333
Good grief.

477
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:39,676
Madam, are you crazy?
Why lift someone else's car, huh?

478
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,173
I'm just warming up.

479
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:46,213
I used to exercise,
so my muscles are still strong.

480
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,253
If my car arrives
just a little scratch,

481
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:50,333
I won't let you
just get away with it.

482
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:51,732
Your car?

483
00:30:51,814 --> 00:30:54,333
More important than cars are people.

484
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:57,853
Because of you, there are people who are trapped
in the car overnight.

485
00:30:57,854 --> 00:31:00,414
These women
really annoying.

486
00:31:00,454 --> 00:31:03,614
What? If you want to move it,
yeah just say it.

487
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:10,969
Mi-ri.

488
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,494
What?

489
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:19,934
You won't apologize to me?

490
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:22,591
Apologize? What is that?

491
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,493
I hate apples the most.

492
00:31:25,532 --> 00:31:27,758
If the type
Shine Muscat grapes are another matter.

493
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,573
Honey, you are so cute.

494
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,533
It's funny, right? Damn.

495
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:33,314
What a pain in the ass, damn it.

496
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:35,775
Oh, it's so noisy.

497
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:42,194
Don't want to apologize, huh?

498
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,213
WELCOME.
Ah, so much fun.

499
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:52,853
Please come in. Yes, this is a bazaar. Yes.

500
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:54,693
MOTHERS' BAZAAR
GWANGSEON JUGONG COMMUNITY

501
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:58,064
Come on. We're having a bazaar. Come on in.

502
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,454
We accept support items for the bazaar.

503
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:02,493
Yes, we accept support items.

504
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:05,013
Thank You.
These books are invaluable.

505
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:06,829
Thank you.

506
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:09,178
These are the Mothers of the Gwangseon Jugong Community.

507
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:12,754
Unlucky.

508
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:16,094
What is this?

509
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:18,084
Find out quickly, okay?

510
00:32:19,225 --> 00:32:21,843
Car from outside
can't park here, right?

511
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:24,213
I have to go. They have to.
Immediately move the car.

512
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:26,734
We don't have the owner's contact.
We will take care of it immediately.

513
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,470
Hurry up and find out.

514
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:32,853
Oh, what about tonight's appointment?
I have to go.

515
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:34,245
Are you looking, damn it?

516
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,202
What a bastard
the most jerk, right?

517
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,253
How should we act
that pervert and annoying person?

518
00:32:44,424 --> 00:32:46,773
I really can't stand it
looking at them both,

519
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:48,556
the tattooed man and his girlfriend
who are like two lovebirds.

520
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:52,574
When I was delivering the goods,
I see he is truly human trash.

521
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:54,974
Hey, where are you going? Not that way.

522
00:32:55,014 --> 00:33:00,814
- Good grief.
- ♪ You're stupid, it's really not me. ♪

523
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:04,933
Absolutely insane. Disgusting.

524
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,613
♪ You're stupid, it's really not me. ♪

525
00:33:07,614 --> 00:33:09,454
Restart.

526
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,853
Why is he always like that?

527
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:16,933
What? There's money today. Damn it.

528
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:18,093
- Do you want to eat ice cream?
- Yes.

529
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:20,774
Don't go to the store.
Just go to the place I told you to.

530
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:22,733
I've told you everything.

531
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,447
Come on, put on your mask, quickly.
Wear a mask.

532
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:29,064
There's already a long queue, right?
This is all here.

533
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,884
The turnover is already three hundred million.

534
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:34,677
Come on, you also come and help serve.

535
00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:37,013
I'll pay.

536
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:41,839
- Hey, please sort the trash.
- Damn, I'm so busy.

537
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:42,874
Geez.

538
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:45,574
Sir, let me help you.
Please give it to me.

539
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,279
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

540
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:54,363
Delicious black meat from Jeju?

541
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,230
- Delicious black meat from Jeju?
- Yes.

542
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:59,347
It's a big meat restaurant that just opened.
at the main road intersection, right?

543
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:02,133
I saw it from outside.

544
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:04,133
Lunch time is always full
until there are no seats.

545
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:05,774
Want to order another one?
special lunch menu?

546
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:07,853
If you order kimchi jjigae
as a special lunch menu,

547
00:34:07,854 --> 00:34:09,453
get one free serving of galbi.

548
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,214
He said, many leaflets were distributed.

549
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:13,167
Wow, you must have made a big profit.

550
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,773
Very delicious.

551
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:17,333
That's why he can drive a luxury car
and wear branded goods.

552
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:18,974
No matter how much money,

553
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:22,734
does it make sense for people to look for food
in this environment do like that?

554
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:24,814
Just listen to the story
can make me faint.

555
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:30,014
What is this?
Why is it in bread?

556
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,188
Wow, that's so funny.

557
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,759
- What's that?
- Stickers.

558
00:34:35,746 --> 00:34:37,059
I must have it.

559
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:42,013
- I gave it 5 stars, right?
- 5 stars? Really?

560
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:44,174
- Of course.
- Are you serious?

561
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:48,546
Darling, who's sticking
stickers on your car?

562
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:50,617
What's this?

563
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:57,494
What is this?

564
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:00,374
Who dares to do this?

565
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:04,788
I'm going to go crazy like this.
How can this be?

566
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,533
Look. Quickly let go.
Don't just keep quiet.

567
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:11,550
Gosh, why did you tell me to?
My nails will be damaged.

568
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:14,494
Nonsense.
Get off quickly!

569
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,233
Come on, quickly.
Why is it so hard to let go?

570
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:24,800
What a bunch of crazy women.

571
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:38,254
The boss has arrived.
But where is the car parked?

572
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:42,112
Don't ask too many questions.
I'm really upset.

573
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,314
Good.

574
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,742
- By the way, Boss.
- What?

575
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:49,709
But when can we
got your salary last month?

576
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:51,078
You areâ€¦

577
00:35:51,414 --> 00:35:53,373
Has it been a month?
It hasn't even been a year, right?

578
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,174
It's only a week late.

579
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,000
- Yes.
- Who said you won't get paid?

580
00:35:57,462 --> 00:35:58,514
It is not like that,

581
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,534
- Butâ€¦
- What?

582
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,813
You said three months from now,
the salary is according to the minimum wage, right?

583
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:10,054
By the way, these past few days, you've been out.
five minutes earlier than working hours.

584
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,773
That's called being absent from work.

585
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,099
Work properly.

586
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:16,914
Ready.

587
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:19,274
Thank You.

588
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:24,974
Skipping work? Isn't that skipping work?

589
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,121
You stupid.

590
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:30,653
Oh my, what is this?

591
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,894
I can't take it anymore. Ouch, ouch.

592
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:37,494
Oh my, this is a mess.

593
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:42,013
Let's get this sorted out.
I'm really angry.

594
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:46,613
The car is luxurious,
but the owner is so cheap.

595
00:36:46,614 --> 00:36:49,573
Oh, stupid and doesn't know the rules.

596
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:51,946
Seriously, this can't be allowed to happen any longer.

597
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:55,014
DELICIOUS BLACK MEAT FROM JEJU

598
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,054
It's delicious, isn't it? Right?

599
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:01,013
This is the meat we brought
straight from Jeju.

600
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:02,213
Please come in.

601
00:37:02,214 --> 00:37:03,494
Come on. Pay first.

602
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,893
Soju! Hey, sir.
Want some more soju?

603
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,892
Oh, you're here again. Sorry, sorry.

604
00:37:09,814 --> 00:37:12,463
Hey, why did you throw that away?

605
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:15,094
It's past its expiration date.

606
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:19,023
You idiot, how could you not?
love your own shop?

607
00:37:20,068 --> 00:37:22,308
It's only been a week since it expired.

608
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,714
No, Boss.

609
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,134
It smells bad.

610
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:38,052
It doesn't matter.
That's how it works.

611
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:42,659
Go away, get out!

612
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:46,251
What a nag. Why isn't there any?
a sense of ownership of this place?

613
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:03,414
- Please add more side dishes, okay?
- Yes, wait a minute.

614
00:38:03,807 --> 00:38:05,366
Our home-cooked side dishes are delicious.

615
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:08,573
The food is clean and the presentation is neat.

616
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:10,453
Yes, it is clean.
If there is anything missing, just tell me.

617
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,564
That's how it is.

618
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,915
Geez.

619
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:19,112
You crazy mothers.

620
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:26,274
Of all the places there are,
you guys came here instead.

621
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:29,573
Hey, ladies. You want to apologize?
for messing with my car?

622
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:34,028
It's fine. I've reported it.
everyone to the police station...

623
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,573
...on charges of destruction of property.

624
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,514
Good. We also want to report to the police.

625
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:44,254
I did nothing wrong.
What was reported?

626
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:46,253
You guys made a lot of mistakes.

627
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:51,454
- How about this? Should I start first?
- Yes.

628
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:53,773
DELICIOUS BLACK MEAT FROM JEJU

629
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:56,174
Delicious black meat from Jeju?

630
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:00,954
What is this?

631
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:07,133
MEAT FROM DENMARK

632
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:11,294
Wow, really interesting person.

633
00:39:11,374 --> 00:39:13,534
Is there any proof? Is there any?

634
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:15,516
If you want proof, here it is.

635
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:18,324
Here he is.

636
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:20,574
ORIGIN OF JEJU

637
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,494
Where did you get this? This is slander.

638
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,352
If you want to pretend you don't know,
How about this?

639
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:33,053
But when can we
got your salary last month?

640
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:34,094
You areâ€¦

641
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:37,121
Has it been a month?
It hasn't even been a year, right?

642
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:39,214
It's only a week late.

643
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:41,414
Okay, thank you.

644
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:50,807
Good afternoon.

645
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:54,415
By the way, these past few days, you've been out.
five minutes earlier than working hours.

646
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,101
Oh my gosh, that's what it meansâ€¦

647
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:57,661
That's called being absent from work...

648
00:39:57,972 --> 00:40:03,570
That's a minimum wage violation
and salary arrears.

649
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:07,726
But it's not that I don't want to pay.

650
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:09,652
Hey, Employees.

651
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,236
Hey, I said I'll pay!

652
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:16,453
And saving is allowed,

653
00:40:16,454 --> 00:40:20,653
but if you use it
back to the leftover side dishes, that's too much.

654
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:21,934
What are you talking about?

655
00:40:22,414 --> 00:40:24,853
That is not true.
Nonsense!

656
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:28,413
There is nothing left,
but why are leftover side dishes used again?

657
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:32,161
Madam, what are you talking about?
No, it's not. It's a lie.

658
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:34,366
It's only been a week since it expired.

659
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:39,774
- It smells bad.
- It's okay. That's how it is.

660
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:43,657
When was this recorded?

661
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:46,373
I justâ€¦

662
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:50,894
You do it secretly,
so we also secretly recorded.

663
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:53,792
Who recorded this? Who?

664
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:57,121
Not me. Him.

665
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,628
His salary has not been paid for two months.

666
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:11,799
If their salaries were paid on time,
we wouldn't have known until it was like this.

667
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:13,883
We all live on hourly wages.

668
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,267
Go all of you!

669
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:19,573
I will sue you all
who recorded without permission.

670
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,093
Is the shop owner here?

671
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:23,494
- Who are you?
- We are from the surveillance team.

672
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:24,866
Surveillance team?

673
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:27,527
Yes.

674
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:32,554
- What is this?
- We are from the surveillance team.

675
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:35,853
There are reports that this store is featuring
information on the origin of fake products...

676
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:40,454
...and use the same food ingredients
has passed the expiration date.

677
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:44,463
No, that's not true.
No, wait a minute.

678
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:48,333
- What's wrong with this shop?
- He said it was a fraud about the origin of the product.

679
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:51,493
Sell â€‹â€‹rotten meat that has been
past the expiration date?

680
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:53,293
Do business the right way.

681
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:55,042
I won't be coming here again.

00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:07,334
BUSINESS CLOSURE NOTICE LETTER
FOR 30 DAYS

684
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,708
Damn! What a shame!

685
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,329
These crazy women
really makes me angry.

686
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:14,954
I won't just keep quiet.

687
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,080
Hey, where are you guys?

688
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:25,474
Bring all your cars
to the apartment complex right now.

689
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:27,387
Right now!

690
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,047
Ready, last operation name,
"The rat in the trap."

691
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:46,858
Operation begins.

692
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:54,000
Ready, last operation name,
"The rat in the trap."

693
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,811
Operation begins.

694
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:05,332
OK, let's finish it today
once and for all.

695
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:08,665
You crazy mothers.

696
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,053
I'm almost there.

697
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:14,836
What's this?

698
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:19,993
Security guard, tell them to move this car.

699
00:43:20,018 --> 00:43:23,057
The tire is flat, so it's not possible yet
moved now.

700
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:25,497
Have to wait for the insurance company to come.

701
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:28,102
Oh, damn it.
Just go through the back door.

702
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:30,207
The entrance is blocked.

703
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:34,893
Gotcha!

704
00:43:42,613 --> 00:43:44,577
What is this?

705
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,369
Hey! What's this, ma'am?

706
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:51,515
What is this?

707
00:43:56,744 --> 00:43:57,857
Move your cars.

708
00:43:58,449 --> 00:43:59,969
I said, move!

709
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,127
You crazy mothers.

710
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:04,897
What should I do?

711
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,843
I don't know where the car keys are.
My clothes don't have any pockets either.

712
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:11,931
I will not remain silentâ€¦

713
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:17,304
What? Damn it.

714
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,688
If you don't want to
This ugly car is totally broken down today,

715
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:21,008
quickly move the car.

716
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:25,652
My friend is coming and we
will destroy all your cars.

717
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,848
VISITORS - RESIDENTS

718
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:33,368
What the heck is this? Sir, you guys
what are you doing at this time of night?

719
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,137
You can't see it?
We are painting.

720
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:37,097
Call.

721
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:38,897
Good.

722
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:41,247
Okay, my car too
it's time to change it.

723
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:44,247
While getting compensation,
just buy a new car.

724
00:44:44,272 --> 00:44:47,662
Yeah, just destroy my car.

725
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,889
My bumper is also badly scratched.

726
00:44:51,821 --> 00:44:53,689
Why are you like this to me?

727
00:44:53,877 --> 00:44:57,977
Seriously. Is anyone hurt?
Or even die?

728
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:03,764
You still don't realize it?

729
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:07,337
Friends, how about
let's go for a beer?

730
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:08,804
- Not bad.
- Agree.

731
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:11,017
Where are you going?

732
00:45:11,748 --> 00:45:14,697
Ladies, move your cars,
then you can go.

733
00:45:14,722 --> 00:45:16,402
♪ - If flowers bloomâ€¦ ♪
- Moms!

734
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,547
♪ If flowers bloomâ€¦ ♪

735
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:22,416
Damn it.

736
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,266
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.

737
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:45,369
This is really annoying.

738
00:45:50,794 --> 00:45:52,873
- Hello?
- Why haven't you come yet?

739
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:54,892
Damn it. Since you guys haven't come yet, I...

740
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,577
Anyway, come quickly, okay?

741
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:01,241
At the main door there is
the kindergarten shuttle car was blocking the way.

742
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:02,394
Kindergarten shuttle car?

743
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:04,113
The car tire was flat.

744
00:46:04,232 --> 00:46:06,248
I'm really unlucky.

745
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:09,134
Hey, just go through the back door.

746
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,890
But my car can't either
enter through the back door.

747
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:15,137
And I have to close up shop for a while.

748
00:46:15,552 --> 00:46:19,457
Hey, man. So stop being nosy.

749
00:46:20,273 --> 00:46:21,737
Hey!

750
00:46:22,252 --> 00:46:23,932
Don't just leave!

751
00:46:24,037 --> 00:46:26,796
- Darling.
- Say it quickly.

752
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:31,180
Can you pick me up? I'm here.
at Gwangseon Jugong parking lot.

753
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,124
Gwangseon? Who is this?

754
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:36,658
This is really urgent.
Please come here, okay?

755
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:38,682
- Wait a minute, please?
- Just relax.

756
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:40,116
Who are you with?

757
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:43,818
The signal here is bad.
What did you say earlier?

758
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,149
What is this? Hello?

759
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:47,714
- Nothing is heard.
- Who are you going with? Helloâ€¦

760
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,531
What the hellâ€¦

761
00:46:51,696 --> 00:46:52,698
What happen?

762
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,645
I can't call insurance?
Damn it!

763
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,388
Oh no!

764
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:02,706
Unlucky.

765
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:04,781
Oh, it's cold.

766
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:14,191
Where the petrol is also running out.

767
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,977
The battery is also dead.

768
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:39,096
Unlucky.

769
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:47,959
Gosh, it's so cold.

770
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:55,577
Oh my, how can this be?

771
00:47:56,794 --> 00:48:01,183
Hey, is anyone there?

772
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:03,954
Security guard! Help!

773
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:05,737
Good grief!

774
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,226
Gotcha.

775
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:30,754
Oh, I'm sorry.

776
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:34,773
I promise I won't do it again.

777
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:40,028
Please, please let my car out.

778
00:48:42,498 --> 00:48:47,747
People who can't be told nicely,
must experience directly to be aware.

779
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:51,802
- You're sorry enough, right?
- Yes.

780
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:55,427
Don't bother other people, okay?
We will be watching you.

781
00:48:55,452 --> 00:49:00,599
Yes, I will remember that.
Please, move the car quickly.

782
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:03,461
Let's move it.
It seems urgent.

783
00:49:05,194 --> 00:49:06,394
Thank You.

784
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,768
Wow, you came earlier today.
Keep moving forward, okay?

785
00:49:13,936 --> 00:49:15,030
Thanks for your help.

786
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,351
Good.

787
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:21,609
In front of Block 212,
there is an empty space for one car.

788
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:23,297
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

789
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:26,704
Just slowly.
Relax!

790
00:49:26,812 --> 00:49:29,832
Take it slow, okay!

791
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:43,017
Ladies, have you arrived yet?

792
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:46,217
- You keep working hard, huh?
- Working hard what?

793
00:49:46,394 --> 00:49:48,368
You guys come down.
Let me park it.

794
00:49:48,393 --> 00:49:50,873
- Do not bother.
- Get down.

795
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:53,052
Yeah, are you serious?

796
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:57,874
Hey, sir.
Don't double park like that.

797
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,815
Move the car.
Yes, please move it.

798
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,675
Please come in.
I'll bring the key home later.

799
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,760
- Okay thanks.
- Good.

800
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,890
It looks like he's come to his senses.

801
00:50:10,064 --> 00:50:14,197
Yes, but oddly enough, there's a funny side to it too.

802
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:16,353
I want to pick up my child first.

803
00:50:16,354 --> 00:50:17,474
- Be careful, ok.
- Yes.

804
00:50:19,404 --> 00:50:20,684
Good afternoon.

805
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:23,464
You're a resident of 1004, right?

806
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:25,938
Thank you very much
for your help yesterday.

807
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:29,252
- You're welcome. We just help each other.
- Geez.

808
00:50:29,815 --> 00:50:30,836
Excuse me, I have to come in first.

809
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,377
- Please come in.
- Yes.

810
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:35,673
Oh my gosh, the people are so friendly.

811
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:38,114
Is he new?
who moved into that house?

812
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:39,286
Yes, right.

813
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:44,218
So lucky
there are good people moving in.

814
00:50:44,243 --> 00:50:46,537
I don't think he knows
about that incident, huh?

815
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:49,530
I don't know, it seems so.

816
00:50:49,594 --> 00:50:53,680
- I told you, that's not true.
- It is true.

817
00:50:53,705 --> 00:50:55,204
Want to eat tteokbokki?

818
00:50:55,229 --> 00:50:58,104
Tteokbokki? No, I have an exam.
and the lesson has started.

819
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:08,467
The weather is very nice.

820
00:51:24,762 --> 00:51:26,125
- What is this?
- What?

821
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:27,788
What are you doing?

822
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:34,541
- Hey, don't run.
- Mi-ri.

823
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:43,130
Hey, don't run.
You crazy person. Stop!

824
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,874
Stop. Heyâ€¦

825
00:51:46,194 --> 00:51:48,721
- Oh, damn it.
- Don't run!

826
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:51,176
- Go after him!
- Stop.

827
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:57,260
Wait!

828
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:02,528
Don't run!

829
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:04,097
Hey!

830
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:11,871
Stop following me!
Oh, damn it.

831
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:12,916
Go after him!

832
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:16,233
METAL FACTORY

833
00:52:16,455 --> 00:52:17,465
Mi-ri.

834
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,434
- Mi-ri.
- Sir, here.

835
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:25,176
- Come on, come along.
- Chase the perpetrator.

836
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:28,866
Oh, we're so busy.
What is this?

837
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:34,530
We have gathered you,
but are you sure he came in here?

838
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:37,513
Who's in?
We are working.

839
00:52:37,514 --> 00:52:39,713
We have to send
goods arrive tonight.

840
00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:41,234
We don't have time for this.

841
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,339
What do you see?

842
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:44,382
Which person is that?

843
00:52:45,844 --> 00:52:46,591
Police officerâ€¦

844
00:52:47,953 --> 00:52:50,477
- Where is that child from?
- Good grief.

845
00:52:54,034 --> 00:52:55,097
Are you sure?

846
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,354
Come on everyone, let's talk inside.

847
00:52:59,395 --> 00:53:00,634
What do you want to talk about?

848
00:53:00,674 --> 00:53:02,833
Come on in and talk quickly.

849
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:06,354
- Okay, okay, come in quickly.
- Seriously.

850
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,691
- What does this mean?
- Yes, why did it turn out like this.

851
00:53:09,716 --> 00:53:10,903
Geez.

852
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,541
That's your stuff, isn't it?

853
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:18,434
Sorry, please forgive me.

854
00:53:18,902 --> 00:53:20,371
What have you done?

855
00:53:20,587 --> 00:53:23,721
I'm sorry. I may be a little crazy,
Please forgive me.

856
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:24,995
Come with me to the office.

857
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:30,658
Hey, Kim Kyung-hee, is she the culprit?
Crazy.

858
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:38,091
Wow, you're so great, Mi-ri.
How do you know?

859
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:42,874
I saw the size of the masked man
as big as this MP3,

860
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:44,735
so I asked the police...

861
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:48,306
...looking for one that size.

862
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:55,349
But I'm a bit hungry.
Let's eat something.

863
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,845
Mi-ri, want to eat tteokbokki at my house?

864
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,274
- Tteokbokki?
- Yes.

865
00:54:02,692 --> 00:54:05,012
- I would love to!
- Come on!

866
00:54:05,195 --> 00:54:08,034
Ta-da! Eat a lot, okay?

867
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:09,146
Thank You.

868
00:54:09,674 --> 00:54:10,684
You're welcome.

869
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:14,256
Let's eat.

870
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:16,375
How does it feel?

871
00:54:16,476 --> 00:54:19,422
Wow, that's delicious.
You should try it too.

872
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:26,434
Your mother is good at cooking.

873
00:54:26,485 --> 00:54:28,513
Yes, right? If you open it
snack stall, definitely sells well.

874
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:29,690
Yes, it is true.

875
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:32,114
After this, let's go for a walk, shall we?

876
00:54:32,886 --> 00:54:34,705
Where are you going, Ji-eun?

877
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:39,229
Ji-eun?

878
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:47,274
Ji-eun, why are you silent?
Ji-eun.

879
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:55,216
Ji-eun, look at me!

880
00:54:55,827 --> 00:54:59,646
Is anyone here?

881
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:04,804
Ji-eun, why you? Ji-eun.

882
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,641
POLICE LINE - DO NOT ENTRY

883
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:35,079
THREE MONTHS AGO

884
00:55:42,784 --> 00:55:44,624
If there is something strange,
report immediately.

885
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:46,354
Ready, we will work well.

886
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:04,275
FOR FIRE TRUCK ONLY

887
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,263
HARD DRUGS
ONLY WITH DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION

888
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:28,345
- Try checking this medicine.
- Yes.

889
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,433
This is Zolofut, the drug used
in the psychiatric department.

890
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:35,914
- Psychiatry?
- Yes.

891
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:40,954
Two daughters?
Oh, what will happen to them?

892
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,949
It's very spacious.

893
00:57:11,451 --> 00:57:13,794
Is this house really that cheap?

894
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:17,954
The homeowner is in a state
emergency, so it's sold quickly.

895
00:57:21,281 --> 00:57:23,013
I assume there is none
hidden problem, right?

896
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:26,927
There is no problem whatsoever,
the owner is very neat,

897
00:57:27,228 --> 00:57:28,977
so the house is like new.

898
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:32,469
It is very clean indeed.

899
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,393
The view is so beautiful.

900
00:57:43,394 --> 00:57:47,042
This is my favorite floor,
so units like this are very rare.

901
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:49,110
The one who gets it fast,
he is the lucky one.

902
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:51,703
FOR FIRE TRUCK ONLY

903
00:58:05,043 --> 00:58:06,277
I take this unit.

904
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:20,514
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPECIAL APPEARANCE
FROM KIM MIN-HO, KIM JUN-HYUN, MOON-HEE

905
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,417
You can't ignore
the kindness of your friend.

906
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:32,272
- He might be bullied at school.
- What?

907
00:58:32,297 --> 00:58:34,117
I'm afraid you feel lonely
beaten alone.

908
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:35,742
I called him on purpose
let me beat you all together.

909
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:37,117
Please stop!

910
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:39,322
- Attack!
- It turns out that all the damn thugs have gathered.

911
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,004
We will help you.

912
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,689
Please don't do anything.

913
00:58:42,714 --> 00:58:43,934
That's upstairs.

914
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:46,209
I think no one caught on
at the front gate.

915
00:58:46,234 --> 00:58:48,694
There are two reports coming in about
the presence of perverts in this environment.

916
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:51,939
We are still minors, whatever
what we do, will not be punished.

917
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:54,313
Every difficulty
there must be a way out.
