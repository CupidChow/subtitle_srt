What's this?

9
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:29,305
SAUCE?

10
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,416
Purple hair?

11
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,252
Swallow this!

12
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:36,826
Sir, please…

13
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:38,885
Help me.

14
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,433
Swallow it now.

15
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,423
If you had been obedient from the start,
it wouldn't be this complicated.

16
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:02,356
Have a good night's sleep.

17
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,276
This is a signal for help.

18
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,100
Hello, So-hee, our guess was right.

19
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:35,923
There is an emergency signal on the lid of the bowl.

20
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,148
Mi-ri, I'm busy.
I'll call you back later.

21
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:39,856
So-hee!

22
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:43,882
SAUCE?

23
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:47,395
So, you mean those part-time employees?
really locked up in that house?

24
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:50,015
So, the first thing to do is
what is done is to report it to the police.

25
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:52,494
This cannot be allowed.
I have to go now.

26
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,093
EPISODE 5 ABOUT THINGS THAT DISAPPEAR
Should not.

27
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:57,580
If you move carelessly,
we instead paved the way for him to escape.

28
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,353
But that's a request for help, isn't it?

29
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,328
I'm afraid something will happen
in our apartment.

30
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:06,381
Who knows? What if
That person turned out to be a murderous psychopath?

31
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,466
Murderer?

32
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,186
Hye Jung?

33
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:23,990
Hye Jung!

34
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,463
No!

35
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,094
If we don't know, that's another story.

36
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,563
But since I already know,
We can't stay silent. Let's go!

37
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,830
Where to?

38
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,936
Report to the police
is the safest move.

39
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,620
Or do you want to talk directly?
to Min-yeo's father?

40
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:49,456
Wait a minute.

41
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:53,435
We don't even have any proof
which is convincing.

42
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,929
Why is there no evidence?

43
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,635
We have that hair.

44
00:03:56,673 --> 00:04:00,933
It's just useful
if the police believe our theory.

45
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,513
And we have no witnesses.

46
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,359
Correct.

47
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,233
Maybe until now,
There have been no reports of missing persons.

48
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:09,106
After all, our position
only as a third party.

49
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,742
We need stronger evidence.

50
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,420
Irrefutable evidence!

51
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:33,546
Yes! Wait a minute.

52
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:37,859
Shut up.

53
00:04:42,453 --> 00:04:44,726
Hye-jung, don't move,
you'll get hurt later.

54
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:49,630
I?

55
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,523
Gosh, you guys must be crazy.
I can't!

56
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:53,681
Ji Hyun.

57
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,700
Ji-hyun, the owner of the convenience store
know my face and Kyeong-ja's.

58
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:58,913
I didn't hear!

59
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,276
Ji-hyun, think carefully.

60
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:05,500
If something happens
to the employee,

61
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:07,651
you can sleep soundly
with your character like that?

62
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,628
Why are you like this to me?

63
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,505
You want me to come in
into the tiger's den alone, huh?

64
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,898
I don't want to! I'm too scared!

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,165
Oh, Ji-hyun. Who knows?

66
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,380
Because of this, your life can change completely.

67
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,045
How did it change completely?

68
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,653
Ji-hyun. What is your biggest dream?

69
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,700
Join the Miz Silver Korea contest
and wearing a tiara crown.

70
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:29,479
What the heck is that?

71
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:30,573
It does exist.

72
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:34,860
It's a Miss Korea contest for mature women only.
aged 40 years and over.

73
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:36,072
Miz Korea?

74
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,919
The winner of Miz Silver Korea 2025 is…

75
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:42,359
Jeon Ji Hyun!

76
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,729
MIZ SILVER KOREA AWARDS 2025

77
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,243
At this very moment,
at the same time,

78
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,470
to Mr. Cheon Yong-man
from Gwangseon Store...

79
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,503
...who remains steadfast
guarding his shop like a rock.

80
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:02,570
And also the Zoomvengers Detective Team
from Gwangseon Jugong,

81
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:06,645
I want to share
this honor is with you.

82
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:12,459
It's a very beautiful night.

83
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,295
- Jeon Ji Hyun.
- I love you guys.

84
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,791
- Jeon Ji Hyun.
- Jeon Ji Hyun.

85
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:23,076
Ji-hyun, listen.

86
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:26,962
You have a naturally beautiful face.
Slender body.

87
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,116
The sound is also not competitive
with Song Ga-in.

88
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,753
Well, that's right! Not less competitive.

89
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,903
But there is one thing.

90
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,423
There's only one thing missing from you.
You know that?

91
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:40,850
Unlucky in terms of husbands?

92
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:43,063
No. Acting skills!

93
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,836
You have the ability to speak
outstanding,

94
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:49,929
but a little lacking in acting skills
that comes from the heart.

95
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:54,082
Yes, that's why we're going to use this.
as real-world acting practice.

96
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,048
- So true!
- Yes.

97
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,055
Acting practice?

98
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:59,675
- Yes. What else is missing from you?
- Right?

99
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:01,614
Tell me, what's missing?

100
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,468
Correctly!
You have to keep attacking, like a mammoth!

101
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:05,500
I mean, let's go! You can do it!

102
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:06,748
- Okay.
- Yes.

103
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,748
Yes! With this kind of appearance
At my age, how can I not?

104
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:13,911
That's right, but with one condition.

105
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,582
Why again? What? Speak quickly. I'm busy.

106
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,300
Please. Can you please talk?
a little more polite, Mr Noh Kang-sik?

107
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:23,776
So, you called to talk like that?

108
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,404
It's like this, Min-yeo's father.

109
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:29,180
It looks like there is a woman being held captive
in one of our apartment units.

110
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:30,876
- Confined?
- Yes.

111
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:34,316
We are confused whether to report to the police or not,
So I want to ask your opinion.

112
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:35,748
Did you see the incident yourself?

113
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,742
- No, it's not like that.
- What do you mean?

114
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,249
Why are you so sure?

115
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,540
What is your reason for wanting to report?

116
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:46,140
Here's how it is, minimarket employees
next to our apartment disappeared.

117
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,915
Based on our investigation,
the owner of the minimarket…

118
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,770
Investigation?

119
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,283
Oh my gosh, these mothers
his know-it-all disease has relapsed.

120
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,380
But we are sure!
Based on our investigation…

121
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,730
Do you still think you're a police officer?

122
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:58,103
Just close it!

123
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,310
Look?

124
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,576
I told you
it will be of no use.

125
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,561
Ji-hyun. We can't.
stop here.

126
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,459
- Just once! Please.
- It's about saving someone's life.

127
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:11,499
Well that's that then.

128
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,499
I'll be the one going!

129
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:14,979
Spirit!

130
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,223
Who?

131
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,103
Hello. I'm from Gwangseon Store,
deliver orders.

132
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,050
I never ordered anything.

133
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:30,163
Very weird.

134
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,963
This isn't Mr Lee Won-seok's house, is it?

135
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,819
Please step out for a moment to confirm.

136
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:40,590
Ouch, it's so heavy. It almost took my hand off.

137
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,443
Let me put it inside, okay?

138
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,549
Wait a minute. Sorry.

139
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,981
- Ma'am, this is…
- Oh my gosh, that's scary.

140
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:46,550
Damn, he's so great.

141
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:50,001
- Mom!
- Wow, look at this.

142
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,574
This is a man's house, but it is very clean.
Great.

143
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:53,475
What is this, ma'am?

144
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,460
This is kimchi.

145
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,313
If not entered directly,
it could be sour later.

146
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,820
Oh my, you're hurt, huh?

147
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,882
- No need to go to the hospital?
- I am alright.

148
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,300
I'll just put this there, okay?

149
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,980
Who ordered?

150
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,933
Your mother ordered it.

151
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,503
Who?

152
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,433
- Your mother.
- My mother ran away when I was in junior high school,

153
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:27,536
now suddenly send
kimchi after 20 years?

154
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,276
Who are you really?

155
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:34,856
What do you mean by coming here?

156
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:42,410
Wait, notes!
Oh yeah, I have notes!

157
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,319
His name is Han Jeong-suk.
Isn't that your mother?

158
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:51,673
He said he asked me
deliver this kimchi.

159
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:52,399
Mom!

160
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,565
This is not unit 805 in block 202.

161
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,492
You should be 805 on block 302.

162
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,179
Are you sure you ordered it?
named Lee Won-seok?

163
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,140
Oh, maybe this is the same name, huh?

164
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,406
Oh my gosh, that's amazing.

165
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,839
This world is full of surprises. Geez.

166
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,166
- Go out.
- What?

167
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:12,264
Come out now!

168
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,265
It hurts! Okay, I'm going!

169
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,220
Ouch, my stomach. Sorry, okay!

170
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,370
- I'm just going to the toilet for a bit!
- Mom!

171
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,300
- I really can't stand it anymore.
- Mom!

172
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,473
Mom!

173
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:33,653
This is a real emergency, that's why it's like this.

174
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,886
Sorry, I'm just waiting for a while.

175
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:38,420
Successfully infiltrated.
Found a suspicious room.

176
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,619
- Wow, it worked!
- Good!

177
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:43,413
Quickly take a photo first.

178
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,176
- Hello?
- Hello?

179
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,743
We are in the parking area.

180
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,896
Is this the owner of car 5986?

181
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:55,973
Yes, that's right. Why?

182
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,460
Oh my God! Please come here quickly.

183
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:01,132
There was a car that hit your car 5986
and it looks like it's going to run away!

184
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,766
- What?
- Oh my gosh, this looks like a hit and run.

185
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:06,820
Already hit someone's car,
badly damaged, but instead wants to run away.

186
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,313
Oh my, there are people that evil.

187
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,923
I will try to hold him back,
so please come here quickly. Fast!

188
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,693
Wow, that's great!

189
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,100
Mom! Get out before I break this door down!

190
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:22,420
I can go out when this is over!
Ouch, my stomach…

191
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:23,836
Crazy, absolutely crazy.

192
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:30,246
Mom! I have to go now!

193
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,953
Don't worry, just go.

194
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm not a person who likes to bother
other people's belongings.

195
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:37,186
I am the owner of Gwangseon Store! The owner of the store!

196
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,459
Ouch, my stomach!

197
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:43,186
Okay, I'll be right back.
Stay here, don't go anywhere!

198
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,566
Yes, yes! I can't even get out.

199
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:48,466
This is going to take a long time. Just go.

200
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:01,796
Damn. What the hell is this?

201
00:12:05,372 --> 00:12:06,210
Come on!

202
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:20,840
Oh my gosh, my heart feels like it's breaking.
was about to explode earlier.

203
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,688
Ji-hyun, you are so great.
Absolutely cool!

204
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,551
If I have intervened,
it will be total, right?

205
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,420
Hey, we don't have much time.

206
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,496
From here to the parking lot,
round trip takes eight minutes.

207
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,210
Unlucky.

208
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:35,740
If you don't wait for the elevator and run,
can be six minutes!

209
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:38,146
We have to finish everything
in six minutes.

210
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,052
That, that room is suspicious.

211
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,452
Is anyone inside?

212
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:48,972
Hye Jung!

213
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,352
Hye Jung!

214
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:56,012
- Maybe that person has already…
- Move aside first.

215
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,513
If you are inside,
please give a sound signal! Yes?

216
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,595
Hye Jung!

217
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,450
Maybe we have the wrong person?

218
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,686
Hye-jung? If it's you,
please speak up one more time.

219
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,850
It seems like he can't talk.

220
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,870
Have to find the key first. Key!

221
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,678
Only four minutes left.
Must be fast!

222
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,249
Unlucky.

223
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:45,147
Oh, seriously.

224
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,393
What the heck is this? What's really going on?

225
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,456
Guys, only two minutes left.
He must have regained consciousness and returned.

226
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,065
Damn it.

227
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:06,576
Where did he put the key?
Could it be that the person brought it?

228
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,685
Everyone get out of the way.

229
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,878
Why doesn't it come down? Damn it!

230
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:21,724
Excuse me, did you see?
a dog around here?

231
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:22,584
I don't know.

232
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,291
PLEASE FIND THIS DOG

233
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,823
You're okay.
It's safe now!

234
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:53,026
It is all over.
Don't worry anymore.

235
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:07,103
I have installed an additional lock.

236
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:08,603
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay. Be careful, okay!

237
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:12,362
What is this?

238
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,250
Mom, open the door!

239
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:15,683
What are you doing in someone's house?

240
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:16,749
It doesn't matter.

241
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:20,615
Don't you know better?
what exactly is going on here?

242
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,642
Open the door.

243
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:23,549
This is breaking into someone's house, you know?

244
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,658
I know.

245
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,129
Entering someone's house without permission is wrong.

246
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,385
But isn't confinement
and more severe violence?

247
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,259
You know what to do
talking carelessly like that?

248
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,715
Open the door!
Quickly open it before I call the police!

249
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,552
We have indeed called
ambulance and police.

250
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,085
They will definitely come soon.

251
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,099
What?

252
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,456
Damn it.

253
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,152
- What is this, ma'am?
- I?

254
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,610
Residents of Gwangseon Jugong Block 2.

255
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:53,143
And also the wife of a police officer.

256
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,580
- It was my mother who brought the trash that time.
- You have a good memory, huh?

257
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,265
Move aside. If you don't want to get hurt.

258
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,485
This has become a threat
with sharp weapons.

259
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:05,258
- You are making your own punishment heavier.
- Don't interfere, move aside!

260
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,860
Oh, blood!

261
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,356
- This is assault with a sharp weapon.
- Damn it!

262
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,770
Five years imprisonment
or a fine of one billion!

263
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,700
What do you want?

264
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,570
Damn it!

265
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,050
You can't escape!

266
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,086
He's out!

267
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:41,863
Kyung-ja!

268
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,230
Towards the parking lot!

269
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,976
- I'm already in the parking lot.
- Beside the white car!

270
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:45,754
Which white car?

271
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,690
Beside the gray car! That's it!

272
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,337
White car next to grey car.

273
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,089
Kyeong-ja, behind you.

274
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:54,376
Behind.

275
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:56,083
Behind?

276
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:58,876
- Behind!
- Behind?

277
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:00,296
Which one is further back?

278
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,074
- Unlucky.
- Found you too.

279
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:03,669
- Be careful.
- Yes. Catch it.

280
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:06,742
What is this?

281
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:08,281
You crazy woman!

282
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:09,163
Hey, who are you?

283
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:11,591
- Stop!
- Stop!

284
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,151
Hey, Chu Kyeong-ja.
You stop too.

285
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:14,704
Stop, you bastard.

286
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:16,584
Stop!

287
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:18,864
Stop!

288
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,195
Chu Kyeong-ja. Do you think you're still a cop?
If I say stop…

289
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,940
Yes. But I will be the one to catch him.
You just move aside.

290
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,784
- Who's he?
- That crazy minimarket owner.

291
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:28,475
Noh Kang-sik, take that path.

292
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,991
You think you're my boss?
How dare you order me around.

293
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:33,693
Stop you!

294
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:34,955
You're the one who called, right?

295
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,272
- Yes, this way.
- Good.

296
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,383
Come on, this way.

297
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:39,150
This is the person.

298
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,870
- Can you stand?
- Yes.

299
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:43,403
One two three.

300
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:46,257
- Step forward, slowly.
- Be careful, ok.

301
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,797
Head, watch out for your head.

302
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:13,336
Where is he going?

303
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,237
Wow, he ran so fast, damn.

304
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:19,163
Come out while I'm
still talking nicely, okay?

305
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:20,677
Hey.

306
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:24,959
Oops, I got scratched too.

307
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,899
I said, get out while you still can.

308
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:38,356
Unlucky!

309
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,103
You… You bastard.

310
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:47,426
- You bastard.
- Handcuffs.

311
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:48,484
Shut up! In the bag.

312
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,887
You didn't even look back?

313
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:56,516
Chu Kyeong-ja, you are so bad.

314
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,180
But it's been a long time, huh.
We managed to work together again, right?

315
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,823
Are you still using those handcuffs?

316
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:05,470
Memories full of our history.

317
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,813
- Come on, move aside.
- Yes.

318
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:09,864
Stand.

319
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:14,555
Who taught you?
Putting on the handcuffs was very flexible.

320
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:17,900
I am so sure indeed
choose the top husband.

321
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,245
It's done. Go home.

322
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,125
Don't hang around in the middle of the night
and leave Min-yeo alone.

323
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,337
Yes.

324
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:25,839
- Go, quickly.
- I go.

325
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,091
What are you looking at?

326
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,168
Mi-ri, if anything happens,
please contact us immediately, okay?

327
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:46,516
- Yes.
- I hope the treatment goes smoothly.

328
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,117
Thank You.

329
00:19:54,136 --> 00:19:56,116
Ouch. Oh my, really…

330
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,473
- Good night.
- Good night, too.

331
00:19:58,957 --> 00:19:59,947
Did something happen?

332
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,380
It seems like there is a resident who is holding him hostage.
a woman in this apartment.

333
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,936
- Confinement?
- Yes.

334
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,666
How can there be confinement?
in an apartment like this?

335
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,016
By the way,
You haven't seen my dog, have you?

336
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,676
Ouch, still haven't found it, huh?

337
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:16,201
Oh, how is this?
If I find it, I'll let you know right away.

338
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,442
Yes thank you.

339
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,368
Mi-ri.

340
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:05,342
I miss you.

341
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:09,696
Where are you now?

342
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,847
Where is my photo?

343
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,087
This is not mine.

344
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:56,321
Hello?

345
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:01,345
Yes, that's right. Pomeranian.
With a yellow necklace.

346
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:02,895
Are you holding Mi-ri?

347
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:07,026
Thank You.

348
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,913
Yes, where is the address?

349
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,730
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

350
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:18,758
So happy!

351
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:21,453
- Wow, it's finished?
- Of course, it's gone right away.

352
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:24,887
Tanghulu is not a snack.
This is a food to accompany your drink.

353
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:27,933
Ji-hyun, why are you
bring this all the way here?

354
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:31,050
Stay cool.
I'm a regular customer here, you know?

355
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:34,854
This is also for shop owners.

356
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:36,570
Wow, thank you.

357
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,049
Is there a place in this area?
which you are not yet a subscriber to?

358
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,726
There isn't any.

359
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,032
Excuse me, one serving of sundae, please.

360
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:47,408
Give lots of lungs and liver.
Let me get the shrimp sauce.

361
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,293
But the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get.

362
00:22:51,926 --> 00:22:55,899
That crazy person,
how can it be near us?

363
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,050
He said the employee's body
full of bruises.

364
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:01,166
Bruises can heal.

365
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,846
But mental trauma can take a long time to disappear.

366
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:05,315
Of course.

367
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,260
The part of your body that is affected
Are those scissors okay?

368
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,339
Yes. Check it out.

369
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:10,531
Just a scratch.

370
00:23:10,778 --> 00:23:11,745
I've given you the red medicine.

371
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,526
This Kyeong-ja,

372
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:15,911
if it's already in action,
he didn't look left or right.

373
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,760
No wonder he is called
Ma Dong-seok female version.

374
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:21,338
Seriously, Kyeong-ja.
You are so brave.

375
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:23,292
Even though he is armed,
you face it head on.

376
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:27,642
You can be a great police officer
if you continue your career. Why stop?

377
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:32,171
Well, if there are two policemen at home,
who cooks and takes care of the children?

378
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:33,266
But still…

379
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:38,420
Today, I just joined in the performance
on the stage that Mi-ri prepared.

380
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,826
By the way, your acting was amazing just now.

381
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:42,813
Correct.

382
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:44,832
What is it called? Miz Silver Korea?

383
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,102
No. It's like an award.
Best Actress at the Blue Dragon Awards.

384
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:50,952
Of course. I'm Jeon Ji-hyun.

385
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:53,519
I'm Jeon Ji-hyun.

386
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:55,625
That's right. The real Jeon Ji-hyun.

387
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,057
But how come the employee did that?
to be locked up in that person's house?

388
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:04,680
He said he wanted to quit his job,
but he was given a farewell drink.

389
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,448
When he came to, he was already in that room.

390
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:08,362
He must have been given medicine.

391
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,388
It's not confinement, it's protection.

392
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:13,129
What's wrong with protecting because of love?

393
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,302
Ask Hye-jung directly.
What did I do wrong?

394
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:20,101
Hey, bring Hye-jung here.

395
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,129
Bring him here!

396
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:23,426
Stay there.

397
00:24:24,272 --> 00:24:26,240
He said, at first he
a very caring man.

398
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:29,168
Because of that, Hye-jung couldn't
reject all his kindness.

399
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:31,595
But the man misunderstood,
consider it love.

400
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,231
We fell in love with each other.

401
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:34,980
Oh, damn.

402
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,536
It's so noisy.

403
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:41,429
Excuse me.

404
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:46,382
It's a twisted kind of narcissism,

405
00:24:46,426 --> 00:24:48,906
feel superior
from other people.

406
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,180
Narcissistic abuser syndrome.

407
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:56,167
Until finally he didn't allow it
Hye-jung meets anyone but herself.

408
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,273
It seems like he's really obsessed.

409
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,420
If such people are not obeyed,
finally locked up.

410
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,420
It was indeed confinement.

411
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:05,940
By the way,
So-hee didn't pick up the phone earlier.

412
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,260
I want to ask him out for a drink.

413
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:09,156
Now he is busy working.

414
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,669
Better to earn money
than free drinks, right?

415
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:13,894
It's a mystery. What a mystery.

416
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:17,262
Collecting money that hard,
what for?

417
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,182
What else to do?

418
00:25:19,495 --> 00:25:20,489
There is gossip.

419
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:23,765
They say So-hee has billions in assets.

420
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:26,968
He lives very frugally, doesn't shop,
not eating well,

421
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:29,480
all money is saved, invested,

422
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:31,296
and now have bought
houses and land in the village.

423
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,760
Are you serious?

424
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,800
How is it going?

425
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:49,685
Blood pressure and its beats
is back to normal.

426
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:50,858
The fever also went down.

427
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,893
Can I come in for a moment?

428
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:10,296
Yul,

429
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,343
Mom brought the choco ring snack that you like.

430
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:20,843
Come on, cheer up a little more, okay?

431
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:42,260
CHOCO RING

432
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,445
PLEASE FIND THIS DOG

433
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,138
Mi-ri.

434
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:03,605
Where are you going?

435
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:08,905
I miss you, Mi-ri.

436
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:19,358
Oh my. Looks like I drank too much.
Are you okay?

437
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:20,854
I am alright.

438
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:22,736
Be careful on your way home.

439
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:25,923
Thank You.

440
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:38,980
Mi-ri.

441
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:43,510
Why did you leave?
I'm alone, Mi-ri?

442
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,815
Excuse me,

443
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,434
Are you a resident of Block 2?

444
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,020
Which unit do you live in?

445
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,147
Why ask that?

446
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:58,627
I'm the new security guard here.

447
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:02,048
Come on, I'll take you there
to the front of the house, so it's safe.

448
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,532
I said I was fine.
Why is everyone like this?

449
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:07,892
Please find Mi-ri first.

450
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:11,352
Yes, I'll help you look for it later.
Now come on, be careful, okay?

451
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:13,279
Oh, oh.
Here, here. I'll help.

452
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,943
I heard that Mother Chu acted again today?

453
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,587
How to report about pervert
in Block 2 Gwangseon Jugong?

454
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:32,332
There has been a patrol from the nearest police post,
but there seems to be no clue.

455
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:36,576
But how could Mother Chu know?
are there any employees being held captive in that house?

456
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,836
Hey, that's a very easy question.

457
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,370
Min-yeo's mother called.
and ask about it.

458
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:43,835
Do you still think you're a police officer?

459
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,980
I am the one who gives
all the instructions one by one.

460
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:46,773
Just close it!

461
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,752
I'm busy. Damn it.

462
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,913
- Are you serious?
- Why? Does it sound like a lie?

463
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:51,766
No.

464
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,226
Has the CCTV footage of the pervert been copied?

465
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,252
- Oh, that. It's being worked on.
- Why hasn't it been done yet?

466
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,647
- It's being processed now, sir.
- Just do as I say.

467
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,972
Blanket, the blanket.

468
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,491
Share a little, please…

469
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:15,738
Honey, when are you coming home?

470
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:18,052
Aren't you on night duty?

471
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,986
Almost died in my own home.

472
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:21,437
What are you doing down there?

473
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:22,533
I go to sleep first, ok?

474
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:24,664
Oh my gosh, seriously.

475
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,877
Okay, just go to sleep. Go to sleep.
Deep sleep.

476
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:37,516
It smells like vanilla.

477
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:41,669
Vanilla. So delicious.

478
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:43,475
Vanilla scent?

479
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,995
I like you.

480
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,398
Do you like it?

481
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:54,539
What is he talking about?

482
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,460
This is a cafe near the gym.

483
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:15,083
Usually he just drinks a hot Americano.
Why are you suddenly drinking vanilla?

484
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:19,710
This early in the morning?

485
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,083
Oh Hee Soo?

486
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:31,123
Why change the password?

487
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:42,149
Oh Hee Soo?

488
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:44,177
Obviously a girl's name.

489
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,197
Just moved in a month ago,
but can we drink coffee together?

490
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:49,612
Damn man.

491
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:54,445
Okay, let's start the group PT session.

492
00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:57,110
Come on.

493
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,411
Gather.

494
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:01,939
Okay, let's start the warm-up.
Okay.

495
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,875
Lift your feet with enthusiasm.
One two three.

496
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,740
Who is the vanilla latte?

497
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,905
No, who exactly is Oh Hee-soo?

498
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,072
It must be found out today.

499
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:15,918
Tighten your abdominal and thigh muscles.
Keep going until the end, okay? Good.

500
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,453
Why is everyone wearing
such open clothes?

501
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,380
Gotta sweat, huh?
Come on, knees. Knees.

502
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,351
Gosh, every day he works surrounded by
such a young and beautiful woman.

503
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:25,892
No, no.

504
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:28,685
Oh, Mi-ri.

505
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:32,632
Can't do pretty makeup.
Are you too lazy to wash clothes?

506
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:37,938
Good, good.

507
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,564
Come on, this way.

508
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,060
Lean over. One more time.

509
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:48,491
What the heck is that?
Touching things carelessly?

510
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,153
In front of me pretending to be calm
just talking about wines,

511
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,446
now it looks real.

512
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:55,546
Okay, even though he's a coach,

513
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:57,595
but he can't do whatever he wants
touching a woman's body, right?

514
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,386
- Okay, yeah?
- Oh, you idiot.

515
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,740
Come on, exhale. Ten more breaths.
Yes, ten times correct.

516
00:32:03,793 --> 00:32:05,311
Who exactly is Oh Hee-soo?

517
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:08,564
You?

518
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,569
You, huh?

519
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:11,473
- Help me too, Coach.
- Okay, okay, here.

520
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,200
Okay, thank you everyone.
Remember, eat one minute.

521
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,420
But it burns for an hour.

522
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,540
- Eating out ten thousand.
- It burns a million.

523
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,500
Oh yeah, Coach. To be fresher.

524
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:22,851
Oh, how come?
I only drink hot coffee.

525
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:24,700
Drink cold
instead it causes stomach ache.

526
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,223
Could it be that you are a prince?

527
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,003
No, I get stomach aches easily.

528
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:34,414
- Thank you, everyone. See you.
- Thank you, Coach.

529
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:36,533
Don't be late for your next PT session.
See you.

530
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:37,374
Seung Ho.

531
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:42,621
Hot Americano.

532
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:44,809
What is this?
Are you the psychic Lee Hwa-rim?

533
00:32:44,895 --> 00:32:46,347
How did you know I only drink hot coffee?

534
00:32:46,482 --> 00:32:47,793
Could it be, that vanilla latte?

535
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:49,643
You've always only liked hot coffee.

536
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,869
Her body. Oh my…

537
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,116
- Nice?
- Wow, it's delicious. I really like it.

538
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:02,142
Why?

539
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,923
It doesn't matter.

540
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,142
What is this?

541
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,195
- Hello?
- Mi-ri.

542
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,940
- Who's this?
- It's me, Seon-hee.

543
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:10,870
Seon Hee?

544
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:13,443
Jang Seon Hee?

545
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,390
GOODBYE
CLASS 19 JEONGHEE HIGH SCHOOL

546
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,443
They said our teacher died yesterday.

547
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,343
Location and schedule
I will send it via message.

548
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:27,609
CONDOLENCES - YANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

549
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,900
ROOM 4, THE LATE PARK NAM-HO

550
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:33,288
REST IN PEACE

551
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:37,990
So-ran...

552
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,023
Long time no see.

553
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:40,889
Extraordinary.

554
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:43,629
Gong Mi-ri arrives
see off his teacher.

555
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,299
I'll go in first.

556
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:49,196
Do you think the teacher will be happy to see you?

557
00:33:50,716 --> 00:33:52,835
I heard, before he died,
he mentioned your name.

558
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,255
He asked if you were living well.

559
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:58,562
Thankfully, it seems
you live well now.

560
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:06,297
You know, Um Ji-eun's mother
already dead?

561
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,776
Looks like you don't know yet.

562
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:11,916
I just heard about it here too.

563
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:13,963
He said, suicide.

564
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:23,612
Maybe we can not care, but you?

565
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,414
Yes, maybe you are hurt too.

566
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,585
But sorry,

567
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:31,878
I can't forgive you.

568
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,438
I hope you can pay your respects well.

569
00:34:49,793 --> 00:34:52,876
So what? What else can we do?

570
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,695
That happened several decades ago,

571
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
but i still have to live
like a prisoner?

572
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,622
Twenty years!

573
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,256
You know, Um Ji-eun's mother
already dead?

574
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:03,782
He said, suicide.

575
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,742
Is it my fault?

576
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:09,298
That's why I stayed away.

577
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:12,319
You always treat me like
I deserve to die every time I see you.

578
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:14,693
I suffer too.

579
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:17,106
Oh my. You. You surprised me.

580
00:35:18,227 --> 00:35:20,066
Yes, maybe you are hurt too.

581
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:21,427
But I can't forgive you.

582
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,985
I know.

583
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:28,328
Me too.

584
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:35,979
I still can't forgive myself.

585
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,736
MISSED CALLS (5)
MY BELOVED CHILD

586
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,053
Oh my, since earlier
someone keeps calling.

587
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:53,516
Come on, stop drinking...

588
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:55,497
...and just pick up the phone.

589
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:57,990
You look like you're drunk.
Go home, Mom.

590
00:35:59,686 --> 00:36:03,380
A day like this, how could it be
can i go home conscious?

591
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:05,467
Another bottle of soju here, please.

592
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:08,174
Just one bottle before going home.

593
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,577
- No, I can't. That's enough.
- This is my wallet.

594
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:14,071
Oh my gosh, why him?
like this tonight?

595
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:16,504
Okay, don't cause trouble.

596
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:20,217
Come on, get up quickly and go home.

597
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,360
Your homework is always done neatly,

598
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,430
but every test,
its value sinks to the bottom of the sea.

599
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,561
Mother, if there is a competition it will hurt the child's feelings,
Mom is definitely the number one winner.

600
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,339
Hurt?

601
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:36,971
Your mother is...

602
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:40,070
...champion in all things.
Just watch out.

603
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,456
I hung up the phone.

604
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:15,136
Hey, Detective Choi.

605
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:16,590
Pick up the phone.

606
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,223
Base!

607
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:21,429
Yes, this is the Gwangseon Police Department.

608
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:23,202
Disorder of lewd behavior, huh?

609
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,469
A moment.

610
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,310
Which block is in Gwangseon Jugong?

611
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:29,108
Can you remember the characteristics?
A hooded jacket, huh?

612
00:37:30,337 --> 00:37:32,805
Okay, we'll be launching soon.

613
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:35,915
Damn, now it's going around
from Block 1 to 3 freely, yes?

614
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,629
- Let's go.
- What now?

615
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,011
There are reports of perverts in our neighborhood.

616
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,003
Hey, who's there?

617
00:37:47,629 --> 00:37:51,625
You're the new resident in unit 1104, right?

618
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,215
Hey, you.

619
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:02,233
Yes, the police, right? There are…

620
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:06,653
It's me. Me!

621
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,320
Are you Gwang-gyu?

622
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:16,396
I only brought enough clothes...

623
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:18,104
...and cooking utensils
to make instant noodles.

624
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,330
Some plates too.

625
00:38:20,176 --> 00:38:23,006
I've only been absent for three days
due to intestinal inflammation.

626
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,930
Suddenly there is a new resident
who entered with the Block leader's connection.

627
00:38:26,322 --> 00:38:28,519
So it's you?
What do you mean? Why this apartment?

628
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:31,549
That's it. That's why I moved quietly.

629
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,980
If you knew, I would
won't be allowed to move here.

630
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,419
If you knew that,
shouldn't have moved.

631
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,060
This is my workplace, my source of income.

632
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,053
That's why
I had a hard time looking for you, Dad.

633
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,400
I've been looking for a long time, you know?

634
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,262
I told you,
I don't want to be involved anymore.

635
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,875
Our relationship is over
ten years ago.

636
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,566
It's not a bad relationship, but destiny.

637
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:52,700
If it wasn't for you, I would have
became a thug and my life was ruined.

638
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,920
Dad got fired from school because of me
and have to live a hard life in old age.

639
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,981
How can I calm down?

640
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,513
If I can help pay
Father's debt and living together,

641
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,193
isn't that great?

642
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,180
There is no debt you need to pay.

643
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,173
Get out of here.

644
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:06,533
Otherwise, I'll go.

645
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:10,293
I can't stay here long either.
You know the rental price yourself.

646
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,110
I'm writing a novel.

647
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:15,703
He said that if you write here,
sure to be a bestseller .

648
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,529
Just three months, please be patient.

649
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:21,450
While you are here,
pretend we don't know each other.

650
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,356
Are you leaving right away?

651
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,270
Eat these noodles first.

652
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,883
KANG YOON JU
GWANGSEON JUGONG BLOCK 213 UNIT 902

653
00:40:31,212 --> 00:40:32,870
Ouch, my head.

654
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:36,710
Ouch, my stomach.

655
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:39,323
Who is that so early in the morning?

656
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:47,851
Geez.

657
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:51,370
Mom. Why didn't you tell me earlier?

658
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,436
Even my brother-in-law joined in.

659
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,669
Mom, who is he?

660
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,183
Shut up.

661
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:01,436
Be quiet.

662
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,183
Wait, you…

663
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:08,409
What do you think?

664
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,345
- Good grief.
- Let me hold it.

665
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,139
Mom, who is he really?

666
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:18,590
- Isn't this a shaman?
- What shaman?

667
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:19,679
This is a very powerful spiritual teacher.

668
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:23,443
You who insist on not moving,
that's why we took action.

669
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:25,923
Seung-ho said often
having a nightmare, right?

670
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:28,863
You just keep quiet and go along with it.

671
00:41:28,976 --> 00:41:30,863
The efficacy of his knowledge is very well known.

672
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:32,593
This is my house.

673
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:34,856
Why do you do it?
all this without asking me?

674
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,096
What's your house?

675
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:39,039
This is the house that Seung-ho bought.
by working hard.

676
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,240
Mother.

677
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:43,372
Mi-ri, come here!

678
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,066
Sorry ma'am.

679
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:50,507
I also sometimes go to fortune tellers
if you're stuck, but this...

680
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:52,359
This is too much.

681
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,152
I even went to high school
still active in the church.

682
00:41:57,213 --> 00:41:58,533
Shut up.

683
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:01,813
Mi-ri, don't be rude.
You should just shut up now.

684
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,863
Don't go there.

685
00:42:05,998 --> 00:42:07,029
Good grief.

686
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:09,999
- What's this in someone's house?
- Shut up!

687
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:11,454
Geez.

688
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,574
Good grief.

689
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:18,661
- Teacher, are you okay?
- Teacher?

690
00:42:21,153 --> 00:42:23,110
A curious spirit who can't
die peacefully...

691
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:25,463
...still roaming around
in every corner of this house.

692
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,496
Can't go to the afterlife,
or live in the real world.

693
00:42:30,323 --> 00:42:31,750
Poor and vengeful spirit,
the God calls you.

694
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:35,260
He ordered you
to leave this place immediately.

695
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,780
The God will solve everything.

696
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:39,961
- Good grief.
- Now is the time...

697
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:44,336
...you let go of your grudge,

698
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:48,670
and follow the God.

699
00:42:48,726 --> 00:42:50,693
Follow the God.

700
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:10,996
Here he is. She is this woman.
The spirit was hiding in it.

701
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:15,142
Get out quickly. The God is furious.

702
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:17,708
This cursed woman.
Get out. Get out.

703
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,168
Ouch, it stings. I'm coming, I'm coming.
I'm going out right now.

704
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:24,752
No, no. You're wrong.
It's not you who has to go out.

705
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:28,669
Sick.

706
00:43:29,616 --> 00:43:30,626
Exorcism ritual?

707
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:36,515
Yes, he said the house's aura was bad
and can harm the head of the family.

708
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:38,352
The head of the family is your husband, right?

709
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:41,469
Could it be that he's having an affair?

710
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:42,163
Geez.
What?

711
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,555
Ah, don't believe it. Don't believe it.

712
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:48,376
Once you believe, you will be carried away
until it never ends.

713
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:49,641
That's superstition. Don't believe it.

714
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,580
- Right?
- Yes.

715
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,420
But still make it
uncomfortable, right?

716
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:54,860
That's why they
still want to do the ritual?

717
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:56,420
Where does the money come from?

718
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:57,989
He said it would take at least 500,000 won.

719
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,283
I don't even have 50,000 right now.

720
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,900
Oh, yeah. My mom really likes stir-fried fern.
She made a lot for me yesterday.

721
00:44:03,982 --> 00:44:05,900
Before you go home, stop by.
Just take it and take it home.

722
00:44:05,962 --> 00:44:07,820
- Are you serious?
- Yes, until my hands are sore.

723
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:09,515
Wow, that's delicious. Thanks, Kyeong-ja.

724
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,420
- Yes.
- I don't like vegetable nails.

725
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:12,768
Mi-ri, take it for yourself.

726
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:16,155
Indeed, in your shop
never prepared vegetable spikes.

727
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:19,886
Yes, even though it's vegetables
always fresh and good.

728
00:44:20,762 --> 00:44:21,814
Mi-ri,

729
00:44:22,135 --> 00:44:26,668
The head of the RT mothers has
high-ranking policeman's sister, right?

730
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,740
Oh, Kyeong-ja.
How many times have I told you?

731
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,758
Just call a toilet cleaner.
Do you want me to call their number?

732
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,750
You think I can't
call the repairman yourself?

733
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:44,546
I have called you,
He said he could come tomorrow morning.

734
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:47,780
How?
The public toilet in this complex is far away, right?

735
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:50,967
This is not a security guard's job.
I have a schedule to clear the undergrowth.

736
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:54,013
The security guard's job is different, right?

737
00:44:56,116 --> 00:45:00,036
Listen, since the garbage thing
which was chaotic at that time,

738
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:03,943
I see the security guard here
receive a salary every month,

739
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:07,113
but don't care about the citizens.

740
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:10,536
When people are in trouble,
the security guard didn't move.

741
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:11,489
That should be it, right?

742
00:45:11,996 --> 00:45:15,715
Geez. Look for a job as luxurious as this
at your age it's not easy.

743
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:19,462
Helping each other is good, right?

744
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:20,949
Stay cool.

745
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:23,742
I didn't ask you
work for free.

746
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,462
Come on!

747
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,276
Quickly deal with the toilet.

748
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,650
Clean it too if you can.

749
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,109
That's the rate.

750
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:35,297
Please, yes.

751
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:40,536
Wow, that's a violation.

752
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:41,745
Good.

753
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,812
Fun.

754
00:45:48,252 --> 00:45:52,020
Oh, I invited guests,
but the food is not much, yeah.

755
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:54,020
Not much how?

756
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,823
With this much tea and fruit,
it felt like a big banquet.

757
00:45:59,076 --> 00:46:02,260
It smells so good. What kind of tea is this?

758
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:03,775
Persimmon leaf tea.

759
00:46:03,913 --> 00:46:05,913
I picked it myself
and dry it.

760
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,820
But I don't know whether it tastes good or not.

761
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:10,170
- Wow, if that's the case…
- Of course it's delicious.

762
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,580
They say half the taste of tea comes from
from the sincerity of the person who brews it.

763
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:19,038
Oh, because of sincerity
The RT chairman felt it so much,

764
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:23,748
it feels deep and classy.

765
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:25,987
Really?

766
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:27,898
Oh, it's hot.

767
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,620
I heard you three saved
part-time worker who is held captive, huh?

768
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,860
How can you do something dangerous?
like that without police assistance?

769
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:37,937
Ah, that. The three of us…

770
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,973
How could it be
without the help of the police can it succeed?

771
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:45,299
I also ask for advice
and guidance from my husband.

772
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:47,856
So, all of that can happen.

773
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,061
Oh, I see?

774
00:46:50,147 --> 00:46:54,795
But he said the police came
after the victim was rescued?

775
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,867
- That…
- That's because it has to be that way.

776
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,890
If you rush to involve the police,
the victim could be in even greater danger.

777
00:47:05,148 --> 00:47:08,922
So unofficially,
we asked for a little help from my husband...

778
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:11,083
...and it can be resolved like that.

779
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:15,229
Oh my. Oh my. That's wise, huh?

780
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:20,660
Anyway, you three saved
Gwangseon Jugong complex again this time.

781
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:23,165
We just do a little bit.

782
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,987
All this thanks to attention and direction
The RT chairman is full of affection.

783
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,653
Thanks to my attention and direction, huh?

784
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:33,893
Oh my, the occupants of 803
very good at talking.

785
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:36,166
- 806, ma'am.
- Oh, yes. That's right.

786
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,286
Block Leader, I have cleaned the toilet.

787
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,493
- Has it been cleaned too?
- Already.

788
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:44,383
I will not accept payment.

789
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,036
Just throw it away.
My back is a bit sore, so…

790
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:00,993
UNDER REPAIR

791
00:48:17,153 --> 00:48:19,633
Yes thank you.

792
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:26,190
Chu Kyeong-ja, for the sake of your husband's career,
you even twisted the truth?

793
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:28,996
Indeed, you're going a bit too far, you know?

794
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,660
Oh, please just understand.

795
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:33,275
Min-yeo's father must be promoted this time.

796
00:48:33,336 --> 00:48:36,270
Yesterday he was overtaken by his junior,
so the stress was taken out on me.

797
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,496
If he fails to get promoted
because they don't have the ability.

798
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,040
Why was his wife the target?

799
00:48:40,578 --> 00:48:41,343
Excuse me.

800
00:48:41,778 --> 00:48:44,668
It's okay. It's not about ability,
only fate is not on your side.

801
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:47,805
Usually incompetent people
easy to blame fate.

802
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,638
Ji Hyun.

803
00:48:49,982 --> 00:48:52,078
- Yes, sorry.
- Oh my gosh, really…

804
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:54,471
You are…

805
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:55,926
Unlucky.

806
00:48:56,731 --> 00:48:57,886
- What?
- Kyung-ja.

807
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:01,477
No, that's for the elevator.

808
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:04,311
His fate is better than ours.
You can rest if you are tired.

809
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,940
But is this checked again?

810
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:07,506
There is no choice anymore.
We'll just take the stairs.

811
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,093
Oh my, poor me
this old one. My knees.

812
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,761
Cheer up, Ji-hyun. We're almost there.

813
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:17,740
- Hey, wait for me.
- Oh, how is this?

814
00:49:17,773 --> 00:49:20,033
- Here, just lean back.
- No, you have to carry him.

815
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,321
What's this?

816
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,300
This is a security guard hat, right?

817
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,260
Right. How can there be?
Security guard hat here?

818
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:32,796
Wait a minute.

819
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:35,783
Mr. Security Guard!

820
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,439
Good grief.

821
00:49:39,472 --> 00:49:40,627
Ji-hyun, call an ambulance.

822
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,306
Pack!

823
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,500
Oh my gosh, how is this?
If it turns out…

824
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:45,213
Fast.

825
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:46,386
Pack?

826
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,120
What really happened?

827
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,356
Oh, I'm worried too.

828
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,230
I hope he's okay.

829
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,063
If the lift is broken, we can bring it later.

830
00:49:57,193 --> 00:50:00,593
Why rush?
bring down the stairs?

831
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,779
Whose sofa was he actually carrying?

832
00:50:06,386 --> 00:50:08,445
Which floor did he get off from?

833
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,263
BLOOD CIRCULATION AND MEMORY SUPPLEMENT

834
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,098
No one?

835
00:50:24,827 --> 00:50:28,456
Wow, teachers are starting to forget too.

836
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:30,307
Has my number been saved?

837
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,980
DO NOT LIFTING

838
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,743
Look. Am I a loan shark?

839
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,100
CHIEF MANAGEMENT

840
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,225
Chief executive? This should be appointed.

841
00:50:44,238 --> 00:50:46,222
- Yes?
- Mr. Kim. You said you had an accident?

842
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:47,784
- Seriously injured?
- Accident?

843
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:48,771
Who?

844
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:50,218
Teacher?

845
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,078
Mother Misery? (=suffering)

846
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:54,796
If you look at it,
You do look like the perpetrator.

847
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:57,199
The jacket you wear
same as that time.

848
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:58,439
Ouch, let go.

849
00:50:58,793 --> 00:51:00,473
Where is the proof that I am the perpetrator?

850
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,900
If you are looking for evidence,
means you are the culprit.

851
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:06,973
And if you keep accusing people without evidence,
it could also be a violation of the law.

852
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:08,264
And what evidence?

853
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:09,485
Unzip?

854
00:51:09,578 --> 00:51:10,905
You urinated carelessly that time.

855
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:12,798
Who knows, maybe you do something else too.

856
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:14,235
That's not what I meant.

857
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:17,078
I'm in a hurry,
We'll talk later.

858
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,083
When are you going to catch the perpetrator?

859
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:23,357
What a pervert.

860
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,376
Which block do you live in?

861
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:44,303
What?

862
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,104
This is the first time I've seen you.
Did you just move here?

863
00:51:47,129 --> 00:51:49,270
Oh, yeah. Block 202.

864
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:51,656
Unit 804, huh?

865
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:52,860
Wow, how did you know?

866
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,120
Wow, I sell in this complex.
If you are not observant, you cannot survive.

867
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:58,980
Oh, right.

868
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,640
Mom, I want this.

869
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,413
Well, Mom told you not to come.

870
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,113
There's still a lot of chocolate at home, right?

871
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:13,303
Six cans of beer, eight cup noodles.

872
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:17,300
All 35,700 won. Oh, the bag is a hundred huh.

873
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:18,858
- Yeah, just wrap it up.
- Yes.

874
00:52:26,373 --> 00:52:27,853
This is the card.

875
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:34,918
Eun-byeol, come out.

876
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:50,163
When are you coming?

877
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:52,129
He said he went to night prayers?

878
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:58,556
Milk chocolate.

879
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:01,850
There were 15 milk chocolates earlier,

880
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,635
now only 14 left.

881
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,260
Oh, don't be like that.
Just one chocolate.

882
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:07,980
FINANCIAL NOTES

883
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,140
If you count them all, there are up to 20 items,

884
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,536
all charged to the cost of living.
So, please be aware.

885
00:53:13,727 --> 00:53:15,816
- Good afternoon.
- Thank you for your hard work.

886
00:53:15,843 --> 00:53:16,971
It doesn't matter.

887
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:27,912
- Welcome, sir. Coming home early?
- Yes.

888
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:33,161
Look, young people like this are really good.

889
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:36,876
Polite, diligent. I like him.

890
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,608
What is the difference between a security guard's job and a security guard's job?
with the citizens' affairs, sir?

891
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:40,915
Citizens' affairs are also my responsibility.

892
00:53:40,993 --> 00:53:45,753
Wow, that's a great way of thinking.
I'm really good at judging people.

893
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:48,596
Hand over the keys, I'll help you park.

894
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:51,843
Have initiative too, huh.
You are perfect for this.

895
00:53:52,003 --> 00:53:53,683
I'll deliver the keys
straight home, okay sir?

896
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,303
- Sure, sure. Block 211…
- Unit 806.

897
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,943
Wow, that's amazing.

898
00:54:01,753 --> 00:54:03,230
- Yes,
- Please come in, sir.

899
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,536
ONE DAY AGO

900
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:12,833
Mr. Kim. You think I am this?
a place to vent anger?

901
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,076
Just told to throw away the sofa,
but instead got hurt?

902
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:18,606
You should use your head.

903
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,851
I'm just following Mr. Chairman's orders.
But now my head is injured too.

904
00:54:24,876 --> 00:54:26,884
Do you still have to be cursed at?

905
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:30,231
Who's cursing? Just annoyed.

906
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:34,284
- This is to help with hospital costs.
- No need.

907
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:36,900
I give you this
not because I like you.

908
00:54:36,951 --> 00:54:40,044
Don't drag me into gossip
about abuse of power.

909
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,820
Watch your mouth. Understand?

910
00:54:41,884 --> 00:54:44,577
I'm not a person who likes to gossip.
Just bring it back.

911
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:46,639
Do not be like that.

912
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,359
Respect people's intentions
it's not about self-esteem.

913
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,820
That sofa I'll tell you later
who offered to throw it away himself, yes.

914
00:54:55,853 --> 00:54:58,659
Let everything be okay
and no need to make a fuss.

915
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:00,516
Take care of your health, okay?

916
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,843
I'll take my leave.

917
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,449
Oh, how careless.

918
00:55:09,883 --> 00:55:11,443
It really pisses me off.

919
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:27,418
Ouch.

920
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,018
Good grief...

921
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,086
On the head, on the neck.

922
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,203
Oh my. So strong.

923
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,503
How did you know I was here?

924
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:38,691
Well, you don't have any wealth,
only have a body.

925
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:41,133
If it continues to be crushed like this,
will be gone in an instant.

926
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,160
Don't worry. Even if there's a knife to my neck,
I will not owe you anything.

927
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,453
See, being angry means you are still strong.

928
00:55:49,907 --> 00:55:52,558
- Who was that just now?
- It's none of your business. Just go home.

929
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:54,899
Just a short time ago and you're already being kicked out?

930
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:57,543
- I'll see the doctor first, okay?
- Gwang Gyu.

931
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,696
I am a person whose time has passed.

932
00:56:01,766 --> 00:56:03,916
People whose time has passed,
you shouldn't look back.

933
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:08,066
Do you remember?

934
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:12,461
At that time the teacher and parents of students
furious, everyone gathered...

935
00:56:12,822 --> 00:56:14,454
...and suddenly you're on your knees
in front of them?

936
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:18,376
Then you said it was all your fault
for failing to educate me...

937
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,335
...and you will be responsible.

938
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:25,153
I think, it's similar to the scene
"Dead Poets Society!"

939
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,270
After acting like a hero like that,
you just left.

940
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:30,073
You think I can sleep soundly
after you left?

941
00:56:30,233 --> 00:56:31,584
It's all in the past.

942
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:35,743
You just need to walk forward
without looking back.

943
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:36,970
Now it's my turn, sir.

944
00:56:37,926 --> 00:56:39,309
Thanks to you,
I can be human.

945
00:56:40,236 --> 00:56:41,354
So I have to reply to it.

946
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,356
Until that time comes,
Don't argue and keep following me.

947
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,181
What do you want to reply with?

948
00:56:48,969 --> 00:56:50,215
With my debt at that time!

949
00:57:08,995 --> 00:57:12,150
A WEEK AGO

950
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,383
Oh, what is this?

951
00:57:23,683 --> 00:57:24,916
Blood?

952
00:57:25,895 --> 00:57:26,982
Geez.

953
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,430
Sir, are you okay?

954
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,620
If it hurts in the morning,
Please go straight to the hospital, sir.

955
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:37,760
Thank You.

956
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:43,826
The world still has
someone as good as you, yes. I'm grateful.

957
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:21,863
What's this?

958
00:58:22,176 --> 00:58:24,050
If it happens
sexual crimes...

959
00:58:24,075 --> 00:58:26,138
This apartment could be dangerous...

960
00:58:26,185 --> 00:58:27,963
This damn rat, can it kill too?

961
00:58:28,036 --> 00:58:29,623
New security officer
have arrived!

962
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:31,763
Your distrust of other people,
it is also a disease.

963
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,222
Do you know what it's like to talk nonsense?

964
00:58:33,254 --> 00:58:37,529
There are concerns that the Ribbon Man
which was lost for a long time, is now back again.

965
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:39,614
This is a more serious problem
than I thought.

966
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:40,642
Impossible...

967
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:42,876
Just looking at your facial expression,
It seems the answer is already known.

968
00:58:43,035 --> 00:58:44,742
If you want to get the proof immediately,

969
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:45,889
must be done today.
