Oh, it's starting again.

10
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:15,493
What? How dare you?
you're ranting like that. Hey, youâ€¦

11
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:18,245
We've been together too long, huh?

12
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,634
Goodbye!

13
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:23,946
Sorry, we're leaving soon.

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,056
Come on!

15
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:29,957

16
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:36,075
Wow, even the weather cooperates!

17
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:39,557
- Perfect day for moving, huh?
- That's right.

18
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:47,717
Wow, finally a day like this
also comes into Gong Mi-ri's life.

19
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:50,733
The day I ended
living in different rented houses,

20
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:52,237
and have their own house.

21
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:54,773
After 15 years of struggle,

22
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:56,552

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,547
Great! We, the little family

28
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,821
- Thank you very much!
- Finally arrived.

29
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,352
Sorry, please do it as soon as possible, okay?

30
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:25,733
If it coincides with the time to go home from work,
it will be difficult to use the elevator.

31
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:27,197
Don't worry.

32
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:30,013
Let's get it all done
before the sun sets!

33
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:32,357
It's great, isn't it?

34
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,213
Dad, I'm going to school first.
See you later, Mom!

35
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,317
- Hey, let Dad take you there.
- No need. I know the way. Bye!

36
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:42,757
- Here! Quickly help move first.
- Yes. Come on.

37
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:08,277
Wow, everyone is here.
looks so relaxed.

38
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,197
The air feels different too.

39
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,093
My sweet home.

40
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:19,773
- Hello. Are you guys moving to the 10th floor?
- Yes, unit 1004.

41
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:24,477
- Pleased to meet you.
- Wow, I'm the one who's asking for your help.

42
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,597
This is my first experience
live in an apartment.

43
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:31,173
This is my first house
after 15 years of saving.

44
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:33,346
Really? Wow, congratulations.

45
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:35,757
Happy what?
I still have a lot of debt.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,470
But I look around,

47
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:42,677
This complex is clean,
and the residents look friendly.

48
00:03:42,797 --> 00:03:43,817
What?

49
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:46,351
Damn it!

50
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:49,672
The parking lot is spacious.
It must be very comfortable to park here.

51
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:53,927
The road is good, it fits perfectly
to take the dog for a walk.

52
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:57,706
Good, smart. Let's go home.
We drink probiotics, okay?

53
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:01,567
Here, the relationship between citizens
and the security guard is also very warm.

54
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:04,605
Damn. Is he crazy?
Is this to be eaten or thrown away?

55
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:08,211
And most importantly, the people here
care deeply about each other.

56
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:11,277
Pretending to be stylish, even though her husband
cheater.

57
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,106
Only the outside looks luxurious,
but the inside is rotten.

58
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,213
Rotten? What does that mean?

59
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,733
Just pretend not to know.

60
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:25,373
Anyway, they are good people.
It's great to move here.

61
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:27,365
Yes. Hope you enjoy it.

62
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:30,047
Why is the weather like this?

63
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,547
Wow, that's surprising.

64
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,146
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

65
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:37,293
Sorry. Please speed it up a bit, okay?

66
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,867
Why did it suddenly become cloudy like this?

67
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:42,293
Lightning too, wowâ€¦

68
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,499

EPISODE 1
GWANGSEON JUGONG BLOCK 3

70
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,041
One, two. Let's pick it up.

71
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:11,138
Yes, I think so.
just install it like that.

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,837
Ma'am, we're done.

73
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,586
For settlement, do you want to?
using card or cash?

74
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:22,937
Cash only. But, it seems
The corner of this table is a little bumped, huh.

75
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,597
Ah, that? It was like that from the start, Ma'am.

76
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:28,249
- Mom may not realize it.
- Oh, really?

77
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,517
There's a picture. It was smooth before, right?

78
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,093
And I also asked for extra...

79
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:36,731
...to wrap one by one
cutlery with bubble wrap,

80
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:40,117
- Good grief.
- But look at this. Well, it's cracked, right?

81
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,413
We have already packed the others
one by one with bubble wrap,

82
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,366
but it seems like this one is just missing.

83
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,773
And what is currently happening
you cover it with your hand,

84
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:50,333
flower pot behind it
when it was brought in it fell,

85
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:52,277
and the base seems to be broken.

86
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,893
- Oh, thatâ€¦
- Yes, that one.

87
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,397
Who brought this?
carelessly like that?

88
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,653
I've said it many times...

89
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:03,117
...to be extra careful
with breakable items, right?

90
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:04,693
- Sirâ€¦
- Yes, ma'am?

91
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,982
You brought it yourself.

92
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:09,349
- I brought it?
- Yes.

93
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,973
But ma'am, it's like this.

94
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:14,053
Actually this much stuff
should be transported by two 2.5 ton trucks,

95
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:16,573
but we have tried to make it fit
in one truck 1 ton as estimated.

96
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:20,773
- So, maybe it can be a little understandable?
- Oh, I want that too.

97
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:25,093
But you guys were 20 minutes late, right?

98
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:30,453
Even though your ad says,
'If late, compensation 100,000.'.

99
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,417
This. It's here, right?

100
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:33,452
COMPENSATION 100,000 WON
IF THERE IS A DELAY

101
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:38,232
Even your boss emphasized it once
to me to be punctual and professional.

102
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:42,573
- Wait. I'll look for the SMS first.
- Okay, ma'am.

103
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:45,637
I will make a big decision today.

104
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:51,437
We will cut 50,000
from settlement and additional costs.

105
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:53,552
- Wait a moment.
- Yes.

106
00:06:56,797 --> 00:07:02,053
If you give me the account number,
I'll transfer 50,000 later, okay?

107
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,557
Oh, no need, sir. Really.

108
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,862
- Where?
- Oh, thank you.

109
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:07,928
Okay.

110
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,557
The mother in this house is really tough, huh.

111
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,237
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you. We'll take our leave now.

112
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:20,397
Thank You.

113
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,719
- Be careful on the way, ok.
- Thank You.

114
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:28,557
Yes thank you.

115
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:32,477
You think you're rich?
You think you're Elon Musk?

116
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:36,613
Face masks are stingy even for the wife,
but pretending to be a good person.

117
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:38,413
Today is a happy day.

118
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:42,557
Only 50,000.
After all, they have worked hard.

119
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,481
Hard work?

120
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,509
The person who suffers the most
in this world is me...

121
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,397
...who must live
with someone like you.

122
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,752
- Come on, hurry up, lift the bookshelf over there.
- Okay ma'am.

123
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:01,197
Oh, these people.
Just left alone.

124
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,026
Back again apparently?

125
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:12,197
Seung-ho! We're coming.

126
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:14,054
- That's Mom.
- Older brother.

127
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:15,797
Wow, they came too.

128
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:22,927
Why did they come on moving day?

129
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,655
Do you know which man that is?
The 134th.

130
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:34,397
- Geez.
- Then I said to him,

131
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:37,046
Brother, are you sure you can face me?

132
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,213
Oh, it's hot. Oh my.

133
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:44,397
And he said, 'I'm ready.'
But I left right away.

134
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:49,493
Don't let it burn!

135
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:52,157
Oh my gosh, that needs to be turned off.
Must be lifted!

136
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,550
- I swear!
- Ohâ€¦

137
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,054
My wife, won't you sit with me?

138
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:00,256
At least,
help fry the jeon.

139
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,973
Oh Amitabha,
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

140
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:05,973
Is that all?

141
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:09,213
Loving Lord Jesus, please
grant peace to this family.

142
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,626
- Amen.
- Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

143
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:12,186
Is that really all there is to it?

144
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:14,853
God of Heaven and Earth, please just allow
good energy entering my sister's house.

145
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:17,133
Hey, Park Soo-ji, let it go.
You are reallyâ€¦

146
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,477
- Why was it released?
- Enough with Buddha and God.

147
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:20,538
Quickly take it off.

148
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:23,373
- Evil spirit, begone.
- Ouch. Quickly let everything go.

149
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,813
- Oh, my goodness.
- No one can keep his mouth shut.

150
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:26,933
This is your brother.

151
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:30,273
He said it would make the bad aura go away
and good luck comes into this house.

152
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:33,917
- Look how sincere he is.
- Is that so? Thank you, Park Soo-ji.

153
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,253
Oh, your son is really
have worked hard.

154
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,853
In difficult times like these,
still be able to buy a house.

155
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,053
From now on,
Do you come here often?

156
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:44,973
There are three rooms,
so you can stay overnight.

157
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:47,098
- How about it? Want to stay the night?
- May also.

158
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:48,213
- Yes, agreed.
- Yes.

159
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:50,773
- Let's have a drink and stay overnight.
- Seriously.

160
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:53,253
Let's cheers. Mi-ri, come here quickly.
We drink together.

161
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:54,933
Yes. I'll be there soon.

162
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,653
- Come on, let's just get started.
- That's right.

163
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:57,677
- Yes.
- Okay.

164
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,013
For Seung-ho who finally
managed to buy a house in Seoul.

165
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:02,973
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

166
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,997
Thank You.
I will live happily.

167
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,253
I heard the price of this house
below market price.

168
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,493
You're in big bucks, huh?

169
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:10,013
He said it was for sale because
emergency state?

170
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,587
Not just a quick sale,
but it's an emergency sale.

171
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,733
Usually there is something unnatural.

172
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,157
Maybe this is the house
former house of the deceased?

173
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:19,333
Oh my. At your sister's moving party,
you talk like that?

174
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,517
How do you knowâ€¦

175
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,297
Ouch.

176
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,173
- Why?
- I'm stressed because of you.

177
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:25,197
Ouchâ€¦

178
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:27,173
Oh, I'm going to the bathroom.

179
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:31,973
- Look, he's scared.
- He's always been a coward, hasn't he?

180
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:34,197
Probably because
His wife's cooking was too salty.

181
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:37,906
Is my child's bowel disease getting worse?

182
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,173
His wife's cooking is salty?

183
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:42,837
From past to present,
it feels so bad.

184
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:44,517
But that's indeed his ability.

185
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:49,437
Oh my, this house needs a complete renovation.
The structure is very narrow.

186
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:52,933
Because it's an old house, huh? It seems so.
at most only 66 square meters.

187
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:54,840
The furniture arrangement is very unique.

188
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:58,064
The interior feels
a bit outdated.

189
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:01,917
Bro, does your wife like retro style?

190
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:03,352
No.

191
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,559
Wow, that looks delicious.

192
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:12,733
There are not many,
but please enjoy.

193
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:14,573
No, this is more than enough.

194
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:18,157
- But Mi-ri, what kind of soup is this?
- Crab soup.

195
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,613
- Where is the crab?
- Try searching again.

196
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:25,008
When I make crab soup,
but no crab?

197
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:27,637
Seriously, where are the crabs?

198
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,671
Did I smooth it too muchâ€¦

199
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,093
Mother's teeth are not good anymore.

200
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:38,803
I'm afraid my teeth will fall out if
chewing, so I crushed it all at once.

201
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,166
That's good.

202
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:44,397
Sis, no galbi or bulgogi?

203
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,013
You know yourself, me and mother
both like meat.

204
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:49,572
- Soo-ji.
- Please understand. His name just moved.

205
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,092
This even goes into the piggy bank
We dismantled Hyun-ji's house completely.

206
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:55,663
That's why my son uses it
clothes with a collar that stretches like that.

207
00:11:56,837 --> 00:12:00,917
Oh, Mom. This is a T-shirt full of history.

208
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,249
Right, honey?

209
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,219
BE THE REDS!

210
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:12,801
NINETEEN YEARS AGO

211
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:17,185
- South Korea is great!
- South Korea is great!

212
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:20,053
Dry snacks. Enjoy.

213
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,933
This is very dangerous. Dangerous.

214
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,533
- Damn. Seriously.
- Goal!

215
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:25,253
France scored first.

216
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,997
Why damage things?
If it's damaged, do you want compensation?

217
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:30,637
It sucks.

218
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:33,578
Oh, what else can I do?
We lost, can't you be angry?

219
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,677
You support France?

220
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:36,900
What are you doing? Such a mediocre face
instead of talking a lot?

221
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,853
The color of your poop is like a rainbow.

222
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,877
- Oh my, that's so annoying.
- Yes.

223
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,767
Rainbow Pup Power! What do you want?

224
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:47,652
- You're so rudeâ€¦
- You are also rude.

225
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:48,773
What's so rude?

226
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,333
And now Park Ji-sung enters.

227
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:52,773
Kickâ€¦ Goal!

228
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:55,533
The equalizer.

229
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,973
A great goal from Park Ji-sung.

230
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:00,253
As expected from Park Ji-sung.

231
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:03,877
Red Devils call on South Koreaâ€¦

232
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:35,013
- South Korea is great!
- South Korea is great!

233
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:37,173
The current situation is really hot!

234
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:41,912
Wow, your body is really nice, huh?

235
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,571
I am a former swimming athlete.

236
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,853
Lee Chun-soo. With the right foot.

237
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:49,877
Kickâ€¦ Goal!

238
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:50,938
Goal!

239
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:52,018
Goal!

240
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:56,371
Thanks to Lee Chun-soo, South Korea
managed to conquer France.

241
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:02,157
- South Korea is great!
- South Korea is great!

242
00:14:03,446 --> 00:14:05,299
- South Korea is great!
- South Korea is great!

243
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:08,592
- South Korea is great!
- South Korea is great!

244
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,859
Just looking at the dish, you can tell.

245
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,930
My son's body used to be good,
now why are you so weak?

246
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:25,453
Mom, your child has been with you for a long time.
it is indeed weak inside.

247
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:27,373
When you are looking for a house
for newlyweds,

248
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:31,408
don't forget if they arrive
drain your savings.

249
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,053
The words that have been said
I've heard for 15 years.

250
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,920
If you forget, you are not human.

251
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,054
Get ready to go to hell, Mi-ri.

252
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:40,973
My brother is really pitiful.

253
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:44,083
You don't get any benefit
from your wife's family and your own wife.

254
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:47,197
His child is still small,
not yet able to serve.

255
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,506
- Hey.
- No.

256
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:52,701
When your family goes bankrupt
and have no money, we help.

257
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:54,317
Hey.

258
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:58,677
- Ouch.
- Are the crabs cooked enough?

259
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:03,100
Yes, if the crab is overcooked,
will be tough.

260
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,466
I mean, hardâ€¦

261
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,540
Why did you get married?
with such a fierce woman,

262
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,573
until we have to feel
not feeling good like this?

263
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:11,797
Why can't I eat?
just calmly for once?

264
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,206
Don't say that.

265
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:15,935
If it wasn't for Mi-ri,
we won't be able to buy this house.

266
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:17,733
You know, don't you?

267
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,803
Once we bought it, the price of this house
immediately increased by 100 million won.

268
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,837
It's not just your house that's going up,
all also go up.

269
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,797
- Sis, that's what you call gaslighting .
- No.

270
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,213
- Are you happy now?
- Yes.

271
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,487
Well, you've been gaslighted .

272
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:35,757
Mom, there's no meat here either.
This is just odeng. And this is pollock fish.

273
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,757
- Do you know you're being gaslighted ?
- Bro, come on.

274
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,573
I can only surrender
being gaslighted like that.

275
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:41,917
Where are you going?

276
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,789
- Older brother?
- Darling.

277
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:45,961
Was there a fire?

278
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:55,317
- What's this?
- What's this?

279
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,119
It's not a toy.

280
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,197
What are you doing? Why are you standing?
while holding a fire extinguisher?

281
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:33,619
Because I have difficulty digesting food,
So I exercise like this.

282
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:39,455
- He's been exercising a lot lately.
- Oh, this is still not enough.

283
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:43,837
I also bought some fruit,
so it can help digestion too.

284
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:49,459
Oh, Gong Mi-ri.
You give in too much.

If you sell food, you have to be generous.

304
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:02,693

'Doesn't this make them lose out?'

305
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,041
Only then, people were moved.

306
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,997

Why should it be sued?

337
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,242
Am I lying?

338
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,222
If so, at least hide it.
your character's shopping plastic.

339
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:32,293
Good grief.

340
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:36,939
Have you finished delivering the previous one?

341
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:41,013
Yes. Where to next?
Block 203, unit 204?

342
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:44,333
Yes. But be careful, okay?
Don't get injured.

343
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:47,996
This is easy. I'm not
a day or two by motorbike.

344
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:51,337
I'll go first.
Let's have lunch together later, okay?

345
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,392
All the girls stay here,
man out.

346
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,477
Fast!

347
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:26,148
Get out quickly, everyone!

348
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,344
Quick, get out everyone!

349
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:40,013
Mrs. glasses,
if you move just a little bit,

350
00:20:40,037 --> 00:20:41,907
your head is the next target.

351
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:42,968
Yes.

352
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,195
You!

353
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,278
Lock the automatic doors and lower the curtains.

354
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:47,951
Fast!

355
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:52,077
Everyone, gather here.
Now!

356
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:55,671
Come on, quickly.

357
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:59,225
- What is this?
- How about this?

358
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:06,613
There must be one person here
who knows why i did this.

359
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:11,997
If he confesses,
others will be saved.

360
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:15,894
Otherwise, everyone will die.

361
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:18,877
This is a love affair.

362
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:22,085
- Romance? Infidelity, you mean?
- Yes.

363
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:26,077
Hey, if you don't want to sacrifice
innocent people,

364
00:21:26,737 --> 00:21:29,340
better move forward now.

365
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:33,962
Hurry up, who is it?
Just get out.

366
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:37,407
Who slept with Kim Dong-seok,
get out right now.

367
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,117
Honey, it's me. Don't shoot.

368
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:46,357
Honey, what is this?

369
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:49,653
Sorry, everyone.
I'm the store manager here.

370
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:52,813
My wife is having serious delusions
and overcome with jealousy.

371
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:55,944
- I will calm him downâ€¦
- What? Calming?

372
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:58,952
You're a jerk at home.

373
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,853
You cheated, now you pretend
be a good husband?

374
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:04,957
Honey, I'm not cheating.

375
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,127
Where did you hear that from?
It was all just a misunderstanding.

376
00:22:09,517 --> 00:22:12,613
Ladies, I'm sorry.
My wife is indeed unstable.

377
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:15,373
He calls me dozens of times a day
until I can't work.

378
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:18,742
Just look at her shoes.
Look at that.

379
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,066
- Those are sandals and shoes!
- Yeah, look!

380
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:23,333
- Maybe he really is sick.
- Oh, it's getting more complicated.

381
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:26,357
Honey, let's talk.
Put down your weapon first, okay?

382
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:29,693
Are you still trying to dodge?

383
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:33,989
I saw you cheating
with my own eyes.

384
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,301
You came here after from
Gwangseon Motel with him.

385
00:22:37,352 --> 00:22:39,630
- Gwangseon Motel?
- Wow, really cheating, huh?

386
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:41,597
- It's really bad.
- You are crazy.

387
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:47,066
Oh my, do you not exercise enough?
Why is my thigh cramping like this?

388
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,133
What a jerk.

389
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:52,413
I have installed a tracker
in your car.

390
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,157
It doesn't feel satisfying, right?

391
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:57,093
I know you're at that motel.
at lunch time.

392
00:22:57,117 --> 00:22:58,741
I followed you from there.

393
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,032
- That is not me.
- Can you still say it?

394
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,651
It's really not me.

395
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:07,813
Son of a bitch.
You still insist on lying?

396
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:10,157
Come on, just die.

397
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:11,597
Don't shoot. Don'tâ€¦

398
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:26,573
Code Zero. Code Zero.

399
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:29,533
Armed incident at Wonderful Home Mart,
Road 85, Gwangsan Intersection.

400
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:31,173
Request immediate assistance.

401
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:32,933
This is Korea, not America,
but there was a shootout?

402
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:34,884
Wonderful Home Mart is
in your area, right?

403
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:36,372
Come on, quickly.

404
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,336
What is this? Who threw it?

405
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:48,769
You? Who? You, huh?

406
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,820
- It was me. I threw it.
- Who are you really? Do you want to die?

407
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:55,675
Even if you want to kill,
look for the evidence first. Evidence.

408
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:59,206
Only then, finish him off.

409
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,464
- Correct.
- Yes, that's right.

410
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:05,533
You're an ex-cop. Come on, do something.

411
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:08,062
The weapon was a hunting rifle.
It's real.

412
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,210
Didn't you say before?
can catch flying bullets?

413
00:24:11,261 --> 00:24:14,523
- That's a gun. This is a rifle.
- Those old ladies over there, be quiet!

414
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,293
Proof? Who doesn't know?

415
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:19,973
But if he keeps dodging, what then?
can i know who the affair is?

416
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:21,173
Wait. Calm down.

417
00:24:21,197 --> 00:24:26,644
Hey, why are you wearing so much makeup?
to the supermarket? Your skirt is so short.

418
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:30,862
I failed at dating. I just want to
shopping, then drinking alone at home.

419
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,013
I'm so sad,
don't be insulted even more.

420
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,917
How dare you grumble
in front of me?

421
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:37,493
Excuse me.

422
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,460
If this is how it is, we all
could be trapped until night.

423
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:44,550
Here's how?
Who was that?

424
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,472
You?

425
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:53,961
If I help you find it
his mistress,

426
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:56,037
- can you stop?
- What?

427
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:58,893
I mean, if you
kill your husband now,

428
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,693
his affair will never be revealed.

429
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:03,560
Wouldn't it make more sense to find
him first, then take revenge?

430
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:07,060
- That makes sense.
- Yes that's correct.

431
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:08,357
Crazy, cool too.

432
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:10,369
- Listen to him.
- Find out first.

433
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:17,437
If you lie.
You're the first to die.

434
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,717
Oh, that kid said
just went to buy fruit,

435
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,213
but why don't you go home?

436
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,253
Mom, it will be soon.
He's coming. Be patient, okay?

437
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:34,093
Now it's time to eat fruit,
but he is totally unreasonable.

438
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,293
Just doesn't make sense?
He is also insensitive.

439
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,693
It's insensitive sometimes
make life more peaceful.

440
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:41,117
Just look at our brother-in-law.

441
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:43,539
How cruel to leave
husband's family is like this.

442
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,212
There may be no one else
in this world who lives as peacefully as him,

443
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,573
without regard for others.

444
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,253
Why is he taking so long?

445
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:51,053
Brother, I didn't want to say it at first,

446
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:53,746
but because we are
talking about brother in lawâ€¦

447
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:54,957
Yes, Park Soo-ji.

448
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:57,437
If you hesitate to speak,
better not talk.

449
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,933
And again, don't just sit around.
Stand up and help clean up.

450
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:02,573
Do not take it wrong.
I'm not sitting because I'm lazy.

451
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:04,587
We are waiting for the fruit,
that's why it hasn't been sorted out yet.

452
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,333
We thought he was buying fruit,
so we patiently wait for it.

453
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,917
Okay, I'll just call him.

454
00:26:10,557 --> 00:26:14,290
Hey, what's that? What's that sound?

455
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:15,351
Excuse me.

456
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:21,317
This is my husband.
Can I pick up for a moment?

457
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:22,380
Unlucky.

458
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,539
- Just pick it up.
- Thank You.

459
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:26,573
Hello.

460
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:30,686
Honey, I miss you so much.
I feel like dying waiting for you.

461
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:31,797
Really?

462
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:36,213
Me too. I feel like
really going to die now.

463
00:26:36,237 --> 00:26:38,773
What? What are you talking about? Where are you?

464
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,489
- Why haven't you come home yet?
- Give it to me.

465
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:44,289
- My mother-in-law. Mom.
- Ma'am, press this to make it louder.

466
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:45,813
Sorry. Sorry everyone.

467
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:50,773
Kid, where are you? What are you doing
Haven't come home yet? Come home quickly!

468
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:53,997
- Sorry, ma'am. I can't go home now.
- What? Can't go home?

469
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,467
No. Mom, give it to me.

470
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:57,257
Even though I don't know your reasons,

471
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:01,433
but if mother in law speaks,
should have just said 'yes'.

472
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:02,907
Yes.

473
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:06,062
Mi-ri, what's that tone of voice?
Want to say, "Take it and get out of here?"

474
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:09,693
Bro, you are underestimating me.
your mother and all your sisters-in-law, okay?

475
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:10,757
Come on, be self-aware.

476
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,253
Before I realized it, I thought I was
have to save my life first.

477
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:19,133
What? You're going against your parents now?
Don't know manners?

478
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:22,093
If I had known this, maybe I would have
should have written a will earlier.

479
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:23,552
I think I willâ€¦

480
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:31,493
Hey, stop playing with words.
Find that girl right now.

481
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,953
Yes, good.

482
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,738
Good work.

483
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:41,173
How many hostages are inside?

484
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:43,693
If you count employees and customers,
looks like more than ten people.

485
00:27:43,717 --> 00:27:45,853
Except for one person, all were women.

486
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:47,253
Is the identity of the perpetrator known?

487
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:50,213
Choi Yang-hee, woman in her 40s
who live in this neighborhood.

488
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,957
Hey, make sure
the identity of the perpetrator was not disclosed.

489
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:56,445
Do not allow civilians, especially
journalists, approaching within a radius of 50 meters.

490
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:59,726
Fellow civilians.
Please step back, everyone.

491
00:27:59,957 --> 00:28:02,557
You said you were chasing your husband, right?

492
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,077
Are they in?
through a special employee route?

493
00:28:05,128 --> 00:28:06,136
Yes, right.

494
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,838
ONE HOUR AGO

495
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:25,157
So, your husband's mistress
is a female employee in this shop.

496
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:28,493
People who won't be suspicious
when greeting coworkers...

497
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:29,527
...and enter through
employee only door.

498
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:30,933
That is true.

499
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:35,637
Hey. All the female employees left.
Forward, move forward quickly.

500
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,148
Honey, please stop.
I am completely innocent.

501
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:43,246
Wait a minute.

502
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:47,093
Who? You? You? You? You?

503
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:51,635
Please, I'm really not the culprit.

504
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:54,213
I just got married two weeks ago.

505
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:56,253
- You?
- I live a celibate life without marriage.

506
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,447
It's really not me.

507
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,957
- You?
- I'm engaged.

508
00:29:02,717 --> 00:29:05,293
- You?
- Not me, really not.

509
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:09,893
Is that so? Then everyone must die.
You all have to die.

510
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:14,053
Wait. Stop. This is crazy.

511
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:15,493
Think about Jae-hoon first.

512
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:19,933
Hey, don't mention our child's name.
with your dirty mouth.

513
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,531
You have the heart to cheat
and now talking about Jae-hoon?

514
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:24,118
FIVE DAYS AGO

515
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,940
Jae-hoon, Dad will be waiting there, okay?

516
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:29,053
- Grip and enjoy the game.
- Yes, Dad.

517
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:32,357
- Okay, keep your spirits up, okay?
- Everyone, have fun.

518
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:33,530
Yes. Dad is here.

519
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:07,877
Father.

520
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,037
Father.

521
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,087
Father.

522
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:15,207
Father.

523
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:18,927
Father.

524
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:20,167
Father.

525
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:21,544
Father.

526
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:31,837
My childâ€¦

527
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:35,877
Oh, how come?

528
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:41,677
Mom, Dad left me.

529
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,866
No. It's not like that.

530
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:47,637
Dad can't possibly leave you,
Jae-hoon. No way.

531
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:53,597
You just left your child
and having an affair with another woman?

532
00:30:53,805 --> 00:30:55,317
Are you still worthy of being called a father?

533
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,933
Oh my, what a big-time bastard.

534
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:01,013
The trash of society that even
Even dogs are reluctant to bite.

535
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:02,853
And he claims to be a father.

536
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:04,957
How could you leave your child?

537
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:10,933
- What a jerk.
- He is not human.

538
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:12,133
He's such a jerk.

539
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:13,644
You bastard. Come to your senses.

540
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,172
Get down! Get down everyone!

541
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,435
Everybody, don't move!

542
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,842
If he has to die,
let me kill him!

543
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,990
Who is that bitch?
Get out! I said get out!

544
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,584
Hey, why don't you come out too?

545
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:35,091
I?

546
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,745
Whether you are celibate or whatever,
I saw something earlier, you know!

547
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:44,638
He gave Bacchus
into the man's hand on the snack shelf.

548
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:47,880
He did it secretly too,
while throwing a sweet smile!

549
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,933
- What?
- Secretly?

550
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:51,197
Why is he like that?

551
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,381
That's because...

552
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:55,016
...next week there will be an evaluation
contract extension.

553
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:57,341
I just want to secure my position.

554
00:31:57,802 --> 00:32:01,637
If not for that, why would I
approaching a married man?

555
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,844
- Managerâ€¦
- No wonder.

556
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:07,536
Suddenly you are not helping
hand out flyers again.

557
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:09,322
You're looking for points on your own, huh?

558
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,884
I didn't expect it at first,
but this is too much!

559
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:13,044
Everyone shut up!

560
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:16,458
I just want to kill you,
so you guys don't make a fuss?

561
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:24,040
There is only one woman who cheats,

562
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,704
but you want to kill
innocent person?

563
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:29,117
- Then what should I do?
- I know!

564
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:32,605
I think I know who...

565
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:35,053
...his mistress.

566
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:39,355
Who? Where is he?

567
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:41,151
His mistressâ€¦

568
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:44,247
Not me.

569
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:53,842
â€¦it's him!

570
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:00,735
Mom, I'm home.

571
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:03,956
Grandma, Aunts, good afternoon.

572
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:06,973
- But where is Mom?
- Mother went to the supermarket to buy fruit.

573
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:09,674
Whether to buy fruit
or even plant fruit there.

574
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:12,985
- Which room is mine?
- That one. It's over there.

575
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:16,053
Attention, this is an announcement
from the management office.

576
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,173
There has been a hostage taking
in front of the apartment,

577
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,893
precisely at Wonderful Home Mart.

578
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,933
For residents who have families
the one in the supermarket...

579
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:23,173
...or can't be contacted yet,

580
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:24,166
please check immediately.

581
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:28,533
Dad. Don't tell me,
Mom was at the supermarket too?

582
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,573
- Oh no!
- Oh my, Mi-ri is there.

583
00:33:30,597 --> 00:33:33,133
- My wife!
- How is this? What should we do?

584
00:33:33,157 --> 00:33:35,517
What else? Of course.
we have to help him.

585
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:51,293
Not me. What the heck? Any proof?

586
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,837
What are you doing? Why are you accusing me?
random people like that?

587
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:55,786
Are you sure?

588
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:59,040
When your gun is pointed
to other women, he kept quiet.

589
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,267
But when directed at the woman,
he immediately stepped forward and protected her.

590
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:05,666
Is that so? Then everyone must die.
You all have to die.

591
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:09,827
Wait. Stop. This is crazy.

592
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:11,428
Think about Jae-hoon first.

593
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:16,657
What are you talking about?
I never did that.

594
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,577
It's not me. I really am.
not the person.

595
00:34:20,907 --> 00:34:22,533
Can I borrow your phone for a moment?

596
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:24,997
Why should I give
my phone to you?

597
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:26,963
Shut up. Just do it.

598
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,705
This.

599
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:38,250
I have nothing to hide.
Please check everything.

600
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,117
Yes.

601
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:43,924
Just look. On my IG, there is not a single one.
photo of a man. That's the proof.

602
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:50,077
UPDATE 11 SEPTEMBER 2024

603
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:59,028
A GLASS OF WINE

CHRISTMAS SONG 1988

605
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:15,334
CHRISTMAS SONG 1988

606
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:19,797
Excuse me, is it really your birthday?
your husband September 11, 1975?

607
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:20,757
Correct.

608
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,333
Why do you know?
my husband's birthday?

609
00:35:24,384 --> 00:35:28,146
Your birthday is December 25, 1988, right?

610
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:29,653
What are you talking about?

611
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:32,785
Yeah, right? We were at that time.
having a Christmas party together. Remember?

612
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,157
Show your ID card. Right now.

613
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,253
- Show me quickly.
- Come on, show me.

614
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:40,639
- You said you weren't having an affair.
- Where is the proof?

615
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,859
- Just give it.
- Yes.

616
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:47,877
Oh my. That's right.

617
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:49,253
How do you know?

618
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,456
Usually in illicit relationships, they
like to put meaning into giftsâ€¦

619
00:35:53,856 --> 00:35:54,866
Excuse me.

620
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:56,258
I mean,

621
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:59,765
usually people insert
the meaning of the year of birth into the gift.

622
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,747
Like the wine of 1975,
1988 vinyl release.

623
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:09,497
- That is true.
- Makes sense.

624
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:10,919
Crazy, this is true!

625
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,306
- Geez.
- It turns out to be him.

626
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:14,448
No. It's all just a coincidence.

627
00:36:14,499 --> 00:36:17,378
So what about this photo?

628
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,293
That's for the diet. I'm on it.
prepare body profile.

629
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:24,877
Really? But you're not alone, right?

630
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:28,271
- I was alone at that time. I swear!
- I do not think so.

631
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:44,571
- Looks like that's the store manager.
- True, although it's a bit vague.

632
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:47,642
- That's very clear.
- Even though it's blurry, it's still visible.

633
00:36:47,693 --> 00:36:50,477
That bastard.

634
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:54,077
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

635
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:56,137
Where is the clear evidence?

636
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,973
Ma'am, this is too much.

637
00:36:57,997 --> 00:37:01,038
This is an invasion of privacy.
I will sue you.

638
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:02,351
Shut up!

639
00:37:02,632 --> 00:37:05,757
Wow, it's this clear,
still insisting, huh?

640
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,733
In that case, I give
more convincing evidence.

641
00:37:09,757 --> 00:37:12,739
- What's that?
- What other evidence?

642
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:16,837
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee, this is the police.

643
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:22,213
We don't know what you want yet,
but we'll be getting inside soon.

644
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:23,573
Come talk to us first.

645
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:25,077
Please save meâ€¦

646
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,517
Yes, we will save you.
Don't worry.

647
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:29,653
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee.
Please talk to us first.

648
00:37:29,677 --> 00:37:33,133
What the heck is this? The hostages are not safe yet,
why did he just talk like that?

649
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:35,351
What are you waiting for?
Quickly stop him.

650
00:37:41,597 --> 00:37:43,653
My husband,
I am in the supermarket.

651
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:46,613
Don't go in yet.
The situation is not safe yet. Wait a minute.

652
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:50,493
Wait a minute? Oh my. Why is he
not at home, instead here?

653
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,238
Still feels like a policeman apparently.

654
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:55,894
There they are.

655
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,597
Here!

656
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:06,303
We received a request for assistance.

657
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,663
Don't waste any more time.
We will start the ambush operation.

658
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:09,437
Wait a moment!

659
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,597
Isn't it better to listen?
the hostage taker's motives and demands,

660
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:14,266
then try to negotiate first?

661
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,783
If we keep delaying,

662
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,655
then there are those who are shot or killed,
that would be a big problem.

663
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,733
We will start
by placing snipers.

664
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:25,263
- Sniper?
- Start placing snipers.

665
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:28,988
Okay. Prioritize the position with
clear view into the supermarket.

666
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,253
Then, I'll buy some time...

667
00:38:31,277 --> 00:38:33,493
...in front of the main door of the supermarket
to negotiate.

668
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:35,251
Meanwhile, you guys get ready to go in.

669
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,899
- Okay.
- Yes.

670
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:41,197
Team one to the staff line,
Team two check the back door. Go!

671
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,333
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee.

672
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:49,613
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee,
do you hear me?

673
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:53,449
Nowadays, holding hostages and threatening people
with a weapon is a criminal act.

674
00:38:53,526 --> 00:38:54,904
I will go in alone.

675
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:57,893
Come in, you say?
Oh my, that emotional man.

676
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,373
Once again I beg you,
Mrs. Choi Yang-hee.

677
00:39:00,397 --> 00:39:02,767
This situation is very
dangerous for you too.

678
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:06,453
Please, just open the door of your heart a little bit.
and talk to us.

679
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,487
Mrs. Choi?

680
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,477
Stop calling my name.

681
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:16,819
I will kill him with my own hands
alone before the police pulled him out.

682
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:19,905
Wait!

683
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:26,670
Before being arrested, we should at least
find out about the affair first so you can feel relieved, right?

684
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:31,572
Yang-hee, put down the gun.
We almost found it.

685
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:35,348
Right. We beat up the mistress first.

686
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:41,109
That's right. I'll try.
hold the situation here.

687
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,087
- Correct.
- Hold on a minute.

688
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:44,730
- Yes.
- They are right.

689
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:46,854
Good.

690
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:11,557
In a situation like this,
why is there applause?

691
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,131
One two three.

692
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:28,640
One more time. One, two, three.

693
00:40:31,357 --> 00:40:34,493
Whether they hold the wall
from within or how.

694
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,271
He really knows how to stall for time.

695
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:39,333
He said you saw them come out
from the motel together, huh?

696
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:42,573
- Yes. I've told you many times.
- Wait a moment.

697
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:44,541
What?

698
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,293
What are you doing?

699
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:54,133
Your shampoos smell the same.
Something like...

700
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:56,447
...White Rose aroma
which is usually smelled from motels.

701
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:57,517
White Rose?

702
00:40:58,142 --> 00:40:59,555
Wow, that must be Love Me Motel.

703
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,424
LOVE ME MOTEL

704
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,906
BATH SOAP AND SHAMPOO
WHITE ROSE

705
00:41:06,957 --> 00:41:07,967
No.

706
00:41:08,484 --> 00:41:12,533
I saw that bastard come out
from Gwangseon with my own eyes.

707
00:41:12,557 --> 00:41:16,474
Yes, Love Me Motel and Gwangseon
using the same parking space.

708
00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:19,066
I often go around delivering
food in this area, so you know.

709
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,911
Your husband's car, license plate number 3883
black sedan, right?

710
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:27,957
Yes, right.

711
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,261
No wonder. I do it very often.
see that car there.

712
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,280
- Wow, it's him.
- She's his mistress.

713
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,030
- How embarrassing.
- No shame.

714
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:42,596
So it's you.

715
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,133
Madam, it's really not me.

716
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:48,405
I'm not lacking to the point of having to
having an affair with a married man, right?

717
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:51,952
How can you prove it?
if I was the one who left the motel?

718
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:55,780
I wanted to keep quiet for the sake of politeness,

719
00:41:56,926 --> 00:41:58,645
but now, i can't stay silent.

720
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:02,356
How can you prove it?
if I was the one who left the motel?

721
00:42:03,717 --> 00:42:06,225
I wanted to keep quiet for the sake of politeness,

722
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:09,114
but now,
I can't stay silent.

723
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:19,087
Look at this.

724
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:21,073
Two hours ago, there was a transaction
between users...

725
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:24,407
...BeautyfulGirl and WonderfulMan
at Wonderful Home Mart.

726
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:28,665
Oh, so WonderfulMan is here.

727
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:31,449
Got it!

728
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,663
- It's him?
- Wow, heâ€¦

729
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,007
Unexpected.

730
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:47,376
At first I thought, is it true?
second hand goods transaction that happy?

731
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:50,239
But why
the manager of a supermarket this big...

732
00:42:50,552 --> 00:42:54,032
...surrounding all the aisles
while opening your Hongdang application?

733
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:57,559
Can you meet now?
I'm going to the fruit area, okay?

734
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:01,602
The comments seem normal,
hidden neatly.

735
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:03,487
But still.

736
00:43:03,986 --> 00:43:07,567
Selling someone's husband as if it were used goods?

737
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:16,701
Especially during working hours?
Now it's a new trend, huh?

738
00:43:24,244 --> 00:43:27,103
Two days ago, the transaction
at BeautyfulGirl's apartment.

739
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:30,863
This morning's transaction at Gwangsan-dong 66.

740
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:32,833
That's the location of Gwangseon Motel, right?

741
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:33,930
Good grief.

742
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:37,767
Tonight, transaction plan
in parking lot B3.

743
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,680
This weekend, a trip to Yangpyeong
for â€œremote donation.â€ Great, right?

744
00:43:41,731 --> 00:43:42,741
Geezâ€¦

745
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,375
Wow, crazy. He's a buying and selling maniac.

746
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,863
There were 98 transactions with the same person.

747
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:48,321
Trust score 72.

748
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:51,983
I have never seen
that high.

749
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:57,319
Crazy, people like you,
Even if it's given for free, I don't want it.

750
00:43:57,405 --> 00:43:58,937
You guys!

751
00:43:58,988 --> 00:44:01,038
- You guys!
- Ouchâ€¦

752
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:02,843
- Beat him up!
- Teach him a lesson!

753
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:11,250
There. My wife is inside.
What is this actually about?

754
00:44:11,813 --> 00:44:12,876
- What is going on over there?
- Let us in!

755
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,527
- Older brother!
- Let me in!

756
00:44:15,578 --> 00:44:16,630
Mother!

757
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,367
Honey, I'm really guilty.

758
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:25,703
Please, please forgive me.

759
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,111
Please save my life.
Forgive me.

760
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,737
Please forgive me.
The manager asked me to wait.

761
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:35,887
He said you guys are getting a divorce.

762
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:37,197
- What?
- Wowâ€¦

763
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:41,949
What? Hey, when did I say that?
Don't just talk.

764
00:44:42,123 --> 00:44:45,607
Oh, you bastard.

765
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:49,728
I regret having
spend my life with you.

766
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,493
Just die!

767
00:44:51,544 --> 00:44:52,833
Helpâ€¦

768
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:55,669
Where are you going?

769
00:44:56,685 --> 00:44:57,716
Helpâ€¦

770
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:10,367
My wife!

771
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,410
Mi-ri!

772
00:45:13,425 --> 00:45:14,449
Get down!

773
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,253
- Get down!
- Do not move!

774
00:45:18,304 --> 00:45:20,196
- Do not move!
- Remain still!

775
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:21,823
Choi Yang-hee, lower the weapon.

776
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:25,367
It is all over.
Quickly put down the weapon.

777
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,320
Take it down, Ms. Yang-hee.

778
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,463
Wait. Cease fire.
Everyone, cease fire.

779
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:33,136
What are you doing?
Don't.

780
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:36,091
- Do not do it!
- Don'tâ€¦

781
00:45:36,142 --> 00:45:38,634
What do I live for?

782
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,807
It is all over.

783
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,756
My son, Jae-hoon,

784
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:49,989
will live...

785
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:54,112
...as the son of a criminal.

786
00:45:56,766 --> 00:46:00,523
His father was having an affair, his mother was a hostage taker.

787
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:06,865
I can't even
be a good parent.

788
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:14,848
My son does not deserve to carry this burden.

789
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,591
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry.

790
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:25,471
- Do not do it!
- Stop!

791
00:46:25,522 --> 00:46:27,424
- Don't, ma'am!
- Stop!

792
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:28,485
- Don'tâ€¦
- Put it down.

793
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:33,143
Your husband is wrong,
why did you have to die?

794
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:36,743
Mama Jae-hoon, please think about Jae-hoon.

795
00:46:36,782 --> 00:46:38,820
Please, don't do that.

796
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,207
Catch him.

797
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:16,257
- Finally freeâ€¦
- I'm grateful!

798
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:18,257
- I'm here!
- Come here!

799
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:21,456
- Come hereâ€¦
- Here, honey.

800
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:27,423
Wait. This is your phone, it fell earlier.

801
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:29,863
Looks like the message was sent.

802
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,176
What's this?

803
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,127
ONE BILLION WON

804
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:36,557
Get him. There are people injured?

805
00:47:36,608 --> 00:47:37,624
FIVE MINUTES EARLIER

806
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,953
Weapons. Take the weapons first.

807
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:48,716
Hey, you. Move quickly.
Are you a cop or what?

808
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:51,593
How to unlock the phone?

809
00:47:51,644 --> 00:47:54,179
This.
He uses the face unlock feature.

810
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:56,103
- Get everything done!
- Able to?

811
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:57,467
Oh, it's you,

812
00:47:57,686 --> 00:47:59,499
- You're already the chairman, huh?
- Yes, to be the chairman, ma'am!

813
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,084
Passwordâ€¦ What is it?

814
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:06,381
What was the birth date of the home wrecker ?

815
00:48:06,432 --> 00:48:08,672
December 25, 1988.

816
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:14,109
Geez.
Son of a bitch.

817
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,852
His wife lives a hard life,

818
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,583
while she was shopping
luxury goods for his mistress.

819
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:25,062
Have one billion won,

820
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:30,261
but only to support
his wife 300 thousand per month?

821
00:48:30,312 --> 00:48:33,047
Just send them all.

822
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:36,183
Here it is, 04-750.

823
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:37,503
16, huh?

824
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:40,127
2547.

825
00:48:40,207 --> 00:48:41,303
TRANSFER SUCCESSFUL

826
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:42,567
- Yes!
- Wow!

827
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,061
- We will confiscate it as evidence.
- How could that be?

828
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,420
Money in your husband's account
I have moved it.

829
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:55,183
This world is cruel. At least,
we must have insurance.

830
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:57,863
Now the account is empty.
Completely empty.

831
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,087
Thank You.

832
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:01,381
Trash must be thrown in the trash.

833
00:49:01,432 --> 00:49:03,103
It is impossible to collect it back
to be used again, right?

834
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:05,303
Make amends for your mistakes
and rise again with determination.

835
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:06,717
That is true revenge.

836
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:09,167
Think about your son, okay?

837
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:21,848
Brother, when are you coming out?

838
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:26,383
Father.

839
00:49:26,407 --> 00:49:29,447
Darling.

840
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:33,107
Sorry, I'm late. Sorry.

841
00:49:33,158 --> 00:49:36,423
Darling, I can't live without you.

842
00:49:36,447 --> 00:49:37,783
Get up.

843
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:41,423
Take care of Hyun-ji and move on with your life.
without me well, yeah.

844
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:43,383
I can't. I can't live without you.

845
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:45,846
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Good grief.

846
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,607
Even your own wife
can't you recognize?

847
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:54,463
Oh, move aside for now.

848
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:58,727
- Mother.
- Oh, Sis Mi-ri. Thank goodness.

849
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:00,703
Look at these soft meat fibers.

850
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:05,943
Filled with natural meat flavors and essence,
Authentic LA ribs for only 99,000 won.

851
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,623
Wow, look at the meat.

852
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:10,663
Only 99 thousand won?
Cheap. Very cheap. Fun.

853
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,487
- Order one.
- Want to shop again?

854
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:16,647
Oh my. Say hello first
when entering the house.

855
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:18,078
Even greeting is useless.

856
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:20,406
You are too focused on meat
to the point of not hearing me.

857
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:23,903
- Meat addiction is a disease, you know?
- Yes, I have to eat.

858
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,863
Earlier at the supermarket,
My energy is drained.

859
00:50:25,887 --> 00:50:29,783
No wonder. Fighting the hostage takers
with bare hands,

860
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,287
playing the police too.

861
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:33,461
When did I play the police?

862
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:38,183
Aren't you the one blocking the entrance?
and said he wanted to confront the hostage taker?

863
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:42,967
The police can't get in, because Hulk is there.
who happens to be a police officer's wife.

864
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:47,207
Amazing. Three men pushed the door,
but it didn't move an inch.

865
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:48,740
Great.

866
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,678
What can I do?
what if I'm that strong?

867
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:53,615
Duh, why is he acting like that?

868
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:58,847
Oh my gosh, Mom.

869
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:02,186
My friends said, mom is there
at the supermarket hostage situation earlier?

870
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:04,378
It is said that the hostage taker had time to shoot?

871
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,629
Hey, Mi-nyeo. You're such a rude brat.

872
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:09,703
If your mother comes home from a dangerous place,
you should ask,

873
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:12,491
"Is mom okay?"
or "Is anyone hurt?"

874
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,622
That's just being polite.

875
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,519
But mom looks fine.

876
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:19,143
Come on, tell me. How many shots were fired?

877
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,663
This afternoon, an incident occurred
armed hostage taking...

878
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:23,127
...at a supermarket in Gwangseon-dong.

879
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,983
According to the testimony of residents who came out
from the location just before the incidentâ€¦

880
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:29,807
That's it! That's it, honey. Honey!

881
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:31,863
Watch on TV.

882
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:34,004
Gosh, he looks good
on camera. His face is thin.

883
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:36,863
Wow, it's in the news too.
Now you're a star.

884
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:39,297
What star?
Luckily I didn't get shot.

885
00:51:39,348 --> 00:51:41,543
Why are you interfering?
in such a situation?

886
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:44,663
If I don't get involved,
maybe the situation could be worse.

887
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:48,263
You don't know which situation to be in
what do you take care of and what don't you?

888
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:50,247
Hey. You're a meddler too, you know?

889
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:55,223
Next news. A high school student
who was kidnapped on the way to school...

890
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:57,423
...found in a state
lifeless.

891
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,706
The police immediately carried out
further investigation.

892
00:51:59,757 --> 00:52:03,503
- Full report by reporter Jeong.
- This world is really crazy.

893
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:06,553
â€¦and has requested an autopsy
from the National Institute of Forensic Scienceâ€¦

894
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:08,947
- How about this?
- â€¦to investigate the cause of death.

895
00:52:09,687 --> 00:52:10,767
Why not eat it?

896
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:12,927
I'll go into the room first.
Want to take a break?

897
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:15,995
- Yes, take a rest.
- Where do you want to go? Just here.

898
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:19,548
Let him rest. Just rest.

899
00:52:59,138 --> 00:53:01,714
You must be very surprised, right?

900
00:53:01,738 --> 00:53:07,258
So scary. Absolutely terrifying.

901
00:53:08,498 --> 00:53:10,098
Calm down everyone.

902
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:12,549
Oh, you guys keep chatting.

903
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:16,618
Today, there is a new friend
who moved into our class.

904
00:53:17,618 --> 00:53:22,098
Hello, nice to meet you.
I'm Um Ji-eun.

905
00:53:22,258 --> 00:53:25,634
- Hurray.
- Hello, Ji-eun.

906
00:53:25,658 --> 00:53:28,531
Ji-eun, please sit in the right row.
at the very back, in that empty chair, yeah?

907
00:53:28,582 --> 00:53:29,618
Yes.

908
00:53:29,698 --> 00:53:34,018
The basis of the Goryeo economy
relies on agriculture.

909
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:38,958
Land cleared for agricultural land...

910
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:43,978
...not taxed
within a certain period.

911
00:53:58,054 --> 00:54:00,418
YOU KNOW MR. HOLMES, RIGHT?

912
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:05,018
THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

913
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:09,458
All agricultural land is tax free.

914
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:13,118
- Very beautiful.
- The weather is also nice.

915
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,738
Here, give me your hand.

916
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:20,687
Ta-da!

917
00:54:20,738 --> 00:54:24,018
- What is this? It's so beautiful.
- Beautiful, right?

918
00:54:24,258 --> 00:54:27,858
- I have one too.
- Come on, look ahead.

919
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,046
Closer still.

920
00:54:32,298 --> 00:54:36,698
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

921
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:56,120
Pour again.

922
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:59,369
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

923
00:55:03,818 --> 00:55:05,018
Wow, this is delicious.

924
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:07,727
Are you the ones from the supermarket?

925
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:12,354
The Sherlock Holmes from earlier?
So you're from here, huh?

926
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:17,058
Yes, I just moved into unit 1004,
block 213 today.

927
00:55:17,098 --> 00:55:18,557
- Unit 1004?
- Unit 1004?

928
00:55:20,778 --> 00:55:24,538
- Angel unit, huh?
- Is there anyone in that house whoâ€¦

929
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,538
People who live there
previously moved, right?

930
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:31,394
Enough, enough. This is the meeting.
which is predestined.

931
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:32,674
Let's have a drink together.

932
00:55:32,698 --> 00:55:34,298
Here, sit down.

933
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:37,098
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

934
00:55:42,498 --> 00:55:44,378
It never fails.

935
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:55,099
Wow, the way of eating is really cool.
No wonder you are so strong.

936
00:55:55,124 --> 00:55:59,656
See for yourself, right? He's an ex-cop.

937
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:03,675
It used to be very famous
as a police officer who catches criminals.

938
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,873
- She is the female version of Ma Dong-seok.
- Wow, you're so cool.

939
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:10,898
Gosh, why are you bringing up the past?
Geez.

940
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:16,122
But the way you searched for clues earlier,

941
00:56:16,173 --> 00:56:18,818
Sherlock Holmes can too
raise your hand after seeing you.

942
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:23,942
- My dream was to become a detective.
- No wonder.

943
00:56:23,993 --> 00:56:29,705
Wow, that's so cool. I even
have no ability whatsoever.

944
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:35,474
Why are you so humble?
You're the former insurance queen, right?

945
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:36,698
Insurance queen?

946
00:56:36,723 --> 00:56:40,253
He is good at counting
and know many people.

947
00:56:40,304 --> 00:56:41,595
He worked in insurance for a long time,

948
00:56:41,646 --> 00:56:43,823
so civil law, commercial law,
everyone knows it by heart.

949
00:56:43,874 --> 00:56:45,354
He is like a lawyer
in this complex.

950
00:56:45,378 --> 00:56:47,674
Oh, enough.

951
00:56:47,698 --> 00:56:50,498
Police, detectives, lawyers.

952
00:56:51,647 --> 00:56:54,938
If the three of us join forces,
no one can fight us.

953
00:56:55,748 --> 00:57:01,283
Wait, what if
let's form a team?

954
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:05,738
Wow, agreed. What about the name?
Zoom-vengers? (Ahjumma-Avengers)

955
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:07,548
Zoom vengers?

956
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:11,734
- Zoom vengers?
- Zoom vengers?

957
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:17,862
Oops, I drank too much.

958
00:57:17,913 --> 00:57:18,923
Ouch.

959
00:57:19,258 --> 00:57:22,554
But there is one important thing
that we don't have on this team yet.

960
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:25,898
- What's that?
- Resources.

961
00:57:26,824 --> 00:57:28,424
- Resources?
- Resources?

962
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,594
Wow, the smell of alcohol is really strong.

963
00:57:37,645 --> 00:57:39,367
Oh, you cameâ€¦

964
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:43,989
Moms, aren't you going home?
The family is waiting at home.

965
00:57:48,053 --> 00:57:51,218
Why?
Is there something stuck on my face?

966
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:55,728
Gosh, I like you.
You are so cool.

967
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:56,789
What?

968
00:57:59,264 --> 00:58:00,932
- Agree?
- Agree.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPECIAL APPEARANCE
FROM KIM GEUM-SUN AND LEE JI-HUN

975
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:37,168
Wow!

976
00:58:37,193 --> 00:58:40,048
In our apartment too
Turns out there are parking criminals.

977
00:58:40,301 --> 00:58:41,741
The whole neighborhood was abuzz with discussion.

978
00:58:41,766 --> 00:58:43,581
Isn't that like a crime?
the most serious of all crimes?

979
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:45,121
That's why you should live well.

980
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,581
- What do you want?
- All that remains is to teach a lesson.

981
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:49,195
I will not remain silent.

982
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:53,610
We have to send something hot
and tempting to his taste!

983
00:58:53,661 --> 00:58:56,148
To be honest, it is true
did anyone die here?

984
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:58,128
Someone died?

985
00:58:58,388 --> 00:58:59,815
I think I know who did it.

986
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,855
The name of the last mission is...

987
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,247
...mouse in the trap.

988
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,282
The mission begins.
