- Thief! Catch the pickpocket!
- Stop right there!

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,580
That's my phone! Don't run!

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,260
Stop! One, two, three!

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,660
What is this, sir?

12
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:55,577
I rarely hit children
underage, you know?

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,060
But exceptions are made for criminals.
Son of a bitch!

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,590
What did I do wrong?

15
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,002
Look at this. Just study the bad stuff!

16
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,314
Let go!

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,818
This kid is really…

18
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:29,502
What kind of student pickpockets in broad daylight?
in this sacred apartment complex?

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,820
Pickpocket?

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,380
I'm just borrowing it for a while!

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,106
Then why run?

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,060
Try it again if you dare!

23
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,660
Next time directly
I'll take you to the police station!

24
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:42,883
Remember, you are not
minors again.

25
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,277
Is this your phone?

26
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:53,927
Geez.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,780
Next time look ahead, to the side too.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,820
Be careful of people and vehicles.

29
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,946
- This.
- Thank You.

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,958
Did you see that? I'm so cool, right?

31
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:28,060
- Oh, what are you talking about? Give it.
- Let me take you to unit 213, no. 1004.

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,540
No need. Give it to me.

33
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,780
I'll go first. Follow slowly.

34
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,200
Watch out!

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Are you okay?

EPISODE 6: WOMAN IN THE RAIN

37
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,060
I really can't eat this.

38
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,513
I washed my hair three times just now,
but the smell is still there.

39
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,100
You just finish it.

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,620
- Thank you. Let me finish it.
- Yes.

41
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,300
But Mr. Kim, the security guard, said,
have to rest for four weeks, right?

42
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,940
Oh, poor thing.

43
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,260
But fortunately, there is
The replacement security guard came immediately.

44
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,260
But the head of security said
he might as well get hired.

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,700
But I feel something is strange.

46
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,727
Moreover, the Block Chairman said
who recommend directly.

47
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:42,788
Very suspicious.

48
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,518
Frankly, it's a bit strange.

49
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,129
Strange how?

50
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,930
The bachelor security guard
live above your unit, Mi-ri.

51
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,060
The Block Chairman said that the house owner,

52
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,140
and the unit is for rent
short term with expensive rates.

53
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,905
- How many?
- It looks like more than a million.

54
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,016
- One million?
- One million?

55
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,406
One million?

56
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:04,881
He pays one million a month in rent,
but working part time as a security guard?

57
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,900
- But he said he was very handsome, right?
- Really?

58
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:09,620
My son, Min-yeo,
until I was really infatuated.

59
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,106
Gosh, that kid is really weak.
with a handsome face.

60
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:13,167
Who does it look like?

61
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,864
Tell him to be careful.

62
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:17,500
We don't have any strong evidence yet
if he wasn't a pervert.

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,580
But we don't have any proof either.
if he's the culprit, right?

64
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,100
What proof? I saw it directly
with my two eyes!

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,620
But Min-yeo said he was good,
His face is handsome and athletic.

66
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,100
Even he helped
looking for his stolen cell phone.

67
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,740
It's precisely the person who has the most secrets
which looks the least suspicious.

68
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,740
Well, your nature is not easy
trusting people is also a disease.

69
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,100
If you believe in the axe
who cuts off your own feet,

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,180
you could be paralyzed.

71
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,067
WANTED UNDERWEAR OWNER
Good grief.

72
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,602
WANTED UNDERWEAR OWNER
But what is that?

73
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,540
This was found in the store?

74
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,143
Why did you just say that now?

75
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:54,500
That annoying old man went on a rampage
and look for the owner of the panties.

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,900
I feel like sewing up his mouth
with knitting needles.

77
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,820
I've already removed the flyer,
but installed again.

78
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:02,460
What a pain in the ass!

79
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:06,220
The color is dazzling.
This must be a crazy person.

80
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,712
Could this be the pervert's underwear?

81
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,949
The security guard who just came in?

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,087
That handsome security guard?

83
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:15,780
Why? Did you see him wearing these pants?

84
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,513
Not the pants.

85
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,220
But I saw something else.

86
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,220
- Another?
- What else?

87
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,880
Oh, no, no.

88
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,514
I can't tell.

89
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,860
You saw that one, huh?

90
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,900
- Really?
- What is the size?

91
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh, you guys. Don't say that.
What size?

92
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,780
What a flirt.

93
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:47,923
The problem is, I heard the police
looking for a pervert…

94
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:53,460
…nicknamed “Jiwangul”
or the little mouse.

95
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,580
So, he stalks every night
woman walking alone,

96
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,556
continue to go straight down
his pants just like that.

97
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,460
- After being lowered?
- After being lowered?

98
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,861
Oh, I can't continue.

99
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:09,780
But he said the size was very small,
that's why it's called the little mouse.

100
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,460
How small is it to be called a “little mouse”?

101
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,300
That's why, Mi-ri.
Try to think carefully.

102
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,020
When I saw the security guard,
is it the size of a small mouse or not?

103
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,540
Oh, it was dark.

104
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:24,042
I didn't see clearly.
It doesn't seem that small.

105
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:46,768
Hood?

106
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,280
That pervert!

107
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:50,291
Hey! Stop right there!

108
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,420
Where are you running off to?

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
Wait a minute, I'm coming.

110
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:30,097
Thank You.

111
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,820
Excuse me, aren't you getting off?

112
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,060
Yes, it should go down.

113
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:18,839
Hello.

114
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,340

120
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,390
Yes, Boss.

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,280
Unit 213?

122
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,535
I just finished delivering to 901.

123
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,638
Oh, you said double payment?

124
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,660
Yes, previous payment
has been cancelled.

125
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,020
Sorry for the inconvenience.

126
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,780
- OK, thanks for the hard work.
- Yes thank you

WE WILL FIND YOU A PLACE

129
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,460
On vacation, huh?
Apparently she likes shopping too.

130
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,780
Recently, the identity and causes
death of woman in her 20s…

131
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,580
…which was found
in an abandoned construction area…

132
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,700
…in Gwangcheon-dong has been revealed.

133
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,500
The victim was Lee, a 26-year-old woman,

134
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
part time worker
at Gwangcheon-dong cafe.

135
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,060
He was reported missing,

136
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,820
then found dead due to
out of breath due to strangulation in the neck.

137
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,540
The autopsy results showed
that this crime pattern…

138
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,140
…similar to the serial killer method
performed by Ribbon Man,

139
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,620
who strangled five women
in the last 10 years…

140
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,620
…and tie a red ribbon
on the victim's body.

141
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,820
Because Ribbon Man doesn't do
any crime in the last 10 years,

142
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,540
The police also opened up the possibility
if this is an act of imitation…

143
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,020
…and will expand the investigation.

144
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,420
Meanwhile, the victim's family
Ribbon Man case…

145
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,700
…ask the police

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,177
Oh, Ji-eun…

No, Ji-eun, I'm sorry. I…

Still haven't saved my number?

154

I'm the Block Leader!

155
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,060
- Yes, good afternoon.
- Hurry to the front of unit 211 right now.

156
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,063
Yes, I am

Good.

161
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,618
He thought I was his personal messenger.

162
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,460
Ah, you again?

163
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,660
Where is your mother?

164
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,020
You came here alone?

165
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,420
Oh, what about your mother? Telling
little kids going out at this time of night?

166
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:01,882
In the office.

167
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:09,300
Your mother is very busy, isn't she?
So, you're home alone?

168
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,460
Thank goodness. So what do you want to buy?

169
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,540

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,990
Instant noodles?
Wait here a moment, okay?

171
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,860
The child came
buy instant noodles, you know.

172
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,380
- But why didn't he come in?
- He seems very shy.

173
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
- The money?
- Money?

174
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:38,969
This, yes.

175
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,780
This is the same ramen
like the one your mother bought that time.

176
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,980
Then, this is a bonus from me.

177
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:52,461
Come home soon, okay?

178
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,420
Thank You.

179
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,620
Don't run, you'll fall.

180
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,323
- It's delicious, isn't it?
- Yes, it's very good.

181
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:20,380
Now you think it's time
relax and eat chicken?

182
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,180
Earlier there were residents from Block 211
bring chicken for the security guards.

183
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
He said to be enthusiastic about working...

184
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,300
What hard work?
You're all wage thieves!

185
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,340
Mr. Chairman, your words are excessive.
Are we called salary thieves?

186
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,220
Where is he? Where is the new security guard?
Where is the young man?

187
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,300
Here, I'll buy you a drink…

188
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,940
Hey!

189
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,780
Ouch!

190
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:47,620
Why are you suddenly like this?

191
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,020
Hey, I told you to put the package down.
in front of my house, right?

192
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,900
Do you put it or not?

193
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,860
I've put it down
according to your instructions.

194
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,980
- But why not?
- Please speak nicely.

195
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,780
Here's how you do it
Tasks of the Block Leader?

196
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,260
You've changed now.

197
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,612
Humans don't know how to benefit!
Do you want me to fire you?

198
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,020
Wouldn't it be better to look for
that package first?

199
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,180
Search now!

200
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:14,860
You guys too.

201
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,020
Can't you just guard one package?

202
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,660
Before finding that,
don't expect to be able to go home. Understand?

203
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,539
Damn it!

204
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,740
This is already considered violence, you know?
Losing a package is not the security guard's fault.

205
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,540
Whatever the reason,
the security guard is always blamed.

206
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,540
- Are you sure you put it in front of the house?
- Of course.

207
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,555
- Then, let's look for that package first.
- Okay sir.

208
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,180
Oh, if you want to tell me,
tell me clearly.

209
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,220
Already searched…

210
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,980
I was sure I put it here earlier.
Where did it go?

211
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,980
Where to look for this?

212
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,327
There's nothing inside either.

213
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,540
- Senior!
- What?

214
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,900
- Found you, huh?
- Nothing, I think. Oh dear…

215
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,420
So where does the stuff go?

216
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,780
Darling,
You came home earlier, right?

217
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,912
What are you talking about?
I'm out of town.

218
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,100
Why? Is there a problem at home?

219
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,460
What is the problem?
No, just asking.

220
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,220
You're coming home this weekend, right?
Play golf with me.

221
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,260
Oh, keep playing golf.

222
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,304
It's better to take care of the building properly.

223
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:27,500
This month's rent hasn't come in yet, you know?

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I have left messages several times,
but no response.

225
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,620
Don't work using just your thumbs.

226
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,180
Meet the person in person!
Is it really that difficult?

227
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,980
Yes. I'll go there tomorrow, okay?

228
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,780
Do you think the salary of a regional lecturer is enough?
pay for Dong-yun's studies abroad?

229
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,700
If not from rent money,
won't be enough.

230
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,740
So, take good care of the building.
You don't have a job either, right?

231
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,300
Why do you say it doesn't work?
I'm the block leader, you know!

232
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,598
Wow, that's great.
Block leader!

233
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:04,153
Just because I have a little money,
husband is considered trivial.

234
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,740
CCTV?

235
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,020
Well, we have to find the culprit.
It looks like someone stole it.

236
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,918
It's useless.
All the CCTV here is dead.

237
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,100
Two years ago, the funds were used instead
to repaint the apartment walls.

238
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,140
Still, let's check first.
Who knows, there might be a clue.

239
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,221
Yes, I will report it to the manager first.

240
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:34,260
Why can't this be contacted?
It's been four months.

241
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,060
How?
Do you want to continue like this?

242
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,300
If it's hard to pay,
just rent out the house.

243
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,057
Please let me know as soon as possible.

244
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,540
How come the homeowner is not considered?

245
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,500
- Where are you going?
- Oh, yeah. To the boarding house, ma'am.

246
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,100
Again? Why are you carrying so much stuff?

247
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,620
This is a book. I have to read it.
all this week.

248
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,630
Just take the car.

249
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,860
Mom doesn't use it either.

250
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,940
- Yes.
- Wait.

251
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,140
Let Mom pack the side dishes.
There's bulgogi in the fridge.

252
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,460
Oh, ma'am. Don't bother.

253
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,420
Studying also includes working.
Must eat well.

254
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,914
I can take care of myself.

255
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,095
What have you managed to take care of on your own?

256
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:30,603
This year you have to graduate, understand?

257
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,220
You know how it feels to be asked by a neighbor,
"What is your child busy with now?"

258
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,340
I feel like clawing their mouths.

259
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,300
Look at the pitying look
which is half sarcastic.

260
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,083
I feel like poking their eyes out!

261
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,260
- Tae-hun.
- Yes.

262
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,180
Has your mother ever asked for something extravagant from you?

263
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,060
What mom wants you to be
just an ordinary person.

264
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,700
The mediocre ones,
which is not too conspicuous,

265
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,000
not become a topic of conversation.

266
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,660
Wait a minute, just five minutes.

267
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,280
Again?

268
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:23,426
Why not separate it for recycling?

269
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,260
It has happened before
Even though he hasn't learned his lesson yet.

270
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,935
Why is there a package box here?

271
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,700
What is this?

272
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,590
What's this?

273
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,437
What was that?

274
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:38,397
What's this?

275
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:40,749
Good grief.

276
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,740
What happened?
Don't be afraid. I'm a resident of block two.

277
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,158
What happened? Are you okay?
There are people injured?

278
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,681
Hold this for a moment.

279
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:57,347
Geez.

280
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:02,460
You must be really surprised.
Actually, what happened?

281
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:08,593
It felt like someone was following me.
When I looked…

282
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,896
Oh, this damn little mouse.
You pervert!

283
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:27,569
Where is he?

284
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,790
What's this?

285
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,980
Underwear that can
glow in the dark thong model!

286
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,340
LOOKING FOR THE OWNER OF THE UNDERWEAR

287
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,260
Sorry, according to regulations, CCTV footage
cannot be shown carelessly.

288
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,460
I know. I know that.

289
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,740
But look at this first.

290
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,380
What's this?

291
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,500
- Those are that pervert's panties.
- What?

292
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,180
After scaring the female occupants
who came home,

293
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,340
he took off his pants,

294
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,780
and hang it
on the tree branch beautifully.

295
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,220
Take a look at this too.

296
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,660
I found this
last night in the trash.

297
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,860
As you can see,

298
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,620
even though the location of the discovery is different,
the designs and colors are almost all the same.

299
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,500
Most likely,
the owner is the same person.

300
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,220
If so, you still don't want to
show the footage?

301
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,260
If the manager just keeps quiet like this
and later there will be more serious victims,

302
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,940
who will be responsible?

303
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:40,774
That…

304
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Alas, I don't see anything.

305
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,980
We surrender security
1,800 housing units damaged by cameras like this?

306
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,232
But the management bill
picked up quickly.

307
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,980
Oh my, really…

308
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,951
There!

309
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,060
No, no. A little forward, please.

310
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,790
Yes, here!

311
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,220
This is the bag.

312
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,540
Look at the way he's lurking around,
very suspicious.

313
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,580
Wait a minute, Mr. Chairman.
Let me see.

314
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,660
But this silhouette looks like a woman, right?

315
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,260
Yes.

316
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,540
Hello, residents of Gwangseon Apartments.

317
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,380
Recently, a man
wearing a black hooded jacket …

318
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,460
…allegedly stalking and terrorizing
a woman who comes home late at night.

319
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,220
Please be careful.

320
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,380
If you see someone suspicious…

321
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,360
Ouch…

322
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,780
Finally we start renovating the garden, huh?

323
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,140
Of course! This is our citizens' dream project.

324
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,740
Seriously will it change like this?
Looks like a new apartment.

325
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,620
Luckily now
finally done, huh? Thank goodness.

326
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,780
- That's right. If so, cheer up.
- Yes.

327
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,443
Okay.

328
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,460
This just closes
just the vital parts, okay?

329
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,460
If you wear this,
not slipping behind?

330
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,700
- It must have slipped.
- Miss, move aside.

331
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,860
Oh my. Who is this lady…

332
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,500
- What?
- What did you say?

333
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,820
Aren't you guys first?
call me "Mr. Park"?

334
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,820
He said he looked like a man?
Even giving nicknames too.

335
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,540
It's very similar to underwear
which is in my shop, no?

336
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,740
Yes. Underwear
found in minimarkets,

337
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,580
inside the complex, and in the trash,
everything is almost the same.

338
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,540
If it's called coincidence, design,
colors, and tastes are too identical.

339
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,660
So, that Little Mouse...

340
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,003
Most likely the Little Mouse
live in our complex.

341
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,540
I've heard about Little Mouse too.

342
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,340
He said it often appeared at first
in complexes 1, 2, and 3,

343
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,740
but since security has been tightened,
he moved to complex 4 and 5.

344
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:45,300
If that bastard
indeed live in this complex,

345
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,389
this could be a serious problem.

346
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,380
If it becomes a sexual crime…

347
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,420
Maybe he's just an exhibitionist.

348
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,580
There have been no reports of him touching
or attempting to commit a crime.

349
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,940
His name is also Little Mouse.
At most, they're just small-time criminals.

350
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,620
That's the problem. Little Mouse.

351
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,020
- Little Mouse?
- Little Mouse?

352
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,700
He must have a disorder.

353
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,340
Such disturbances can trigger
urge to kill.

354
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,420
Why do you think the first murder
in human history happened?

355
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,060
The first murder in history?

356
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,220
In the Book of Genesis,
Cain killed his brother, Abel,

357
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,980
because it feels disturbed
towards his younger brother.

358
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,731
Just look at serial killers.

359
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:25,770
They always kill
the weak and helpless.

360
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:29,404
So, you mean the Little Mouse
can kill?

361
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,820
You're not ashamed, are you?

362
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,732
If a woman gets angry
and fight, not fear,

363
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,702
disturbances within him can be provoked.

364
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,920
It drives him absolutely crazy.

365
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,180
Oh, what are the police doing?
Why haven't you caught him yet?

366
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,300
It's not that I don't want to catch it,
but can't.

367
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,540
They say he is very skilled.

368
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,608
If only our CCTV wasn't broken,
he's been caught.

369
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,660
He always says there is no budget,
but the funds for the new park are there.

370
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,340
You are crazy!

371
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,063
Maybe that's what he took advantage of.

372
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:14,900
Yes! He knows very well the condition of this apartment.

373
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:17,609
He can act many times
and never got caught.

374
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,230
That means he knows exactly the location of the CCTV.
and the residents' return schedule.

375
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:25,300
But why did he throw it away?
new panties,

376
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,340
which still has the label,
in a box like that?

377
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,300
Maybe customer tastes have changed.

378
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:33,140
But who threw away the underwear
in the box was a woman.

379
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:34,260
- Woman?
- Woman?

380
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,740
Yes. This is the mystery.

381
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:41,002
The owner of the underwear is a man,
but who threw away the woman?

382
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:45,700
Look at Mi-ri's expression, it seems like
found the answer, huh? What?

383
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,300
The owner of the panties
is Little Mouse.

384
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,860
Who threw it away
the Little Mouse family.

385
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,380
If it's a woman, the percentage possibility is
wife or mother reaches 100%!

386
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,740
Oh my. You again?
Where are you going at this time of night?

387
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,184
To the store.

388
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,829
Our store?
Where is your mother?

389
00:26:11,641 --> 00:26:13,540
Are you alone again today?

390
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,820
Late at night
walking alone is dangerous.

391
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,596
Is your mother really that busy?

392
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,355
What do you want to buy?

393
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,900
Chocolate.

394
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,140
Chocolate? Come on in.

395
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,951
Here.
Thank you for dropping me off.

396
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,260
You're not alone at home, right?

397
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:51,489
Come in, okay?

398
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,125
From now on don't walk around
alone at night, huh?

399
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,410
Promise?

400
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,896
- Thanks for the chocolate.
- You're welcome. Come in quickly.

401
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,916
My name is Eun-byeol, Kim Eun-byeol.

402
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,115
- See you!
- Yes.

403
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:22,101
Eun-byeol.

404
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:25,095
Kim Eun-byeol.

405
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:29,025
What a beautiful name.

406
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:36,513
My Aram too
have a beautiful name.

407
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,362
Enjoy your meal.

408
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,826
Still not home?
Could it be that you're sick?

409
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:08,782
Looks like he lives alone.

410
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:14,669
Yes, Sir.

411
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,660
It says it hasn't been received yet?

412
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,020
I've put it there
at the door as instructed.

413
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,740
Okay, I'll check again. Yes.

414
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,807
The police are investigating
Miss Lee's body discovery case…

415
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:44,641
tied with a red ribbon
at the former site of an abandoned project,

416
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:47,140
stated that until now
there are no suspects yet…

417
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:48,499
which can be identified.

418
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,140
Why is it turned off?
I'm watching the news.

419
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,220
I thought you were asleep. I'm sorry.

420
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,780
Police said Miss Lee was known to
good and have no personal conflicts…

421
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,020
Watching the news is important
to know world developments.

422
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,140
It's a shame the child had to die.

424
00:30:07,735 --> 00:30:09,797
This world is truly broken.

425
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:11,235
Geez.

BLOCK 3, UNIT 1004, LEE MIN-SEON

427
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,380
To the families of Ribbon Man victims.

428
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,820
Recently, it happened
a copycat murder…

429
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,220
…crime patterns
serial killer Ribbon Man...

430
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,460
…who disappeared ten years ago.

431
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,700
By killing the victim
using red ribbon…

432
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,259
…and tie the ribbon
on the corpse before it is disposed of,

433
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,209
we all still remember very well
the horror.

434
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,369
The police concluded this
just a copycat act,

435
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,740
but we don't believe it.

436
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,340
What the police do
for ten years,

437
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,580
when our five daughters died
between 2003 and 2013?

438
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,900
If only the perpetrator had not disappeared,
There may be many more victims.

439
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,235
We no longer believe
in police investigation…

440
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:10,008
and will not accept
too easy a conclusion.

441
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,307
It's time for us to act.

442
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,020
Let's help our daughters
free from that painful day.

00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,540
IS THIS THE RETURN OF RIBBON MAN?
OR JUST A COPYRIGHTED?

445
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:04,687
When I read the article, I felt like
really can't breathe.

00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:08,740
Every time I hear
news about someone who died,

448
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:10,934
I feel troubled.

449
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,980
Lately,
every night my chest beats fast,

450
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,538
and I constantly feel guilty.

451
00:32:19,911 --> 00:32:22,011
It felt like everyone had died
or getting hurt is because of me.

PSYCHIATRIST PARK DO-JIN

453
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,535
I often have nightmares too.

454
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:28,424
Is this a symptom?
panic attack or depression?

455
00:32:28,689 --> 00:32:30,721
Since when did you start feeling that way?

456
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:33,103
The feeling that as if
it's all your fault.

457
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,610
From Miss Um's rotting body,

458
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:44,340
found the ring worn
when he was declared missing.

459
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,350
A ring, huh?

460
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,340
There he is. Who went with the victim.

461
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,180
He said he was the only one who survived?

462
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,780
Yes. He said he was a close friend.
But how can that be?

463
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,940
They went to the former hospital
in Yulsanri, right?

464
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,860
Heard that Gong Mi-ri invited him.

465
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,380
Why also invite
to such a dangerous place?

466
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,940
It's so scary. How can that be?
he survived alone?

467
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,420
he must be very stubborn.

468
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,740
If I'm in danger,
will you help me or not?

469
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,390
I think since then,

470
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,860
I started to feel ashamed for being alive.

471
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,940
Oops, sorry.
I sound so stupid, huh?

472
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,780
Not stupid at all.

473
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,580
Guilt for failure
saving a friend is…

474
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,340
…a very human feeling.

475
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,456
In your case,

476
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:40,562
traumatic past events
leaving deep wounds.

477
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,380
Even though you look fine,

478
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,716
when facing a situation
which reminds of that event,

479
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:48,700
anxiety can reappear.

480
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:52,993
What do you usually do?
when you start to feel anxious?

481
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:56,993
What is it? Weaving rattan.

482
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,820
Drink until you are unconscious.

483
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,500
Excessive drinking
It's best to avoid it for now, okay?

484
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,580
Good.

485
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,735
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

486
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:08,456
Succeed.

487
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,940
I joined the detective club.

488
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,060
Semi-professional detective mothers club
in the Gwangseon apartment complex.

489
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,550
Moms detective club?

490
00:34:20,054 --> 00:34:22,260
So, you guys investigate cases together?

491
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,500
Of course.

492
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,722
We will not stop
until the case is solved.

493
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,860
With my girlfriends,

494
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,900
I feel strong and confident
can do anything.

495
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,006
That sounds like a lot of fun.

496
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,060
Recently, there was a case
lost package belonging to residents…

497
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,980
…due to the negligence of the security guards
in our complex.

498
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,140
There are complaints regarding
lack of sense of responsibility...

499
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,919
…and the negligent attitude of the security guards
which threatens the safety of citizens,

500
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,220
so we have this meeting.

501
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,657
Let's just replace everything at once.

502
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,460
In an era without physical contact
like now,

503
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,940
package management is very important.

504
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,420
But they just ignore it
thus harming the residents.

505
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,380
It doesn't make sense if all the packages
that much must be managed by security guards.

506
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,776
After all, technically,
it is not part of their duties.

507
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,940
As a resident, shouldn't you
do we side with our fellow residents?

508
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,900
Not defending, but…

509
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,860
What are the residents and security guards now?
should be divided into camps and attack each other?

510
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,420
- Geez!
- I was shocked!

511
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,380
Oh, enough, enough!

512
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,180
Although package management
not the formal responsibility of the security guard,

513
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,860
there is still a moral responsibility.

514
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,340
We can't let it happen
whoever tarnishes…

515
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,860
…our apartment reputation
which is just starting to improve.

516
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,571
But there is a time bomb that could
destroy that reputation instantly.

517
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:49,980
- Time bomb?
- What does it mean?

518
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,620
What do you mean by time bomb?

519
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,130
- CCTV!
- CCTV!

520
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,620
If we don't replace the CCTV,

521
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,740
apartment safety
could be seriously threatened.

522
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,580
You don't know about apartment developments.

523
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,060
This year's budget has run out
for garden landscape projects.

524
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,940
And everyone knows now house prices
depending on the garden view.

525
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,260
When it comes to planting flowers,
I can do it too.

526
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,780
But how to cover it
security gaps without CCTV?

527
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,540
What about the pervert who likes…

528
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,740
…lower the pants
and drop your panties?

529
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,140
Mothers who have daughters
not worried?

530
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,780
Can this just be left like this?

531
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,500
Why should it be excessive?
about the perverted exhibitionist?

532
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,060
We are not children anymore!

533
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,420
- Yes!
- Correct!

534
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,420
I wonder if he really doesn't
wearing anything under his coat?

535
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,140
- What's this?
- Why is it dark?

536
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,500
- Geez!
- Power failure?

537
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,780
Please turn on the lights!
There! Hurry!

538
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:50,002
- Good grief.
- Geez!

539
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:52,369
THREE HOURS EARLIER

540
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,700
Oh! I can't!

541
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,500
How could I possibly wear this?
It's too much. It can't be done.

542
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,700
Didn't you say you could catch?
the pervert in a week?

543
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,020
But the proof is, there are no results
exactly the same.

544
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,780
Are you really serious?
want to catch the perpetrator?

545
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,820
I also try my best.

546
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,380
If you try,
no clues found?

547
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,860
Not long ago, there was a woman who came back to be
victims and even screamed in fear.

548
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,980
Where were you at that time?

549
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,180
The security guard's job is not just patrolling, ma'am.

550
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,656
You don't know that night patrol
most important task?

551
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,380
If you are this indifferent,
could it be that you are the culprit?

552
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,925
Oh my, it's starting again.

553
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:33,706
Good!

554
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,660
I do!

555
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,420
If that's what I have to do,
yes i do!

556
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:41,408
- That's the back.
- What?

557
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,401
If used like that
will be sick. Turn back.

558
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,100
Oh my gosh. What kind of show is this?
Get out quickly!

559
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,540
If I surprised you, sorry.

560
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,100
But before I go,
may i say one thing?

561
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,140
- Say it quickly and get out immediately.
- Look at this?

562
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,540
The underwear I'm wearing now
found in our environment.

563
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,500
There is a pervert who is determined to chase
female occupants walking,

564
00:38:12,743 --> 00:38:15,735
then leave these pants
just like that and run away.

565
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,180
- Why not cover it up right away?
- Forgive me.

566
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,420
If only all the CCTV in this neighborhood had
works fine,

567
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,454
I have caught it
that pervert for a long time.

568
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,904
CCTV is the most basic element
from the security system.

569
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:34,756
Does it make sense if the priority
just decorate the garden?

570
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,340
What if a murder occurs?

571
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,822
Without witnesses and without CCTV,
how can we handle that?

572
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,780
The case of lost packages is also the same.

573
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,220
If there is CCTV, who would dare?
stealing someone else's package?

574
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,500
Even if he stole, he would have been caught.

575
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,420
If so, why do we pay security guards?

576
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,460
If CCTV is inadequate, then the security guard
must cover the shortfall.

577
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,180
- That's right!
- What does a security guard actually do?

578
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,100
Now we are working
with minimum personnel,

579
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
carry out the tasks that
not stated in the contract.

580
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,300
And now it has to be a live CCTV too?

581
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,820
That's already oppression!

582
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,500
Oppression? You didn't hear?
I told you to get out?

583
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,580
Just one more sentence.

584
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,215
The value of an apartment is not determined…

585
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:22,644
…from the quality of security guards
or the beauty of the garden.

586
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,620
The true value emerges
from basic things and common sense.

587
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,720
- Agree!
- Agree!

588
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,145
Not bad.

589
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,940
Have you thought about it?
contract cancellation penalty?

590
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,430
All of that will be charged
to the citizen's bill.

591
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,860
If the CCTV has to be replaced now,

592
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,835
that means we have to cancel…

593
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:53,220
… garden project
or increase management fees.

594
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,820
- Don't!
- Don't raise the fees!

595
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,820
- Let's just continue with the garden project!
- Correct.

596
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,878
The security guard issue will be discussed again later.

597
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:03,780
Today's meeting is over!

598
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,060
Come on, move!

599
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,500
Chief! Wait a minute!

600
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,860
We have to discuss
which is more important…

601
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:19,746
That pervert always appears
at night when it rains.

602
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:25,288
Days like these are the best time to eat
Korean pancakes with dongdongju.

603
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,499
State the date of the report received.
about the recent appearance of the Pervert.

604
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:32,906
February 20,

605
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:35,961
February 22, March 4, March 15,

606
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:40,156
March 22, April 19, May 3, May 4.

607
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:45,077
Why do you ask this?
Our CCTV also doesn't record anything.

608
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:46,152
Friends,

609
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:49,326
know what all those dates have in common?

610
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,450
What?

611
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,913
All those dates,
rainy or cloudy weather.

612
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:56,325
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

613
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:00,473
Even if there are those who do not report,
it's still clear that the pervert...

614
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:03,277
...appears more often during rain
or cloudy weather.

615
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,338
Correct.

616
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:07,333
The day when the panties
hanging on a branch, at that time it was raining.

617
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,280
Look!

618
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:12,107
This kind of weather is just right
to wear a raincoat, right?

619
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,309
If you want to get evidence at the scene,
tonight is the chance.

620
00:41:44,396 --> 00:41:47,107
Gosh, he's overdoing it,
to the point of shaking your hips.

621
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:49,172
So, it looks suspicious.

622
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:52,094
Yes, the road is indeed too much.

623
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:54,969
This year too it seems he failed again
at the Miss Silver Korea contest.

624
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,523
Kyeong-ja, don't speak so loudly.

625
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,336
I know Ji-hyun is still beautiful
in middle age,

626
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,977
but it seems clear that
he's already in his 50s.

627
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:03,759
If only So-hee didn't clash
with his part-time work schedule,

628
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,165
he could be a better bait.

629
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:08,300
Hey, on a rainy night like this,

630
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,300
The pervert will not choose his victims
based on age or face.

631
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,940
He chose a target that looked weak,
which is easily attacked.

632
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,540
Yeah, I know, but still…

633
00:42:18,623 --> 00:42:21,459
He should have shown up already.
Why isn't it visible yet?

634
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:24,822
Oh my gosh, he's dancing
jive cha-cha-cha.

635
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:26,439
We should have stopped him.

636
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,955
Hey, Ji-hyun. Jeon Ji-hyun!

637
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,560
Hey, you damn pervert!

638
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,620
Operation successful!

639
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,940
Finally got the hang of it!

640
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,660
Feel this return shock,
the pervert “Little Mouse!

641
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:18,604
Watch out!

642
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,169
Where are you running to?

643
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,460
Why wear a face covering?
Are you embarrassed?

644
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,820
Even though he used to show off here and there
without any shame!

645
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,860
Miss Misery, hurry now!

646
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,100
No! Perhaps! Should not!

647
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:47,391
Block Leader?

648
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:53,009
Good grief.

649
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,460
What a perverted bastard.

650
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:58,975
This!

651
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:05,980
Thank You.

652
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,940
This is a mental illness.
It's called impulsive control disorder!

653
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,460
When I'm stressed, I can't
control yourself.

654
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,327
Besides, I'm just wandering around
wearing light up underwear,

655
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:28,220
I didn't hurt anyone, right?

656
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:33,502
Doesn't it hurt?
Because of you, I was slandered as a pervert.

657
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,020
Article 245 of the Criminal Code.

658
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,829
Public indecency crime.

659
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,700
Maximum sentence of 1 year in prison
or a fine of 5 million won.

660
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,409
Prison?

661
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,980
Your sexual deviation is a crime.
Mental sexual abuse.

662
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,340
You know that, 806?

663
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,700
Perverse pleasure
what you feel is…

664
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,140
…it might be a nightmare
lifelong for the victim.

665
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,700
Everyone be quiet!

666
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Mom, please go home first.

667
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,180
Wait a minute, Detective Choi.

668
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:09,173
Actually there are still some
which we want to make sure.

669
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,150
Sorry. Just a moment, okay?

670
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:14,048
- Yes?
- Detective Choi,

671
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,700
why haven't the mothers been sent home?

672
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,700
They said there are still some
which you want to clarify.

673
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,868
Meet me outside now.

674
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,460
Wait a moment here. Be quiet.

675
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:33,300
Oh my! This kind of person is me.
deserve to die!

676
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,900
That's it, my history is over.

677
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,660
Why are you silent? Stop him!

678
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:42,900
If that's how it is, how can one die?
Try hitting it against the corner of the table, harder.

679
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,860
Please…

680
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:48,712
Please forgive me just once.
I ask.

681
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:51,453
I was out of my mind at that time.

682
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,900
Oh, what's up now?

683
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,820
I said tell the tenants on the second floor
if they have to go out.

684
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,820
Have you told me yet?

685
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,660
I'm busy today
due to the block representative meeting.

686
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,700
Don't waste time on things
that doesn't make money.

687
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,740
Focus on what makes money.

688
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,380
If you continue like this,

689
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,660
I will use your pocket money for
pay a professional property manager.

690
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,180
- Honey, I was wrong. I will change.
- Just hang up the phone.

691
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,300
I am not a husband.
Not a man either.

692
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,849
To my wife,
I'm just a building guard.

693
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,140
All that, for me is just for
just relieve stress. I swear!

694
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:49,268
Once in a while?
What other lies are there?

695
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,260
You wander from block 1 to 3,
then move to blocks 4 and 5.

696
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,900
We know everything.
Shall we call all the victims?

697
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,380
What do you mean?
I've never been to blocks 4 and 5.

698
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,500
I'm not that rotten
until having to tour around the complex.

699
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,700
Wow, you're good at dodging things.

700
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,500
The legendary Little Mouse.

701
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,680
The Little Mouse?

702
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:10,476
I?

703
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,580
Good grief.

704
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,402
Where from, try?

705
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:21,220
looks like me
can be compared to the Little Mouse?

706
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,500
My wife is madly in love with me.
Want to know why?

707
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,060
I am in the top 1% of men
in Korea about… that!

708
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,980
- Enough!
- Even urologists admit it!

709
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,540
Can you please stop the terror?
to our eardrums?

710
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,985
So, isn't he Little Mouse?

711
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,300
Hey, are you unemployed?
Want to keep listening to those mothers' chatter?

712
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:49,980
That's not it, sir. Ms. Kyeong-ja said
there is something that needs to be confirmed.

713
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,500
What to ensure?

714
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,980
That determines him
whether or not the perpetrator is the police's job.

715
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,540
Who do they think they are? Detectives?

716
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,420
Yes! Just check it out if you don't believe it!

717
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,660
Want to see me for yourself?
the Little Mouse or not?

718
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,100
Oh, please stop embarrassing yourself!

719
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,020
I said I'm not him.
Why do you keep accusing me Little Mouse?

720
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,620
Here, just see for yourself.

721
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,900
Oh my gosh, is this guy crazy?
What is he doing?

722
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,140
Is this what you want to confirm?
Ms. Kyeong-ja?

723
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,780
Hey, Kyeong-ja. So, you mean
do you want to see that?

724
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,860
Me? Crazy, who else?
who wants to see that?

725
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,260
Here. Just look at it directly, so you'll be satisfied!

726
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,620
Come on, get down now!

727
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,140
- I told you I'm not the Little Mouse.
- No!

728
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,940
You are the Little Mouse, aren't you?

729
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,740
Oh my gosh, no!
Just look at the evidence yourself!

730
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,013
- Good grief!
- Quick! Drag him out!

731
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,060
Come on, get out now!

732
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:38,406
I can prove it.
The real Little Mouse is different from me.

733
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:42,660
I'm just a copycat. I'm just an imitator.
Not the main actor!

734
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,340
- Put him in a cell now!
- I'm big! Very big!

735
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,780
Thanks for your help.
We will contact you again.

736
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,820
- Darling!
- What is so big about it?

737
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,220
He didn't even look at you once.
Is your husband really your husband?

738
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,340
Professionalism above all else.

739
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,350
So, in this complex,
there are two perverts?

740
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,029
Why are you looking at me?

741
00:49:13,982 --> 00:49:16,340
Whether there are two or three, it's definitely not me.

742
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,860
Why me?
Want to see the evidence too?

743
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,580
Oh, what's wrong with him?

744
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,420
If you still don't believe it,
please ask my teacher directly.

745
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,180
So, you mean…

746
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,340
Are you Mr. Kim, the security guard's student?

747
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,951
- Yes.
- No wonder.

748
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,352
Aroma of a scholar
from you like real.

749
00:49:39,403 --> 00:49:41,300
Mr. Kim used to be a high school teacher, right?

750
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:47,260
But you are a very young security guard.
My beautiful daughter has a crush on me.

751
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:49,340
Yes, this is only temporary.

752
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,554
While Mr. Kim was hospitalized,
I want to help as much as I can.

753
00:49:55,738 --> 00:49:57,860
You're cool too, huh?

754
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,260
In these brutal times,
seeing the student defending his teacher…

755
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,380
- …so cool! Salute!
- Correct!

756
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:08,862
Well, compared to his services,
I'm nothing yet.

757
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,375
Anyway, thanks for helping.
Catch the Little Mouse, Security Guard Brother!

758
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,531
Please accept this.

759
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,257
- Let's take turns.
- Why did you keep it a secret?

760
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,220
Well, it's not a big secret.

761
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,900
If you had said from the start
you are Mr. Kim's student,

762
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,740
many misunderstandings can be avoided.

763
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,447
So why hide it?

764
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,260
Maybe you have another motive?

765
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,120
You have trauma about lying, right?

766
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,300
What?

767
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,780
You must have been betrayed by someone you love.
trust until your heart is badly hurt.

768
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,060
That's why you keep being suspicious
to everyone.

769
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,380
Other people don't care anymore,
but you keep chasing. Am I right?

770
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,020
But it's true, Mi-ri.

771
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:53,460
Sometimes you are too suspicious.

772
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,620
Yes, it can turn into paranoia.

773
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,580
You might get hit later
serious breach of trust.

774
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,580
- Correct.
- Certain.

775
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,066
You know what?

776
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:08,175
What do you know about me?

777
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,150
Mi-ri.

778
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,455
I'll go home first. What I ate,
I'll transfer it to Ji-hyun's account later.

779
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:18,488
Hey…

780
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,620
I said something wrong, didn't I?
Is it really that important?

781
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,740
Maybe it should be
I'm not talking about being paranoid.

782
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,151
I'm following him!

783
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,460
- Please note, I'm the one paying.
- Yes.

784
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,180
Oh, it was just a trivial remark.
Why did it have to be like that?

785
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,620
Why don't you follow along?

786
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,300
If you leave food,
poor owner, right?

787
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,793
- But okay, I'm coming too.
- Yes.

788
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,380
- Friends.
- Be careful on the way.

789
00:51:50,598 --> 00:51:53,060
The block leader is finished.

790
00:51:53,994 --> 00:51:58,460
But the mystery is not over yet.
Who stole the Block Leader's package, huh?

791
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,140
Here it is, it's been delivered.

792
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,460
I definitely put it in that house.

793
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,500
What is this?

794
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,700
BYUN HAKDO
GWANGSEON JUGONG BLOK 211 NO. 806

795
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,220
Oh my God, what is this?

796
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,991
You crazy grandpa!

797
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,740
Often in and out of clubs,
old habits are back again.

798
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,413
Which other woman would you like to show off to?

799
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,580
What a shameless old bastard.

800
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,620
Even wearing a wig.
What are you actually doing?

801
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:01,538
Cool, right?

802
00:53:04,286 --> 00:53:06,380
I have found
the owner of the panties.

803
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,460
Did you find it?

804
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,820
We have caught
and handed it over to the police.

805
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,114
Once again you associate me with
those thong pants,

806
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:17,500
I will remove your name from the family card.

807
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,580
I do not care.
Who is the owner?

808
00:53:22,121 --> 00:53:23,131
Block Leader!

809
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,780
Block Leader?
How could I possibly believe it?

810
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:31,020
He is the owner of the building, his wife is a lecturer.
What else is missing?

811
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,707
Oh my gosh, you didn't believe it all along, huh?

812
00:53:43,566 --> 00:53:46,095
Hair up, pants down.

813
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:49,706
This is a real party
from top to bottom!

814
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,780
That's why you keep being suspicious
to everyone.

815
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,980
You must have been betrayed by someone you love.
trust until your heart is badly hurt.

816
00:53:58,304 --> 00:54:01,489
Other people don't care anymore,
but you keep chasing. Am I right?

817
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,220
What do they know about me?

818
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,540
That's ridiculous.

819
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,531
Is he a psychiatrist or what?

820
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,420
Does not make sense!

821
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,220
If it goes astray
in the wrong direction,

822
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,440
you might become paranoid
to your partner.

823
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:26,745
IN THE PAST, THE TEACHER OFTEN DID
BUY US TTEOKBOKKI.

824
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:27,823
I MISS HIM.

825
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,980
In the past, the teacher often
bought us tteokbokki.

826
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,620
I miss him.

827
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:35,916
I found a photo from that time.

828
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,460
Did you know that Ji-eun's mother died?

829
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,700
Looks like you don't know yet, huh.
He said he committed suicide.

830
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,692
Usually they undergo
day as usual,

831
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:18,406
but if you meet a situation
which reminds of that incident,

832
00:55:18,457 --> 00:55:20,460
anxiety symptoms may appear.

833
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:58,670
You should have come along!
You should have gone with him too!

834
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,500
He said Ji-eun didn't want to go,
but Gong Mi-ri is the one who forces it?

835
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,260
I knew it from the start.
Gong Mi-ri is sure to cause trouble.

836
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,820
Darling.

837
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:27,220
Mi-ri, why are you like this? Why?

838
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,700
Mi-ri, why are you like this?
Why?

839
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,300
If only we had found it sooner,
Ji-eun can definitely be saved.

840
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,780
You guys go together,
you guys should get back together too.

841
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,180
Why are you the only one alive?
Why only you?

842
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,706
Forgive me.

843
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:50,460
I am wrong.

844
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,494
Help me!

845
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:03,854
Help me!

846
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,340
Enjoy your meal.

847
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,980
Sorry, excuse me!

848
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,300
You just got out of unit 902, right?

849
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,460
No!

850
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,500
But I'm clear
see you out of 902!

851
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Wrong view.

852
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,660
Wait!

853
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,420
Excuse me!

854
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:05,997
I will find it, no matter what.

855
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:08,370
So you mean Gwangseon Jugong?
is the final shipping address, right?

856
00:59:08,395 --> 00:59:09,810
If the jacket has a hood,
you mean that damn little rat?

857
00:59:09,863 --> 00:59:11,497
This is no ordinary missing person case.

858
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:15,295
My arrival to Gwangseon Jugong,
already planned.

859
00:59:15,572 --> 00:59:18,718
Looking from the same vertex,
most likely the perpetrator is the same.

860
00:59:18,743 --> 00:59:19,596
You, right?

861
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,338
He started committing other crimes
after the perverted crime.

862
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:23,850
You could die!

863
00:59:23,957 --> 00:59:25,403
You could be sued!

864
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,710
I think I can find it
the common thread in this Ribbon Man case.

865
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:29,803
Help!

866
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,063
Who are you?

867
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,100
