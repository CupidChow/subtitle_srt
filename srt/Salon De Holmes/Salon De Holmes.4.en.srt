EPISODE 4:
CASE OF DISAPPEARING STUDENTS

9
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,390
The elevator doors opened.

10
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,800
O.

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,899
Trash cannot be thrown here.
Must be thrown in the trash.

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,379
Cleaning fee is included
in management fees.

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,140
The cleaners do not work 24 hours.

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,579
Since we live together here,

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,280
it is important to look after each other
and appreciate.

16
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:36,560
Come on!

17
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,009
Oh my, if only his mother was like that,
What will the child learn later?

18
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,080
Base!

19
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:46,740
What?

20
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,520
What is this? It hasn't been transported even today?

21
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,680
What?

22
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:55,100
No wonder the trash isn't collected.

23
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,660
Do you really want to be rich?
from saving trash bags?

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,308
Stop right there!

25
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:03,556
Oh, good morning.

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,200
Come on.

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,540
What is it?

28
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,152
Aren't you a model citizen?

29
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:11,005
Some time ago, overcoming
hostage taking at supermarket,

30
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,091
dealing with parking lot troublemakers,

31
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:15,380
but now secretly…

32
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:18,260
Secretly, secretly like this?

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,379
Ah, no. This is a misunderstanding.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,539
This is not mine!

35
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,941
I just witnessed it live
with my own eyes,

36
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:27,194
and you still deny it?

37
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,179
No, really. I just found it.
here and pick it up…

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,940
Everyone who is caught
must have said so.

39
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,021
Good grief…

40
00:02:35,803 --> 00:02:38,835
Oh my gosh, what is all this?

41
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,680
Geez.

42
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:41,835
Good grief!

43
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,394
- Ouch.
- This absolutely cannot be allowed.

44
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:51,259
- Not me.
- Oh my God, what is this?

45
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,699
I'm really not the culprit.
How can I explain it?

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,379
This really cannot be allowed.

47
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,420
- Oh my. There's no CCTV either.
- Mother?

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,099
Hyun-ji. Why did you come back?

49
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,040
I forgot to bring my gym clothes.
Mom, why is this?

50
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,620
- Look at that.
- Completely devoid of conscience.

51
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,620
- It's nothing, son.
- The black bag is the culprit, huh.

52
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:13,700
Immediately transfer to an official waste bag
and separate according to type.

53
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:17,420
I'll come back to check.

54
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,499
If this bag is still there later,

55
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,979
I will announce
name of owner of unit 1004, block 213,

56
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,140
on the notice board with the full name.

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,221
This isn't me, I swear.

58
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,979
- I've thrown it in the right bag.
- Geez.

59
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,539
Caught red-handed on the spot,
still many reasons?

60
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,299
Gosh, shameless.

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,601
I warned you.

62
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:39,866
Please, don't make
our apartment image is going down.

63
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,059
Oh my gosh, really…

64
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,219
Madam Chair, please wait a moment.

65
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,299
- Why is he acting like that?
- Even though he seems like a good person.

66
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
I… Really, it wasn’t me.

67
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:49,877
Gosh, I'm going to go crazy like this.

68
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:53,092
Mom, are you okay?

69
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,510
It doesn't matter.

70
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:59,886
Why are you still here?
Hurry up and get your gym clothes.

71
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,870
Here, quickly.
Take a taxi so you won't be late.

72
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,497
Mother herself is not at home?

73
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:06,953
Of course to the house.

74
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,324
But…

75
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,620
Mom won't just come home like that.

76
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:19,617
Humiliated in front of
my grown up daughter?

77
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:24,532
I will definitely find the culprit
and clear my good name.

78
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:30,692
HANA - SOFT CHOCOLATE

79
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:37,483
TOTO CHAMEL PERFUME

80
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:46,139
Okay. Got you.

81
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,060
Now, the address, the address.

82
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,220
What is this?

83
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,234
Who threw out the trash?
in front of someone's house?

84
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,819
Hello, this is the administrator, right?
I'm from block 213 number 1302.

85
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,716
- Mom, this is my toy, right?
- Wait a minute, please.

86
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,080
What?

87
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,826
But I already threw all this away.

88
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:12,497
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING,
INCLUDING THE TRASH YOU THROW OUT.

89
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,460
- Who's he?
- BLOCK 213, NO. 1302.

90
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,100
So you mean, you managed to find
the perpetrator is just from that pile of trash?

91
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:27,660
Yes, luckily there is a jokbal order note
with the address still attached.

92
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:28,960
Geez.

93
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,001
It's time for you to apologize, isn't it?

94
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:43,213
Yes. I was wrong earlier. I'm sorry.

95
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,920
Oh, maybe because of that
This garbage business, my head is getting tangled.

96
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,499
The misunderstanding is over
and you've apologized.

97
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,020
Well then, I'll take my leave now.

98
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,460
Oh my God, what is this?
Oh my gosh, that's…

99
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,699
Isn't that underwear?

100
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,580
Is this called underwear?

101
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:11,540
Those are men's thong underwear.
Oh, that's so disgusting.

102
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,905
You found out so quickly.
You can tell right away from seeing it.

103
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,820
- You've seen it many times, huh?
- What?

104
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,840
It's just weird. There are men's underwear.
tucked away in the corner of a shelf like this?

105
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:25,416
How do I know? Maybe have customers
who fell while shopping.

106
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,939
Of all the things that could fall,

107
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,940
when a crazy person arrives
drop used underwear?

108
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,506
Who says second hand? It could be new.
How could you know that?

109
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:38,994
If it's between men, it's clear.
These are clearly worn pants.

110
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:45,778
Are you sure you don't know about this?

111
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:50,548
What's with that look?
Like the eyes of the devil.

112
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,459
Are you suspicious of me now?

113
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,659
Not suspicious. I just want to make sure.
My wife is becoming more and more suspicious.

114
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,816
Oh my gosh, that's too much.

115
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,996
Bandage? For that matter,
It's better to just use a delivery service, ma'am.

116
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:08,474
After all, you're on your way.
There's also a minimarket on the road, right?

117
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,419
I count time with money,
If you add more, there will be additional costs. Is that okay?

118
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,869
How long does it take?
Okay, I'll pay.

119
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,820
But please buy it at the same time
painkillers and pantyhose too, yeah.

120
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:22,771
Oh, just say no.
add fifty thousand to the shipping cost?

121
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,939
- WELCOME.
- Good night.

122
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,330
There's a customer. I'm closing, okay?

123
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,877
Only available on weekends,
I said what too. Can't.

124
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,091
Who was that?

125
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,387
Friend.

126
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:42,500
This drink is buy one get one free,
but there is only one here.

127
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,457
- Check it quickly.
- Okay, just a minute.

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Damn, what's the code?

129
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:05,155
- I'll pay, okay?
- Yes, of course.

130
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:07,100
Excuse me, where is the painkiller?

131
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,739
Oh, it's on the second shelf from the top, over there.

132
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,340
Oh, that's it.
Wait a moment.

133
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:12,639
Continue the payment.

134
00:08:20,617 --> 00:08:23,300
What is it?
Is there something strange with my face?

135
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,180
Absolutely not.
Her hair color is so cool.

136
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,900
If I may know,
where to get your hair cut?

137
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,585
A few days ago, there was an academy
hair salon looking for a hairstyle.

138
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:37,340
Just sleep two hours, free cut,
and instead given 100 thousand rupiah.

139
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,420
Crazy, big profit, right?

140
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:41,322
But your hair seems a little damaged.

141
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,529
Maybe they use
cheap bleaching medicine.

142
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:46,994
Yes, that's right. Over here.
But how do you know?

143
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,822
I'm preparing
beauty certification exam.

144
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,700
Just come and see me next time.

145
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,739
In our academy,
we use vegan bleaching.

146
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,619
I can help with bleaching
some match your hair color.

147
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,020
Seriously? Wow, I really want that.

148
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:01,599
Thank you. I'm happy too.
there's something I can use to practice.

149
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,659
What about ash gray like this?

150
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,459
This color is perfect for
your cool skin tone .

151
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,025
Wow. So beautiful. Wow, so cool.

152
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,420
I'll process the payment first.

153
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,540
Rather than medicine, this is much more effective.

154
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:22,686
What's this?

155
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,339
If in front of his wife,
he doesn't want to obey.

156
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:31,540
It's one click, hallelujah .
Get up straight away again.

157
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,180
Actually, what's in it?

158
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:37,411
Oh, pretend not to know.
Just imagine you are on a world tour.

159
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:40,226
So, this is what he said
more effective than medicine, right?

160
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,608
Darling.

161
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:50,520
Wow, this is amazing, huh?

162
00:09:58,896 --> 00:09:59,896
What are you doing?

163
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,420
Why is it locked?

164
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,931
Hey, what are you doing?

165
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:11,200
- Why?
- Why did you lock the door?

166
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,235
- What? It's locked, huh?
- Why?

167
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,381
That's strange, maybe you didn't do it on purpose.
pressing it from the outside?

168
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,908
Me? Oh my.

169
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,322
This.

170
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,894
I noticed you've been feeling really weak lately.
I bought expensive ginseng for you.

171
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,990
It's also delicious.

172
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:26,787
- What's that sound?
- What?

173
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,429
Why did you?

174
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:38,647
You here?

175
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,030
Study there, fast.

176
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,060
Are you sick?
What's wrong with you?

177
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,820
Turns out today, it's grapes.
Harvest. Uh, no.

178
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,740
The harvest day has arrived.

179
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,140
Oh, what's wrong with you today?

180
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,980
Drinking this makes me very strong.
Wow, today is the day.

181
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,989
- What's wrong with you?
- What now?

182
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,820
What I didn't have time to finish yesterday,
Today we continue.

183
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,499
- Why so suddenly?
- Everything beautiful is sudden.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,859
You're really crazy, aren't you?
Hyun-ji hasn't slept yet.

185
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,360
We can take it slow here.

186
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:14,025
Oh my, how can it be slow?
You can't calm down the person.

187
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:26,487
Sparta!

188
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:30,148
Today, I will not die.

189
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:49,215
The reason for irritable bowel syndrome is
also can't be used continuously.

190
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,320
Every time, you suddenly
want to defecate?

191
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,099
Just say,
you don't want to do it.

192
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,620
Why am I like this? Why?

193
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:03,715
Why can't I use all of them?
the wine stickers I've collected?

194
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,420
Ouch, it hurts so much.

195
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:11,020
If you can't get an erection, it looks like that
side effects of steroid use.

196
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,259
Steroids, yes.
I am a fitness trainer.

197
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,379
Sometimes I drink,
but so far never been a problem.

198
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,460
But since the beginning of this year, it's been a bit difficult.

199
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:25,220
But the strange thing is, I just
can react to one person.

200
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:26,736
Not your wife, huh?

201
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:29,660
What? How did the doctor know?

202
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:34,302
But that doesn't mean,
I have strange intentions, yes.

203
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:39,340
- Do you think it can be cured, Doc?
- Yes, of course.

204
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,180
Really? How?

205
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:43,435
What if you change wives?

206
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,860
I am just kidding.
I'll prescribe some medicine, okay?

207
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,575
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

208
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:57,631
CALCIUM MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENT

209
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:03,235
There should be two grains,
but I only drank four.

210
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,840
The time has been brought here,
told to take it home again? Ouch.

211
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,460
I'm so sorry.

212
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:41,900
Then, we have to take it home.
all this trash to the house?

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,139
Transport company
said I don't want to take it anymore,

214
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,459
so for now,
we can't do much either.

215
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,979
The rubbish has piled up like this,
you just sit back and do nothing?

216
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,539
We have repeatedly asked residents
sorting waste, but it is not done.

217
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,219
So, the TPS rejected it. I'm sorry.

218
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,620
Yes, yes, yes, just a moment everyone.

219
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,219
What is the problem actually?

220
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,326
What a coincidence the Block Leader came.

221
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:05,914
The trash we have brought,
should be accepted, right?

222
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,779
That's right. It's been brought,
just put it here. That's it, right?

223
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,460
Sorry, not possible now.
The trash can is completely full.

224
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,555
We have to clean up
this one first, then you can…

225
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,619
Oh, that's right. Yes, that's right.
Let's finish this one first.

226
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,140
That's exactly it. If from the beginning the security forces
clean up quickly, it wouldn't have turned out like this.

227
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,699
That is true.

228
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,259
Indeed, the security guard's salary comes from the residents,
so it should be more responsive.

229
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,180
You should do a better job.

230
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:35,300
In the Security Act,
Sorting waste is not our job.

231
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:38,365
Really? Is that the rule?

232
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,659
Sorry, sorry. Please take out the trash.
brought again, ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am.

233
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,779
Oh my, what does this management office do?
It just makes me dizzy.

234
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,539
What a coincidence that the Chairman came.

235
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:54,225
Chairman, what do we want to do?
about this trash?

236
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,434
Try discussing this with the neighborhood mothers.

237
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:58,860
RT mothers?

238
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:01,059
What should I do?
This period was thrown at us?

239
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,979
Why should I just leave it?
this whole apartment smells bad?

240
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,040
Geez.

241
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,060
So, you can find
the culprit is from trash?

242
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,440
Ouch.

243
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:16,063
It smells so bad.

244
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,820
Hello? I'm the RT chairman.
Do you have time now?

245
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:25,388
In return, we will be given
free official trash bags for a month.

246
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,912
What, only get a trash bag a month?

247
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:30,379
He also said, after
negotiate with the management office,

248
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,979
management fee
will be free for a year.

249
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:34,739
This is absolutely amazing.

250
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,539
One year. Just count how much that is.

251
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,140
But it's just the three of us who have to
supervise all the trash bins in the complex?

252
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:42,339
There he is.

253
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,059
I just look after the shop while working
rattan crafts that So-hee brought,

254
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,459
it feels like 24 hours is not enough.

255
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,859
This year, I want to take certification
and opened his own studio.

256
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:54,219
I want to stop living
relying on pocket money from my husband.

257
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:58,539
So, let's do the math.
You are actually very lucky.

258
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,259
In the future, regular trash bags
will be totally banned in this complex.

259
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,579
People must be in a hurry
buy the official bag, right?

260
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,379
But selling trash bags is so
How much profit can you make?

261
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,100
They don't just buy bags,

262
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,859
but also buy side dishes,
home needs, all in your store too.

263
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,459
At the same time, promote your shop without paying,
and if turnover increases?

264
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,640
You can stand tall in front of your husband,
control the household economy.

265
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,148
- Control the economy?
- Yes.

266
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,899
I don't want to.

267
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:28,259
In order to get a management discount
and trash bags,

268
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,539
have to take care of the trash in the complex?
Oh, I don't want that kind of hassle.

269
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,860
You are a police wife,
but why say that?

270
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:38,619
If possible, I want to too
back to being an ordinary person,

271
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:40,000
no need to be a police wife.

272
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:43,944
Listen, this is a big secret, okay?

273
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:48,659
He said he was the younger brother of the RT Mothers' Chairperson
high ranking official at Police Headquarters.

274
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,020
Headquarters? You mean the central one?

275
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,060
Who knows, if this project is successful,
can help your husband's promotion.

276
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,624
- You said you failed to get promoted yesterday, right?
- As for promotions, that's a matter for later.

277
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,579
- But you yourself, Mi-ri?
- I…

278
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,299
You're helping out?
without getting anything?

279
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,872
If I,

280
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:11,220
as long as this Gwangseon Jugong complex
can be clean, I'm happy.

281
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,348
Oh, the coaches here
Her body is all amazing, isn't it?

282
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:16,834
He must be very good at teaching.

283
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,054
I have a principle of repaying trust
with the best results.

284
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,509
Please help us, okay?

285
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:22,174
I should be the one asking for your help.

286
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,885
I invited my friends too.
We want to register together.

287
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,895
What are you guys doing outside?
Come in quickly.

288
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,063
- Hello.
- Hello.

289
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:30,327
These are my friends.

290
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:33,499
Wow.
Your friendship is amazing too, huh.

291
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,059
I am the Chairwoman of the Mothers.

292
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,992
Everyone will definitely be healthier.

293
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:38,459
WELCOME.

294
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,379
Wow, can it be this crowded?

295
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,739
Please take the registration form, okay?
Please, please.

296
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,179
- Even those behind can get it, yeah.
- Don't miss it.

297
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,819
You've got it all, right?

298
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,857
Okay, let's start exercising right away, shall we?
Come on, follow me.

299
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:51,009
- Come on.
- Come on.

300
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,259
Come on in quickly.

301
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,899
Why keep saving money?
It should be used like this.

302
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:57,680
Gosh, I didn't expect that.
they will be very happy.

303
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:00,406
Wait. How many of these are there?

304
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:02,899
- One, two, three, four… there are six.
- Why count?

305
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,499
- Oh my gosh, this must be over a hundred.
- Are you sure you can sort this out?

306
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,859
We worked on this all night.
Until it's done. Come on, open it.

307
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,899
Come on, open it now.

308
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
One.

309
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:11,329
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

310
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:15,380
Good. Hold on tight, okay?

311
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,060
Ugh, the smell.

312
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:26,949
Gosh, the food is still messy like this,
just throw it away. How is that possible?

313
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,054
Oh, the smell…

314
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:34,322
Fingerprints. Footprints. Bloodstains.

315
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,440
There really isn't any.

316
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:38,527
But here's a clue.

317
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,626
Look, he's starting to relapse again.

318
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:43,379
There are three people eating together.

319
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,699
Got it. Unit 1112.

320
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,700
This is from unit 601.

321
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,747
Is there any proof that it is our trash?

322
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,819
This is a warning letter
parking violation fines.

323
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,100
There's an address, right?

324
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,900
Right, you huh?

325
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,379
Who said at that time I didn't have any
conscience in the trash?

326
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,820
Okay, just give me the bag.

327
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,060
Oh, why did it have to come to this?

328
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,334
Oh my gosh, the smell.

329
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,540
Block 211. Caught. Got you.

330
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:10,192
What size do you want?

331
00:19:10,243 --> 00:19:13,139
- The 50 liter one seems enough, right?
- Excuse me.

332
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,660
Got it too. Unit 201.

333
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:18,352
How long have I been
don't eat gimbap foil like this?

334
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:21,040
Now!

335
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:36,259
Sir. Hey, Bro. Young man.

336
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:37,804
Mom. Why are you chasing me?

337
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,460
Sir. Sir. Hey, son.

338
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,482
What were you doing just now?

339
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:03,339
Take it home, right now.

340
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,699
Yes. I brought them all.
Sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

341
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,100
Please cooperate, okay?

342
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,188
Its power is terrifying!

343
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,915
PLEASE THROW AWAY TRASH IN THE OFFICIAL TRASH BAG.
WE ALL STILL HAVE A CONSCIENCE.

344
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,296
Wow!

345
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,036
When I started it, I felt scared.
Approximately when will it be finished?

346
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,003
But now, it's almost finished.

347
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,661
Do you think they will?
take out the trash this time?

348
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:24,513
Yes, because we have worked hard,

349
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,013
the amount of waste is also reduced,
looks cleaner.

350
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:29,754
Good looking.
Come on, let's cheer for the last one.

351
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,120
- Come on.
- Okay.

352
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,980
NO ENTRY

353
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:38,614
- Looks like he just got home from studying, huh?
- What?

354
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,830
Who's he?

355
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:43,860
The son of the complex's mothers' leader. Cool, right?

356
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:49,020
- His face is also very handsome.
- Student, huh?

357
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,936
Graduate of Economics from a top university.
Currently studying for the civil service exam.

358
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:55,895
He said, nowadays,
the more handsome or beautiful the child,

359
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,021
usually getting smarter.

360
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:01,624
If only my child was like that too.

361
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,683
What was that study table bought for?
Now it's a dressing table.

362
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,199
Come on, come on. Rather than being jealous
with other people's children,

363
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,749
- finish this first.
- Okay, let's go.

364
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:14,933
Oh my, the smell is amazing.

365
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,626
There must be something here too.
We'll definitely meet again.

366
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:21,587
Yes. Found one. Got it too.

367
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:25,018
- Exactly. Block 211.
- Uh, this is…

368
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,651
This dog…

369
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,722
Ouch.
Ouch, it hurts.

370
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,100
Is my tailbone broken?

371
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:38,531
What's this?

372
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:42,936
Ouch.
Good grief…

373
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,190
- Mi-ri.
- Yes?

374
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,640
Mi-ri.

375
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:50,780
Mi-ri, come here, honey.
Come here, Mi-ri.

376
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,899
Mi-ri, you can't go up.
just like that, you know?

377
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,980
Excuse me.

378
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:56,834
Excuse me!

379
00:21:58,037 --> 00:22:01,140
How could you just leave like that?
Your dog is the one pooping, right?

380
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:02,405
Oh, you mean Mi-ri?

381
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,779
What the heck is that?
Is the dog's name also Mi-ri?

382
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,299
Can't change the name to another?

383
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,555
He's not just a dog. He's my little brother.

384
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:11,666
Isn't this Mi-ri?

385
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:14,779
That's the dog that pooped
dirt everywhere.

386
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,940
He loves his dog so much.
How come it got lost?

387
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,580
The owner of Unit 902 must be panicking.

388
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:24,447
Yes, right. A small Pomeranian dog.
Where did you see it?

389
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,920
No, no, I will
go straight there now.

390
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,611
Guys, wait.

391
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,051
There is something strange.
This is all trash from the minimarket.

392
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,995
Minimarket kimbap,
minimarket sandwiches,

393
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,539
instant lunch,
all single portion food packages,

394
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,540
bowl ramen, shaving cream,
toiletries.

395
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:09,756
It's definitely a man's
who lives alone.

396
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,459
Yes, yes. Gong Mi-ri,
your detective skills are amazing.

397
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,619
You'd put a real detective to shame.

398
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:18,695
I admit it.

399
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,800
How about we open it later?
just detective services, huh?

400
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,779
If so, what about the name?
“Zoom-vengers Detective Agency”?

401
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:29,489
- Cool, right?
- May also.

402
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:31,186
It looks like it's from a minimarket near here.

403
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,349
- Why?
- Blood!

404
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,420
- What?
- Blood!

405
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,400
Wow, this is…

406
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,793
This is real blood.

407
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,359
Judging from the color of the dyed hair,
most likely this is a young woman.

408
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:00,785
Yeah, seriously?

409
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,115
Wow, thank goodness.

410
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:05,880
Yes.

411
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,915
Yes.

412
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:14,084
I'm on my way home.

413
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:21,078
What's that?

414
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,979
Are you okay? What's going on?

415
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,316
There's a pervert there.

416
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,580
- Hey, you fucking pervert.
- Ouch.

417
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:36,900
You crazy.

418
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,660
Who are you? Are you crazy?

419
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,084
Thank goodness I'm not crazy yet.

420
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:43,308
If I'm really crazy,
you are dead now.

421
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,420
Why are you like this? What is this?

422
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,979
Trash? So stinky.

423
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,979
People like you are trash too
too precious for you.

424
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,020
Stop. I'm not a pervert.

425
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:57,085
Oh my gosh, my eyes.

426
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,355
It's obviously a pervert, just admit it.

427
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,700
Ouch. Stuck.
I'm really not a pervert.

428
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:04,520
Hey.

429
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:08,538
Hey, you damn pervert.

430
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:11,993
- Hey. Stop right there.
- Not me!

431
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,148
Are you okay?

432
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:32,293
Why speed like that?
in the complex? Evenings too.

433
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,046
Sorry, you suddenly appeared.
Are you hurt?

434
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,518
- No, I'm fine. Go ahead.
- Excuse me.

435
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:47,595
Oh, where is he going now?

436
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:50,736
If only there was no car…

437
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:54,960
So-hee.

438
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,486
Hey, So-hee!

439
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,280
So-hee.

440
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:04,059
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

441
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,270
Mi-ri, I just finished
last delivery. The shop is closed.

442
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,833
Go for a walk.
That way. Quickly.

443
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,897
- I want to go home.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

444
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:11,367
Okay, which way?

445
00:26:12,615 --> 00:26:13,880
That way. That way.

446
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,845
It seems he hasn't gotten too far.

447
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:21,262
That's it. Hurry!

448
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,674
Go after him!

449
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:25,261
You pervert!

450
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:27,847
Oh, what's wrong with him again?

451
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,091
Hey.

452
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,035
Mi-ri, I'll call the police, okay?

453
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,740
Hey, you.
You're caught now.

454
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,040
What a pervert.

455
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,740
- Unlucky.
- You damn pervert!

456
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:14,791
Geez.

457
00:27:16,948 --> 00:27:18,471
Where else could he run to?

458
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:22,700
Damn! If you get caught, just watch.

459
00:27:22,953 --> 00:27:26,593
I'll take a picture of you as big as a door
and I make you a world celebrity.

460
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,620
LOOKING FOR THE OWNER OF THE UNDERWEAR

461
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,539
Hooded sweater?
Not a raincoat?

462
00:28:14,564 --> 00:28:17,204
Is it still there now?
perverted man wearing a raincoat?

463
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm pretty sure it's a black hood.

464
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:25,380
Wow, if it appears in front of you
those nights,

465
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:28,180
maybe he's a pervert
what your father said.

466
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:31,580
Recently there was indeed
report of pervert in Block 2.

467
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:35,274
Oh, this can't be allowed.
You should stop taking lessons first, okay?

468
00:28:36,362 --> 00:28:38,882
Stop, stop, stop. Don't move.

469
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,210
Why should I stop taking lessons?
Let me pick you up and drop you off.

470
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,948
And this is not for you.

471
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,662
Let Min-yeo eat too, bro.

472
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:48,193
Oh my, what a mother
want to eat it all?

473
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:50,042
Hey, look at your mother.

474
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:54,669
The fat is evenly distributed,
big bones, strong body.

475
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:59,213
He has natural protection.
Even if you come home late, it's still safe.

476
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:04,814
That's a compliment,
but why does it hurt, huh?

477
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:08,244
Okay, you guys just finish it.

478
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,032
- Why? Eat some more.
- I'm full, but I feel nauseous too.

479
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,668
See, right? He only ate half.

480
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,119
It would be a shame to throw it away.

481
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,672
Okay, just finish it all.

482
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:23,526
- I don't want to eat.
- Don't want to eat?

483
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:24,271
Don't want to eat.

484
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,791
- Correct?
- Not eating. Are you satisfied?

485
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:29,579
Don't want to!

486
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,251
Oh, no need to eat.
Why are you so angry? Ouch, my waist…

487
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:35,062
You, when you talk…

488
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,060
MOTHER

489
00:29:40,016 --> 00:29:42,250
Hello? What's up?
Is mom sick?

490
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,297
Ouch, my waist…
Oh, damn it.

491
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,475
What did you move the dressing table for?

492
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:55,022
Because this table is too close to the door.
Every time I open the door, it always hits something.

493
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:58,508
- Have you sent money to Mom?
- Why is there no sound?

494
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:01,740
You said you sent it
two hundred thousand for physiotherapy?

495
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:05,320
- Mom just called.
- This is so heavy. Ouch…

496
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:09,293
Why are you suddenly so diligent?

497
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:10,805
Do not be like that.

498
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,010
Don't make me nervous.
My waist is hurting.

499
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:17,715
- Over here?
- Yes.

500
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:23,929
Is it done?

501
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,855
If it's that strong, it's better
Just take care of Min-yeo.

502
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,186
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

503
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:33,209
- You believe it, right?
- Believe.

504
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,425
Good night.

505
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,117
Mr. Kim. Just a moment.

506
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:00,620
- You know my house, right?
- What?

507
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,647
Remember it well. Block 211, unit 806.

508
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,647
I am the head of the building block.

509
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:09,313
If you don't have the initiative,
at least be friendly.

510
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:11,236
Don't be so stiff.

511
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,379
And about the garbage mess at that time,
I'm the one who tidies it up, right?

512
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,740
Not you. Right?

513
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:23,179
Well, here. Bring it up, okay? I want it.
stop by Gwangseon Store for a while.

514
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,220
This is an expensive item, so carry it with care.
Like carrying a baby, huh?

515
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:34,199
Oh, yeah. He said lately,
There are perverts who often appear in Block 2.

516
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,940
How is that?
Have you seen it?

517
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:38,913
I don't really know, sir.

518
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:41,303
Well that's that then. Please monitor, OK?

519
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:43,660
Geez.

520
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,240
If only I was faster,
I must have caught it earlier.

521
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:55,880
If we meet again,
I will pull the hood off by force.

522
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,140
But before that,
have to sort this out first, right?

523
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:24,952
This is also from NS. Wait a minute.

524
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,105
NS, NS, NS, NS.

525
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,740
Oh my gosh, these are all from the same store?

526
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,614
This guy is a regular customer, right?

527
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,980
What was that?

528
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,150
Come on, focus.

529
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:49,053
What's going on? At this time of night…

530
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:57,055
Oh my, don't tell me
something happened up there?

531
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:10,190
It's already this late at night,
why don't you know manners?

532
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:12,859
Oh, the residents in this neighborhood,
why is it so much trouble, huh?

533
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,900
Ouch.

534
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:25,826
What an annoying woman.
How did he know to get here?

535
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:28,057
Oh, what a bother.

536
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,579
The voice was clear
comes from this house.

537
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:41,352
Could it be the wrong house?

538
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:47,138
But it doesn't feel like it.

539
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:55,139
Hey, back then we even
no need to study, you know.

540
00:33:55,288 --> 00:33:56,995
Hyun-ji. Park Hyun-ji.

541
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,720
Your school bag, school bag.

542
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:01,595
Gosh, how can students forget?
carrying a school bag?

543
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,419
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Yes, go quickly.

544
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,819
- Okay. See you later, ma'am.
- Yes.

545
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:06,459
- Come on.
- Yes.

546
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,312
Ouch,
How could you forget your bag?

547
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:11,748
He looks so much like his father.

548
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,220
You? You!

549
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,380
Security guard?

550
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,790
That's right.
He is our security officer.

551
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,979
He has a clear background,
even been a bodyguard for an idol group.

552
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,620
I have checked all the documents.

553
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:30,339
Sir, do you believe what this pervert says?

554
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,264
Sir, how many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not a pervert.

555
00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:37,460
I've checked
population data.

556
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:42,299
He is officially registered as
occupant of unit 1104 in building 213.

557
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,701
1104? That's right above my house.

558
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:46,592
That noise last night from your house?

559
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,446
Have committed an indecent act,

560
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:52,419
keep making noise too?

561
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,259
Me? How noisy can I be?
This mother likes to exaggerate.

562
00:34:57,343 --> 00:35:00,779
Despite everything,
Why can residents become security guards?

563
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,180
- There must be some hidden intention, right?
- What do you mean, Mom?

564
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,195
Disguise.

565
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,499
Undercover? As a security guard?

566
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,779
So that it can be done more safely
his lewd actions, as well as having an alibi.

567
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,979
One stroke of the paddle,
two or three islands passed. Am I wrong?

568
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:16,579
Wow, that's a big mistake.

569
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,939
- Mr. Block Chairman, good morning.
- Wow, first day of work, huh.

570
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:22,300
This child, I guarantee it.

571
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:27,365
Nowadays, it's hard to find
a young man as good and sincere as him.

572
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:28,840
What?

573
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,720
THREE DAYS AGO

574
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:37,979
Ouch.

575
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,459
Oh, this…

576
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,888
There's blood, oh my.

577
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,299
Ouch, it hurts so much.

578
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:48,379
Sir, are you okay?

579
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,127
What do you think?
I look okay?

580
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:51,563
What?

581
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,424
Are you a resident of this apartment?

582
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:56,220
I don't think I've ever seen your face before.

583
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:59,388
- Come on.
- Geez.

584
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,300
Where do you live?

585
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,299
It doesn't look like it can walk on its own.
Let me deliver.

586
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,739
Wow, what a polite young man.

587
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,320
There, 806.

588
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,603
Wow, this young man has extraordinary energy.

589
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:17,395
So what that means is,

590
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,680
just because he escorted the Block Leader
who came home drunk a few days ago,

591
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:24,581
that's enough of a reason to give it to him
job as a security guard?

592
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,739
Gosh, this is getting even more suspicious.

593
00:36:26,944 --> 00:36:29,474
Whatever it is, do your job well.

594
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:32,612
I have to go to a hiking club meeting,
so see you again.

595
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:35,020
Okay, Mr. Block Leader. Be careful on the road.

596
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:36,561
That…

597
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,939
It's clear there isn't any
administrative problems...

598
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,660
...and the references too
we have verified.

599
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:47,171
This kid has a good background.
Look at his face, right? So dashing.

600
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,420
Don't just look at the outside,
then concluded he was not the culprit.

601
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,099
There were no cases of sexual violence
relation to education or career.

602
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,315
Sexual harassment? Me?

603
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:57,234
What is visible about me?
like a harasser?

604
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:00,363
- This mother is really too much.
- What? This mother?

605
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,499
Wow, your temperament
Turns out it's bad too, huh.

606
00:37:02,576 --> 00:37:03,873
It seems like Mom has misunderstood something.

607
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:06,457
At that time, I just…

608
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,339
I really need to pee
and didn't have time to go to the toilet.

609
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,019
So, I just…
Just a moment near the park.

610
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,260
Oh, so you do that too
defecating in public places?

611
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,379
Amazing. One by one,
let out all his antics, yeah.

612
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,699
I am well aware that it is wrong,
but the condition is really urgent.

613
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,699
Surely you have been there too
in such urgent situations.

614
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:28,075
Never, right? Never?

615
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:33,100
I can't stand it anymore.
I… feel like I'm going to explode…

616
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,259
Whatever it is, why did you run away?

617
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,979
There must be something you are hiding,
that's why you ran, right?

618
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,100
Because of shame.

619
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,209
That night, you screamed “pervert”,
chasing me like he wants to kill me.

620
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,139
Even though he was recommended by the Block Leader,
I don't believe what he said.

621
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,615
I know you are busy,

622
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,495
so i will submit it officially
at the next citizen representative meeting.

623
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,880
Wait a moment.

624
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:00,438
If the perpetrator is a pervert
I caught it, how about it?

625
00:38:02,064 --> 00:38:04,144
If I manage to catch him,
would you believe it?

626
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,093
And stop suspecting me?

627
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:31,363
WELCOME.

628
00:38:35,048 --> 00:38:36,499
As you can see,

629
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,660
all these are receipts issued by
minimarket in Gwangseon Complex 1.

630
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,800
And in the Gwangseon 1 area, there is only one
minimarket of this brand, namely this one.

631
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:45,552
You know that, right?

632
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:48,796
Yes. This is indeed a receipt from our store.
But where does this come from…

633
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:54,708
Well, all those receipts come from
from inside this trash bag.

634
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:58,115
- What's this?
- We are looking for the owner of this trash.

635
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:01,647
Judging from the contents,

636
00:39:01,698 --> 00:39:04,604
most likely this belongs to
loyal customer of this store,

637
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:06,060
or maybe you yourself.

638
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,568
So you mean, you're digging
all this trash?

639
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,919
Garbage transport party
refused to take him.

640
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:13,706
Like it or not, we have to look for it
the owner and sort it out.

641
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:16,220
Have you seen this bag before?

642
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,060
Or maybe you've seen me?

643
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:21,620
Are you okay?

644
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,821
Why speed like that?
inside the complex?

645
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:31,114
Yeah. It looks like that.
it's indeed our trash.

646
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:34,059
I'm really upset
and can't hold back emotions.

647
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,208
Gwangseon residents often bring trash
and throw it in our trash.

648
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:41,156
So because I was annoyed, I also,
also throw it into the complex area.

649
00:39:41,902 --> 00:39:43,555
Anyway, I'm sorry.

650
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,779
But still, how can that be?
you throw away the minimarket trash...

651
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,593
...into an apartment complex like that?

652
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:49,726
At least sort it out properly first.

653
00:39:49,777 --> 00:39:52,779
You know how hard we work
find out the owner of the trash?

654
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,840
I will be more careful.

655
00:40:00,383 --> 00:40:03,606
Judging from the color of the dyed hair,
most likely this is a young woman.

656
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:08,460
There are women's haircuts
in that bag.

657
00:40:09,068 --> 00:40:10,740
That's also from this minimarket, isn't it?

658
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:14,685
Yeah, it looks like there's some bloody tissue too, huh?

659
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,619
And that wound on your hand…

660
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,186
No. It's just scratched.
when I was wrapping the cardboard earlier.

661
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,659
I don't know about the hair.

662
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,989
Maybe a high school student threw it away.
Some of them like to dye their hair.

663
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:30,555
But I didn't say the hair was colored.

664
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,270
Yes, why are you talking?
as if seeing it yourself?

665
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,786
Do you have to see it in person?

666
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:38,147
If you look at the contents of the bag like that,
clearly belongs to a high school student.

667
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:41,555
If you have been working for a long time
around the school, you will understand.

668
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,749
That is true.

669
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:48,043
My son also really likes hair dye.
Even if it is forbidden, it is still forced.

670
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:52,580
So that means, the hair in the bag
also comes from this minimarket?

671
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:56,324
But from earlier, I felt like
as if being interrogated.

672
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:00,761
- If you feel that way, I'm sorry.
- We are sorry.

673
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:06,936
Kyeong-ja, you don't feel
Is there something strange about that person?

674
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,979
Why? He is not visible.
like a bad person.

675
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,780
After all, he also admitted that
indeed rubbish from its place.

676
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:13,956
- Wait a moment.
- Nonetheless…

677
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,659
Oh no. The in-laws are coming.

678
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,709
Gosh, he must be
there is another heart problem.

679
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:19,956
Oh my gosh, really…

680
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:25,615
But how could he know?
is the hair colored?

681
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:29,538
He said he had been working for a long time
near high school, maybe he already knows.

682
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:32,459
But now the scariest thing
is my mother-in-law's nagging.

683
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,864
- Come on.
- But…

684
00:41:33,915 --> 00:41:36,299
He spoke as if
really see that hair.

685
00:41:36,376 --> 00:41:37,899
If you saw it, just say you saw it.

686
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,739
He said he didn't see,
but his words seemed to see it.

687
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,260
Ah, never mind. Hair and coloring.
not a problem now.

688
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:44,038
A moment.
Phone call from Mom.

689
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:45,602
- Yes, Mom.
- But Kyeong-ja…

690
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:49,690
I'm really frustrated. He disappeared.
days just because of one message.

691
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,084
I don't understand. He already
prepare practice for the test the day after tomorrow.

692
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:57,679
Okay, I'm going to the place.
He usually works, who knows if there's any news.

693
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,620
Her hair color…

694
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:03,378
Yes, I'm going there. I'll be there soon.

695
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:07,019
- Come on, Mi-ri, let's go. Hurry.
- Wait a minute, Kyeong-ja.

696
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,525
- Come on, quickly.
- Because I don't feel well.

697
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:12,647
Damn it.

698
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,515
Where is it? Where is it? Damn it!

699
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:28,540
I was wrong. I am guilty.

700
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,417
Forgive me. Please.

701
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,816
Help.

702
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,632
Please, please.

703
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,899
I won't let you
meet another man.

704
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,979
I was wrong. I was so wrong.

705
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:52,072
I am wrong.

706
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:54,197
I was totally wrong.

707
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:08,508
Hye-young is coming, huh?

708
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:12,569
Are you looking for your brother again?

709
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:15,363
Sir, hasn't my brother contacted you yet?

710
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,613
Your brother hasn't told you yet, has he?

711
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:21,628
These past few days he's been a bit stressed.
because there are annoying customers.

712
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:23,836
He said he wanted to calm down.
I'll be home soon.

713
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:27,405
Because he didn't answer the phone,
so I'm really worried.

714
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,360
If anything happens, he will definitely let me know.

715
00:43:30,198 --> 00:43:32,907
Don't worry. If he contacts you,
I promise I will tell you.

716
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:34,640
Yes.

717
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:36,503
Wait a moment.

718
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:39,729
This is for you.

719
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,105
No need, sir. I'm fine.

720
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,846
Just use it, make enough food.

721
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:46,751
Thank You.

722
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:00,803
Hello?

723
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,682
Hello? Is there no one there?

724
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,143
Please. Someone is here.

725
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,545
Please help me.
I'm here, is anyone there?

726
00:44:19,378 --> 00:44:20,438
Excuse me.

727
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,980
Good night.

728
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,140
Is your house undergoing renovations?

729
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,316
Renovation? Oh, nothing.

730
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:27,844
Strange.

731
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,499
I'm not at home during the day,

732
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,650
but my mother said, this afternoon I heard
"duk duk duk" sound from your house.

733
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:40,491
Oh, it looks like your mother heard wrong.

734
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:44,362
The structure of the apartment building is interconnected
connected. The sound of other units can be heard.

735
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,610
Oh, I see?

736
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,124
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:48,558 --> 00:44:49,638
It doesn't matter.

738
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:55,400
Unlucky.

739
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:07,080
Hey.

740
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:08,680
Hey.

741
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,640
Hey.

742
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:21,260
Your beautiful forehead is scarred like this.

743
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:24,509
You think the neighbors will come?
save you?

744
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,813
Please, let me out.

745
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,419
I just want to meet
my sister just a moment.

746
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,520
I swear.

747
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:40,180
Don't worry, your sister is fine.

748
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,830
I even gave him one earlier
pocket money. Fifty thousand.

749
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:46,835
The child is cute.

750
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:51,123
Of course you are more beautiful.

751
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:55,494
Does it hurt? Sorry, Hye-jung.

752
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:58,206
I promise I won't do it again.

753
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,740
Let's live well, shall we?

754
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:01,080
- Is lost?
- Is lost?

755
00:46:02,822 --> 00:46:07,155
You mean the owner of the hair from
the trash bag is now gone?

756
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,739
I'm not sure if he's missing,
but what is certain is that he cannot be contacted.

757
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:11,817
Do you know where?

758
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:13,795
Oh, my.

759
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:16,259
At that time, you suddenly
said he wanted to defecate,

760
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,259
then ran into the shop,
So you want to meet that student, huh?

761
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,859
Oh, you know yourself.

762
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,980
I can still hold my bowel movements,
but I couldn't hold back my curiosity.

763
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:30,107
Sorry, I actually
accidentally overheard your conversation.

764
00:46:30,158 --> 00:46:31,699
But I heard you say,

765
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,299
your sister who works at the minimarket
could not be contacted?

766
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:35,571
You know my brother?

767
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:38,643
No, not directly acquainted.

768
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,539
Just because we are in the same environment,
I'm worried too.

769
00:46:41,672 --> 00:46:44,360
Who knows, maybe I can help you find it.

770
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,418
It's been a few days now,
his phone was completely dead.

771
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,539
Just send one message,
can't go home anytime soon.

772
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,797
What did the minimarket say?

773
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,699
Don't know anything?

774
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:56,031
The owner said,
My brother is stressed because of customers,

775
00:46:56,082 --> 00:46:57,900
so go for a short walk.

776
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,100
But my brother is not that type.

777
00:47:01,095 --> 00:47:03,464
My sister's salon course fees
five hundred thousand won a month.

778
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:06,122
This year, he is very determined,
saving desperately.

779
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,260
He is a very frugal person.

780
00:47:08,706 --> 00:47:10,666
Even eating with leftover food.

781
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:12,402
Walk everywhere.

782
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:15,085
Just pocket money
five thousand won per day.

783
00:47:15,475 --> 00:47:16,955
So, it's impossible that he's on vacation.

784
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,259
Your hair color is nice, huh?
It doesn't seem like a common color.

785
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,667
My sister mixes the dye herself.

786
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,979
He had time to practice coloring,

787
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,540
even dyed my hair and
her own hair is the same color.

788
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:33,866
He said in a few days,
there will be a test at the beauty academy.

789
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,400
If this isn't just running away from home,

790
00:47:36,885 --> 00:47:37,935
This is a criminal act.

791
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:40,620
Criminal?

792
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,459
You mean like kidnapping,
kidnapping, murder, is that it?

793
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,100
What? Murder?

794
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,957
Help. Someone is here. Help me.

795
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:50,517
There are people here.

796
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:55,594
Help. Someone is here. Help me.

797
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:59,290
Help. Someone is here. Help me.

798
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,462
Oh my gosh, you went too far.
Just because of a clump of hair?

799
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:11,913
Yes. Maybe the employee
work stress, emotional,

800
00:48:12,158 --> 00:48:14,458
cut your own hair,
and just disappear?

801
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:16,019
The trash is from the minimarket too, right?

802
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,339
Yes, maybe too. But at that time,
we only found some hair.

803
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,500
If you want to cut it, you will definitely cut it.
all, right? Not just some.

804
00:48:23,676 --> 00:48:27,875
After all, the person who is preparing
beauty certification exam,

805
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,380
suddenly disappeared?

806
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,739
If you think about it, it's a bit strange, yes.

807
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:34,659
Not just a little. But very strange.

808
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,320
- Wow, surprised.
- Already up?

809
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,099
He said he would bleach it
some of my hair, you know?

810
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,539
He said the exam was near,
So it's also a practice.

811
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,619
I only bleached part of it, okay?

812
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,418
He doesn't seem like the type
who likes to walk.

813
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,899
Wait, but the minimarket owner
a bit strange, isn't it?

814
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,540
How could he not know that his employees
get your hair cut at that place?

815
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:58,604
Why did you say that?
Maybe it was the work of the local high school students?

816
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:00,780
Maybe he's lying.

817
00:49:00,913 --> 00:49:03,273
If you don't know, you should.
just say you don't know.

818
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,339
But it seems like he's trying
cover something up,

819
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,980
That's why I rushed to find an excuse.

820
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,699
It's possible. Because we kept pushing earlier,
so he's probably just nervous.

821
00:49:10,738 --> 00:49:14,618
I find it very suspicious.
You guys also think he's weird, right?

822
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:15,801
But…

823
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:20,275
The strangest thing is your work.

824
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,819
You guys have talked a lot,
when are you going to finish this?

825
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,724
If it continues like this, it's better to break up
and just create a makeshift detective agency.

826
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:29,779
I will not give
another side job.

827
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,100
This kid. His words…

828
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,299
Listen, that's the age here
is the same age as your mother or aunt.

829
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,699
If they're the same age, so what?
His work is equivalent to that of a toddler.

830
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:41,851
- What? A toddler?
- Look.

831
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,459
There are lots of holes.
Can't use it, it's really bad.

832
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,179
Even Mrs. Oh Eun-young can't
provide a solution for this.

833
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,859
It's serious. It can't be helped.

834
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,939
- You're so talkative.
- Okay, focus now.

835
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,739
Wait, I really
intend to focus, I swear!

836
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:56,800
But you keep talking about that employee.
You know something, right?

837
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:58,387
There's not much info.

838
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,849
But the owner of the minimarket
live in unit 202, right?

839
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,401
I almost every day
deliver the order to the house.

840
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:06,826
Since the day the employee disappeared,
the order menu started to increase.

841
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,259
He used to always order
just one serving of jjigae.

842
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,080
But suddenly an order appeared,
such as pizza, risotto, pasta, tteokbokki.

843
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,322
He even ordered
two portions of boxed rice too.

844
00:50:18,127 --> 00:50:22,367
Two servings is not impossible, right?
So what?

845
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,619
You don't understand.
You eat a little.

846
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,819
But those who live alone can do it
order a lot and a variety, understand?

847
00:50:28,846 --> 00:50:31,108
Pizza, pasta, risotto, tteokbokki.

848
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:33,300
Those are all my favorite foods
girl in her twenties.

849
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,340
Don't talk about food anymore.
I'm getting hungry. My jaw is heavy.

850
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,579
But isn't tteokbokki a favorite?
Kyeong-ja in her forties?

851
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,699
- That is true.
- Geez.

852
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,099
The important thing is not the tteokbokki,
Something feels wrong.

853
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,820
I have to pick up Min-yeo now.
Okay, that's all for today.

854
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:49,756
Orders are coming in.

855
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,859
You guys have to finish it
all this before tomorrow.

856
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,379
- I'm serious.
- Yes.

857
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,700
I can't stand it
if you have a bad feeling.

858
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:56,991
So-hee, wait a minute.

859
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,600
Can I ask you one thing for help?

860
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:02,809
Ask for help?

861
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,940
Hye-jung, it's still warm.

862
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,915
This is your favorite creamy risotto.

863
00:51:14,748 --> 00:51:15,640
This.

864
00:51:21,804 --> 00:51:23,584
I have something
that I want to show.

865
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:31,615
Hye Jung.

866
00:51:33,714 --> 00:51:35,523
Beautiful, right? Want to try it for a while?

867
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,986
I think this brown color suits you much better.
for you than that bright color.

868
00:51:39,906 --> 00:51:43,426
I don't need this.
Please, let me go home.

869
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:49,299
Please let me call
my sister just once. Please.

870
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:51,899
Is it that hard to be by my side?

871
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:53,457
If I set you free now,

872
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:56,257
You must have met that man, Jae-wook.

873
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:59,220
Because you can't be trusted.

874
00:52:00,565 --> 00:52:03,657
Once I give you freedom,

875
00:52:04,816 --> 00:52:07,978
you immediately turned to another man.

876
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,259
Right?

877
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:14,720
- Reply me.
- He's just a friend, really.

878
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:21,004
And I never once
like you as a man.

879
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:26,468
I just feel awkward because you are kind,
That's why I can't bear to refuse. That's all.

880
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:33,580
Why did you lie?

881
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:38,110
Eat together, drink, play games.
That's not dating?

882
00:52:38,297 --> 00:52:39,977
You even borrowed money
for tuition fees.

883
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,740
Where is there anyone who borrows money?
to just anyone?

884
00:52:43,722 --> 00:52:47,322
Hye-jung, that's what love is.
You understand, right?

885
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,658
Sir, I will return all the money.

886
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:56,117
I promise I won't report it to the police.

887
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:57,977
Please let me out.

888
00:52:58,903 --> 00:53:03,219
My sister must be very worried now.

889
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,500
Your sister. Your sister.
Stop talking nonsense about your sister.

890
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,620
Damn. If you miss him,
Do you want me to bring it here too?

891
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,659
You want me to change it
be like you?

892
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,220
You're crazy.
Don't mess with Hye-young.

893
00:53:18,806 --> 00:53:20,780
How can I trust you?
Damn it.

894
00:53:30,753 --> 00:53:34,193
If the employee is at home,
maybe he could leave a message.

895
00:53:37,395 --> 00:53:38,435
Yes?

896
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,779
- The food has arrived.
- Just put it in front.

897
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,619
Sorry, cutlery stock
single use is running out,

898
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,500
so I bring it using a regular container.

899
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,699
When you have finished eating,
please put it outside.

900
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,391
- I'll get it later.
- Good.

901
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,219
It's the only line of communication
from inside the house to outside.

902
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,460
Through the food container.

903
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,660
Please, don't do this.

904
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:09,848
Don't do this.

905
00:54:19,693 --> 00:54:22,413
What? Barely eaten?

906
00:54:28,344 --> 00:54:29,980
Am I overreacting?

907
00:54:39,548 --> 00:54:40,458
What's this?

908
00:54:43,993 --> 00:54:44,859
Who is it?

909
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,820
Hello? This is a delivery.
from Gwangseon Store.

910
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:54,219
Ouch, it's so heavy. It almost took my hand off.
Let me put it inside, okay?

911
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,859
Wait a minute. Excuse me.
Ma'am, this is…

912
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,619
Wow, look at this.
The man's house is clean without a speck of dust.

913
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:01,979
- Great.
- What's going on, ma'am?

914
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,099
This is kimchi.

915
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:06,154
If not entered directly,
it could be sour later.

916
00:55:10,828 --> 00:55:12,868
SAUCE?

917
00:55:15,504 --> 00:55:16,904
This is a signal for help.

918
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:27,613
22 YEARS AGO

919
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:31,154
We have found the body.
One two three…

920
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,418
The forensics team is ready, right?
Please check.

921
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,635
We immediately headed to the location.

922
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,219
- Hey, hold the reporter.
- Wait.

923
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,939
- Quick, stop the reporters from entering.
- Hold it there.

924
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,173
Back off. Don't come any closer.

925
00:55:46,198 --> 00:55:49,705
- Do not come close.
- Stay behind the lines.

926
00:55:55,303 --> 00:55:57,592
- Please look over here.
- This way, sir.

927
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:00,600
- Step back, don't come any closer.
- Look this way.

928
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:01,927
- Step back.
- Please, sir.

929
00:56:01,952 --> 00:56:03,099
Hey. Hold that reporter.

930
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,499
A young woman with the surname Um,
who was reported missing three months ago,

931
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,139
found dead...

932
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,452
...in a reservoir in Deokjin-gun,
Gangwon Province.

933
00:56:10,025 --> 00:56:12,739
After the body of the girl with the surname Um
who was reported missing...

934
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,859
...while exploring an empty house
with his friends found,

935
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,819
the police decided to change
status of this case...

936
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,660
...to murder
and expand the investigation.

937
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:24,361
Oh my gosh, you must be
feeling cold, my Ji-eun.

938
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,740
Why are your feet so cold?

939
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,414
Why are your feet so cold?
Where have you been? Ji-eun, my child…

940
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,201
Aunt.

941
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:41,596
Is that really Ji-eun?

942
00:56:43,363 --> 00:56:47,163
Mi-ri. Why did you do that? Why?

943
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:52,928
If only we had found it sooner,
Ji-eun can definitely be saved.

944
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:56,620
You guys go together,
you guys should get back together too.

945
00:56:57,586 --> 00:57:02,106
Why are you the only one alive?
Why only you?

946
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,895
Ji-eun.

947
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:25,900
Ji-eun, no. Ji-eun.

948
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:29,721
Ji-eun, I'm sorry.

949
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,255
- You said we would go together.
- Turn on Ji-eun.

950
00:57:35,306 --> 00:57:38,139
Because you killed him,
you have to revive it.

951
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,514
Forgive me.

952
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,900
Bring Ji-eun back to life, my daughter.

953
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:47,859
Ji-eun. Open your eyes.

954
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,579
The police continue to carry out
Field investigations stated that...

955
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,579
...this incident was not triggered
by debt or revenge.

956
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,655
Due to the similar mode,

957
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,859
MAY 10, 2025
the public speculates that Ribbon Man…

958
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,419
...which is
the serial killer...

959
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,300
...has returned to action
after a long time of disappearance.

960
00:58:04,493 --> 00:58:08,502
Although in the last ten years
no new Ribbon Man cases found,

961
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:11,314
the police are still considering it.

962
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:43,210
We need stronger evidence.

963
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,470
Irrefutable evidence.

964
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:45,530
Stop right there, damn it!

965
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,970
You know what?
to the point of being careless?

966
00:58:47,493 --> 00:58:48,713
Aren't you allowed to be like that?

967
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,930
That is unforgivable.

968
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,360
I will definitely catch you.

969
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,880
What is your goal?
Why this apartment?

970
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,270
- Security guard!
- Sir!

971
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,820
Is there anything you remember from
her body shape and clothes?

972
00:58:58,439 --> 00:58:59,239
Hooded jacket?

973
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,610
This is not mine.

974
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,470
That's why you're hiding
to that extent?

975
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,530
We have to report to the police first!

976
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:07,290
Who knows?
He could be a psychopathic killer.

977
