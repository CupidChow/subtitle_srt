LEE SI-YOUNG
AS GONG MI-RI

JUNG YOUNG-JOO

00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,980
SALON DE HOLMES

8
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:47,530
Since you came,
a lot of things happen in this apartment.

9
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,596
Initially, the Block Leader was like that...

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,540
...and I almost believe that you
really want to help me.

11
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:53,393
But...

12
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,558
...since when did letters come from the post box?
unit 1004 never existed again?

13
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,353
Teachers know too, right?

14
00:01:00,398 --> 00:01:02,571
To write a novel,
research is very important.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,631
You don't want to help me.

16
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:07,460
You want to help the owner of this letter.

17
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:11,051
That's the real reason you came
to Gwangseon Jugong, right?

18
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:14,211
What is your relationship with Lee Min-seon?

19
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:17,917
Initially...

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,760
...because of the novel.

21
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:31,832
Red Hunter.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,016
White and slender hands
of the girl who had lost her life.

23
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:39,414
The finger decorated with a small flower ring
suddenly turned pale and wilted.

24
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,485
Silver scissor blades
covered in blood...

25
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,539
...the hunter's glow shone dazzlingly.

26
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:47,445
How can someone
write so realistically,

27
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,794
as if it were real
be at the scene,

28
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,896
as if meeting in person
with the victims?

29
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,755
Never mind, don't keep coming home
someone who is no longer your teacher.

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,790
Why?

31
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:04,195
I also bought this for Teacher.

32
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,009
If you don't want to, I'll just eat it.

33
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:13,573
Victims killed by Ribbon Man
two years ago was my student.

34
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,980
Because of that, I can no longer teach.

35
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:18,676
At least, I want to
defended him through a novel.

36
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,738
Actually, I also want to be a writer.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,843
How to
can write like a teacher?

38
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,820
Since that day, I also started
preparing a novel about the Ribbon Man.

39
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,115
If you really want to be a writer,

40
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:33,628
you should write
quietly alone.

41
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,820
Why does it appear in front of me again?

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,410
Because I realized...

43
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,457
...there is something more important
from writing novels in my life.

44
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:43,991
My daughter spoke to me in a dream.

45
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:44,818
JANUARY 2020

46
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,976
Mother,

47
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,317
I don't want to.

48
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,756
Please remove the ribbon around my neck.

49
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:57,916
She cried so hard like that.

50
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:02,356
21st Regular Meeting
FAMILY OF MURDER CASE VICTIMS

51
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,179
Oh, I'm getting so old,
I cried instead. It was embarrassing.

52
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:17,578
It doesn't matter.

53
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:19,160
It's normal to cry a little.

54
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,013
I want to cry too,
so that mother doesn't feel embarrassed?

55
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:26,355
Thank you.

56
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,815
Even though young people like you must be busy,

57
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,293
but still had time to help
at a victim's family event like this.

58
00:03:31,353 --> 00:03:32,833
I did do it
because I want to.

59
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,712
Just think of me as your mother's child,
so just relax.

60
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,853
Yes, if you were my own child,
would have been nice.

61
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,993
The more I look at your character
very similar to Ji-eun.

62
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:46,070
Friendly, caring, polite.

63
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,203
Mother is also very similar
with my late mother.

64
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,396
Both are loving...

65
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,043
...and cries easily.

66
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,713
How old is your mother now?

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,123
My mother died when I was ten years old.
Gastric cancer.

68
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,273
My father remarried shortly after that.

69
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,526
Oh, is that so?

70
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,753
It must be very hard at such a young age.

71
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,039
But you grow
be such a good boy.

72
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,720
Your mother must be proud.

73
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:18,121
All my life, I only received
mockery as an orphan...

74
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,700
...and endless torment.

75
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,060
I didn't expect, from the place that was originally
I just want to come to write a novel,

76
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:27,393
I even met adults
who really cares about me.

77
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:32,327
This is a flower ring
which Ji-eun always wears.

78
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,403
I have the same one too.

79
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,581
Oh, that's right.

80
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,496
Ji-eun's fingers are white and very beautiful.

81
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:48,013
And these are the exact same scissors
like the one he bought at the stationery store…

82
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:49,534
...the day he disappeared.

83
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:53,683
This…

84
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,010
Flower ring,

85
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,643
scissors.

86
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,166
Why do I feel like I've seen this before?
directly the victim's belongings,

87
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,222
even though it was never mentioned
in any news or articles?

88
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:08,726
That's when it hit me.

89
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:13,848
What I saw at that time was
the killer's diary.

90
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,653
A confession from people
who actually committed the murder.

91
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:20,547
FEBRUARY 2025
It's not good to suspect people,

92
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:22,725
but this heart can't be controlled.

93
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,752
The person who made
we suspect that is the one who is guilty.

94
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,006
Who?

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,300
Who is it?

96
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,859
Just tell me at once
all to your child.

97
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:33,753
He is a person who often
I met in this apartment.

98
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,543
Son,

99
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,761
if something happens to me,

100
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,505
come again to this apartment, okay?

101
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,549
Ah, what are you talking about, Mom?

102
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:51,908
Come in quickly, okay?

103
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:53,356
See you next Friday.

104
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,235
Yes.

105
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,219
- Mother.
- Yes?

106
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,619
Don't forget to eat regularly.

107
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:01,422
- You too, take care of your health.
- I always eat well.

108
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,695
- Be careful on the way.
- Ready, ma'am.

109
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,365
I never thought
that day would be his last day.

110
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,500
MARCH 2025

111
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,959
You're Gwang-gyu, right?

112
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes.

113
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,664
When tidying up
the deceased's belongings,

114
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:20,555
looks like my brother
really want to give it to you.

115
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,980
ACCOUNT IN THE NAME OF LEE MIN-SEON

116
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:45,476
Son,

117
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,809
if you are reading this letter,

118
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,143
maybe I don't have time anymore
hand it over directly.

119
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,956
Since Ji-eun left,

120
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,503
I feel like I've lived too long.

121
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:00,639
To live
as a failed mother...

122
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:02,173
...very heavy,

123
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:04,706
but thanks to you,
I often smile.

124
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,792
My son, Gwang-gyu.

125
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,139
As long as you live,

126
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:13,412
try to be happy wholeheartedly.

127
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,043
You may not recognize me,

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,130
but i remember that day
very clearly.

129
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,416
Hello.

130
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:32,816
Have a nice day!

131
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,549
The day I realized you were working
in the apartment where Mrs. Lee lives.

132
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:40,613
The day I decided to catch
Ribbon Man with my own hands.

133
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:43,850
That's the beginning!

134
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:48,223
From sneaking in quietly
to the hunter's hunting ground…

135
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Sir, are you okay?

136
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:53,427
Becoming a hunter
who surpassed the hunter.

137
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,533
Becoming a predator
who surpassed the killer.

138
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:57,520
TO LEE MIN-SEON, BLOCK 213 UNIT 1004,
GWANGSEON JUGONG APARTMENT

139
00:07:57,586 --> 00:07:59,859
While quietly preparing everything,
I'm waiting for the right time.

140
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,386
In that case,
how about we work together?

141
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,199
Or rather, form a coalition.

142
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:05,466
If necessary,

143
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,959
I will hold anyone's hand
who have the same goal.

144
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,920
I want to catch him
with my own hands.

145
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:14,543
Kim Hyun-deok, the Ribbon Man.

146
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,423
In that case,

147
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,890
I have no other choice.

148
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,180
I warned you
many times to go.

149
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:36,043
But you ignored it and instead
throw yourself into danger.

150
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:39,810
Hand over the items you're hiding.

151
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,636
That's an important thing for me.

152
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,587
You mean these gloves?

153
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,167
Or rather,

154
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,247
murder tool?

155
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,303
This place is suitable
to hide something.

156
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:02,530
There is no ventilation,

157
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,603
so it's also suitable for people like you
end life in despair.

158
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,156
Are you Gong Mi-ri?

159
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,150
Yes.

160
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,410
E.P. 10: DESPERATE HOUSEWIFE
Wait.

161
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,116
Who sent this?

162
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,701
He said, once you open it, you will know.

163
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:09,790
That's Ji-eun's ring.

164
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:21,770
PERSONAL NUMBER

165
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,851
Have you received the gift?

166
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,178
You must be Kim Hyun-deok, right?

167
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,107
Even now, the decision is yours.

168
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,972
You decide
whether your child will live or die.

169
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:37,165
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

170
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,372
Please drink it first.

171
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:39,978
Thank you, I'll have a drink first.

172
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,018
- Who's this?
- So refreshing!

173
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:45,664
Hello, why?

174
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,831
Ah, I want to find more.

175
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:51,440
Where are there empty houses in Gwangseon?
which can be used to test your courage?

176
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,779
Because the prize is big, so you have to
look for a really scary place.

177
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,153
Tomorrow school finishes at 4 o'clock,
so I came home early.

178
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,314
Is it okay?

179
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,301
I feel like I can make some time.

180
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,755
But shouldn't you
tell your parents?

181
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,620
This was kept a secret from Mom and Dad.

182
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,728
I have to win that prize money,
so I can give the money to Dad.

183
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,203
Hyun-ji!

184
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,856
Uncle!

185
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,636
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

186
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,369
Oh, of course not.

187
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:29,006
Mother!

188
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:33,527
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- Hyun-ji!

189
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,828
- Hyun-ji!
- Please save me.

190
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:38,829
- Hyun-ji!
- Mother!

191
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:44,485
Where is my son? Where's Hyun-ji?

192
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:45,955
He is still alive.

193
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:47,884
So don't be reckless
and think carefully.

194
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,243
If you dare to touch my child,
even the tip of a hair,

195
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:52,780
I will kill you
with my own hands!

196
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,883
I'm curious...

197
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,730
...with the scared girl I freed
more than 20 years ago.

198
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:00,440
Mother!

199
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,776
- Mother!
- No! Hyun-ji!

200
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,363
My child!

201
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,416
MY BELOVED DAUGHTER

202
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,396
It's true, apparently.
history always repeats itself.

203
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:16,186
If you want to help your daughter,
come to that place.

204
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:18,723
The place where our history began.

205
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
Gong Mi-ri,

206
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:22,879
you really are
want to enter this place?

207
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,367
Of course!

208
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,740
I will immortalize everything.

209
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,700
Do we really have to go today?

210
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:28,940
Ah, hurry up!

211
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,085
I really can't get in!

212
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,276
HAESAN MENTAL HOSPITAL

213
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:43,913
Mrs. Lee did not commit suicide.

214
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:47,566
SEVEN HOURS EARLIER
The prime suspect is the person who made it…

215
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,522
…to the point of having to dig up the evidence yourself.

216
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,509
You mean, what you mean is that
Mr. Kim, the security guard?

217
00:12:55,575 --> 00:13:00,100
Who first discovered
Ji-eun's mother's body?

218
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,347
You must know, right?

219
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,273
That's Mr. Kim, the apartment security guard.

220
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,710
What?

221
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,195
At that time, there was a match
Korean football vs Japan,

222
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,236
so everyone is watching…

223
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,316
...and there is not one
which passes in front of the apartment.

224
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Mrs. Lee!

225
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:14,073
Except me,
who is delivering orders.

226
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,660
There... there's someone who fell! Here...

227
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,753
Please come soon. Okay?

228
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,547
Oh my, what should I do?

229
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:23,980
What happened, sir?

230
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,360
I was on patrol and found
occupants of unit 1004.

231
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,693
Mrs. Lee!

232
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,620
It turns out Mr. Kim was right.

233
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,879
But if Mr. Kim is the perpetrator,

234
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:42,794
why should you be the first witness?
which actually makes him suspicious?

235
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,853
- Yes, right?
- Because he's a security guard.

236
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:48,634
If there is an incident in the apartment, people
The first person who must come is the security guard.

237
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:51,506
He was the one who found the body.

238
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,184
Too perfect to be a coincidence.

239
00:13:54,348 --> 00:13:57,843
That day, Mr. Kim ordered
fried chicken in large quantities.

240
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,859
At that time, I felt something was strange.

241
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:02,645
- That day, before seeing Mrs. Lee fall,
- Fried chicken is coming.

242
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,592
I had time to deliver
chicken orders to the management office.

243
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,003
Wow, thanks to Mr. Kim,
we can have a party.

244
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:08,948
Wow, how much is this all together?

245
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,123
Everything has been paid.

246
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,756
But why do people order
not eating?

247
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,829
He said he had business with the Block Leader
and told us to eat first.

248
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,362
So, only Mr. Kim is not there.
in the office at that time.

249
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:19,106
Yes.

250
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:22,420
What if it's all just an alibi
so he can leave without suspicion?

251
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,033
What?

252
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,347
SECURITY GUARD POST
This is from the guard post.

253
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,839
- Hello?
- This is the lady from unit 806, right?

254
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,894
- Yes, right.
- Your husband just came…

255
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:37,500
...and immediately brought
Mr. Kim went to the police station.

256
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,199
What?

257
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:40,606
My husband brought
Mr. Kim to the police station?

258
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,460
You must be really tired, huh?

259
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:53,020
So, of the three messages sent,
one of Mr. Kim Hyun-deok...

260
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:55,074
...and two from Park Tae-hoon
who sent it first.

261
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:58,227
It's just an exchange of news.
It's just a normal thing.

262
00:14:58,252 --> 00:14:59,218
Correct.

263
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,728
Between the security guard and the apartment residents, sending
such messages could indeed happen.

264
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:04,618
But...

265
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:07,505
...if you see the message from Park Tae-hoon,

266
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:10,351
he looks very familiar
with Mr. Kim,

267
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,177
even it seems
really respect you.

268
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:16,724
Every time we meet, he always
bowing like a loser.

269
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:21,740
Because I used to be a teacher too,
I feel sorry and sympathize with him.

270
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,860
So, you just give
spirit via message?

271
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:24,753
Yes.

272
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:27,182
- Is that really all?
- Yes.

273
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,020
He said he was only being examined as a witness
and nothing suspicious.

274
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,123
He was also sent home earlier.

275
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,736
Excuse me.
Have you seen Mr. Kim?

276
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:46,212
He has quit his job.

277
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,719
He said he suddenly had to go out of town
for important matters.

278
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,179
Working together for years,
instead just left without saying goodbye.

279
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,995
And today, Gwang-gyu
also can't be contacted.

280
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,900
It will definitely be a hassle
before we get a replacement.

281
00:15:58,953 --> 00:16:00,193
Yes, that's right.

282
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,293
Kim Gwang-gyu!

283
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,826
This is really weird.

284
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,726
Kim Hyun-deok, Kim Gwang-gyu.

285
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,709
Why are they both
disappear together?

286
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,894
The little dog is sleeping.
Why wake up?

287
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,860
Excuse me.
Mom woke you up, okay?

288
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:26,086
It doesn't matter.

289
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,889
But this can bark.
Want to hear it?

290
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:33,500
Wow! That's so cool.
Who gave this?

291
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:35,016
Nurse.

292
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:38,540
He said you were the one who gave it
doll for Yul, huh?

293
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,885
Thank you very much.
He really likes it.

294
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:44,956
My mom made it as a hobby,
but the stitching is a bit messy.

295
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,060
Please understand, okay?

296
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,326
In my opinion,
This result is already very good.

297
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,799
It can even make sounds, huh?

298
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:51,940
Nothing special.

299
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:55,208
Just insert a small sound chip
into the doll's stomach.

300
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,742
There is a music sound chip,
even human voices.

301
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,135
Wow, that's so cool.

302
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,663
So-hee! What's wrong?

303
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:10,223
Mi-ri,
I think I found something.

304
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,463
This is just a guess, though. It's not necessarily true.

305
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:16,404
Don't get your hopes up just yet.

306
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,116
There is no harm.

307
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,858
Yes!
This is the recorder I bought!

308
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,310
If hidden so neatly,
there must be something recorded.

309
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,876
Like the sound of
football match broadcast.

310
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:47,793
Maybe this is the day when Mrs. Lee died.

311
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:50,290
Korea vs Japan match day.

312
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,753
I knew you would come.

313
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,316
It was Ji-eun's mother's voice.

314
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,326
I bet in my heart.

315
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,913
If you come to see me,
I won.

316
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,210
But if not,
means you win.

317
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:09,196
It turns out I won, huh.

318
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,847
But the other person's voice
not audible at all.

319
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,141
Yes?

320
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,294
What?

321
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:21,860
I can go there right now.

322
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:24,410
Mi-ri,

323
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:29,283
Yul seems to be able to do it soon
can have a heart transplant.

324
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:31,423
There is a matching donor.

325
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,541
Thank goodness, So-hee.

326
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,795
Mi-ri,
I will contact you again later.

327
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:43,303
- Do you know how to operate it?
- Sure! Hurry up and go!

328
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:45,070
I'm fine. You don't have to go out.

329
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,946
Yes. Thank you, So-hee.

330
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,896
Because I have conclusive evidence,
finally you came alone.

331
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,383
Are you curious?
with the evidence I have?

332
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,321
The decisive evidence.
Let's see what it is.

333
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,447
Kim Hyun-deok...

334
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,883
I don't know what's behind that angel mask
It turns out there was a murderer hiding there.

335
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,523
I was completely fooled.

336
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:18,155
Mom should take a sedative first.
Where is the medicine?

337
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:19,780
Shut up, you murderer!

338
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:23,590
Mother is not conscious.
Where is the medicine, ma'am?

339
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:31,373
Explain everything first.

340
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,429
Wow, why are you here?

341
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,095
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:36,248 --> 00:19:39,275
My father got sick because of this
help fix my water pipe.

343
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:43,475
I felt bad, so I
brought porridge and some side dishes.

344
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:46,288
No need to bother, ma'am.
It will get better if you rest.

345
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:49,913
Come in and rest.
I just put this down for a bit, then went home.

346
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:11,730
I kept the remaining porridge in the refrigerator.

347
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:15,743
Sorry and thank you very much.

348
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:32,496
It's exactly the same
with what Ji-eun bought that day.

349
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,319
What am I thinking?

350
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,544
Time in this world
there is only one pair of scissors like this?

351
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,116
TO LEE MIN-SEON, BLOCK 213 UNIT 1004,
GWANGSEON JUGONG APARTMENT

352
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,050
Good grief.

353
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,343
SENDER: ASSOCIATION OF VICTIMS' FAMILIES

354
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,756
What's this?

355
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:21,343
Mom isn't home yet?

356
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:24,276
Oh, yeah. I want to go home now.

357
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,060
Sorry, I'm bothering you again.

358
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,540
It doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, okay?

359
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,540
Yes thank you.

360
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:46,591
The place where Ji-eun was found
in Deokjin County, Gangwon-do.

361
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:48,930
That's your hometown, right?

362
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:52,306
A remote dam,

363
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,586
five kilometers from your parents' house.

364
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,299
How do you explain
'coincidence' like this?

365
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,300
So, Mom has investigated me?

366
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:01,950
Until I know my hometown
that I didn't even write on my CV?

367
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:02,913
But...

368
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,414
...from the way Mother continues
going round in circles with words,

369
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,086
seems to have not found any evidence yet
that really counts, huh?

370
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:13,010
What?

371
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,613
Is this a curse or destiny?

372
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:28,039
After such a long time,
we meet again like this.

373
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,730
Life is strange, isn't it?

374
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,490
Ji-eun is an amazing child.

375
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,820
He made me like this,
then managed to escape.

376
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:46,250
He is so wild,

377
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,389
that's why hunting them is so satisfying.

378
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:52,330
He is also a great runner.

379
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,260
Even though she's just a little girl,

380
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,393
but at the last second,
he really fought back…

381
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:06,353
His hands and feet are very strong.

382
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:11,896
As a souvenir,

383
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,402
I tied
a beautiful red ribbon around her neck.

384
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,640
The bastard killer, Kim Hyun-deok!

385
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,820
Your daughter looks just like you, doesn't she?

386
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,879
Mrs. Lee!

387
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm going to die here tonight.

388
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:18,836
But the truth...

389
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,210
…will be revealed someday.

390
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,090
Mi-ri,

391
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:25,630
I'm really sorry.

392
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,439
Ms. Ji-eun,

393
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:30,252
now let me
who takes care of everything.

394
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,905
Hyun-ji, wait a little longer, okay?

395
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:39,119
Mi-ri, where are you now?
I'm worried. Please call me, okay?

396
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,700
HAESAN MENTAL HOSPITAL

397
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,380
But where did Mi-ri go?

398
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,617
I was worried because he went by car.

399
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,228
- What?
- Usually when they are close,

400
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:52,980
He just takes the bus or walks, right?

401
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,067
Yes, that's right.

402
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,119
Hello, this is the management office, right?

403
00:25:56,243 --> 00:25:58,330
Is Mr. Kim, the security guard, coming to work today?

404
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:00,696
Yes.

405
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,876
- Why?
- What?

406
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:04,023
- Ji-hyun,
- Yes?

407
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,210
Mr. Kim has resigned.

408
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,020
What?
Oh my god, this is crazy!

409
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:11,593
Gong Mi-ri.

410
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:13,513
Today he must act.

411
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,387
He was on his way to catch the perpetrator.

412
00:26:15,632 --> 00:26:16,539
Yes, that's right.

413
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:17,806
- Let's go too.
- Come on!

414
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,206
What do you mean?
What's wrong with Hyun-ji?

415
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,280
And why did you just say that now?

416
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,646
Because Hyun-ji asked
to be kept secret.

417
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:28,218
Hey, a place to test your courage
Where did Hyun-ji visit?

418
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:31,783
They say that place was once
location of the murder case.

419
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,540
Yes, maybe that's the place.

420
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,663
Mi-ri and her friends' place
been kidnapped before.

421
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,580
NO ENTRY

422
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,903
Hyun-ji. Please,
the important thing is that you are still alive.

423
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:48,268
Please…

424
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,197
Please…

425
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,293
Hyun-ji!

426
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,153
Hyun-ji!

427
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,503
Once you arrive, just go in.

428
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:05,173
Where is my daughter, Hyun-ji?
Tell me where he is.

429
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,006
HAESAN MENTAL HOSPITAL

430
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:13,086
Hyun-ji!

431
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,179
Hyun-ji!

432
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:20,146
Answer, it's Mom!

433
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,046
Park Hyun-ji!

434
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,790
Hyun-ji!

435
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,500
Kim Hyun-deok!

436
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:31,356
Where is my son? Come out!

437
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:35,503
Ms. Hyun-ji, long time no see.

438
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:40,587
A mother's love is extraordinary.

439
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,580
Already knowing I will die,
but still rushed to come.

440
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:47,616
Where is my son?

441
00:27:48,017 --> 00:27:49,435
Where is Hyun-ji now?

442
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,200
Before that,
let's finish our business.

443
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,237
You said you have a voice recorder?

444
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,620
Gwang-gyu told you, right?

445
00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:59,293
Hand it over.

446
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,253
You should know how to return the favor.

447
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,790
Who saved you
from this place first?

448
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,261
Returning the favor?

449
00:28:06,882 --> 00:28:08,416
After killing
Innocent Ji-eun,

450
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,276
you make me live
in a lifetime of guilt...

451
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,620
...and you call that kindness?

452
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,563
I'm not a coward anymore.

453
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:16,779
I am a mother...

454
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,793
...and I have a family
that I must protect!

455
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:21,516
If you want to protect your family,

456
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,620
better give
the recording device now.

457
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,259
I want to know my child's fate first.

458
00:28:26,153 --> 00:28:27,486
Where is Hyun-ji now?

459
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:30,684
This is the video that was recorded
before you arrive.

460
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,237
Please... Help me!

461
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,030
- Mom! Please...
- Hyun-ji! No!

462
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,032
- Mother!
- Oh Lord.

463
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,187
Come on, keep your promise.

464
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:02,072
The bastard killer, Kim Hyun-deok!

465
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:04,115
It seems I underestimated that old lady.

466
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,340
Now tell me, where is Hyun-ji.

467
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,820
Where is my daughter, Hyun-ji?

468
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,883
Pack,

469
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,683
someone asked for this
will be delivered to you soon.

470
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,440
What's that?
From Park So-hee?

471
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,470
So-hee,

472
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:28,510
if something happens to me,
please hand this over to the police.

473
00:29:30,053 --> 00:29:33,243
Thanks to the recording device you bought,
I can leave a copy.

474
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:40,953
Oh my, what is this?

475
00:29:41,006 --> 00:29:43,090
Hello, have you received the recorder yet?
It is done, right?

476
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:44,503
Hurry up!

477
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,013
You should turn on the siren immediately.
and leave now!

478
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:49,115
This is very important!

479
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,349
What is this actually?

480
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:52,256
Kyeong-ja, I just got out
from the police station.

481
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,683
Oh my, So-hee. Thank you very much, okay?

482
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,460
You are on your way
abandoned hospital, right?

483
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,100
I was looking for the address earlier, and it immediately appeared.

484
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,523
But does it make sense,

485
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,049
hospital empty for 20 years
not dismantled either...

486
00:30:02,108 --> 00:30:03,655
...and still left like that?

487
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:06,675
And what makes sense?
Mi-ri went there alone?

488
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:07,906
Yes, it definitely doesn't make sense.

489
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:09,215
That is why...

490
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,014
...we must not let it happen
Mi-ri fights alone.

491
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:13,147
- Yes.
- Let's help.

492
00:30:22,457 --> 00:30:23,746
- Let's go straight there, just the two of us.
- Yes.

493
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:25,469
Gosh, this is really stressful.

494
00:30:25,743 --> 00:30:26,488
Let me drive.

495
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,503
I brought it.

496
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:39,183
Why did you kill him?

497
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:42,420
You said you wouldn't kill Ji-eun.

498
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:46,206
I can't even report it to the police
because you threatened to kill us.

499
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:49,730
I didn't do it.
But you still killed him. Why?

500
00:30:58,597 --> 00:30:59,890
Why did I kill him?

501
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:03,053
Yes, because you didn't do anything.

502
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:06,664
You ran away alone because you were scared,
without doing anything.

503
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:11,810
Think carefully.

504
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,514
The one who killed your friend...

505
00:31:15,112 --> 00:31:17,320
...is it me or you?

506
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:21,759
You murderer!

507
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,306
You are dead!

508
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:32,058
Hyun-ji.

509
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,500
Still as weak.

510
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,940
Your friend before
at least fight to live.

511
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:45,613
You too, do something,
try fighting me!

512
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,267
If it's too easy,

513
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:52,203
I'm actually bored.

514
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:05,277
Well, that's it.

515
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,024
That's just interesting.

516
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,875
You know why I love this place?

517
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,119
Because even though it's burning
or filled with smoke,

518
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:44,773
no one cares.

519
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,340
Once you decide
to enter here,

520
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,356
you will never come out again.

521
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,779
Hide well.

522
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:14,920
Your hair is showing, you know!

523
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,070
That weak girl,

524
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,190
pretty tough now, yeah.

525
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:53,733
Operating room, it fits too.

526
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:10,506
That's Mi-ri's car.

527
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:16,659
Kyeong-ja, I'm scared.

528
00:34:16,712 --> 00:34:20,232
Honestly, we both fought
such a crazy person, how can he do it?

529
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,825
Why don't you invite me along?

530
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,460
- You're coming too, huh?
- So-hee.

531
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,599
How about you
just give up here?

532
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:35,276
The mastermind behind the act
Park Tae-hoon is you, right?

533
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,782
In this situation,
is that all you want to know?

534
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:39,563
Kim Gwang-gyu too
under your control, right?

535
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,860
I can tell you're the one stalking me,

536
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,059
I have a voice recording,
all thanks to Gwang-gyu.

537
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,866
The one who took advantage of my student
it's you.

538
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:52,180
You deliberately put the bait through Gwang-gyu,
provoked me to come to this place.

539
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,529
I know, if you are Ribbon Man,
sooner or later you will move.

540
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:59,183
But you probably wouldn't have thought
I will take your daughter hostage.

541
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:01,877
Finally you are trapped
in your own plans.

542
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,950
Now…

543
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:09,546
Now it's time for you to die.

544
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,072
No.

545
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:13,300
I will not die.

546
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,340
Gong Mi-ri!

547
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:17,939
Mi-ri!

548
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,653
- Mi-ri!
- Gong Mi-ri!

549
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,613
Kyeong-ja?

550
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,586
Kyeong-ja, I'm here!

551
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,780
Kyeong-ja, I'm here!

552
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:25,720
Gong Mi-ri!

553
00:35:28,872 --> 00:35:30,232
- Hammer!
- Hammer!

554
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,986
One two three!

555
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:35,779
- Kyeong-ja?
- What?

556
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,396
- Don't you smell anything strange?
- What smell?

557
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,796
Once again, stronger!

558
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,833
One two three!

559
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,533
Oh, you guys move aside!

560
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:45,736
Watch out! One, two…

561
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,039
Open!

562
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:51,683
- Mi-ri!
- Mi-ri!

563
00:35:53,215 --> 00:35:55,986
Take one more step
and this woman will die by my hands.

564
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:58,989
Mr. Security Guard, no, I mean, Mr. Kim.

565
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,329
Please don't get emotional.

566
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,682
Please listen to us first.

567
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,795
This is a big mistake.

568
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:06,841
Right now, I'm the most calm
all my life.

569
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:08,779
It's you mothers who are panicking.

570
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,420
Okay, okay.
Let's talk this out.

571
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:14,320
How about you
just give up now?

572
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,186
I have been living in peace
more than ten years...

573
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:19,658
...and now you're asking me
surrender?

574
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,706
How does it feel?

575
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,260
In the end you died in my hands too.

576
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:26,981
- He is a total psychopath.
- Oh, Mi-ri.

577
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:29,660
Friends,
please save Hyun-ji.

578
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:30,726
Hyun-ji.

579
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:31,959
Where is Hyun-ji?

580
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:35,311
Please just say it
Where is Hyun-ji? We beg you.

581
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,520
It's so touching.

582
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:39,700
But none of you can
get out of here alive today.

583
00:36:39,753 --> 00:36:40,873
Okay, okay.

584
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:43,020
Look, my hands are empty.

585
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:44,372
Just tell me where Hyun-ji is.

586
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:48,052
If you let go of Mi-ri,
we will go quietly.

587
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:51,272
We won't tell anyone
if we see Kim Hyeon-deok here.

588
00:36:51,297 --> 00:36:53,332
So, please let go.

589
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:54,986
Gong Mi-ri.

590
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:57,850
It's strange, isn't it?
All your friends seem brave.

591
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,780
Ah, you are really
hard to talk to.

592
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,682
Mothers are usually reckless.

593
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,156
And you are indeed looking for death!

594
00:37:14,182 --> 00:37:16,398
- Take this! Damn it!
- Mi-ri!

595
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,280
Ji-hyun, are you okay?

596
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:20,943
Damn it!

597
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,714
- Kyeong-ja, are you okay?
- You are okay?

598
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:52,683
I'm fine, Mi-ri!

599
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,493
Gong Mi-ri.
Hey! Are you okay?

600
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:55,913
You murderer!

601
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,540
Oh, you.

602
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,340
If you are in trouble,
you should say or ask for help.

603
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:03,614
Why are you silent?
and bear it all alone?

604
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,676
- Sorry, Kyeong-ja.
- Oh my God, you are…

605
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,683
Hey, you want to finish a bottle, huh?

606
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:10,115
Ji-hyun, that's enough!

607
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:11,900
Let's go find Hyun-ji.

608
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:12,945
Yes.

609
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:13,943
Hyun-ji!

610
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:16,943
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

611
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,490
What? Security guard. Mr. Kim!

612
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:23,106
Where are you guys going?

613
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:34,068
No one
who will get out of here alive.

614
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:36,816
Watch out!

615
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,775
Go, hurry!

616
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:43,365
- Go away from here!
- Hyun-ji!

617
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,650
According to the regional police, the BTS tower here
too old, so the cellphone signal is difficult.

618
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,373
It's best to wait for the rescue team to arrive.

619
00:38:54,476 --> 00:38:56,313
Inside there is Chu Kyeong-ja, you know?

620
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:57,809
I went in first.

621
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,540
I will give a situation report
from inside. You wait outside.

622
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:03,193
- Wait until the rescue team arrives, sir!
- Don't come in, no matter what happens.

623
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:04,386
- Understand?
- Sir!

624
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:06,023
Wait for help first.

625
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:10,920
Oh my, when will the relief team come?

626
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:18,757
- Ji-hyun, this way.
- Yes.

627
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,960
Hyun-ji!

628
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:24,196
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

629
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:34,336
Just one more step
and your friend dies.

630
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,491
Mi-ri, help me.

631
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:42,615
Here...

632
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:49,491
There isn't any here either.

633
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,605
Come on, wake up.

634
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:53,560
Come on, focus.

635
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,380
Mi-ri, are you okay?

636
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:57,386
Kyeong-ja,

637
00:39:58,132 --> 00:39:59,515
looks like Hyun-ji is here.

638
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,780
What do you mean?

639
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:04,672
Hyun-ji!

640
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,693
Answer, it's Mom! Hyun-ji!!

641
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,252
Wait, be quiet. Listen.

642
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,503
Mother!

643
00:40:11,528 --> 00:40:13,669
- I hear a voice! He's inside!
- Hyun-ji!

644
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:15,356
- Hyun-ji!
- Mother!

645
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:18,183
Mom will save you!

646
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:28,189
How long have they been sent here?
Why hasn't it arrived yet?

647
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,860
Please hurry up. It's urgent!

648
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:32,802
Sorry, you cannot enter this area.

649
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:35,508
Hey, please don't come in here.

650
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,537
- What's this?
- What is really happening here?

651
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:41,507
We came because we were contacted by
the food courier from Gwangseon Jugong!

652
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,394
But what is really going on?

653
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:47,445
My wife and children are in there.
Please do something!

654
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,244
This is dangerous.
Please move away first.

655
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:57,312
Oh my gosh, Jeon Ji-hyun!

656
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,883
Hyun-ji!

657
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:00,010
Geez.

658
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:01,359
Mi-ri!

659
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:02,607
Chu Kyeong-ja!

660
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:05,543
Chu Kyeong-ja!

661
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:09,770
Oh, damn.

662
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,380
Hey, Detective Choi!
Help hasn't arrived yet?

663
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,565
Not yet, sir. It hasn't arrived yet.

664
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,714
- Looks like it will take some more time.
- Good grief.

665
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,509
Then, I'll go in first.

666
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,115
It's too dangerous if you're alone.

667
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:25,635
Don't come in.

668
00:41:25,755 --> 00:41:27,728
Don't move a single step
before I give orders.

669
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,709
If you want to enter, wait and enter
with the firefighters!

670
00:41:31,794 --> 00:41:32,874
Mother...

671
00:41:34,169 --> 00:41:35,016
Kyeong-ja.

672
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,978
You guys go out first.
I'll take care of Hyun-ji.

673
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:38,291
You guys go out first!

674
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:41,755
Hey, if I intend to leave you,
I wouldn't have come this far.

675
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,940
If we continue here,
we will all die!

676
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:44,949
Get out first!

677
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,880
Mother...

678
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,157
Mother...

679
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,026
One two three!

680
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,406
That...

681
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:09,060
Quickly open the door!
Otherwise, the child could die!

682
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:11,116
We'll see once everything is opened.

683
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,702
Open!

684
00:42:12,855 --> 00:42:13,709
Don't!

685
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:15,406
Mi-ri,

686
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:17,499
We have to save Hyun-ji.

687
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:18,906
We definitely can. Understand?

688
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,499
We certainly can!

689
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:24,506
Kim Hyun-deok!

690
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:52,256
Think carefully.

691
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:54,936
Slowly burning to death...

692
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,810
...more painful...

693
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,813
...than to die in my hands.

694
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:02,019
- Kim Hyun-deok!
- Like this!

695
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:05,631
Kyeong-ja!

696
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:17,826
New security guard!

697
00:43:18,036 --> 00:43:19,562
You're not his accomplice?

698
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:21,108
How did you get here?

699
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,536
I installed a tracking device
in his car a few days ago.

700
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:28,047
I didn't expect it either
will be caught first.

701
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:30,659
TWO HOURS AGO

702
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:33,957
Wake up, son.

703
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,078
Gwang-gyu.

704
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:41,815
Wake up.

705
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:48,893
Wake up, okay?

706
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:52,566
Get up!
Hey, wake up!

707
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,396
Wake up.
Wake up, wake up!

708
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,820
Young man, what are you doing?
do with this?

709
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:02,355
How long have I been locked up here?

710
00:44:02,413 --> 00:44:03,993
What?
Locked up?

711
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:08,012
Oh, drink first.
Here, drink this.

712
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:14,659
I'm checking the fire alarm.
and smelled a strange gas smell.

713
00:44:14,684 --> 00:44:16,108
I just opened it and I found you.

714
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,885
Luckily I found you quickly.
That could have been very dangerous.

715
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,660
Teacher... where is he now?

716
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:23,859
Kim Hyun-deok?

717
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:25,706
He resigned today.

718
00:44:26,013 --> 00:44:27,393
You don't know yet?

719
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:34,013
Thank You.
You saved me.

720
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,260
HAESAN MENTAL HOSPITAL

721
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:42,156
Don't you want to go to the hospital first?

722
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:44,329
I...

723
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,722
...have to go to the place
which is a bit far.

724
00:44:48,213 --> 00:44:51,053
Mrs. Misery, I'm the one holding him.
Fast!

725
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:53,420
- The key is with that person!
- Yes.

726
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,627
Mi-ri, hurry!

727
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,971
How does it feel to be treated?
the same from your own students?

728
00:45:03,187 --> 00:45:04,247
Hyun-ji!

729
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:06,741
Mother...

730
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,043
Hyun-ji!

731
00:45:09,379 --> 00:45:12,216
Mother...

732
00:45:15,133 --> 00:45:18,190
Hey, you crazy bastard!
Where is my son?

733
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,880
Where is Hyun-ji?

734
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,370
Answer!

735
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:26,886
Where is he?

736
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,903
Is this place
have a basement?

737
00:45:36,963 --> 00:45:38,043
Mother.

738
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,460
Too late.

739
00:45:39,546 --> 00:45:41,866
You failed, even after
becoming a mother.

740
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,836
Kyeong-ja, I'm going to the basement .

741
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,940
Mi-ri, go!
Run quickly!

742
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,340
Go!
Run quickly!

743
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,863
Die you!

744
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,896
Young security guard!

745
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,016
Are you okay?

746
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:05,256
Finally, I will end
everything now.

747
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:06,805
Kim Hyun-deok!

748
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:09,563
Starting from you...

749
00:47:28,106 --> 00:47:29,085
I can not...

750
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:35,386
...end the hunt like this.

751
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:39,583
Is this what it feels like to hunt...

752
00:47:40,006 --> 00:47:42,092
Talk too much!
You crazy!

753
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:48,940
Chu Kyeong-ja!
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

754
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,676
You should go back to the service.
Fight with a police badge.

755
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,132
Then you...
Can you accept it?

756
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:56,716
My wife almost died.

757
00:47:57,036 --> 00:47:58,355
I'm not the Noh Kang-sik of old anymore.

758
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,625
Ouch...

759
00:48:00,316 --> 00:48:03,035
Oh, Guys.

760
00:48:03,073 --> 00:48:05,713
- Are you okay?
- Why did you just come now?

761
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,873
I'll tie it up first, okay?

762
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,660
Honey! Ji-hyun!
Jeon Ji-hyun!

763
00:48:11,714 --> 00:48:14,270
Ji Hyun!

764
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,843
Oh my, enough! I'm embarrassed, you know.

765
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,823
You shouldn't have asked him to come here.

766
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,030
Jeon Ji-hyun!

767
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:22,579
Ouch…

768
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,715
- Geez.
- Here let me see, here!

769
00:48:25,745 --> 00:48:27,355
I'm fine.
Do not exaggerate.

770
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:30,371
Sir, you can't steal this tool, okay?

771
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,696
I just borrowed it.

772
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:35,930
Take a look at the person first. This is an emergency!

773
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,433
Let me see first.

774
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:40,119
I told you I was fine.
Don't be too dramatic.

775
00:48:42,947 --> 00:48:43,947
Hyun-ji?

776
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,990
Hyun-ji!

777
00:48:55,963 --> 00:48:56,763
Hyun-ji.

778
00:48:56,811 --> 00:48:59,998
Mom will open the door, Hyun-ji!

779
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,253
Hyun-ji.

780
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:04,795
Hang in there, okay?

781
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,820
Mother...

782
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,863
I may fail in many things,

783
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:27,670
but in recognizing Mi-ri's smell,
I'm never wrong.

784
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:28,672
Hyun-ji is in here, right?

785
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,116
Hyun-ji is here...

786
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,726
The key doesn't fit...

787
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:43,860
I'm not a husband
or a great father,

788
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:48,300
but I still
their husbands and fathers.

789
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,730
So, please…

790
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:54,370
Please…

791
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:56,504
Please…

792
00:50:00,576 --> 00:50:01,429
My darling...

793
00:50:02,225 --> 00:50:03,705
Hyun-ji!

794
00:50:04,504 --> 00:50:06,008
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

795
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:07,142
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

796
00:50:07,195 --> 00:50:09,275
Oh, how is this?
What should I do? Oh God.

797
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,556
Hyun-ji, wake up, son.
It's Mom, Honey. Wake up!

798
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:14,983
- Mother...
- Yes, Hyun-ji. Mom is here.

799
00:50:16,353 --> 00:50:17,450
Hyun-ji!

800
00:50:18,303 --> 00:50:20,796
We have to get out now.
Honey, we have to go out! Hurry!

801
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,736
Come here, son.
Just a little bit more. Daddy, will you carry me?

802
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,169
Carry him.

803
00:50:39,048 --> 00:50:40,363
There are still people inside!

804
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:42,425
- There's someone inside.
- Listen to us!

805
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:43,739
Why is no one answering?

806
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:44,727
Ouch...

807
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,260
Oh, my goodness!

808
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,420
In the basement...

809
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:49,647
My friend is still there,
there are still people!

810
00:50:49,674 --> 00:50:50,622
Please save him...

811
00:50:50,702 --> 00:50:52,075
- They're out!
- Yes.

812
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,248
- Gong Mi-ri!
- Mi-ri!

813
00:50:53,294 --> 00:50:55,794
- Over here! Please, there's someone here!
- Come on!

814
00:50:55,854 --> 00:50:57,127
Mi-ri!

815
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:59,579
- That's it! Hurry, hurry!
- Friends!

816
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:05,313
Here, here. This is our child. Our daughter...

817
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,863
Hyun-ji, are you okay?

818
00:51:09,897 --> 00:51:10,943
Now you are safe.

819
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,963
We're going to the hospital.

820
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,580
- Mother?
- Yes...

821
00:51:14,853 --> 00:51:16,453
- Father?
- Yes, son?

822
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:19,316
Then, buy me a new phone, okay?

823
00:51:21,936 --> 00:51:23,915
My cellphone was lost earlier.

824
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,450
Oh my, this kid...

825
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:26,980
We almost died
and what do you think about HP?

826
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,060
- Okay, just buy it.
- Come on, let's go to the hospital first.

827
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:33,116
Noh Kang-sik,

828
00:51:33,597 --> 00:51:36,597
You're afraid I'll die, aren't you?

829
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,282
Scared? Not really.

830
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,414
Hey, Chu Kyeong-ja, did you know?

831
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:44,930
The amulets from my mother he said
to make your life unlucky...

832
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:47,177
...I've been burning it for a long time.

833
00:51:47,956 --> 00:51:50,805
I've replaced the amulet
with prayers for long life,

834
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,774
which I bought using my own money.

835
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:57,198
Let you, my stubborn wife,

836
00:51:57,272 --> 00:51:59,693
can live long beside me.

837
00:52:02,131 --> 00:52:03,609
Wow, the prayer is effective too.

838
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:05,454
Yes.

839
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,877
But somehow, it smells like smoke
makes me want to eat samgyeopsal.

840
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:11,300
How about we
grilling samgyeopsal?

841
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:12,335
And soju too.

842
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:14,576
And the grilled skin too.

843
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,835
- We're coming too.
- We also!

844
00:52:17,863 --> 00:52:20,419
- We all?
- Oh! Of course, come on.

845
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:21,756
I want to eat.

846
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:23,556
Somaek, ready!

847
00:52:25,886 --> 00:52:28,895
It is known that the serial killer
known as Ribbon Man,

848
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,635
the perpetrator of the murder of five women,

849
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,852
including a high school student
the innocent,

850
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:34,513
finally died during the arrest process...

851
00:52:34,538 --> 00:52:36,980
...in an abandoned hospital
in Kyeonggi Province,

852
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:39,812
the location of the kidnapping of the first victim
several years ago.

853
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:42,999
Meanwhile, the police stated
will conduct a re-investigation...

854
00:52:43,023 --> 00:52:46,054
...into a number of other suspected cases
relating to Ribbon Man's crimes,

855
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:48,820
in order to uncover all other crimes
that he might have done.

856
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:55,376
Aunt,

857
00:52:56,323 --> 00:52:57,830
I spent
my life by running,

858
00:52:57,855 --> 00:53:00,083
create fear
as an excuse to hide.

859
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:03,507
But because Auntie never
surrender to the end,

860
00:53:03,862 --> 00:53:05,702
I can also be brave.

861
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:08,446
Forgive me...

862
00:53:09,913 --> 00:53:11,000
...and thank you.

863
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:13,105
Now Auntie can
rest in peace.

864
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,106
Ma'am,

865
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:20,239
Mom is not a bad mother.

866
00:53:22,153 --> 00:53:23,953
For me, Mom is the best mother in the world.

867
00:53:25,173 --> 00:53:29,163
Mother's child will live happily,
more than anyone else.

868
00:53:31,547 --> 00:53:32,627
Look at me from there.

869
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:48,332
The old hunter's last hunt
ended in tragic failure.

870
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,731
After 22 years,

871
00:53:51,298 --> 00:53:52,198
...the perfect victory was achieved by...

872
00:53:52,764 --> 00:53:54,420
...a young girl growing up
become a brave warrior.

873
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,477
However,

874
00:53:57,405 --> 00:53:59,298
is this for real
just one girl's victory?

875
00:54:03,821 --> 00:54:06,086
SALON DE HOLMES

876
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:09,253
The story of an ordinary housewife...

877
00:54:09,285 --> 00:54:11,347
...who managed to catch the killer
even the most cruel chain is highlighted by the media,

878
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,447
and this cafe became very famous.

879
00:54:13,472 --> 00:54:14,403
THREE MONTHS LATER
Thank You.
Good.

880
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:20,060
Excuse me, is the owner there?
I want to consult confidentially.

881
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:22,686
- Manager Kim, we have a guest!
- Ah, please come here.

882
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:25,772
Wait a moment!
You have to order coffee first, okay?

883
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:26,996
Then, just one caffè latte.

884
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,035
Ah, lattes. A good choice.

885
00:54:29,149 --> 00:54:30,900
It turns out, quite a lot of people
around us,

886
00:54:30,939 --> 00:54:32,219
more than I thought,

887
00:54:32,556 --> 00:54:33,976
who wants to seek justice
for the injustice they experienced,

888
00:54:34,076 --> 00:54:35,086
beyond the reach of the law.

00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:44,420
Still in the same office
and she is also a married woman.

892
00:54:45,287 --> 00:54:46,707
I said it wasn't cheating!

893
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,780
At least not yet…

894
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,700
If you want to cheat,
must be caught early.

895
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:59,035
If it passes the critical point,
it's already difficult.

896
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:01,685
The secret of our working method is,

897
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:04,727

We are not ordinary mothers.

898

Wow, there are too many cases piling up.

899
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,550
Starting tomorrow, we will not accept
the affair case first, yeah.

900
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,583
There are many other cases, such as missing elderly people,
insurance fraud, teenager runs away.

901
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:20,133
Oh, we're going to work.
until the feet blister.

902
00:55:20,437 --> 00:55:21,465
So true.

903
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:24,860
Okay, that's it. We're closing for today.
I have to continue working part time.

904
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,080
- Excuse me…
- Do you want to continue?

905
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:29,328
Today there is a special discount

906
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:30,316
Yes, I want to.

907
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:31,983
Pay in advance, okay!

Okay, then.

I?

911
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:42,260
Looks like I managed to get it again
my peaceful and precious life.

912
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,986
Somehow, living in an apartment
It turns out it suits me too.

913
00:55:45,786 --> 00:55:47,788
The medicine I prescribed at that time
it's finished, right?

914
00:55:48,733 --> 00:55:51,855
I don't think I need it
That medicine again, Doctor.

915
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:55,755
Everything that has been pressing me down
I've finished it.

916
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,431
That's why I came today
not for medical treatment,

917
00:56:00,654 --> 00:56:02,120
but to say thank you.

918
00:56:02,183 --> 00:56:04,006
Ah, no need for thanks.

919
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:06,581
All this is because of Mother herself
who managed to overcome it.

I'll go first, okay?

923
00:56:14,781 --> 00:56:16,065
- Yes.
- Yes, be careful!

924
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,272
- Sports uniform!
- Oh, I told you,

925
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:19,992

Park Hyun-ji!

926

- I'm leaving, okay?
- Nothing is missing, right?

927
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,111
Yes, there isn't any.

00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:39,754
He was rushed
to the nearest hospital emergency room,

932
00:56:39,788 --> 00:56:42,813
but eventually died.

933
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:44,261

Narcotics and psychotropics.

936
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,590
Police are now tracking
distribution channels of the drugs.

MIN-EUM PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC PHARMACY

938
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:56,920
However, there are monsters that live

This time it's really a case
that's worth addressing, right?

943
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,020
I'm tired of looking for dogs, I swear.

944
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,925
Yes, let's start handling the case

Yes, everyone has gathered,

946
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:09,860
- so we can start discussing the case, right?
- Yes.

947
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:13,586
Yes, this time it feels different.

948
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:25,020

Yes, you crazy mothers
from the supermarket at that time.

955
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:43,860
Yang-hee, are you out of prison?

956
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,990
- Wow!
- Wow!

957
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:50,859
- Extraordinary!
- Oh my, is this a dream or reality?

958
00:58:50,884 --> 00:58:53,466
Your appearance becomes more charming.

959
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:57,955
But wait.
Isn't the sentence still a long way off?

960
00:58:58,027 --> 00:59:02,117
Special remission.
I'm a model prisoner, you know?

961
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:08,459
Thanks to your help too,
My son, Jae-hoon, is growing up well.

962
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,236

I use it for investment,

963
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,005

969
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,140
but together, these mothers
become many times braver.

970
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:31,463

new cases with enthusiasm.

981
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:11,520
