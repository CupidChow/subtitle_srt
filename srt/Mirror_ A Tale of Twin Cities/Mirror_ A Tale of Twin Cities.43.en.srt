3
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,380
Zhi Zhe came to find me. I agreed.

4
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,590
Yu Huan, he's slowly absorbing your will right now! Don't be fooled by him.

5
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,280
You've exposed Puojun. If you're bewitched by Zhi Zhe,

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,320
then there will be no peace in Yunhuang anymore and more innocent people will be dragged into this.

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,540
Is this what you want?

8
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,050
I want to renounce this entire world!

9
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,770
You injured Bai Ying.

10
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,610
If you had come a little later, you wouldn't have been able to see her again.

11
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,680
Why is my injury slowly recovering?

12
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,610
Do you think, after obtaining the power of Zhi Zhe,

13
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,290
you can do whatever you want?

14
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,010
Do you think I'm a failure?

15
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,460
If not, then?

16
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,890
Life cannot be repeated. You must do the right thing.

17
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,960
But can't I win, not even once?

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,190
It's not about having to win.

19
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,830
7,000 years ago,

20
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,770
Chun Huang sowed discord between mine and A'Wei's relationship.

21
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,190
7,000 years later, you are here again to ruin my plan.

22
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,670
Preposterous. You are clearly committing evil deeds in the name of love.

23
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,000
You used Bai Wei as an excuse to seize the wealth of the Quanxian

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,980
and to imprison and enslave Quanxian's ancestors. In fact, you only actually expanded your own ambitions.

25
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,210
So what?

26
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,050
I want to create a new order.

27
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,930
Was your so-called creation of a new order to help Cangliu eliminate Kongsang a century ago

28
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,860
and make it so the 100,000 innocent people of Kongsang would be unable to see the sun again!

29
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,450
I want to tear apart everything in Yunhuang!

30
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,990
What do you think Yunhuang is?

31
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,990
What do you take the world for?

32
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,400
Zhi Zhe, no, Lang Gan,

33
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,810
who do you think you are?

34
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,970
I'm the from the Deity Clan of Yunfu City.

35
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,120
You aren't fit to call yourself a deity.

36
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,580
You bewitch people and harm commoners.

37
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,410
You are a devil who should be punished by the people!

38
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,220
Although you have the power of the dragon deity, you are not the dragon deity.

39
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,270
Although I'm not a deity,

40
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,460
I can still seal you!

41
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,270
Even if I have to use all of my power.

42
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,320
In my entire life,

43
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,900
today is probably the only day I can reverse fate.

44
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,590
Even if the stars fall and the earth perishes,

45
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,240
nothing can stop me.

46
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,820
Give up. You can't change fate.

47
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,180
I won't let you escape again!

48
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,440
To prevent the power of Zhi Zhe from escaping again,

49
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,820
we must seal the combined powers of Yu Huan and Zhi Zhe.

50
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,100
Once they show up again, all of Yunhuang will be in chaos again.

51
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,910
What about the Splitting Sword?

52
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,820
Seal them together under Jing Lake.

53
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,920
The Splitting Sword has already sealed the power of Zhi Zhe.

54
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,330
I believe it will be hard for him to escape again.

55
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,450
The power of the emperor has awakened. Wuse City can be opened now.

56
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,960
Next, we must find a solution to prevent you from being turned to ash.

57
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,480
Actually, I'm not bothered by this anymore.

Thank you all for sealing Zhi Zhe.

Yunhuang is our homeland.

64
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,730
We should naturally work to protect its peace.

65
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,670
Zhen Lan, now you can open Wuse City

66
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,110
and wake up the 100,000 people of Kongsang

from their deep sleep.

Open Wuse City? Then, the six princes...

69
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,180
Lift up your heads and take a look.

That's right.

73
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,660
Is it because we sealed Zhi Zhe?

74
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
You've changed your own fates after all.

75

Go on then.

84
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,770
what the third prophecy for me is.

85
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,570
You no longer have a third prophecy.

86
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,590
You have already rewritten your destiny.

87

You know about this as well?

The moment that spell was formed,

93
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,400
in that instant,

94

yours and Bai Ying's destinies

Have you heard of the Sea Oath of Star Soul?

165
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,450
Kongsang's forbidden arts.

166
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,510
It can reverse life and death.

167
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,690
But the price is...

168
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,530
To live and die with that person.

169
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,680
Enjoy life together,

170
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,030
but if one person dies,

171
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,950
the other person cannot live.

172
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,610
Master,

173
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,160
I would like to seek your help to cut the blood tie.

174
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,650
Sealing Zhi Zhe

175
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,700
has already exhausted all of my power.

176
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,870
I don't have much time left.

177
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,290
Cut off the connection of the Sea Oath of the Star Soul between Bai Ying and me.

178
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,100
Let her possess

179
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,480
a complete life.

180
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,210
I've called everyone here today

181
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,570
because I have an important matter to announce.

182
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,690
Starting today,

183
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,510
I will abdicate from the throne as Emperor of the Sea.

184
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,910
To all the gods in Yunhuang,

185
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,570
the sun, moon, and stars in nine heavens,

186
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,920
the Lord of Seven Seas offers his most noble blood

187
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,500
in exchange for your blessing.

188
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,230
My duty has always been to take everyone back to Biluo Sea.

189
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,620
Now that I've completed this duty,

190
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,890
I should step down as well.

191
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,800
Young Master!

192
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,060
Once the choice has been made,

193
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,780
there's no going back.

194
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,260
Emperor of the Sea, once this spell takes effect,

195
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,710
you will gradually...

196
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,180
lose your power and life.

197
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,240
Quanxian will be temporarily governed by the Commissioner of the Left, Yan Xi.

198
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,300
If you trust him,

199
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,900
you can support him as Emperor of the Sea.

200
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,810
If someone else is more suitable,

201
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,170
you can make your own decision.

♫ Give birth to blue branches ♫

203
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,450
Yan Xi, I'm entrusting the Quanxian to you from now on.

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,840
You must keep it strong.

Na Sheng, when the time comes, naturally I'll need to go.

your last wish?

212
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,710
I wish for our love to last forever

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,400
Please help him fulfill his wish

You can't go. Young Master doesn't allow you to tell Princess Bai.

- I'm not going to listen to him!
- Stop causing trouble!

225
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,720
I'm not creating trouble. If we wait until the day she finds out,

226
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,590
she will be sad and die from regret!

231
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,320
In order to seal Zhi Zhe, you exhausted all your power.

232
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,030
Also, in order to not burden Bai Ying, you decided to cut the blood tie.

233
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,100
Emperor of the Sea,

234
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,590
you...

235
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,810
Is it over?

236
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,410
The cutting of the blood tie is over.

237
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,140
That's good.

238
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,450
Dragon Deity,

239
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,310
are you here to pick me up?

240
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,620
I'm here to take you home.

241
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,800
I have a request.

242
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,310
Speak.

243
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,010
I hope that...

244
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,930
you will transform me into rain...

245
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,930
and sprinkle me over the land of Yunhuang.

246
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,310
You want to transform into rain

247
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,470
to rejuvenate Yunhuang.

248
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,890
This is the last thing I can do for Yunhuang.

249
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,560
In this way, Su Mo will no longer exist.

250
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,600
It's no longer important.

251
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,610
Emperor of the Sea, you are now transformed into mist.

252
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,680
No one can see you again.

253
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,180
You will soon vanish

254
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,750
and transform into rain.

255
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,320
Don't worry.

256
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,660
Everything will be as you wished.

257
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,010
Are you taking me to Tianque?

258
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,650
That's the place where we first reunited a century ago.

259
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,410
Do you still remember the scene back then?

260
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,180
Of course, I do.

261
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,280
Back then, I couldn't believe what was happening in front of me.

262
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,700
Going down memory lane.

263
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,900
I'm bringing you here to see it again.

264
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,950
I'll tell you a secret.

265
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,930
When I first saw you after a century,

266
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,160
I saw that you were already reborn.

267
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,670
I thought you had fallen in love with another lady.

268
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,830
You know I care about you. Can you tell me the truth?

269
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,950
Tell you the truth about what?

270
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,160
The Sea Oath of the Star Soul,

271
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,500
if one is injured,

272
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,190
the other person can feel it as well.

273
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,350
You are obviously getting weaker and weaker.

274
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,520
I'm not getting weaker. After the battle,

275
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,620
I haven't yet fully recovered.

276
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,020
Stop lying to me.

277
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,070
Are you not willing to tell me the truth even up to the last moment?

278
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,440
Even if it's the final moment,

279
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,250
I still won't tell you.

280
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,780
Didn't you always say,

281
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,460
never to give up until the final moment?

282
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,530
I want to use the Sun Blocking Pearl to return your spiritual consciousness back to you,

283
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,800
but the High Priest told me that I can't return it.

284
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,090
I don't blame you.

285
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,390
Su Mo! Su Mo! Su Mo!

286
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,630
I've already severed the Sea Oath of Star Soul.

287
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,200
You can have a new life...

288
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,070
and start a new life in Yunhuang.

289
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,200

But from today onward,

327
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,620
I may have to break my promise.

328
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,640
Promise me!

329
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,610
Even without me,

330
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,460
you must continue to live happily.

331
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:28,250
♫ But to be brave enough to hold back tears ♫

332
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,950
Bai Ying, remember this.

333
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,570
You must forget.

334
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,380
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

335
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:48,100
♫ Yet you tell me to forget the memories ♫

336
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:54,610
♫ I quietly listen to the story starting at the beginning ♫

337
00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:01,470
♫ Why must deep love be greedy and long for such words? ♫

338
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:08,150
♫ Unforgettable longing is like wind and the snow
is like cherry blossoms ♫

339
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:14,840
♫ It seems that your footsteps are light ♫

340
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,220
♫ In my dream is you ♫

341
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,140
♫ Awake from my dreams, I wait for you ♫

342
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:29,600
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

343
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:38,980
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

344
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,460
Every year, on the fifteenth of the tenth month,

345
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,120
I will return with the tide to Yunhuang, to see you.

346
00:34:52,130 --> 00:35:00,830
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

347
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,810
Brother Crown Prince, is it fun being the King of Kongsang?

348
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,710
Did Uncle Xi Jing return from Taoyuan Province?

349
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,300
Zhi Xiu went to Jing City to find Sister Hong Yuan.

350
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,800
They should have met up with each other again.

351
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,780
Life here in Quanxian is different from what I imagined.
[Bilou Sea]

352
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,670
Everyone is so carefree.

353
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,500
Every day, at sunrise and sunset,

354
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,630
they sing. They are extremely happy.

355
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,320
I have more time researching herbs every day

356
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,500
and have improved a lot. I'll record all of it

357
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,680
and will later send it to you in Yunhuang.

358
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,100
So that the people of Yunhuang won't suffer from the pain of illnesses.

359
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,380
- Chase me!
- Give it back to me!

360
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,150
By the way, about this sea conch,

361
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,410
talk to it if you have anything you want to say.

362
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,720
You must keep it safe.

363
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,030
"The mountains and rivers are forever silent."

364
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,270
It has been three years.

365
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,870
That year, in the Heavenly King's mausoleum,

366
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,140
I finally understand the meaning of this phrase.

367
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,040
As an emperor, you are destined to endure loneliness.

368
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,170
It seems like I have everything,

369
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,580
but also have nothing left.

370
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,590
Your Majesty, what you have,

371
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,050
may not necessarily be what's by your side.

372
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,820
A'Ying, after this last farewell,

373
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,220
I don't know when we will meet again.

374
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,230
Before you leave, let's have a drink.

375
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,870
All right.

376
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,180
This century, all the stories you told me about Yunhuang,

377
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,260
I remember all of them in my heart and haven't forgotten a single one.

378
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,870
After I leave, no no one will tell you them anymore.

379
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,740
A'Ying,

380
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,280
it seems like...

381
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,070
after all this time, this is the first time

382
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,150
we've sat like this to chat and drink.

383
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,130
Perhaps...

384
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,000
this is the last time.

385
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,780
I'm really happy

386
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,350
to finally be able to live the life I want.

387
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,260
Wearing a sword and traveling around the world.

388
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,030
What about you, Your Highness?

389
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,790
Do you have a life you want to live?

390
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Right now is how I want to live my life.

391
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,110
Yes, you're right.

392
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,500
Xi Jing, don't go back.

393
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,450
Stay here.

394
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,360
Your Majesty,

395
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,490
today... is the fifteenth day of the tenth month.

396
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,250
That's right.

397
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,200
That year when Su Mo

398
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,980
obtained the power of the dragon deity and sealed Zhi Zhe,

399
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,080
in order to thank him, the people established the Sea Deity Festival.

400
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,160
And gave him the honorific title of

401
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,720
Sea Deity of Bilou Sea.

402
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,560
In the blink of an eye, three years have already gone by.

403
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,530
Will the Sea Deity...

404
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,270
come back at all?

Su Mo, after you left,

everyone has respected you as the Sea Deity of Bilou Sea.

430
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,530
Every year, on the fifteenth of the tenth month,

the people come to the seaside to watch the tides and view the scenery.

Only I know that

this is the day we promised each other.

434
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,710
However, it has been already three years.

435
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,120
You have never appeared.

436

Do you know that I'm waiting for you?

437

Su Mo,

438

you gave me the rest of your life.

439
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,260
I will also use the rest of my life

♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

479
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,640
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

480
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,730
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

481
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:22,930
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
