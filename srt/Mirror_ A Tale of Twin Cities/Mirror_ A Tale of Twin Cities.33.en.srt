[Episode 33]

3
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,120
Did you hear that sound?

4
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,350
Stranded Dragon Abyss is right up ahead.

5
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,380
We have to hurry and break the dragon deity seal.

6
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,660
Otherwise, when the Cangliu arrive, it will be much harder to deal with.

7
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,260
Okay, let's go.

8
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,360
[Cangyu Province]

9
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,220
At the time, I wasn't paying attention, I thought we were arresting someone with a weapon.
[Cangyu Province]

10
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,960
They didn't have any weapons so we let them into the city.

11
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,550
Please forgive me, General Yu.

12
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm still a step too late...

13
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,760
The city guards were negligent in their duties.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,480
Punish according to military code.

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,870
General Yu, it isn't because we were negligent.

16
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,090
The moment I realized they were the two on the arrest warrants—
- Take him away.

17
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,060
General Yu. General Yu!

18
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,710
This punishment is too severe!

19
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,260
They didn't let just anyone get away. It was the Emperor of the Sea.

20
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,680
Bai Ying and Su Mo have already arrived.

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,970
They will definitely go straight to the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

22
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,700
Then, what should we do next?

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Take your soldiers and head immediately for the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

24
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,840
Remember, take the mountain path by the river.

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,390
Don't touch any source of water.

26
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,060
Why?
- I have my reasons.

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,490
How about you?

28
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,220
I'll come later.

29
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,740
Yes, General Yu.

30
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,230
Everyone, listen up!

31
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,340
Immediately follow me to the Stranded Dragon Abyss to capture the Emperor of the Sea!

32
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,110
Yes, Sir!

33
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,440
General Yu, why are we staying?

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,310
You stay here. Don't follow me.

35
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,630
[Stranded Dragon Abyss]

36
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,460
This is Stranded Dragon Abyss?

37
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,550
Back in the day, King Xing Zun captured the Dragon God

38
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,740
and cut a line in the ground.

39
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,400
He locked the Dragon God here.

40
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,410
I can feel a surge of anger.

41
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,390
The power of despair.

42
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,790
Through thousands of years, no one has been able to break the barrier.

43
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,420
I'll go first. You wait here.

44
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,750
No, we already talked about this.

45
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,390
He's poisoning the river?

46
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,310
Su Mo, no matter how fast you swim,

47
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,830
it can't be faster than this river.

48
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,380
This poison acts too quickly.

49
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,900
The poison is so potent although I should be fine after taking the antidote.

50
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,900
General Yu, what's wrong?

51
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,650
Yunhuang's rare poison, Algae of Red Ghost.

52
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,930
You were just poisoned?

53
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,480
I have the antidote.

54
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,120
I told you not to follow me. Why didn't you obey?

55
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,530
I was worried about you.

56
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,930
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,010
Do not enter the water. It's poisoned with the Algae of Red Ghost.

58
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,220
Someone's over there. I'll go check it out.

59
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,850
Don't worry about it. If you touch the water, it'll hurt you.

60
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,440
Let's go.

A'Ying!

62
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,730
As we were coming down, the fog was causing me to hallucinate.

63
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,250
Don't worry, I'm here.

64
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,520
Strange... Why can't we find the lock?

65
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
Let's split up and search.

66
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,240
A'Ying.

67
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,350
Remember.

[Cangyu Province]

69
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,820
We've already arrived at the Cangyu Province boundary.

70
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,470
The path ahead is heavily guarded. Let's use the water route.

71
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,330
Should we wait for the Left Commissioner and the others?

72
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,970
Rest awhile. If Yanxi hasn't made it by then, we move without him.

73
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,310
It's all that Central Plains girl's fault. She's not familiar with water, yet still tags along.

74
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,300
- Otherwise, it'd be so much quicker if we could take the water route.
- Out of line.

75
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,960
Let's not wait anymore. Into the water.

76
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,930
Yanxi knows the route.

77
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,300
Right Commissioner, there are cracks on the sound pearl from Xiao's transmission.

78
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,060
I don't know if there's still any sound.

[Cangyu Province]

80

Don't...

81
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,520
Don't...

82
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,260
It's Xiao's voice.

83
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,150
But I only heard "don't."

84
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,780
Was Mo Xiaofei discovered while transmitting the pearl

85
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,000
so the sound pearl was damaged.

86
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,020
It's possible.

87
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,540
Maybe she's trying to warn us not to go to the Stranded Dragon Abyss?

88
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,960
Then wouldn't Young Master be in a lot of danger?

89
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,630
Then let's take the water route.

90
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,240
Let's go.

91
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,090
Yan Xi, we have been following the markers left by Ning Liang.

92
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,460
Why haven't we bumped into them yet?

93
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,090
Could something have happened to them?

94
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,190
That couldn't be. Let's just speed up.

95
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,810
All right.

96
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,650
- How do you feel?
- Much better.

97
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,740
Ning Liang!

98
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,470
Yan Xi!

99
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,860
- Ning Liang.
- What's going on?

100
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,240
We've been poisoned.

101
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,880
Cangliu set up a checkpoint here

102
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,120
and forced us into the water. They threw something toxic into the water.

103
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,190
- What kind of poison is this? It's too cruel!

104
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,600
This should be the Algae of Red Ghost.

105
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,270
Algae of Red Ghost?

106
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,200
What happens after being poisoned?

107
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,480
This poison is in the water.

108
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,610
When anyone goes into the water, they come into contact with the poison.

109
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,700
Their bodies will petrify and they'll die from the pain.

110
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,780
Right now, from the look of it, all the water in Cangyu Province has this poison in it.

111
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,750
The people of Cangliu are too cruel.

112
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,350
Is there an antidote for this poison?

113
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,290
The person who did this must have the antidote.

114
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,990
Let's go then.

115
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,290
What's wrong?

116
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,800
We have spies in Cangliu's military camp.

117
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,470
Why didn't we receive any information?

118
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,110
I received a sound pearl from Xiao,

119
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,260
but the sound pearl was damaged.

120
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,530
All right. I'll definitely get the antidote.

121
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,990
Let's go.

122
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,360
Be careful. Sit over here.

123
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,040
Why is this fog still not clearing?

124
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,280
Emperor of the Sea, save us.

125
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,510
Save us! Save us!

126
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,520
Emperor of the Sea!

127
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,310
Emperor of the Sea. Emperor of the Sea!

128
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,340
Emperor of the Sea, the King of Kongsang has killed his way to the Bilou Sea already.

129
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,550
He said... He said that Princess Ya Ran poisoned Queen Bai Wei.

130
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,730
He said he'd flatten Quanxian to get revenge for the wueen.

131
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,580
If you want to use an army to suppress others, why send an army without a name?

132
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,970
Was that an illusion just now?

133
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,810
Why does it seem so real?

134
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,490
Su Mo!

135
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,200
Su Mo!

136
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,930
Su Mo, is that you?

137
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,760
Su Mo.

138
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,370
Su Mo, did you find Stranded Dragon Abyss?

139
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,430
The fog here is very strange.

140
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,870
Let's look for Stranded Dragon Abyss now.

141
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,490
Su Mo,

142
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,990
did you sense me because I knocked twice on the Sunlight Blocking Pearl?

143
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,970
That's why you came to find me?

144
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Yes. Let's go.

145
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,810
You aren't Su Mo.

146
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,920
Who are you? Why are you impersonating him?

147
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,290
I'm Su Mo.

148
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,510
Without the dragon deity's protection,

149
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,380
from now on, the Quanxian will

150
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,550
obey for generations to come.

151
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,240
If you kill the Quanxian today,

152
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,070
Kongsang will be destroyed later by others.

153
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
This constant going back and forth,

154
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,510
when will it stop?

155
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,370
What are you doing?

156
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,780
You are no longer the A'Lang that I used to know.

157
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,940
The kind astrologer A'Lang who grew up with me.

158
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,560
You've turned into the Heavenly King that I don't know anymore.

159
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,700
I'll return this Earth Ring

160
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,650
to you.

161
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,920
The Earth Ring belongs to the queen!

162
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,450
How can we own Heaven and Earth?

163
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,510
For generations, the seven seas have been the home of the Quanxian.

164
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,720
Yuhuang is the home of many lives.

165
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,170
How could it belong only to you?

166
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,780
Stop with this obsession!

167
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,810
Let me go!

168
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,370
Who are you exactly?

169
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,210
I am you.

170
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,470
Are you an illusion or something else?

171
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,630
I'm not an illusion.

172
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,630
I'm the one who came to end you.

173
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,060
Today, I shall take back everything that belongs to me.

174
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,410
Su Mo!

175
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,830
Bai Ying!

176
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,950
Bai Ying!

177
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,890
Who was that?

178
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,990
He knows the shape-changing technique.

179
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,910
It appears that he was waiting for us on purpose.

180
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,720
Could he be someone sent by Lord Zhi Zhe?

181
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,970
I'm not sure.

182
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,280
Anyway, this place is very strange.

183
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,020
It always has delusional illusions.

184
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,440
Just now, I was also caught up in an illusion from life in the past.

185
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,580
Illusion from life in the past?

186
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,970
I saw that over 7,000 years ago,

187
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,820
the Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei were here at the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

188
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,170
I also saw how Queen Bai Wei...

189
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,320
died.

190
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,080
What was the story in the illusion?

191
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,270
Queen Bai Wei was...

192
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,750
was murdered.

193
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,740
But I didn't see the final result yet.

194
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,630
Maybe this was an illusion, too.

195
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,650
You are saying that you saw Queen Bai Wei.

196
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,910
Did Queen Bai Wei resemble me?

197
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes.

198
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,590
No wonder. Previously at the Jing Pagoda,

199
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,990
Zhi Zhe called me A'Wei.

200
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,140
Not only that, Zhen Lan and the Heavenly King,

201
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,740
Chun Huang and I, we all look exactly the same.

202
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,450
Looks like the Stranded Dragon Abyss didn't only seal the dragon deity,

203
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,320
but also concealed secrets from 7,000 years ago.

204
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,520
In your opinion, we look so much like them,

205
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,870
do you think there is

206
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,100
some mysterious connection between us and them?

207
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,210
Bai Ying, you are you.

208
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,890
Even if the two people resemble each other,

209
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,990
you are still two different people.

210
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,920
You have different fates. Without knowing the truth yet,

211
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,680
don't get lost in anything that happens here.

212
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,530
What's the matter with you?

213
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,420
Bai Ying isn't safe here.

214
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,490
If she is really related to Bai Wei...

215
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's go.

216
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,910
[Cangyu Province - Cangliu Military Camp]

217
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,450
[Stranded Dragon Abyss]

218
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,110
Even though we are superior and subordinate, we don't need to be so rigidly formal.

219
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,730
Is the Algae of Red Ghost your handiwork?

220
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,300
It has nothing to do with her. She spends all day with you. I have never had a chance to speak with her.

221
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,470
You can leave.

222
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,930
Yes.

223
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,560
Who told you?

224
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,190
Many people have seen merpeople corpses by the riverside that were already petrified.

225
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,630
That's only what the merpeople in the camp said.

226
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,510
Yu Huan!

227
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,310
When we were young, I was simply a little young master who bullied servants all day long in the mansion.

228
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,520
A... playboy. You harshly disciplined me, hit me, and woke me up.

229
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,940
- That's why I followed you into Ruosong Hall to become a Cangliu warrior.
- Get to the point.

230
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,320
The point is that you disdain such crude tricks as poisoning.

231
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,440
Why have you changed...

232
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,390
from the Yu Huan that I used to admire.

233
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,190
Just be yourself. You don't need to admire me. I haven't changed, either.

234
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,220
You have changed!

235
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,620
In the past, when you'd watch Nan Zhao slaughter merpeople, you would've helped them as I would.

236
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,630
Do you know how many innocent lives will be killed by the Algae of Red Ghost?

237
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,440
Innocent?

238
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,620
Fei Lian...

239
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,700
those people are our enemies.

240
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,190
Su Mo has already obtained the Splitting Sword.

241
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,340
What? Are you going to wait until he calls out the dragon deity?

242
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,220
You can either formulate battle strategies with me

243
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,310
or if you don't want to,

244
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,860
go patrol the camp.

245
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,200
I'll go patrol then.

246
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,130
Why are there so many guards?

247
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,560
How are we going to get in later?

248
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,990
I'll help you divert their attention, and you can enter invisibly.

249
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,230
It's you. You're Ting's older sister.

250
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,180
Are you all right?

251
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,620
Yu Huan poisoned the river with the Algae of Red Ghost.

252
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,490
I sent a message to you, why are you still going into the water?

253
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,600
Ning Liang received the sound pearl, but it was damaged.

254
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,450
We didn't receive the complete message.

255
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,060
No wonder. I was going to distract Fei Lian while he was drunk

256
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,830
and send out the message again.

257
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,620
- Then... where is the antidote?
- It's with Yu Huan.

258
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,750
Yu Huan? Doesn't that make it more difficult?

259
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,640
I have an idea, but you both must coordinate with me.

260
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,430
What's your idea?

261
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,330
Guards! I caught a spy!

262
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,070
- How come it is him?
Hurry. If Fei Lian gets closer,

263
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,020
you won't be able to get away.

264
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,210
Xiao!

265
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,910
Xiao!

266
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,630
- What happened?
- I still pushed Xiao into the water.

267
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,800
She should have been poisoned by the Algae of Red Ghost.

268
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,280
It's not easy to fool Yu Huan.

269
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,820
If you didn't do it for real

270
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,590
with other people as witnesses, Yu Huan wouldn't believe it at all.

271
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,230
But this time, it's for real and there are witnesses.

272
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,150
Fei Lian seemed to have seen me.

273
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,570
Fei Lian? Are you sure he saw you clearly?

274
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,140
I don't know, but I could see him clearly.

275
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,870
Would he think that Xiao and I are on the same side, acting to trick them to get the antidote?

276
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,840
Oh no, oh no! The effort was all wasted and Xiao got injured for nothing.

277
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,370
Don't worry just yet. Even if Fei Lian saw you clearly,

278
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,520
he might not think it's a scheme.

279
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,100
Besides, the way Cangliu people see it, Xiao is a Quanxian traitor.

280
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,320
It makes sense that you would hurt her.

281
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,250
Right now, we can only wait patiently to see what happens.

282
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,050
Yu Huan, you have the antidote. Hurry and give it to Xiao!

283
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,310
What happened exactly?

284
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,410
I caught a spy.

285
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,960
I was going to bring her to the camp,

286
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,820
but, unexpectedly, she pushed me into the river... and escaped.

287
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,780
Did you see the spy clearly?

288
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,170
I didn't get a chance to look at her clearly, she kept struggling.

289
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,650
How about you? Did you see clearly?

290
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,550
I only vaguely saw a woman. She was probably a merperson who was scouting the route.

291
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,420
Merperson?

292
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,170
How can a merperson escape so easily from under your eyes?

293
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,010
That merperson ran really fast.

294
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,770
Besides, Xiao fell into the water and I needed to save her.

295
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,720
Other than me, there were a lot of soldiers who saw Xiao get pushed into the river.

296
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,580
Guards.

297
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,070
Yes, sir.

298
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,450
Did any of you see Xiao being pushed into the water by a spy?

299
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,380
General, I saw it with my own eyes. Xiao caught a spy,

300
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,700
that spy pushed Xiao into the water and then suddenly disappeared.

301
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,540
The other patrol units also saw it and can testify.

302
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,780
Disappeared? What do you mean?

303
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,550
That spy knows some magic, that's why Xiao couldn't overcome her and was pushed into the water.

304
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,980
- You may leave.
- Yes.

305
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,200
What? You don't even believe me anymore?

306
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,330
You've always been sympathetic toward the enemy.

307
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,410
Are you saying that Xiao and I colluded

308
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,080
to cheat you out of the antidote for the Algae of Red Ghost?

309
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,290
Even if so, I wouldn't have injured Xiao this way!

310
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,910
General, I'm incapable.

311
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,950
You don't need to waste the antidote on me. I'm willing to suffer.

312
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,020
Xiao is your subordinate! She's fought alongside you.

313
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,530
Can you really stand by to watch her die from the torment of the Algae of Red Ghost?

314
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,500
Life and death are fated.

315
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,970
General Fei Lian, I am grateful to you,

316
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,650
but you need not plead for me.

317
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,940
Here.

318
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,850
Xiao, Fei Lian said that I've changed...

319
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,780
and have become more heartless.

320
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,390
Is this true?

321
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,010
General, you've never changed.

322
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,120
Maybe you're the ones who've changed?

323
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,300
I... haven't changed, either.

324
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,560
I hope so.

325
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,660
Come on out.

326
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,830
Let's go.

327
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,650
You are here for the antidote, right?

328
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,180
How did you know?

329
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,670
I'm not stupid. I saw your face clearly,

330
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,580
but Xiao insisted that she didn't. So you're all in this together.

331
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,870
Where is Xiao?

332
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,150
She is seriously injured, but she's taken the antidote, so she should be fine.

333
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,110
You should hurry and leave. If people show up later, there'll be trouble.

334
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,630
What about you? If Yu Huan discovers that there's less medicine, he'll surely investigate.

335
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm a general in Cangliu, and we have a bond from growing up together.

336
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,020
He shouldn't harm a friend.

337
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:10,050
Then... what about Xiao?

338
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,890
Don't worry. I'll protect her.

339
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,250
Thanks.

340
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,140
Go! I'll be here.

341
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,510
You know the invisibility spell. Hurry and leave.

342
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,400
Fei Lian, I'm sorry.

343
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,860
Hurry and go!

344
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,010
Don't come any closer. If you come closer, I'll kill him!

345
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,840
Put down all your weapons.

346
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,180
Fei Lian.

347
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,720
You said that I've changed, but actually, you are the one who's changed.

348
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,800
Yan Xi, run!

349
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,520
Yu Huan, we haven't had a good fight in a while.

350
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,980
Who wants to have a good fight with you?

351
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,250
Is that the Stranded Dragon Platform?

352
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,180
It should be.

353
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,790
Your back...

354
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,230
This is the mark of the dragon deity.

355
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,850
The dragon deity should be close by. I can feel it.

356
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,350
What's wrong?

357
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,050
I feel...

358
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:25,030
I feel like there's someone watching us.

359
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,150
Watching us?

360
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,710
Seems like he has a lot to say.

361
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,490
I can feel his existence.

362
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,370
Who is he?

363
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,310
I don't know.

364
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,990
No matter what happens, you have to tell me right away.

[Dragon Silk Palace]

368
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,030
Why can't I speak?

369
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,240
And I can't move my body either...

370
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,680
Why can't I move my hands?

371
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,190
You're finally awake.

372
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,940
Why is Su Mo so strange?

373
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,380
As if he doesn't recognize me.

374
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,830
No!

375
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,220
This person isn't Su Mo.

376
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,490
You don't need to worry.

377
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,380
You only suffered from some shock.

378
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,790
No serious injuries.

379
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,270
Where is this place?

380
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,530
This is Dragon Silk Palace.

381
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,840
Where's my boat?

382
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,430
And the people who were on it?

383
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,130
Your boat is probably at the bottom of the ocean.

384
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,260
I... only saw you.

385
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,850
I didn't see anyone else.

386
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,130
Rest well. I'll come back later.

387
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,930
Don't think too much.

388
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,280
By the way... thank you.

389
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,520
What's your name?

390
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,570
- Chun Huang.
- I'm Bai Wei.

391
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,920
Su Mo!

392
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,510
Was that an illusion from 7,000 years ago just now?

393
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,480
You saw it, too?

394
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,570
Seems like I really went back to 7,000 years ago.

395
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,500
I couldn't speak or move.

396
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,030
As if I were Queen Bai Wei.

397
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,740
Me, too.

398
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,220
This illusion is very strange indeed.

399
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,010
What did you see in the illusion?

400
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,930
I think it was Chun Huang and Queen Bai Wei's

401
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,100
first meeting.

402
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,600
- At Dragon Silk Palace?
- Yes

403
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,650
Looks like we were in the same illusion at the same time.

404
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,260
If you're going to kill or torture me, just do it!

405
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,640
I'm not going to kill or torture you.

406
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,600
Put Fei Lian in my tent.

407
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,290
Don't let him out without my permission.

408
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,190
General Yu.

409
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,290
You still know to call me General.

410
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,090
You had a hand in today's events too, didn't you?

411
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,250
Don't want to say anything?

412
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,010
Fine.

413
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,230
I'll say it for you.

414
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,350
You took advantage of my last bit of hope for you and jumped into the poisoned river.

415
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,870
Then worked with Fei Lian to trick me out of the antidote for the Algae of the Red Ghost.

416
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,730
And then gave it to him! Right?

417
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,140
I gave you a final chance.

418
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,960
I wanted you to choose between me and Su Mo.

419
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,560
This is your answer?

420
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,760
Fei Lian and Yu Huan have both loyalty and retribution in their hearts.

421
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,100
Perhaps they also saved the both of us.

422
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,780
But in the end, what they're doing is all for Cangliu

423
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,690
and are just using the both of us.

424
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,420
Between the two of us, who do you choose?

425
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,350
Say something.

426
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,860
Say!

427
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,650
Young Master Su Mo.

428
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,700
Xiao!

429
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,810
Xiao!

430
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,950
I never imagined...

431
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,800
that my sharpest weapon would hurt me.

432
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,980
But I still kept you.

433
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,910
Right now,

434
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,040
you've become useless.

435
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,860
Xiao!

436
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,250
Xiao!

437
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,460
I will make your Commissioner of the Left replace you.

438
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,660
Throw her in the river.

439
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,380
Ning Liang!

440
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,400
Na Sheng!

441
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,940
Did you get the antidote? Where's Yan Xi?

442
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,320
Yan Xi... Yan Xi...

443
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,650
We sneacked into the camp,

444
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,370
Xiao helped us to get the antidote,

445
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,510
but in order to distract the soldiers,

446
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,500
- Yan Xi was captured by Yu Huan.
- Yan Xi was captured?

447
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,810
He said... He said for me to come back first.

448
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,570
He said the Red Ghost poison couldn't wait.

449
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,660
This is the antidote. There are not many left.

450
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,950
Dissolve this in water and give it to the soldiers to drink.

451
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,570
Yes.

452
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,260
We came too late.

453
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't blame yourself. You've already done your best.

454
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,190
Yan Xi...

455
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,030
Yan Xi is probably in extreme danger, right?

456
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,310
Everyone has their own mission. We also have our own mission.

457
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,860
Ning Liang, you're right.

458
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,050
There's no time to be sad. I have to use this heavenly power

459
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,050
to save the dragon deity.

460
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:46,260
After Su Mo releases the dragon deity, Yan Xi will be able to be saved.

461
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,640
Na Sheng! We're surrounded by the Cangliu.

462
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,370
It's suicide!

463
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,920
Ning Liang, let me go.

464
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,840
Yan Xi...Yan Xi said this was his wish.

465
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,120
Even if he never returns, I must help fulfill his wish.

466
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,580
If you must go,

467
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,210
I'll send some people to escort you.

468
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,570
Thank you, Ning Liang.

469
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,190
It's too quiet.

470
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,890
It makes you feel... strange.

471
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,540
Like you can't feel the presence of any living thing.

472
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,200
I can feel a strong psyche here.

473
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,980
I think we're trapped in here.

474
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,750
Those eyes have appeared again!

00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:13,560
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

488
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,440
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

489
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,470
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

490
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:24,390
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

491
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,940
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

492
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,260
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

493
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,810
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

494
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:41,280
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

495
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,240
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

496
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,370
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

497
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,150
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

498
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,720
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

499
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,100
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

500
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,210
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

501
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:13,860
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
