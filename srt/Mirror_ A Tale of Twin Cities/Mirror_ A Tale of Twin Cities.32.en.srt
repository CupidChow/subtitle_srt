[Episode 32]

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,370
That's why I don't want her to know about this matter.

4
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,640
You want me to help you to conceal things from her again?

5
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,150
What did His Highness tell you?

6
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,920
We both suspect that Lord Zhi Zhe is the Heavenly King.

7
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,200
He told you about the parchment I got from the Jing Pagoda?

8
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,940
We still don't understand why he is helping Cangliu.

9
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,320
We need you and Zhen Lan to look into this.

10
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,090
Now that the seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss is undone,

11
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,270
you also have the Splitting Sword, what should we do next?

12
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,320
Let's wait until you've investigated it thoroughly.

13
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,450
We? What about you?

14
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,340
I'll return to the main camp at Jing Lake to handle some matters.

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,620
Remember. If you need to find me, knock on it three times.

16
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,860
A'Huan!

17
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,220
- Older Sister.
- Why are you in such a rush to see me? What's going on?

18
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,060
Do you know Fei Lian's whereabouts? He still hasn't returned to the camp yet.

19
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,120
Fei Lian has returned.

20
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
But...

21
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,640
What's wrong?

22
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,820
Nan Zhao has proof and says Fei Lian colluded with the enemy at Banbu City.

23
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,800
He deliberately released some merpeople and Kongsang people.

24
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,370
How is that possible?

25
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,090
How can Fei Lian be someone who would collude with them?

26
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,590
Nan Zhao must be using a pretext to frame him!

27
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,790
- Yu Huan!
- Sister.

28
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,840
This matter is definitely my fault.

29
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,800
If I had let him come back with me, this wouldn't have happened.

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,130
I must go see him and save him.

31
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,700
Don't rush just yet.

32
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,160
I think there is room for this to turn around.

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,610
Master Peng asked me to report to Lord Zhi Zhe, not to convict Fei Lian,

34
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,490
but to temporarily detain him in jail.

35
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,560
Master Peng and Master Lan have been fighting each other for many years.

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
If Fei Lian is truly found to be colluding with the enemy,

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,470
he probably would've already been harshly punished.

38
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,580
Then, do you know what Nan Zhao said?

39
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,600
I don't know the details of what happened in the Hall of the Five Masters.

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,990
I only vaguely heard that Nan Zhao found

41
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,320
Quanxian's medicinal ointment on Fei Lian.

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,420
Quanxian's medicinal ointment?

43
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,580
How is Fei Lian connected with the Quanxian?

44
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,750
But if they have the proof,

45
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,250
Master Peng will definitely punish Fei Lian harshly...

46
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,680
and take the opportunity to suppress Master Lang.

47
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,500
For him to involve so many people in this,

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,880
he must have an ulterior motive.

49
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,890
Why isn't there anyone proving Fei Lian's whereabouts and innocence?!

50
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,450
- Investigate it again!
- Yes.

51
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,330
Reporting.

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,550
Master Lang, an object has been submitted.

53
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,470
Hurry and bring it up here.

54
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,180
- You may step down.
- Yes.

55
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,830
Why is it so serious?

56
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,620
Hurry and get up.

57
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,060
A lowly prison guard named Xin Zhui used the interrogation as an excuse.

58
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,020
That bastard.

59
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,030
What did you bring? Any wine?

60
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,840
I didn't know that you got caned.

61
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,670
I brought you some wine and small dishes.

62
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,480
Wait. Let me get some medicine to treat the wounds.

63
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,050
Forget it.

64
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,230
I'm a soldier. These wounds are nothing.

65
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,040
Was that guard, Xin Zhui,

66
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,170
given orders by Master Peng?

67
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,520
What are you trying to say?

68
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,800
You returned victorious with captives, but left me alone in Jiuyi Mountain.

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,130
Did you collude with Master Peng on this?

70
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,140
Of course not.

71
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,050
I came today to beg for your forgiveness.

72
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,030
That day, after I captured Princess Bai of Kongsang, all I could think about was bringing her back here.

73
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,550
I wanted you to wrap up what was left by staying in the mountain to search for the remnants.

74
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,750
But I really didn't expect that...

75
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,130
you would receive such a big punishment because of it

76
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,680
and even get accused of collusion.

77
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,410
I believe you.

78
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,880
I already said that I believe you.

79
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,570
Why did you still drink up three bowls in succession?

80
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,510
You're not really upset that I'm wounded and can't drink, are you?

81
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,390
Yu Huan...

82
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,060
You and I are both soldiers.

83
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,940
We only have one goal, which is to defend against

84
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,920
enemies on the battlefield. The infighting among the nobles in the royal court

85
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,310
is beyond our concern. Isn't that right?

86
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,850
I'll owe you for this for my entire life.

87
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,180
I'm a spy now.

88
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,160
Even if Master Lang can save my life,

89
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,370
I probably can't go back to the battlefield.

90
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,170
That won't happen.

91
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,130
You and I made a promise.

92
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,300
That we would definitely kill our enemies together on the battlefield.

93
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,780
I'll definitely get you out of here.

94
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
Young Master.

95
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,640
Hurry and notify all the warriors that are scattered everywhere to quickly return to the main camp.

96
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,350
Do you have some sort of plan?

97
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,590
I need to leave the main camp for some time.

98
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,940
I'm concerned that Cangliu will attack.

99
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,710
So I want you and them to protect the main camp together.

100
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,060
Young Master, where are you going?

101
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,430
I'll tell you later.

102
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,500
Congratulations, Emperor of the Sea for obtaining the Splitting Sword.

103
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Master...

104
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
the Splitting Sword has been obtained.

105
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,490
I want to go to Stranded Dragon Abyss as soon as possible to undo the seal there.

106
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,800
Release the Dragon Deity.

107
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,700
Stranded Dragon Abyss?

108
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,800
I've been waiting for this.

109
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
Waited for 7,000 years for this.

110
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,800
Why are you so worried about this?

111
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
The Stranded Dragon Abyss was when the Heavenly King

112
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,900
sealed the Dragon Deity back then.

113
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,800
It's also the place where Emperor of the Sea, Chun Huang, died.

114
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,600
Over this last century,

115
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,200
many Quanxian warriors were dispatched to find the way,

116
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
but the seal was too powerful.

117
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,300
It is also extremely dangerous and many people didn't return.

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,200
So, not much is also known about that place.

119
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,900
Are you taking the army with you, Emperor of the Sea?

120
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,300
No.

121
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm preparing to go alone.

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You must not! The Stranded Dragon Abyss is dangerous and abnormal.

123
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You mustn't go alone. Not to mention, your health...

124
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm fine.

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,500
We don't have much time. If we don't unlock the Dragon Deity Seal now,

126
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,600
and instead wait for Cangliu to regain their power, I fear it'll be even more difficult.

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,100
At least, you should take the Left Commissioner and the rest of them.

128
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,200
Emperor of the Sea,

129
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
we waited for you for 7,000 years.

130
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,300
What if something happens?

131
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,200
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me.

132
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
A'Lang, this was entrusted to me by Chun Huang.

133
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,900
In this conch are sounds of the waves.

134
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,800
Could it be that Chun Huang was wildly ambitious and wanted to swallow Yunhuang?

135
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
Queen Bai Wei wanted to stop him

136
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,640
and was killed.

137
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,200
[Queen Bai Wei]

138
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,600
But according to historical records,

139
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,100
the Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei sealed the Dragon Deity together.

140
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,600
Chun Huang perished and was trapped in the Dragon Terrace.

141
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,100
It should be Chun Huang who died first.

142
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,600
Then, who killed Queen Bai Wei?

143
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,490
Your Highness, what are you reading?

144
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm reading the Dark Golden Classics.

145
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Did you find anything?

146
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,700
No.

147
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,100
Your Highness, what did you and Su Mo discuss that day?

148
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,400
Nothing much.

149
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,000
He wanted me to come back and flip through this to see if there were any clues.

150
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,900
That way everyone can get some rest and we can plan.

151
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,580
Are the two of you hiding something from me?

152
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,200
What would we hide from you?

153
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,960
A'Ying, after you went to Jing Pagoda,

154
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,000
- your suspicions have gotten worse.
- I...

155
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
You are here.

156
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,000
Master Peng, you've had to wait a long time.

157
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,200
It's good that you are here.

158
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,030
Do you want the kitchen

159
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,600
to prepare some nice wine and food?

160
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
No need.

161
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,200
If you were considerate, it would have been prepared already.

162
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Tell me. What exactly do you want?

163
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
Military power?

164
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,300
You deserve to be called Master Lang.

165
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,800
The military power isn't in my hands right now.

166
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,500
As long as you are on my side,

167
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,800
it's also not good for Master Xian

168
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,600
to hand over the military power either.

169
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,590
Of course,

170
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,300
it depends on how much you value Fei Lian.

171
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,500
The military is not in your hands,

172
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,200
but Fei Lian is definitely your successor.

173
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Fei Lian committed a crime by collaborating with the enemy this time.

174
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
It's a small matter to be punished with flesh and blood.

175
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,900
There's also a way for him to return after being exiled.

176
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,200
Most importantly,

177
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,400
it's being cut off from the army

178
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,000
and demoted to a commoner.

179
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,700
In this way, Fei Lian's future will be completely destroyed.

180
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,740
Fei Lian is young and talented

181
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,600
and ended up in this state.

182
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,400
It is unavoidable and too embarrassing.

183
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,000
You picked up Yu Huan and spent so much time and effort on him.

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,900
Naturally, when it comes to Fei Lian, I can't stand aside and do nothing.

185
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,990
Aren't you just using this to threaten me?

186
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,600
There are indeed many changes in the Imperial Court.

187
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,700
Right now you are relying on Yu Huan and also have the support of Zhi Zhe,

188
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,000
so you're more and more vicious in the way you do things.

189
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,200
I can't help...

190
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
but have a new level of respect.

191
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,480
Let's see how you'll decide...

192
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
on the final direction of this matter.

193
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,990
Lord Zhi Zhe is superior.

194
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,200
I've received your grace and was ordered to go to Jiuyi Mountain to capture the rebels from land and sea.

195
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,300
During this period, Genera Fei Lian was of great assistance to me.

196
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,100
With Fei Lian's merit, we were able to capture the Queen of the Earth.

197
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,600
But now, he has been slandered as collaborating with the enemy.

198
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
This is definitely not true!

199
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,800
Fei Lian was interrogated without authorization and punished by floggings and torture.

200
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,760
Is that so?

201
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Yes.

202
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,500
I can't watch him being slandered.

203
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,700
Fei Lian is well-mannered and a man of integrity

204
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
and the best general in Cangliu.

205
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,400
But now he's in the hands of a villain.

206
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,100
Please, Lord Zhi Zhe, save Fei Lian.

207
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,400
What does an insignificant Fei Lian...

208
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,800
have to do with me?

209
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
What does it have to do with Cangliu?

210
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,400
However, since you personally plead for mercy on his behalf,

211
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
I can give him a chance.

212
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
Thank you, Lord Zhi Zhe.

213
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,600
[Algae of Red Ghost]

214
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Next, the Land-Sea Alliance

215
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,600
must be going to the Stranded Dragon Abyss to unlock the seal of the Dragon Deity.

216
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
I want Fei Lian to be your deputy

217
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and go with you to Stranded Dragon Abyss.

218
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,300
My Lord, this is...

219
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,800
The Algae of Red Ghost.

220
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,300
It's a poison from Yunhuang.

221
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,300
Release this in the water.

222
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,400
Once anyone enters the water, it'll dissolve into his skin.

223
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,300
That person will gradually become petrified.

224
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,300
I want you to release this in the water routes.

225
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,500
I'll ensure I live up to this mission.

226
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,300
However, once you open this bottle,

227
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,800
you'll be the first to become poisoned.

228
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,500
Are you afraid?

229
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,400
Of course, I'm not afraid.

230
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,700
I wouldn't hesitate to go through fire and water.

231
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Warriors are not afraid of death.

232
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
Excellent.

233
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,600
There is no antidote for this poison.

234
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,000
As long as you consume this in time, it won't harm your life.

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,800
I'll give you this medicine.

236
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you, Lord Zhi Zhe.

237
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,730
As for this blood pact,

238
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,200
after you have completed this task,

239
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,400
I'll give you the elixir.

240
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,960
Thank you for giving Fei Lian this opportunity.

241
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,950
Fei Lian and I will do our best

242
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,920
to stop Su Mo.

243
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,650
Master Lang traded military power for Fei Lian's life,

244
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,770
but Fei Lian just can't lead a troop onto the battlefield anymore.

245
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,970
If you hadn't come, he wouldn't have died either.

246
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,120
However, if officers and soldiers can't go onto the battlefield again,

247
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,220
then this is the same as death.

248
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,970
General Yu Huan brought the command tokens of the five masters?

249
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,200
I didn't.

250
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
Then are you here to break him out of prison?

251
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,840
I'm not.

252
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,780
I'm under orders to take General Fei Lian out of prison.

253
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,170
General?

254
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,260
Escort General Fei Lian back to the camp!

255
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,830
Yes!

256
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,850
You are not talking. What's on your mind?

257
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,960
I was thinking about how you can go onto the battlefield in your condition.

258
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,470
Looking down on me again?

259
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,810
You'll have to suffer being my deputy, but don't worry.

260
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,380
In my heart, you and I are equals.

261
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,500
Yu Huan, Nan Zhao accused me of collaborating with the enemy.

262
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,040
The power struggles between Master Peng and Master Lang are increasing every day.

263
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,190
Why did Master Peng spare my life?

264
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,670
Moreover, he even retained my military status.

265
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,450
I must not let Fei Lian know about Lord Zhi Zhe.

266
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,030
I also can't let him know about

267
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,950
the deal I've made with Lord Zhi Zhe.

268
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,500
It's because Master Lang gave up his military power.

269
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,960
Grand Uncle...

270
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,590
This time, when we go to the Stranded Dragon Abyss, we'll work hand in hand

271
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,730
and definitely obtain outstanding military merits.

272
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,730
All right. Let's make a pact

273
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,760
to advance and retreat together.

274
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,670
What's going on?

275
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,930
The Wind Falcons have all been destroyed by Young Master.

276
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,750
Why are we, the drivers of the falcons,

277
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,230
also going to the Stranded Dragon Abyss?

278
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,630
Yu Huan wants to lead his subordinates

279
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,760
to destroy the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

280
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,180
The power of the Dragon Deity is in the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

281
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,750
Once it's destroyed, our hopes for going back to Bilou Sea

282
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,890
will be even more uncertain.

283
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,400
Help me to delay them. I'm going to see what's going on.

284
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,580
Don't be impulsive. I'll go.

285
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,930
Young Master, Xiang Lai's report just came.

286
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,400
Yu Huan and Fei Lian are leading the troops to destroy the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

287
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,040
I didn't expect them

288
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,390
to take action so quickly.

289
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,320
Young Master, what are your plans?

290
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,380
I must rush and get to the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

291
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,510
- Yan Xi. Ning Liang.
- Here!

292
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,070
Lead a team of horses and men each

293
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,540
and go to the Stranded Dragon Abyss immediately

294
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,570
- and deal with the Cangliu.
- I will abide.

295
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,460
I'll have to trouble you elders

296
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,910
to guard and protect Quanxian's main camp.

297
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,330
Yes!

298
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,820
Should we tell Princess Bai Ying about you going to the Stranded Dragon Abyss?

299
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,750
No need.

300
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,610
If she doesn't go, then I won't have to worry.

301
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,400
Let's set out.

302
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,430
Young Master is heading to the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

303
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,800
Will it be too dangerous?

304
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,130
Young Master can definitely avert danger and release the Dragon Deity without any problems.

305
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,300
We just need to take care of our assigned tasks.

306
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,340
Let's get ready to set out then.

307
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,980
Hold on.

308
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:38,050
I... would like to bid farewell to Na Sheng before we go.

309
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,480
All right. Go on. I'll help you mark attendance for the soldiers.

310
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,150
Thank you.

311
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,770
Strange. Why isn't there any response?

312
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,620
Didn't he say he would show up if I knocked on it three times?

313
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,610
Yan Xi!

314
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,810
Let's go. Let's set out.

315
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,530
Are you really going to come with me?

316
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,340
Of course! Otherwise, we won't know how long we'll be separated.

317
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,410
But the Stranded Dragon Abyss is very dangerous.

318
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,410
I'm not afraid. I have the Heavenly Ring.

319
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,850
I can protect you all. Besides, I know many spells, too.

320
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,400
I can protect myself as well.

321
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,450
I'm not joking with you.

322
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,310
We don't know what we'll encounter along the way.

323
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,970
I'm afraid I don't have the energy to protect you.

324
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,590
Don't worry. I'm so clever,

325
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,950
I can definitely avert danger.

326
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,530
No. You can't go.

327
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,640
If you don't take me along, I can't guarantee that Sister Bai Ying won't take me along.

328
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,400
Young Master doesn't want you to tell her about the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

329
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,090
Fine. Come with me then.

330
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,910
I really don't know what to do with you.

331
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,850
Don't worry. Everything will really be all right.

332
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,790
I have the Heavenly Ring to protect you and Brother Ice Cube, too.

333
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,730
- A'Ying.
- Your Highness.

334
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,580
Where did you go?

335
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,980
I went to find Su Mo, but I couldn't find him.

336
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,090
S-Su Mo? Why are you looking for him?

337
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,340
Do you know where he is?

338
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,450
He should be re-arranging

339
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,520
the defense for the camp right now. Don't go and disturb him.

340
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,570
Arranging the defense for the camp? How did you know?

341
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,830
I made a guess.

342
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,120
A'Ying, don't worry. He's fine.

343
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,560
Why don't you go back and rest now?

344
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,180
Your Highness, are you and Su Mo hiding something from me?

345
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,480
Has he gone to the Stranded Dragon Abyss?

346
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,150
He... really went there?

347
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,350
Did he go alone?

348
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,040
Yes.

349
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,830
Your Highness, why didn't you stop him?

350
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,420
The Stranded Dragon Abyss is where the Seal of the Dragon Deity is.

351
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,200
It's very dangerous and he was recently injured, too!

352
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,820
What if he encounters danger?

353
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,530
I tried to stop him, but he refused to listen to me.

354
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,050
You could have told me! I could have persuaded him.

355
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,610
I... I can go with him to protect him!

356
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,020
A'Ying, I'm sorry.

357
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,730
Su Mo's intention was that he doesn't want you to face dangers with him.

358
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,640
That's why he had me hide this from you.

359
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,140
I wanted to go and help him too, but I can't do anything well.

360
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,420
The only thing I could do,

361
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,350
was to help him hide this from you.

362
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,670
Your Highness!

363
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,820
Forget it.

364
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,600
I couldn't hide it anyway.

365
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,190
If you really want to go, hurry and go and find him.

366
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,570
It's still not too late if you leave now.

367
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,740
Either way, out of all the things not completed,

368
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,040
this is just another one of them.

369
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,600
Master Peng.

370
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,890
My Lord, what's wrong?

371
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,550
I was just getting the servants to prepare some fine wine and nice food.

372
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,080
W-We invited guests from everywhere...

373
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,880
to celebrate you regaining your military power.

374
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,780
My Lord, what did I do wrong?

375
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,440
Do you want them

376
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,050
to see me as a laughing stock?!

377
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,020
What do you mean by laughingstock, My Lord?

378
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,640
This is... just to let them come here to celebrate...

379
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,790
The regaining of my military power? Yu Huan had already seized it a long time ago!

380
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,470
What?

381
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,380
This rascal.

382
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,710
I don't know what tricks he used,

383
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,110
not only did he absolve Fei Lian of his crime,

384
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,670
but he even seized the military power.

385
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,250
He said he's going to the Stranded Dragon Abyss

386
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,240
to gain war merits.

387
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,780
No, wait... It took a lot of effort

388
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,970
to finally have an opportunity to get rid of Fei Lian.

389
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,040
But how... Collaborating with the enemy, My Lord!

390
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,240
It's such a serious crime and it's gone just like that?

391
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,830
And for them to even seize military power?

392
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,390
Right, didn't you used to suspect that Yu Huan could be a traitor?

393
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,060
I think he has already colluded with Master Lang—

394
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,750
Shut up!

395
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,120
My Lord.

396
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,030
My Lord.

397
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,590
If we don't take action in time,

398
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,130
I'm afraid he'll only climb higher and higher.

399
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,280
By then,

400
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,150
if we want to pull him down, it'll be really difficult.

401
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,900
I think I can first take...

402
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,060
What ideas could you have?

403
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,420
Go!

404
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,350
Ask those you invited over to leave!

405
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,800
Yes.

406
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,810
I'll go take care of it right now.

407
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,440
Well done lad.

408
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,690
He's moving up the ladder...

409
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,000
and now ignores me.

410
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,990
How dare he take something from me!

411
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,310
Then I'll come up with a way

412
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,730
to break your ladder!

413
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,770
Emperor of the Sea.

I've tapped on the Sunlight Blocking Pearl many times.

415

Why didn't you come and look for me?

416
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,280
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

417
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,060
We've got the Splitting Sword.

418
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,940
Cangliu has already sent troops

419
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,910
to fight at the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

420
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,830
It's extremely urgent to break the dragon deity seal.

421
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,580
So you don't need help from us anymore?

422
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,710
You're worried that we'll be a burden on you.

423
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,950
Do you think it's okay to go to the Stranded Dragon Abyss alone?

424
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:25,530
- That's not what I mean.
- But you're doing it.

425
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,470
It's too dangerous this time. I'm worried–

426
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,970
The trip to Jiuyi Mountain was dangerous too, but we went there together.

427
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,530
But breaking the dragon deity seal is different.

428
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,970
When the Land and Sea Alliance was formed, that's not what you said.

429
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,910
Why are you following me?

430
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,450
What? Are you going to Stranded Dragon Abyss, too?

431
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,610
When I hid my turning into ash from you, you said

432
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,140
that whatever happened, we'd face it together.

433
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,900
I didn't think it through.

434
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,230
So are you going alone or with me?

435
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,900
With you.

436
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,230
You didn't decide to go alone

437
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,950
because you thought I wasn't powerful enough, did you?

438
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,060
Of course not.

439

The surrounding terrain is complicated.

The Stranded Dragon Abyss is on the other side of the gate of Cangyu Province.

It's most convenient to go through the city.

That year, the Heavenly King attacked Quanxian.

that the Heavenly King killed Chun Huang and sealed the dragon deity,

We need to hurry up and break the dragon deity seal;

485
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,100
otherwise, it'll be difficult to deal with the Cangliu troops when they arrive.

486
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,420
All right. Let's go.

487
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,180
I hope when I die, I can still see

488
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,270
to watch you die one day.

489
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,600
Queen Bai Wei, who were you cursing?

490
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,920
"Quit the commandments"...

491
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,200
Could it be you hated the Heavenly King?

492
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,880
What exactly is the truth about what happened 7,000 years ago?

493
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,570
Who was it that killed Queen Bai Wei?

494
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,980
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

495
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,300
Is A'Ying not here with you?

496
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,900
Your Highness.

497
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,980
Your Highness.

498
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,020
- That's right!
- Your Highness.

499
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,480
Something must be wrong with the Stranded Dragon Abyss!

500
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,150
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

501
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,540
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

502
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,020
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

503
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:51,940
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

504
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,370
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

505
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,910
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

506
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:05,880
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

507
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,340
♫ We've met several times ♫

508
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,720
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

509
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,880
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

510
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,230
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

511
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,840
♫ You live in there ♫

512
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,930
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

513
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,900
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

514
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,830
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

515
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:43,730
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

516
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,250
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

517
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,620
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

518
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,160
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

519
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,570
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

520
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,590
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

521
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,560
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

522
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,680
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

523
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,110
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

524
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,540
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

525
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,600
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

526
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:33,040
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
