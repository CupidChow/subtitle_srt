[Episode 23]

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
You bold treasure thieves!

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,800
How dare you barge into Queen Bai Wei's tomb!

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Who are you?

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
[Li Zhu - Qing Clan's servant - Kongsang]

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
Who are you?

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,000
How dare you trespass here?

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,700
You're from Kongsang?

10
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,360
This girl isn't from Kongsang.

11
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,000
Miss, we're Kongsang people who rushed here from the Central Plains.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We came especially to pay respects to our ancestors.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,200
To pay respect to the ancestors?

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
Kongsang fell a hundred years ago.

15
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,500
Why would there be anyone paying respects?

16
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,800
That's right.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Although Cangliu has been controlling our kingdom for the past century,

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,800
but as a person from Kongsang, we should never forget this.

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Upon arriving here at Jiuyi Mountain, it's natural to come pay respects to our ancestors.

20
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
You haven't introduced yourself yet.

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm Li Zhu, an attendant at Jiuyi Palace.

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,300
An attendant at Jiuyi Palace?

23
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,040
What are you doing living here?

24
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,510
I'm just asking.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
This is the tomb of Queen Bai Wei.

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I've been ordered to keep this place clean.

27
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,600
This really is the tomb then?

28
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,100
Yes.

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,600
If you wish to worship, I can open the door for you.

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Miss, why is this tomb

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
not a burial mound, but a bamboo house instead?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The outer appearance of Queen Bai Wei's tomb

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,700
was constructed by the Heavenly King back then according to the style of the former residence of Queen Bai Wei.

34
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,750
Please follow me.

35
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,390
The tomb of Queen Bai Wei,

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,100
it has been a decade since anyone has come here to worship.

37
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,730
I don't agree with you going to Jiuyi.

38
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,000
It's the boundary of the Kongsang Qing clan.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,200
Although the Qing clan surrendered to Cangliu,

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,600
who can guarantee that these people don't remember and harbor grudges against Cangliu?

41
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,800
Even more so, it's a very dangerous place

42
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
and your injuries from the blood pact have only just gotten better.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,700
How could I let you go to such a dangerous place?

44
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,000
Older Sister, Lord Zhi Zhe ordered me to go.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,400
Zhi Zhe?

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,300
Yes. He told me that people who are not from Kongsang will have their

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,060
magic powers reduced by half when they enter Jiuyi Mountain.

48
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm the only one from Cangliu who can enter the barrier without losing my magic powers.

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Master Peng has already lost his trust in me.

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,300
It wasn't easy for me to get this opportunity from Zhi Zhe. I must seize it.

51
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,800
It's just that my heart feels really empty right now.

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I'm worried...

53
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,070
Zhi Zhe told me there will be a major change in the structure of Yunhuang.

54
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,800
Sending you to Jiuyi Mountain now, at this time...

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Older Sister, I need to go to Jiuyi Mountain this time.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,600
This looks like an ordinary home.

57
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
It's not much different.

58
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
Let me take a look at this.

59
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,390
Wanghai Province, Bai?

60
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,800
What does this mean?

61
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
It's seven thousand years old. This was the symbol of the Bai clan in Wanghai Province.

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,000
If my guess is correct, these should be Queen Bai Wei's old things.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Don't randomly touch anything.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm just taking a look. Let me look around some more.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,900
This house was where the

66
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,200
Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei spent their childhood and teenage years together,

67
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,200
before they became the rulers of Kongsang.

68
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Later, before the Heavenly King passed away,

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,200
he specially sent people to retrieve the furnishings from the former residence of the Bai clan in Wanghai Province

70
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,400
that was a thousand miles away. They were taken exactly as they were and delivered here.

71
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,800
I've heard a story about them before, too.

72
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
It's said that Queen Bai Wei

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
first met the Heavenly King when she was eight years old.

74
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,200
After she passed away at the age of thirty-four, she was only separated from him twice.

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Before the Heavenly King's expedition to Quanxian,

76
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,200
they had never been apart.

77
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,800
Really an immortal couple who loved each other deeply.

78
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,600
- Why are there conch shells here?
- Miss!

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
- What's wrong?
- Please don't touch anything at random.

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
I want to listen to it, just listen.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
- Na Sheng!
- No.

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,400
I've already told you not to touch anything.

83
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
What's wrong?

84
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,950
By the way, isn't this Queen Bai Wei's former residence?

85
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,800
Why would there be a conch shell here?

86
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,100
A'Lang, you're finally back.

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,000
You have been away on expeditions for the past few years. I miss you very much.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,400
A'Wei, from now on, I will never leave you again.

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,700
The trustee of Chunhuang gave this to me.

90
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,400
There's the sound of sea waves in this conch shell.

91
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
Before when I was living in the Bilou Sea,

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,900
he thankfully took care of me all those years.

93
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,200
He wrote a letter to invite us to go again.

94
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,000
You're now recovering from a serious illness.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,100
As the founder of Kongsang, we still have many tasks to complete.

96
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,200
But I really miss them.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
This conch shell

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,300
was actually given to Queen Bai Wei by Chunhuang, the Emperor of the Sea.

99
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,600
So the two of them actually had a past.

100
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
Brother Crown Prince.

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
- Hey, Brother Crown Prince.
- What?

102
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
What's wrong?

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
It's nothing.

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Na Sheng,

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm going to look for the Water Dispelling Pearl. Think of a way to delay Li Zhu.

106
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Miss Li Zhu, we've chatted for a long time already.

107
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Where exactly is the tomb?

108
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
It's in that room.

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,100
Over there?

110
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Sister Li Zhu, I would like to view the courtyard.

111
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,700
Come, let's go. Come and show me.

112
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,200
Is there anything fun to do there? Tell me, please.

113
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,100
What's that over there?

114
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,430
Why do I feel like I've seen this image before?

115
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,600
When the sea was flowing, Bai Wei loved to travel far,

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
sailing by boat to the Bilou Sea.

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,800
Where she encountered wind and waves and was trapped here,

118
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,600
Lang Gan searched the whole day to find her.

119
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,400
They later arrived at Jing Lake Island

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,000
and obtained the Heavenly ring and Earth ring.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
They established this island, the royal city of Yunhuang,

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,800
opened it and developed it together to become a kingdom.

123
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,400
So, Queen Bai Wei lived in the Bilou Sea before.

124
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,300
Then, Heavenly King and the Emperor of the Sea,

125
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,700
what happened between the three of them?

126
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,900
Who took the Water Dispelling Pearl?

127
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Young Master, what did you touch?!

128
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,100
Sister Li Zhu and I heard a sound in here.

129
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,400
We were afraid something happened so rushed in here.

130
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
Sorry, Miss Li Zhu.

131
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I accidentally tripped and knocked into the coffin.

132
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,100
Sir, to prevent burglary, there are many mechanisms here.

133
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,400
Please be careful lest the mechanism is triggered and accidentally hurts you.

134
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
Yes, you're right. You're right.

135
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,800
Mechanism? Are there a lot of mechanisms on Jiuyi Mountain then?

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
Yes.

137
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,400
To prevent burglary, there are many mechanisms in Jiuyi Mountain.

138
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,800
Miss Li Zhu,

139
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,600
I have another presumptuous request.

140
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,700
Young Master, please go ahead.

141
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,600
I wonder if you could take us to Jiuyi Palace.

142
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,500
You... want to pay respects to the King of Jiuyi?

143
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
I won't hide this from you.

144
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm a descendant of the Qing Clan of Kongsang.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,800
As his descendant, it's normal to pay respects to him, isn't it?

146
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,090
Besides, regarding the current King of Jiuyi,

147
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,400
I don't even know who it is in the Qing Clan.

148
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,000
The current King of Jiuyi is Qing Jun of the Qing Clan.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
After the destruction of Kongsang,

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
the descendants of Prince Qing Chen

151
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,600
passed away shortly after ascending the throne.

152
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,400
So, the eldest son of the next closest kin, Qing Jun, was chosen

153
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,800
as the new ruler of Jiuyi up to today.

154
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Why did all the descendants of Prince Qing Chen pass away?

155
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,200
It could be the intentional punishment from the ancestors of Kongsang.

156
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Everyone, please wait outside the door.

157
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,700
After I have tidied up, I will take you all to Jiuyi Palace.

158
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,000
All right. Thank you for your trouble.

159
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,040
Your Highness, did you get the Water Dispelling Pearl?

160
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,560
No.

161
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,270
Queen Bai Wei's wedding robe was inside the coffin.

162
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,420
But the pearl wasn't in the phoenix crown.

163
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,460
Someone must have taken the Water Dispelling Pearl.

164
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Was it Li Zhu?

165
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,420
It shouldn't have been her.

166
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,330
On the phoenix crown, there remained some traces of a spell.

167
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,300
I saw a hand,

168
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,620
with greenish skin.

169
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,820
But what I'm certain of is that it was a woman's hand.

170
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,470
Since the Water Dispelling Pearl has been taken,

171
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,370
aren't we back to looking for a needle in a haystack?

172
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,110
I keep having the feeling that

173
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,190
the Water Dispelling Pearl is still on Jiuyi Mountain.

174
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,800
In addition, we should summon Qing Yuan.

175
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,610
- Qing Yuan?
- Yes.

176
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,450
I'm a halfway crown prince of Kongsang. I don't know much about Jiuyi.

177
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,610
But he's only a side branch of the Qing clan.

178
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,490
He understands mechanisms.

179
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,930
Na Sheng.

180
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,200
Let's send a message to Wuse City.

181
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,260
High Priest, there's a message from the Heavenly Ring.

182
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,840
Qing Yuan, I want you to come quickly to support us in Jiuyi.

183
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,360
I'll leave some marks along the way.

184
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,420
You can find us by following the marks.

185
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,750
Why is His Highness summoning you?

186
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,850
His Highness wants me to go to Jiuyi.

187
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,140
Go to Jiuyi...

188
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,470
Who is His Highness summoning to Jiuyi?

189
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,830
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

190
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,040
I've packed up and can leave right away.

191
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,780
All right. Thank you, Miss Li Zhu, for leading the way.

192
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,550
Don't mention it.

193
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,060
Master Lang.

194
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,880
There are no outsiders here. No need to call me Master.

195
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,620
Do you know where Yu Huan is?

196
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,270
Yu Huan?

197
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,050
Hasn't Yu Huan been at the military camp the whole time?

198
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,480
No. He left for Jiuyi.

199
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,610
Jiuyi?

200
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,730
Why is he going to Jiuyi Mountain?

201
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,980
He went alone?

202
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,640
Let's do this. You should leave immediately for Jiuyi by yourself.

203
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,820
Increase your speed and catch up to Yu Huan.

204
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,040
When you get there,

205
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
take my command token,

206
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
you can deploy all of Banbu City's troops.

207
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,490
I should go after him?

208
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,580
Go monitor Yu Huan to see what he's doing exactly.

209
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,950
Find an opportunity to grab the merit.

210
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,880
Even if you can't grab it, you should get some credit. Understand?

211
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,500
Uncle, I'm sorry that I can't obey.

212
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,770
There must be a reason that he's going alone.

213
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,760
Besides, this is classified information. I'm not going.

214
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,130
Fei Lian.

215
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,190
I've dealt with Master Peng for a long time.

216
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,100
Hasn't it all been for you?

217
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,710
Look? If Yu Huan completes his mission successfully this time,

218
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,360
he'll definitely be promoted.

219
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,380
At that time, the entire Cangliu will only know General Yu Huan.

220
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,650
Who will still know Fei Lian?

221
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,950
- I don't care about all that.
- But I care!

222
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,690
Tell me. Have I raised you for nothing?

223
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,150
I'm telling you. If you don't go, I'll go and complain at your father's grave!

224
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,610
That routine again.

225
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,470
Do you want your father not to find any peace in the underworld?

226
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,860
All right, all right! I'll go then.

227
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,480
Go, go! Hurry and go.

228
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,400
- Go quickly.
 - I'll go then.

229
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,880
Maybe if Yu Huan gets into danger, I can help him.

230
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
Thank you, Uncle.

231
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,530
Be careful along the way.

232
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,320
All right!

233
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,600
Su Mo.

234
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,630
Use the ting grass. I'll help you.

235
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,840
Why didn't you tell me that there was only a little of the ting grass left?

236
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,740
Previously, I had asked Ming Huo. She said the ting grass

237
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,370
can only be found on the snowy mountain cliffs during the day.

238
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,080
I don't want you to take the risk.

239
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,920
I figured I'd go pick more by myself after we leave Jiuyi Mountain.

240
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,230
It's just to pick some herbs.

241
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,010
Now that there isn't much left of the ting grass, we should use it carefully.

242
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,110
How do you feel now?

243
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,590
Much better.

244
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,050
Su Mo, can you tell me where you learned the Mirror Technique from?

245
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,790
Where did you go these past hundred years?

246
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,650
I left Yunhuang a hundred years ago to search for power.

247
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,100
I went to many places, but couldn't find any.

248
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,950
Later, I went in the opposite direction of Yunhuang.

249
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,180
I walked a long time. I had consumed all my rations.

250
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,070
I didn't have any other way to find food or water.

251
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,250
I thought I was about to die.

252
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,590
Right at that time, I arrived at a dark place.

253
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,010
Later, I learned that place was called Jiwei Valley.

254
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,390
In that pitch dark place, there was no grass growing.

255
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,280
The wind blowing by my ears was so piercing that it sounded like people howling.

256
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,490
At my most desperate moment,

257
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,030
- I suddenly heard a voice.
[Jiwei Valley]

258
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,820
Do you want to live?

259
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,050
Who... Who's talking?

260
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,800
Do you want to gain a powerful strength?

261
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,910
- Who are you?
- You don't need to know who I am.

262
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,480
You only need to know that I'll give you what you want.

263
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,350
Why should I believe you?

264
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,350
In this place, the only thing that you can do

265
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,100
is to trust me or wait to die.

266
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,160
I can use my own strength to walk out of here.

267
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,930
You've been walking for three days already. Can you get out?

268
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,780
- What do you want?
- I want you to carry on my magic power, Su Mo.

269
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,900
- You know who I am?
- I know everything about you.

270
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,560
- What's your purpose?
- I'll give you a powerful strength!

271
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,990
In this world, if you want anything,

272
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,420
there's always a price to pay.
- You're quite clear-headed.

273
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,190
But your price has already been written in your destiny.

274
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,280
You will never get what you want in your lifetime.

275
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,600
What I want is to lead everyone back to the Biluo Sea.

276
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,920
Even if I'm not destined to realize it, I will fight against destiny to change it!

277
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,390
You are indeed my chosen one.

278
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,000
I can pass on the power to you.

279
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,720
But you body will experience backlashes

280
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,090
and endure great pain. Are you willing?

281
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,530
As long as everyone can return to the Biluo Sea, I'm willing to do anything!

282
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,890
But I definitely won't submit to anyone.

283
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,220
If the price of getting power is to endure pain,

284
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,490
let it be then!

285
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,400
I cultivated for a long time in Jiwei Valley.

286
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,050
I didn't eat or drink during that time, but I didn't die.

287
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,770
From then, I learned the Mirror Technique

288
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,020
and obtained a powerful strength, and returned to Yunhuang in the end.

289
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,160
You talked about the suffering you endured for 100 years in such an understated way.

290
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,960
Aren't you the same?

291
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,950
In Wuse City where you haven't been able to live under the sun for 100 years,

292
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,460
- you also haven't said much about it.
- I deserved my punishment.

293
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,990
Don't say anything like that from now on.

294
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,160
All right, I won't.

295
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,580
Luckily, we are gradually seeing some hope now.

296
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,730
It's just that even though the Mirror Technique is powerful, the backlash is still too strong.

297
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,290
If you found out that I've also been using the Splitting Technique... it's better that I don't let you know.

298
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,290
Previously, in the Jing Pagoda,

299
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,590
I fought against that mysterious Cangliu person. He also knew the Mirror Technique.

300
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,360
You've said before that there's a book that documented the solution to the Mirror Technique.

301
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,490
Do you remember the book's name?

302
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,230
I found it in the library in Wuse City.

303
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,670
It's called Forbidden Techniqiues. In the book,

304
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,750
it didn't say much about the solution for the Mirror Technique.

305
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,860
Even though it's a healing technique, its backlash is extremely powerful.

306
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,670
That's strange then.

307
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,070
I learned my Mirror Technique away from Yunhuang.

308
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,240
Why does the library in Kongsang have a record about this kind of thing?

309
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,080
Kongsang's library belongs exclusively to the Heavenly King.
 (T/N: the king from 7,000 years ago)

310
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,200
It was only later that it was made available to the other members of the royal family.

311
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,730
No matter what, you must be more cautious from now on.

312
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,420
There isn't much of the purple-lipped orchid left. The barrier at Jiuyi Mountain is strong, too.

313
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,210
You must remember not to utilize the Mirror Technique anymore.

314
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,500
Also, that Tu Luo moves stealthily and fast.

315
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,110
She lured us here,

316
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,150
but doesn't seem to want to kill us. She's only testing us.

317
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,850
If we want to catch them, it won't be easy.

318
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,340
We need to force them to appear.

319
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,490
Do you have an idea?

320
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,000
Draw the enemy into an ambush.

321
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,580
[Jiuyi Mountain - Left Peak]

322
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,120
Isn't this a general from Cangliu?

323
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,370
How can he come in and out freely?

324
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,750
I should send a message to Young Master to tell him to be wary of Yu Huan.

325
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,950
Young Master, General Yu Huan from Cangliu has caught up with us.

326
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,910
Please be very careful.

327
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,240
What's going on?

328
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,390
The Sound Pearl is not working?

329
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,190
This isn't good if the information can't be delivered inside.

330
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:19,820
Why is there another general from Cangliu?

331
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,770
It's hard to enter the barrier.

332
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,670
It's better that I rest for a bit at the entrance of Jiuyi Mountain

333
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,340
and then find the garrison here and think about countermeasures.

334
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,150
I'll follow him first to see what he's up to.

335
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,070
[Tianxiang Tavern]

336
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,410
He really came to a nice place.

337
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,990
Dear patrons, eat and drink well.

338
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,120
[Peng]

339
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,550
Sir, you look unfamiliar.

340
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,100
Where are you from?

341
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,870
Cut the crap.

342
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,900
Here to dine or stay?

343
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,090
Find me a room, one that's quiet,

344
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,190
and then deliver some tasty food.

345
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,590
Oh, right! Include a pot of fine wine.

346
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,790
All right. Guest, please don't worry.

347
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,490
Follow me.

[Jiuyi Palace]

349
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,130
This is Jiuyi Palace?

350
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,940
It seems rather desolate.

351
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,460
General, please.

352
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,820
[Qing Jun - King of Jiuyi]

353
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,190
Who are you?

354
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,340
General Yu Huan of Cangliu

355
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,060
greets Your Majesty.

356
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,960
I, King of Jiuyi, Qing Jun, have been waiting to meet you.

357
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,660
Lord Zhi Zhe dispatched me to deliver this medicine. Please take a look.

358
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,240
We've always only sent

359
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,630
letters to Lord Zhi Zhe.

360
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,120
Before requesting the medicinal pills, the temple attendant

361
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,720
would go to Jing Pagoda to obtain the medicine.

362
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,790
Today, someone suddenly trespassed into Jiuyi Mountain.

363
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,690
This wasn't properly taken care of.

364
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,350
I've troubled you to come all this way personally.

365
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,330
General, please forgive me.

366
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,400
Don't be overly concerned, Your Highness.

367
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,060
You've been in this position for many years and we have never met.

368
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,150
It's my fault.

369
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,620
Whether you meet an old geezer like me isn't a loss.

370
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,690
If it weren't for Prince Qing Chen a century ago...

371
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,160
It's a great honor for someone like me who's part of a branch of the clan to take the throne.

372
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,700
I'm willing to share the burdens of Lord Zhi Zhe.

373
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,890
It's just the trespass of Jiuyi Mountain...

374
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,130
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

375
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,190
Lord Zhi Zhe sent me here

376
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,600
to help you eliminate those who trespassed onto Jiuyi Mountain.

377
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,890
Thank Lord Zhi Zhe for his protection.

378
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,840
Do you know where the intruder is now?

379
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,610
The Left Peak reported there was an intruder.

380
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,680
Do you know what they are here for?

381
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,630
The Six Directions Seal and the Splitting Sword.

382
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,050
The Six Directions Seal and the Splitting Sword?

383
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,350
This... Who are they?

384
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,780
The Heavenly Ring reappeared a few months ago.

385
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,060
Zhen Lan, the Crown Prince of Kongsang has awakened again.

386
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,610
If Cangliu hadn't shown mercy to our Qing clan,

387
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,080
we wouldn't have lived to see today.

388
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,470
We surrendered to Cangliu and wouldn't dare be disloyal.

389
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,290
It's good that you know this well.

390
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,560
This Crown Prince of Kongsang is here for the Six Directions Seal.

391
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,020
But what about the Splitting Sword?

392
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,750
This person...

393
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
I must personally capture.

394
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,980
It's inconvenient for the people of Cangliu to enter the boundaries of Jiuyi.

395
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,990
I came here alone.

396
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,670
So, everyone in Jiuyi Mountain must listen to my orders.

397
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,930
Of course.

398
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,770

399
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,110
I'm here.

400
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,770
Gather all the generals in the square

401
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,030
to welcome General Yu Huan.

402
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,610
Yes.

403
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,020
General, please follow me.

404
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,480
King of Jiuyi, this medicine...

405
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,470
Let's set this aside for now.

406
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,660
After you.

407
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,350
What's wrong?

408
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,910
Su Mo, I'm feeling lost.

409
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,310
This forest is very strange. I feel a little unwell.

410
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,230
Take a break.

411
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,120
Be careful.

412
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,450
Release me!

413
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,830
Release me! Release me!

414
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,080
You...

415
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,640
You...

416
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,590
You...

417
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,930
Release her.

[Ya Ran - Leader of Tu Luo]

It's you!

420
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,190
Who are you?

421
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,050
You look exactly like him.

422
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,060
What happened in the past, it's happening again. I didn't imagine the same outcome would happen again.

423
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,200
Who did you say I resemble?

424
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,700
You resemble him, but you aren't him.

425
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,080
He has never used this tone of manner to talk to me before.

426
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,610
Who is he and who are you?

427
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,240
You don't need to know. Since you've already forgotten us,

428
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,800
it doesn't matter if we speak of it.

429
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm Cangliu's General Yu Huan.

430
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,040
I was ordered to come here

431
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,730
in order to eradicate those who have trespassed on Jiuyi Mountain.

432
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,880
All of you must follow my command.

433
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,320
Yes!

434
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,800
In this search, anyone who is found to have trespassed on Jiuyi Mountain

435
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,350
- will be killed immediately.
- Understood!

436
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,430
General, other than capturing the trespassers on Jiuyi Mountain,

437
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,190
do you have any other plans in addition to the search?

438
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,610
I wonder if I may be of any help.

439
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,860
I'd like Prince Qing to find someone to take me

440
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,140
to visit Jiuyi Mountain's Valley of the Ancestral Kings.

441
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,050
I'll arrange for someone immediately.

442
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,740
Thank you for making the effort.

443
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,240
Prince Qing.

444
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,360
Find someone

445
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,880
- to escort General Yu Huan to the Valley of the Ancestral Kings.
- Yes.

446
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,680
In addition,

447
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,040
tell the officers who are doing the search,

448
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,270
they must report anything they find to me first.

449
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,320
I will then report to the general.

450
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,340
Understood?

451
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,750
I understand.

452
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,480
Go on.

453
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,800
I can't let him ruin my plans.

454
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,240
What are you thinking about?

455
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,010
I'm thinking about Tu Luo.

456
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,320
I've realized the person they've been attacking, was me,

457
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,400
not you.

458
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,360
They say that you look like someone.

459
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,330
Who exactly is it?

460
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,620
I saw their gills, so they should be merpeople.

461
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,170
But why would they appear as Tu Luo?

462
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,600
That girl also looked at me with such a gaze of fear.

463
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,140
But I've never met them before.

464
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,610
I don't know why,

465
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,500
but I feel a sense of inexplicable guilt.

466
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,410
The leader of the Tu Luo should have recognized me.

467
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,900
But because of you, she didn't dare acknowledge me.

468
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,710
What do we do now then?

469
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,710
We're trapped in this forest, clueless.

470
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,720
I have a feeling that

471
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,880
they'll appear again.

472
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,600
Let's get out of the Misty Forest first.

473
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,300
All right.

474
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,690
No matter how we've tried, we still can't get out.

475
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,900
I guessed it right. They've appeared again.

476
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,500
Should we catch up to them?

477
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,600
You stay here and wait for me. I'll go take a look.

478
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,180
I'll go with you.

479
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,920
Perhaps they want to see me alone.

480
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,690
- Be careful then.
- You too.

481
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,480
We can chat a little.

482
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,170
With the Kongsang people, especially the Bai clan,

483
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,770
there's nothing to talk about.

484
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,010
What grievance exactly do you hold against me?

485
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,160
Kongsang destroyed Quanxian and sealed the Biluo Sea.

486
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,770
and you would actually ask me if there's any grievance?

487
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,230
These things happened 7,000 years ago.

488
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,780
Su Mo, who's with me, is the Emperor of the Sea.

489
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,080
He has returned. He will lead you back to the Biluo Sea.

490
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,720
Of course, I know he's the Emperor of the Sea.

491
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,360
We transformed into Tu Luo and haven't left

492
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,280
because we believed the Emperor of the Sea would return someday

493
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,690
to obtain the Splitting Sword to rescue the Dragon Deity.

494
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,960
I have survived in this world sustained by that thought alone.

495
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,470
Just waiting for the opportunity to get revenge against the Kongsang.

496
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,530
There must be a misunderstanding in all this.

497
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,000
Seven thousand years ago, Kongsang indeed committed something shameful toward the Quanxian.

498
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,380
But I have never harmed Quanxian.

499
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,690
Also, I've never met you before.

500
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,160
Are you okay?

501
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,600
Those Tu Luo turned out to be merpeople.

502
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,320
They seemed to know me, and they've been waiting for your return.

503
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,720
They've run away too fast every time, and I don't have time to explain.

504
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,790
We still must think of a way to keep them.

505
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,160
Let's hurry and find the Splitting Sword.

506
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,780
Oh, right! I think I saw my younger sister, Bai Lin.

507
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,640
Your younger sister?

508
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,830
Here, be careful.

509
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,950
[Juiyi Palace]

510
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,260
[Jiuyi Palace]

511
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,750
- Yu Huan has left?
- Yes.

512
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,320
They left for the Valley of the Ancestral Kings.

513
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,530
Qing Jun, you must remember your own status.

514
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,780
There are some things that you shouldn't talk about.

515
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,080
The Temple Guardian Lord is right.

516
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,480
I'll definitely be cautious in how I speak and act in the future.

517
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,690
I've taken away the medicine already.

518
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,400
Greetings, King of Jiuyi.

519
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,950
Greetings, King of Jiuyi.

520
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,120
Greetings, King of Jiuyi.

521
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,480
Lin'er! Lin'er!

522
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,640
Are you sure that you saw her?

523
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,200
Even though it was just an instant,

524
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,270
but I'm sure it was her.

525
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,670
Lin'er? Lin'er?

526
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,620
Lin'er.

527
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,830
[Ba Lin - Kongsang Bird Spirit]

528
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,680
Older Sister.

529
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,580
Lin'er.

530
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,120
How is it? Does it still hurt?

531
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm much better.

532
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,960
It's been 100 years.

533
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,160
I had thought...

534
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,730
Older Sister, I've missed you so much.

535
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,700
What are you looking at?

536
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,250
I'm just curious

537
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,960
why Princess Bai Lin would be here on Jiuyi Mountain.

538
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,860
I've always been here.

539
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,750
Always?

540
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:40,320
That's right, Lin'er. Why have you been hiding on Jiuyi Mountain by yourself?

541
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,530
After Jing City was broken,

542
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,880
I was the only one left in the Bai clan.

543
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,030
Uncle, Prince Qing, brought me here.

544
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,940
That's how I survived.

545
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,190
Didn't Qing Chen die?

546
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,530
Yes.

547
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,770
Uncle died soon after he saved me.

548
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,500
The Qing people said,

549
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,260
our ancestors probably felt that we betrayed Kongsang,

550
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,720
so they cast a curse.

551
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,860
Uncle's heirs died one after another.

552
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,870
I finally escaped from Jiuyi Palace. When I was almost dead,

553
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,620
I carelessly breathed in the evil spirit of Jiuyi

554
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,790
and turned into a bird spirit.

555
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,200
Later, the other people in the Qing clan wouldn't acknowledge me.

556
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,330
They said that I was an evil spirit.

557
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,110
They also wouldn't let me return to Jiuyi Palace.

558
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,820
So I've been always been wandering around the mountain.

559
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,460
You mean, for the past 100 years,

560
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,230
you've been surviving as a bird spirit?

561
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,160
Do you doubt me?

562
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,700
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

563
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,170
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

564
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,680
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

565
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,570
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

566
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:40,050
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

567
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,480
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

568
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:50,480
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

569
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,070
♫ We've met several times ♫

570
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,440
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

571
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,480
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

572
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,950
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

573
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,450
♫ You live in there ♫

574
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:17,520
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

575
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,450
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

576
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,410
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

577
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,350
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

578
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,920
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

579
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,290
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

580
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,800
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

581
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,300
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

582
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,180
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

583
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,310
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

584
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:56,340
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

585
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,640
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

586
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,170
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

587
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,200
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

588
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:18,530
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
