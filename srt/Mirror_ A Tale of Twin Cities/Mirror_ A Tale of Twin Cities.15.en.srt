[Episode 15]

3
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,340
Master, you know me?

4
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,340
On the eve of the destruction of Quanxian, I performed a divination.

5
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,080
The next Emperor of the Sea would appear 7,000 years later.

6
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,590
That would be the beginning of all your pain,

7
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,910
However, for you, everything begins after the end.

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,330
[Every beginning starts with an end. The only way to fight the void is through creation and protection.]

9
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,020
So, Na Sheng's divination wasn't a child's game.

10
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,130
7,000 years ago,

11
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,300
my fate had already been engraved on the Wheel of Life.

12
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,290
You summoned me here today. What are your instructions?

13
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,730
I plan to form an alliance with Kongsang to jointly oppose Cangliu.

14
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,000
I wonder if you have any opinions.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,390
You are too much like him.

16
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,600
The 7,000-year dispute between the two parties

17
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,030
is bound to create confusion among our people.

18
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,320
That's right.

19
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,870
You've already decided, you don't need my guidance.

20
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,620
I will listen to you.

21
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,410
Do you know the Ghost and Deity Abyss?

22
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,780
Is this for the seal of the Crown Prince of Kongsang?

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,760
Although we are the only ones who can enter it,

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,840
however, since the placement of the seal,

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,870
a barrier was set up to prevent anyone from entering it.

26
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,270
Do you know how to get in?

27
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,780
That requires the Heavenly Ring.

28
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,560
The Heavenly Ring?

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,390
Thank you for your guidance.

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,550
Fei Lian.

31
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,690
You are quite bold.

32
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,180
Without consent, you deployed the Cangliu army.

33
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,330
You returned without achieving anything and caused countless Wind Falcons to be lost.

34
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,410
Do you know your crime?

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,150
Although you didn't obtain consent,

36
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,170
you also did this for Cangliu

37
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,150
to pursue and bring back the person with the Heavenly Ring and the Emperor of the Sea.

38
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,570
After all,

39
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,820
this was also all to help Yu Huan clean up his mess.

40
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,570
But the people weren't captured.

41
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,880
For many years, I painstakingly established the prestige of the Cangliu army.

42
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,940
Who knows how much of it is left.

43
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,800
Everyone,

44
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,660
this is last night's submission by Yu Huan.

45
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,340
He's already aware of the direction in which the owner of the Heavenly Ring

46
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,340
and the Emperor of the Sea escaped.

47
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,930
It's Jing Lake.

48
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,250
Jing Lake?

49
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,920
Yu Huan is imprisoned.

50
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,490
How did he find that out?

51
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,490
Yu Huan informed me that he set up a barrier in Taoyuan Province

52
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,920
and sealed up all the water routes.

53
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,990
I also followed his instructions

54
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,540
and almost captured the owner of the Heavenly Ring and the Emperor of the Sea.

55
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,730
But we're not sure what methods they used to escape the barrier

56
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,960
and proceed to Jing Lake.

57
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,900
Since when did Cangliu possess this kind of barrier?

58
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,740
No one can prove if this barrier actually exists.

59
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,900
If there isn't, is Yu Huan trying to drag Fei Lian into this crime, too?

60
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,710
Forget it. Forget it.

61
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,280
Everyone, Yu Huan and Fei Lian are Cangliu's young talents.

62
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,010
Although there were losses at the second battle in Taoyuan Province, there were merits too.

63
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,910
The merits were planned by Yu Huan

64
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,290
and carried out by Fei Lian.

65
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,330
Both have shown outstanding military achievements that make up for their mistakes.

66
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,970
Relay this order.

67
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,390
Release Yu Huan and Fei Lian.

68
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, My Lord.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,610
Regarding the rebellion of Kongsang and Quanxian,

70
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,700
how should we counterattack?

71
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,740
Master Peng, we need a victory to boost morale.

72
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,220
Since we know

73
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,000
the direction they escaped,

74
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,720
then this will make it easier.

75

[Illumination Technique... Mirror Technique]

76
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,440
This forbidden technique is the Mirror Technique.

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
This technique has the miracle of healing injuries,

78
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,790
but there's also a kind of backlash.

79
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,200
It needs to rely on a powerful spell

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,470
to subdue the poison from the backlash.

81
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,570
If the injuries and evil are too excessive,

82
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,260
it'll cause evil thoughts to control the body.

83
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,570
The Yin evil is incomparable
(T/N: yin symbolizes darkness while yang symbolizes light)

84
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,360
and will triple the power of backlash.

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,100
Is Su Mo practicing this forbidden technique?

[Yunhuang Records of Forbidden Techniques]

Indeed, I can't go alone to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

88
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,280
The barrier was created by the Heavenly King of Kongsang.

89
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,480
Does Master mean

90
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,840
that I need to enter with Na Sheng?

91
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,780
The Heavenly Ring and the seal must sense each other in order to open the barrier.

92
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,550
Master Peng, please stay.

93
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,370
Saintess, is there something you need?

94
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,020
Is... this regarding your meeting with Lord Zhi Zhe?

95
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,370
Is there a prospect of a solution?

96
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,940
I haven't found the right opportunity yet.

97
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,480
Please do it as soon as possible.

98
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,200
Is there anything else?

99
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,400
At the observatory, when Lord Zhi Zhe was stargazing at night,

100
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,410
he speculated that the land and sea formed an alliance.

101
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,850
Yu Huan has already told me about this.

102
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,010
But what I found strange, was that

103
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,500
Lord Zhi Zhe unexpectedly stopped me from telling the five masters.

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,940
You mustn't spout nonsense.

105
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,150
Since he knows about this, why didn't he tell us?

106
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,560
Don't tell anyone about this.

107
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,650
Pay closer attention to Lord Zhi Zhe.

108
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,230
Tell me if there's any news.

109
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,650
Yes.

110
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,250
By the way, where did Yu Huan

111
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,860
learn Kongsang's spells?

112
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,100
I have no idea.

113
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Once he's out of prison, tell him to see me immediately.

114
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,210
Yes.

115
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,040
I'll take my leave then.

116
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,740
How can your father in the underworld not worry about you?

117
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,760
You're going to go to complain at my father's grave again.

118
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,590
Fei Lian!

119
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,800
Why do you listen to Yu Huan so much?

120
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,620
You invited him to drink and conduct tasks for him.

121
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,920
He wanted you to dispatch the troops and you did.

122
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,420
Without a comprehensive plan either.

123
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,330
How do you know there isn't any?

124
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,990
I'm the one who underestimated the Quanxian.

125
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,210
Still arguing on his behalf!

126
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,600
Saying that he would push them into a narrow area and then set fire to the merpeople.

127
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,870
Nonsense!

128
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,650
If he's that capable,

129
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,920
why didn't he go on his own?

130
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,200
If you hadn't taken such rash actions this time,

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,990
I would've used my full power to use this unforeseen event to make him disappear.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,850
But look at what you did!

133
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,440
But... about this,

134
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,330
if Master Peng didn't point out that

135
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,240
Yu Huan wanted to pull this trick on his own

136
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,600
to reverse the disadvantage with one move.

137
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,140
Then today, his shrewdness is not to be underestimated.

138
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,700
From now, you must be more cautious around him

139
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,200
and don't let him use you again.

140
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,280
Yes.

141
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,180
What's going on?

142
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,890
Isn't it supposed to be like this?

143
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,850
Eat some grilled chicken. Try this first.

144
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,410
So fragrant.

145
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,210
Big Uncle, your roast chicken is grilled so well. If you were in the Central Plains, you could set up a shop.

146
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,260
Ting taught me.

147
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,740
Wandering around for the past hundred years, she learned how to cook all the dishes in Yuhuang.

148
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,980
It's fine. Eat.

149
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,560
Ting saved my life.

150
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,820
I definitely won't waste her sacrifice. I will study hard the magic techniques from this book.

151
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,710
This way, no matter where I go in the future, I can walk 1,000 miles a day, come and go in an instant.

152
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,280
I won't be afraid of the Cangliu people capturing me again.

153
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,180
You're ambitious.

154
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,360
In my mind, my mission is to help you unseal the Six Directions Seal and Dragon Deity Seal as soon as possible

155
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,210
and defeat the Cangliu!

156
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,540
And then...

157
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,130
And then fly off together with Yan Xi forever.

158
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,620
Swimming together is fine, too. I'll go with Yan Xi to the Biluo Sea.

159
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,640
Big Uncle, after I finish eating, can you hurry and train me?

160
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,280
I want to quickly learn how to walk 1,000 miles a day.

161
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,950
I can teach you.

162
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,130
But even if I teach you the magic technique first,

163
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,860
you still can't cultivate enough to walk 1,000 miles a day.

164
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,870
Why?

165
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,380
We've cultivated for many years already.

166
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,530
It takes that long?

167
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,510
No, no, no. I believe I can learn quickly as long as I train diligently.

168
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,090
Who knows, maybe I'm naturally talented?

169
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,000
After all, I was chosen by the Heavenly Ring.

170
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,130
Fine. Go ahead and eat.

171
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,830
For Quanxian to ally with Kongsang,

172
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,600
what Young Master says makes sense.

173
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
But I'm still worried.

174
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,480
Elder Yu's thoughts are similar to mine.

175
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,500
Quanxian and Kongsang have 7,000 years of grievances.

176
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,390
Can we so easily let go of them just like that?

177
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,160
I originally thought, when the Emperor of the Sea returned, he would be able to take us back to the Biluo Sea.

178
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,070
But now, he actually wants to ally with the Kongsang.

179
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,450
Young Master wants us to let go of our grievances.

180
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,480
Will the Kongsang people really let go of theirs?

181
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,010
They keep saying that Kongsang's ruin

182
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,720
from a hundred years ago was because of the Quanxian.

183
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,350
I'm concerned that their alliance is fake,

184
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,880
and what they really want is revenge.

185
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,020
Elder Quan, you can't just randomly say that.

186
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,080
I heard that before Young Master returned to the main camp,

187
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,790
he fought a battle against Cangliu's Wind Falcons.

188
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,230
Quanxian's main camp in Jing Lake

189
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,480
will probably be exposed sooner or later.

190
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,150
The idea that an alliance will let us return to the Biluo Sea

191
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,760
is not the best choice.

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,160
In my opinion, all of this

193
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,980
needs further discussion and long-term planning.

194
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,250
We should dispatch Han Zhou to contact our spy who's hiding in Cangliu.

195
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,860
See if there's any news.

196
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,470
Ning Liang, what are you thinking about?

197
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,390
I just heard the elders

198
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,920
talking about the Land-Sea Alliance.

199
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,050
What did they say?

200
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,620
The elders are also afraid

201
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,420
that Young Master will be cheated by the Kongsang.

202
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,590
If there is an alliance, Young Master must have decided.

203
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,220
As subordinates, we shouldn't doubt his decision.

204
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,830
Even more so, we shouldn't believe random gossip.

205
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,280
Do you really believe in the Young Master that much?

206
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,660
Is he definitely right?

207
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,550
I've known the Young Master for 100 years. He even saved my life.

208
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,170
No matter where he wants to go, what decision he makes,

209
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,420
I'll always follow and not leave or abandon him.

210
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,730
I witnessed how the elderly people of our tribe lived a life worse than death in prison.

211
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,510
Those bastards suddenly went into the prison, saying they'll give them a quick death. That so-called quick death...

212
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,090
was to pour buckets of boiling water on their bodies.

213
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,020
Yan Xi,

214
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,310
I will never believe anyone for the rest of my life.

215
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,010
- But in Taoyuan Village—
- So what?

216
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,860
How can you be sure that this isn't the warm water that's prepared to be used to cook us alive?!

217
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,380
Ning Liang.

218
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,170
You've changed.

219
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
Yan Xi.

220
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,920
You're the one who's changed.

221
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,530
Ning Liang, what's wrong? Did you fight with Yan Xi?

222
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,330
I don't want to talk much with him. He still can't overcome his impulsive nature.

223
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,650
If we had known about today, why boast in the past?

224
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,220
[Cangliu - Imperial Prison]

225
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,390
Yu Huan went to prison and set up such a big plan this time.

226
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,360
He didn't mention it to you beforehand, did he?

227
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,720
With this kind of arbitrary decision, he wants to gain merits, does he not?

228
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,580
His scheming mind and ambition are quite big.

229
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,190
What I question is...

230
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,300
where did Yu Huan learn

231
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,650
this kind of Kongsang magical technique?

232
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,230
Jing Lake is very large. If he wants to set up a barrier,

233
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,590
it's impossible to do without a very high level of power.

234
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,860
Such a highly advanced level of Kongsang power,

235
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,000
could it be... that person?

236
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,680
Could Lord Zhi Zhe have secretly summoned him to meet?

237
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,520
Yu Zhu never mentioned it to me.

238
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,320
Why would the Saintess tell you about this kind of opportunity?

239
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,660
After all, that's her younger brother.

240
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,090
[Cangliu's Military Camp - Wind Falcon Storehouse]

241
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,720
It was so difficult to finally get into Cangliu's troops. How can you wish for death?

242
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,350
You...

243
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,660
I'm General Fei Lian's subordinate. My name is Xiang.

244
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,650
I finally have a chance to chat with you.

245
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,250
How did you...

246
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,480
Using my willpower, I broke through Cangliu's mind-control technique.

247
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,050
After that, I was kept in the Cangliu's troops to send news to the main camp.

248
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,670
For Ting, you shouldn't seek death.

249
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,300
She was my younger sister.

250
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:23,760
Are you willing to work with me to do your share for Quanxian, for everyone?

251
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,790
Cangliu has dominated the world with their strong machines and techniques.

252
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,820
If we can pass out the secrets of their machines and techniques,

253
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,630
Quanxian's odds of winning will increase a little.

254
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,750
Consider doing it for your younger sister's sake.

255
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm willing.

256
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,100
You've recovered your memory?

257
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,960
You can't talk anymore?

258
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,680
You've remembered everything on the Wind Falcon that day?

259
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,040
I killed my own younger sister.

260
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,250
So, after killing your own loved one,

261
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,560
you wanted redemption by killing yourself?

262
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,590
I can't return to Quanxian, nor do I want to go back.

263
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,790
When you were missing, there was nowhere for me to go in this world.

264
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,820
What? Now that I'm here,

265
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,190
you have a place to stay?

266
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,470
If General wants me to live, I'll live.

267
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,520
If General wants me to die,

268
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,300
I won't live a day longer.

269
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,520
Good.

270
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,160
Remember what you said today. Since I like using sharp blades,

271
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,600
I'm not afraid of cutting my own hands. But I'll tell you this.

272
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,230
I gave you your life.

273
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,230
Without my order, you're forbidden to die. Do you hear me?

274
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,690
Yes. I'll take my leave.

275
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,790
If there is anything you need in the future, you can throw three stones into Jing Lake.

276
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,600
Young Master.

277
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,190
What has happened to the things I asked you and the Right Commissioner to prepare?

278
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,710
Our people in Jing City sent this back.

279
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,780
Inside is a map of Jing City and the intel that you wanted.

280
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,880
Cangliu is under the Five Masters' control right now.

281
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,620
Also, regarding General Yu Huan who you specifically asked about,

282
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,770
his situation is also in there. His background is unusual.

283
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,140
Yu Huan has a vice general named Nan Zhao.

284
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,880
Nan Zhao?

285
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,280
He's only a small character. Why do you...

286
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,900
How is he a small character if he can become a vice general?

287
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,610
In the battle at Taoyuan, Yu Huan lost.

288
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,870
I could tell that Nan Zhao was quite happy.

289
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:56,470
From what he said, I could tell he's quite dissatisfied with Yu Huan.

290
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,560
Perhaps, we can take advantage of it.

291
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,350
- Young Master?
- What is the matter?

292
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,950
Princess Bai of Kongsang is here.

293
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,960
- Where is she?
- By the lakeside.

294
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,350
I think, since Quanxian and Kongsang aren't in an official alliance yet,

295
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,750
it's not proper to let her come inside or the elders may be displeased.

296
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,860
I'll go to the lakeside to take a look.

297
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,230
Bai Ying.

298
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,740
You came in person? I thought a guard would come.

299
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,250
I happened to be on my way out.

300
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,120
Are you going out?

301
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,450
Then... Then I'll come to bother you another day.

302
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,180
I wanted to take a stroll in the woods. Let's go together.

303
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,280
Why were you looking for me today?

304
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Crown Prince said that, after the battle at Taoyuan Village,

305
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,590
your spiritual consciousness was seriously damaged.

306
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,790
He told me to come and see how you were recovering.

307
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,320
So it's Zhen Lan who's concerned about me.

308
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,840
Since we're allies now, of course, we want to care about our allies.

309
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,840
So, to you, I'm also an ally?

310
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,670
To us, all the merpeople are our allies.

311
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,430
Since we're allies, we can't help but meet again in the future.

312
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,540
Are you using the Mirror Technique?

313
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,900
I carefully recalled. That day, the one who injured me in the Ruyi Gambling House

314
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,350
wasn't the real you. Right?

315
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,880
I checked the books. The Mirror Technique is a forbidden technique in Yunhuang.

316
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,280
Even though the cultivator can heal quickly,

317
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,480
it will still have a strong backlash.

318
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,820
Whenever the dark aura floats around you, it's the backlash, is it not?

319
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,250
I know that the Mirror Technique can result in backlash.

320
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,790
But right now, I cannot allow any weakness to be exploited by the enemy.

321
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,380
I also cannot let people have the slightest distraction or concern.

322
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,190
I've found a method that uses orchids as the medicinal primer,
(T/N: Dendrobium porphyrochilum)

323
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,010
and then using my swordmaster's technique to adjust your aura.

324
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,020
Even though this healing method is slow, it won't cause a backlash.

325
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,630
Orchid?

326
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,550
Orchids have a cold nature and suit your particular physique.

327
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,770
Also, it's Quanxian's holy healing medicine.

328
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,810
If you want to help me heal,

329
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,940
you'll always be by my side. Right?

330
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,960
Since we are allies, to help you heal, of course, I'd...

331
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,540
A hundred years ago, you were also the first person to heal me.

332
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Su Mo, I don't want to be healing your injuries anymore.

333
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,260
Don't get injured anymore.

334
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,470
How can I not get injured along this path?

335
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,600
If it's something that cannot be done, I won't promise you

336
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,730
- because I won't lie to you.
- So you'll keep harming yourself then?

337
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,060
Do the other Quanxuan people know?

338
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,610
No one else knows about my cultivating the Mirror Technique.

339
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,100
You're concerned that Aunt Ru and the others will worry.

340
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,150
They've endured several hundred years of torment.

341
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,520
I know what they long for

342
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,180
is a healthy and strong Emperor of the Sea.

343
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,100
If there wasn't an alliance, then you wouldn't use the Mirror Technique anymore?

344
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:58,600
I promise you. I won't use the Mirror Technique unless it's my last resort.

345
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,450
Really?

346
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,510
I won't lie to you.

347
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,450
Oh, yes! There's something else.

348
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,780
In order to unseal the Six Directions Seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss,

349
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,710
Na Sheng also needs to come.

350
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,660
Because the barrier there requires the Heavenly Ring to unlock it.

351
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,190
But Na Sheng isn't able to go to the Ghost and Deity Abyss by herself.

352
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,260
If this matter cannot be resolved,

353
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,440
I'm afraid it'll be very difficult to unseal the seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

354
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,780
I need to go back and discuss this matter with His Highness.

355
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,310
All right.

356
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,230
I must go back now.

357
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,560
This concealing cape was constructed by His Highness using his magic power.

358
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,020
It can only last a short time.

359
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,470
[Yunhuang Record of Forbidden Techniques]

360
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,570
Your Highness, what are you doing?

361
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,680
Your Highness, just tell me whatever you need.

362
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,320
Look at this, you've made a mess of all the books.

363
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,730
I thought about it carefully. That day, the barrier in the water channel at Taoyuan Village,

364
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:09,090
the more I think about it, the stranger it feels.

365
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,540
What do you mean?

366
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,550
Think about it, High Priest.

367
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,360
Wasn't the barrier set up by Cangliu's people?

368
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,180
But they used our Kongsang ancestor's water prison technique.

369
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,270
How did this happen? How can Cangliu use the same techniques as ours?

370
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,940
I've read the Dark Golden Classics.

371
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,210
But it was only half of the book, so I couldn't find anything.

372
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,830
That's why I wanted to come here and see

373
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,790
if there were any clues.

374
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,570
I need to check first.

375
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,290
I wonder how Princess Bai's visit to Quanxian's main camp

376
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,420
at Jing Lake went.

377
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,470
She went to Quanxian's main camp?

378
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,050
Yes, right after you left the great hall.

379
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,790
Your Highness. High Priest.

380
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,890
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

381
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,080
You're back.

382
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,390
Just now, I went to Quanxian's camp at Jing Lake.

383
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,240
- I discussed with Su Mo about unsealing the seal.
- Any progress?

384
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,010
Su Mo said there's a powerful barrier inside the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

385
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,050
According to him, the Six Directions Seal

386
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,240
has formed a barrier by itself, and needs Na Sheng to go.

387
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,400
When the Six Directions Seal and the Heavenly Ring resonate with each other,

388
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,930
that's when the barrier will be opened.

389
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,610
But only merpeople can go down to the Ghost and Deity Abyss, right?

390
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,460
That's why I've asked you to come.

391
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,510
Na Sheng is from the Central Plains. She doesn't have any magic power to protect herself.

392
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,750
Do you know of any magic powers

393
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,020
or a magical device that can resolve this problem?

394
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,130
Yes! Yes!

395
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,070
There really is something like that.

396
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,560
It's called-called...

397
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,750
called the Water Dispelling Pearl.

398
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,700
Back then, Queen Bai Wei particularly enjoyed going traveling into the sea.

399
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,090
She had a precious pearl.

400
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,280
On this pearl, there is a white rose's yellow core.

401
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,110
When wearing it, Queen Bai Wei could walk underwater.

402
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,270
She wasn't afraid of water no matter how deep it was.

403
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,590
Where is this Water Dispelling Pearl now?

404
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,450
It's... I can't remember.

405
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,370
High Priest, think harder.

406
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,830
I still can't remember even if I try.

407
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,970
Think slowly.

408
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,640
[Accumulate Strength Through Knowledge]

409
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,580
General.

410
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,840
You're looking radiant today.

411
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,800
What?

412
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,730
Are you disappointed that I'm not still in prison?

413
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,950
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare.

414
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,980
I'm just surprised.

415
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,300
I heard General was just released from prison.

416
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,450
and immediately rushed to Xin Zhui

417
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,600
to bring back the beautiful merperson who drives his Wind Falcon.

418
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,620
I actually thought General would look poor in complexion

419
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,080
- due to the recent hardships.
- You are really despicable.
(T/N: double-meaning of hardship, also means he's been sexually overworking himself)

420
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,990
What did you say?

421
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,750
I was saying you...

422
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,820
Master Peng.

423
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,770
Yu Huan, about the Land-Sea Alliance,

424
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,080
have you heard of it?

425
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,930
I've heard my older sister mention it a little.

426
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,040
Since you both already know,

427
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,310
then let me get to the main point.

428
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,660
I asked you to come today

429
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,790
because I want to hear if you have any plans to counter it.

430
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,240
I think we don't need to have so many schemes against the merpeople.

431
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,540
Just be direct.

432
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,010
They have a weak and sentimental nature.

433
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,220
We'll kill some of the merpeople inside the city.

434
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,420
The Quanxian army will definitely show up to save them.

435
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,550
By then, the Emperor of the Sea will naturally take command personally.

436
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,780
Then at that time, we can just kill him off, once and for all.

437
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,750
Killing the merpeople will only strengthen the alliance between the Kongsang and Quanxian.

438
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,780
We still don't fully understand the power of the Land-Sea Alliance.

439
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,440
- If we rashly provoke them, wouldn't Cangliu—
- General.

440
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,470
Are you scared after having been defeated twice by that Emperor of the Sea?

441
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,650
I'm not scared.

442
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,200
If the battle does break out, just let me handle that Emperor of the Sea.

443
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,210
I don't believe the Emperor of the Sea is really invincible—

444
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,890
You couldn't capture him at the Taoyuan Province's gate either, right?

445
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,460
It sounds like...

446
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,580
Yu Huan doesn't seem to agree with Nan Zhao's plan.

447
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,760
Nan Zhao's plan is too cumbersome.

448
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,370
What plan do you have to counter then?

449
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,760
We must discuss the Entrapped Dragon Abyss further.

450
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Young Master!

451
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,020
It's just a sound pearl.

452
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,420
Why are you in such a panic?

453
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,560
This sound pearl came from Jing City.

454
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,490
Jing City?

455
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,090
Could it be from Han Zhou?

456
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,090
Master Peng has gathered merpeople in the city

457
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,910
and invites the Emperor of the Sea to meet at Jing City's camp today to discuss an alliance.

458
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,880
Alliance?

459
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,800
- An alliance with Cangliu?
- What alliance!

460
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,100
Gathering the merpeople in the city? They are threatening Young Master by using our tribe's people.

461
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,930
They're definitely planning something evil.

462
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:54,590
They probably want to harm Young Master, too.

463
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,180
Those Cangliu people won't even give us time to prepare.

464
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,010
I've dealt with Cangliu's people a few times.

465
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,550
They should know

466
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,830
it's not that easy to trap me.

467
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,540
But what are Cangliu planning with this maneuver?

468
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,000
Could it be that they heard about

469
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,170
the Land-Sea Alliance?

470
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,590
They've also seen the Emperor of the Sea's abilities.

471
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,150
So they want to win us over to oppose Kongsang.

472
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,540
If we ally with the Cangliu

473
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,490
and force Kongsang to release the Dragon Deity,

474
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,840
it's also another way to do things.

475
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,680
Elder Yu, you mean, instead of allying with the Kongsang,

476
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,810
it's better to ally with the Cangliu?

477
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,730
It's still the Emperor of the Sea's decision.

478
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,130
We naturally need to rescue those who are captured.

479
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:55,280
Since they've issued an invitation, I'll accept the invitation to attend.

480
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,960
Yan Xi, come with me.

481
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,460
Yes.

482
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,570
I can come along, too.

483
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,820
No. You're to stay here in the main camp.

484
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,520
Yes.

485
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,580
I'm going to the city right now to capture some merpeople

486
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,120
to use for today's negotiation.

487
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,020
Who will go with me?

488
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,810
General Nan Zhao, I'll go.

489
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,660
I'll go, too.

490
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,960
Xiao.

491
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,640
G-General.

492
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,280
What are you doing?

493
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,370
I-I'm replenishing the weapons.

494
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,040
Is that so?

495
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,180
How thoughtful of you, but this is the carpenter's work.

496
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,680
You're only in charge of flying.

497
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,230
Yes.

498
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,910
What does General plan to do next?

499
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,420
Patrol.

500
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,120
- Be ready to leave.
 - Yes.

501
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:38,720
It was my plan, but why did Master Peng promote Nan Zhao to General?

502
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,520
Have your injuries healed?

503
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,000
I...

504
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,360
Master Peng has ordered you

505
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,510
to serve him in the main hall today.

506
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,640
It's all thanks to General Yu Huan's good plan.

507
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,490
The Emperor of the Sea has agreed to meet to negotiate an alliance.

508
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,040
Since the Emperor of the Sea is coming,

509
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,170
of course, merpeople must be present to serve.

510
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,570
- Emperor of the Sea?
- No matter what,

511
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,800
even in Quanxian, Xiao is considered

512
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,380
quite a beauty.

513
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,830
Take away your hand.

514
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,770
That's right.

515
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:46,020
I won't disturb the two of you then. You should enjoy it.

516
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,530
Oh, right! Don't forget to serve the Emperor of the Sea well today.

517
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,000
Maybe if you serve him well,

518
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,680
he might just take you away.

519
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,160
General.

520
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,540
Do as he says.

521
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,790
What?

522
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,620
With Su Mo coming, do you have other ideas?

523
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,080
No.

524
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,280
What are you doing? The chicken is burned.

525
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,290
- It smells good.
- Doesn't it?

526
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,360
- Big Uncle, what are you sprinkling on it?
- It's a spice Ting left me.

527
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,800
If we also had some wine,

528
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,270
it would be excellent.

529
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,400
Sister Bai Ying!

530
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,930
Why are you here?

531
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,430
I came to see how your magic training has been progressing.

532
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,270
Sit, sit. I'm practicing every day.

533
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,660
Why are you just like Brother Crown Prince?

534
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,550
Look at this.

535
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,630
You recited the wrong spell again.

536
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,560
I'll practice more. Maybe I won't need to fear the Cangliu people later on.

537
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,060
A'Ying, is there anything else?

538
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,530
There's a change regarding going to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

539
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,440
What's the matter?

540
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,510
Na Sheng, you need to learn some underwater techniques next.

541
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,270
You'll need to go down to the Ghost and Deity Abyss with Su Mo.

542
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,720
I have to go, too?

543
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,430
But I don't want to go with Brother Ice Cube.

544
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,610
Can I go with Yan Xi?

545
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,460
Yan Xi, Yan Xi. Hearing this name,

546
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,880
is growing calluses in my ear.

547
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,010
Su Mo has strong powers. You'll be safer going with him.

548
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,720
But I don't know how to swim.

549
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,820
The Water Avoidance Talisman that Su Mo gave me last time only lasted a short time.

550
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,610
How can I go into the water?

551
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,020
Don't worry. We're going to find a precious pearl for you.

552
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,710
With that pearl, you can safely go into the water.

553
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,760
Precious pearl?

554
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,920
They're giving me a pearl!

555
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,670
When she hears about treasure, she gets hungrier than hearing about food.

556
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,760
Can't I have just a little something that I enjoy?

557
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,770
Fine.

558
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,310
I hope everything will go well in the future.

559
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,860
It has to be. It has to be!

560
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,670
Sister Bai Ying, can you come with Brother Crown Prince next time?

561
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,620
I haven't seen him for a while, I miss him a little.

562
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,260
Every day I only have Uncle Xi Jing to keep me company. How boring!

563
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:23,410
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

564
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,840
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

565
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,450
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

566
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:37,220
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

567
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,740
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

568
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,240
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

569
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:51,150
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

570
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,680
♫ We've met several times ♫

571
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,080
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

572
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:05,250
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

573
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,680
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

574
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,140
♫ You live in there ♫

575
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:18,300
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

576
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,170
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

577
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,160
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

578
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,090
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

579
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,630
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

580
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,990
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

581
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,580
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

582
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:45,990
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

583
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,930
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

584
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,000
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

585
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,860
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

586
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,340
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

587
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,760
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

588
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,840
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

589
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:19,450
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
