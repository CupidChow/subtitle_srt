[Episode 37]

3
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,560
What do I need to do then?

4
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,930
It's better that you remain here at Quanxian camp.

5
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,340
When we go to the enemy's camp, it is better if fewer people go.

6
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,920
What's more, you also have the power of Heaven with you.

7
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,080
We can't put you at risk for Princess Bai's sake.

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,830
Na Sheng, we are going to the camp to rescue Yan Xi.

9
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,460
Someone must remain here to prepare for Yan Xi's arrival.

10
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,010
Okay. Ning Liang, your rescue of Yan Xi must go smoothly.

11
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,840
It will.

12
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,490
Young Master, the pallor of your face...

13
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm fine.

14
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,810
Then I'll go contact Xiang about Yan Xi's rescue.

15
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,400
I'll go take care of Older Sister Bai Ying, then.

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,360
I'll go find Xi Jing and head towards Taoyuan Province later.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,870
All right.

18

- Emperor of the Sea.
- Master, I can feel an extremely

19
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,090
powerful force about to give me a backlash.

20
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,340
It's getting serious. You mustn't force it.

21
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,940
Princess Bai's injury isn't that serious. Regaining consciousness is just a matter of time.

22
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,560
You must stay in seclusion to heal your injury

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,620
and control the reaction to the backlash. I will help you.

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,130
Thank you, Master.

25
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,120
Brother Crown Prince, don't worry.

26
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,290
Leave this to me. I will take good care of Older Sister Bai Ying.

27
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,620
I'm at ease, then.

28
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,570
Then, when you go to Taoyuan Province, you must succeed.

29
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,560
Your Highness.

30
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,100
- You're finally here.
- How's Na Sheng, A'Ying, and the others?

31
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,960
- They're fine. It is just that A'Ying...
- What's wrong with her?

32
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,150
She is staying at Quanxian camp to recover from her injuries. Fortunately, her life is not in danger.

33
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,110
In order to treat her injury, Su Mo lost a lot of his magic.

34
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,630
Right now, he is in seclusion in order to recuperate.

35
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,390
A'Ying is in a coma. Su Mo is in seclusion.

36
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,830
What should we do next, then?

37
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,630
I called you here to tell you about what's next.

38
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,740
This is a good solution. We can try it.

39
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,360
Yes. This is urgent and must not be delayed.

40
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,060
We are going to look for Gao Shunzhao tonight.

41
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,750
All right. I will go make the arrangements.

42
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,650
Your Highness. Zhen Lan. General Xi Jing.

43
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,270
It's been a long time since we met.

44
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,710
After we last said our farewells here, I wondered how everyone was doing.

45
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,850
I'm fine.

46
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,950
You should know our motive for coming here.

47
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,060
In this campaign, Cangliu has been injuring and killing people.

48
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,090
After going through the battle with the Wind Falcons, Taoyuan Province

49
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,270
has been badly damaged.
[Gao Shunzhao - Cangliu - Taoyuan Province Governer]

50
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,120
This is the time that many things are waiting to be done.

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,880
Can you show me the way?

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't dare prescribe a way.

53
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,100
We merely would like to collaborate with you.

54
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,590
Are you saying we should

55
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,520
submit to Kongsang and Quanxian

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,860
and become an affiliated province of theirs?

57
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,350
If that's the case,

58
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,740
what's the difference if we do the same thing with Cangliu right now?

59
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,740
This isn't what I meant.

60
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,830
I'm saying...

61
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,870
We should create a new and peaceful Yunhuang together.

62
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,880
Just like how Quanxian and Kongsang formed the Land-Sea Alliance.

63
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,010
It's definitely not to surrender to another to create an alliance.

64
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,200
But it's an alliance for the sake of stabilizing each other's lives.

65
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,450
I know that you are diligent in government affairs and love your people,

66
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,480
and that they're everything to you.

67
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,170
It's the same for us. Kongsang hopes that our 100,000 people can see the sun again.

68
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,760
Quanxian also hopes to be able to return to Bilou Sea.

69
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,050
We are all doing this for our people,

70
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,640
fighting for peace for them.

71
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,030
When we returned to Taoyuan Province, I had wanted to convince you to serve the Young Master as well,

72
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,390
but I know that you have always wanted the people to live in peace.

73
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,110
And not be someone who depends on power.

74
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,290
Based on my understanding of Young Master, he doesn't want more power either.

75
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,460
He only wants us to live a peaceful and happy life.

76
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,980
We all understand each other; this is what people yearn for.

77
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,260
It's generally the same thing that you wish for them as well.

78
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,020
Let Taoyuan Province become a new Taoyuan.

79
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,100
That's right.

80
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,290
All these years, Cangliu has abused its military power in fierce wars

81
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,680
turning Taoyuan Province into ruins.

82
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,230
After experiencing this campaign and suffering heavy and terrible losses,

83
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,220
it's like sitting on pins and needles.

84
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,770
If you can give the people a peaceful life,

85
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,840
I will definitely help you.

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,850
I won't give up

87
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,260
on giving the people of Taoyuan Province this opportunity.

88
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,470
Governor Gao, don't worry.

89
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,430
We won't disappoint you.

90
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,150
All right.

91
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,200
Then... how do we arrange this? What do you want to do?

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,560

[Taoyuan Province Government Office]

96
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,960
Bad news, the lord was attacked by an assassin!

97
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,390
My Lord, there was an assassination at Governor Gao's council office in Taoyuan Province.

98
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,570
Gao Shunzhao encountered an assassination attempt. It's not clear if he's dead or alive.

99
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,480
I understand.

100
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,160
What do you think of this?

101
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,630
It's very obvious that it was done by the Kongsang.

102
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,050
Their motive is also obvious. It is to take control of Taoyuan Province.

103
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,500
If Gao Shunzhao had an unexpected accident,

104
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,060
they will have taken control of his Gold Two-Headed Green Finch command token.

105
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,680
Then...

106
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,240
Taoyuan Province will belong to the Kongsang.

107
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,990
I request to lead an army to Taoyuan Province to suppress the rebellion.

108
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,860
To suppress the rebellion...

109
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,360
Naturally, I will send someone.

110
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,340
I'm going to hand you an even more important mission.

111
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,560
Young Master is in seclusion. Keep a tight watch.

112
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,590
Don't let anyone go near him. Understand?

113
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

114
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,720
Ning Liang, I guessed you would be here.

115
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,210
Of course, I would be here. Young Master is in seclusion. I'm worried.

116
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,380
What are you worried about?

117
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,100
You wouldn't understand.

118
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,070
Right Commissioner, there's news from Taoyuan Province.

119
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,260
His Highness and General Xi Jing have already taken control of Gao Shunzhao

120
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,000
and have succeeded in attracting the attention of Cangliu.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,780
- You can leave.
- Yes.

122
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,210
Crown Prince Zhen Lan and the others have succeeded.

123
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,770
Xiang should be starting to make her move as well.

124
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,150
What about Yan Xi?

125
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,190
Young Master and the rest have already developed a plan. I'm going to meet up with Xiang.

126
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,220
Nothing dangerous will happen.

127
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,930
Then... Then you must take care of your safety.

128
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,880
- Set out on an expedition to Taoyuan Province!
 - Yes, Sir!

129
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,830
Bai Ying, are you awake?

130
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,650
You've slept for such a long time.

131
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,830
Have you dreamed a lot?

132
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,840
I wonder...

133
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,460
if I'm in your dreams.

134
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,890
Bai Ying.

135
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,520
Who are you?

136
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,180
I'm here to bring you out of here.

137
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,050
Who are you? Where are you?

138
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,970
What is this?

139
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,430
- Tears.
- Tears?

140
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,430
- Whose tears?
- They're mine.

141
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,650
Why is this with me?

142
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,830
Because my beloved one refuses to wake up.

143
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,260
I'm afraid to lose her.

144
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,580
Who's your beloved one? Where are you?

145
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,390
Follow me.

146
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,250
Bai Ying... come with me.

147
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,550
You're awake.

148
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,210
Emperor of the Sea, you've crossed the line.

149
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,600
What is this place?

150
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,740
This is Quanxian's main camp.

151
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:04,220
You've forgotten. After you were injured, I brought you here to heal.

152
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,520
Don't you remember?

153
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,490
I am Su Mo.

154
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,680
I know that you are Su Mo.

155
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,100
Unless you forcefully open her five rhythms and six senses and then infuse magic power.

156
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,390
But if you do this forcefully,

157
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,150
it'll cause damage to Princess Bai.

158
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,210
Is it because of this that Bai Ying is keeping her distance from me?

159
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,380
Other than remembering that I'm the Emperor of the Sea, what else do you remember?

160
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,670
I remember... the Land-Sea Alliance.

161
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,200
We went to undo the seal together.

162
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,560
Undo the seal...

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,470
Where is His Highness?

164
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,630
He isn't here.

165
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,670
Where did he go?

166
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,190
He went to Taoyuan Province. He'll return soon.

167
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,020
Don't worry just yet.

168
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,540
It's probably because you just woke up,

169
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,010
so you're feeling a little confused.

170
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,290
Rest for a while first. I'll go prepare medicine for you.

171
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,660
What is this?

172
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,950
A tear.

173
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
Young Master.

174
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,720
Prepare medicine for Bai Ying.

175
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,510
Princess Bai is awake?

176
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,090
Now that she's awake, is Princess Bai all right?

177
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,420
Her body still needs to recover. Also...

178
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,940
Also what?

179
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,510
She doesn't seem to totally recognize me.

180
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,600
"Doesn't totally recognize you." What does that mean?

181
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,700
She knows that I'm Emperor of the Sea.

182
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,740
But she... doesn't know Su Mo.

183
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,670
Maybe her body is weak after

184
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,080
recovering from a severe injury?

185
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,580
Yes. Let's wait until she recovers.

186
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,670
Young Master, you don't need to worry too much.

187
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,130
At least Princess Bai has awakened. Everything will be fine.

188
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,650
Yes, at least she has awakened.

189
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,690
- Young Master.
- Emperor of the Sea, His Highness the Crown Prince asked me to come to take care of A'Ying.

190
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,680
You'll still be free in the future. You can go wherever you want.

191
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,860
Choose someone you love and stay together for a lifetime.

192
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,520
A merperson...

193
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,930
can only love one person in their whole lifetime.

194
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,460
A'Yuan,

195
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,350
it's been a long time.

196
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,500
It's been a long time, Zhi Xiu.

197
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,990
How is A'Ying right now?

198
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,180
She just woke up.

199
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,180
That's great. Then, I'll go see her right away

200
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,450
Follow me.

201
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,850
Sister Hong Yuan, you've come.

202
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,610
Thankfully, Su Mo saved you again.

203
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,750
What happened to you when you were in the Stranded Dragon Abyss?

204
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,200
Saved me again? Did he save me before?

205
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't you remember?

206
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,770
I remember going to the Ruyi Gambling House.

207
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,530
I was looking for Na Sheng.

208
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,950
Do you remember someone named Su Mo?

209
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,970
Why are you asking this, too?

210
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,300
Has something happened?

211
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,180
Nothing. You just woke up and need to recuperate.

212
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,470
You should take it slow until you've completely recovered.

213
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,290
I'll go pour a cup of water for you. First, get some rest.

214
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,060
Young Master.

215
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,190
Deliver it later.

216
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,740
Yes.

217
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,780
You two... haven't seen each other for a hundred years.

218
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,980
After we bid farewell a hundred years ago, we never saw each other again.

219
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,010
To be able to meet again after a hundred years, it's truly fated.

220
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,570
Brother Ice Cube! Brother Ice Cube, you're out of seclusion?

221
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,110
How are you? Are you better now?

222
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,900
- How about Sister Bai Ying?
- She's awake.

223
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,210
This is wonderful. Wonderful.

224
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,960
Oh right, Brother Ice Cube.

225
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,740
What's the matter?

226
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,470
News just came from Taoyuan Province. We can go rescue Yan Xi.

227
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,200
The news was sent to you?

228
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,740
Ning Liang received the news.

229
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,190
- Why didn't she tell me?
- You were still in seclusion.

230
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,990
Ning Liang went ahead and left to rescue Yan Xi.

231
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,880
- How could she go by herself?
- Ning Liang is so strong,

232
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,970
Xiang is also helping. They should be able to bring back Yan Xi successfully, right?

233
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,490
Young Master, we just got news from Xiang asking for help.

234
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,030
Xiang? Could Yan Xi and Ning Liang be in trouble?

235
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,850
Thank you for the medicine you gave.

236
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,070
I didn't expect... to see you again here.

237
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,750
It's been 100 years since we parted.

238
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,230
I thought we wouldn't see each other ever again.

239
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,890
That's right.

240
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,900
Things are unpredictable in the world.

241
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,630
A'Yuan.

242
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,360
Have you endured hardship over the past 100 years?

243
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:38,700
- Master!
- Master! We've finished our homework.

244
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,370
Master, this is...

245
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,590
This is Kongsang's Princess Chi, Hong Yuan.

246
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,690
She came specifically to take care of Princess Bai.

247
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,850
Hong Yuan? This name sounds a bit familiar.

248
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,230
- Do you know me?
- We've only heard about it once before. Master...

249
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,330
Che, the wounded Quanxian soldiers are gradually returning and need medicine.

250
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,160
You and Han should go to the pharmacy to prepare the medicinal ingredients.

251
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

252
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,330
Once Master was calling out from his dream. It sounded like A'Yuan.

253
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,850
Hurry.

254
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,760
- What's going on?
- Ning Liang, take Yan Xi away first.

255
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,680
We've already sent a sound pearl back to the camp for help.

256
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,190
Someone should be coming to meet you on your way back. I'll head back first.

257
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,450
All right.

258
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,650
- Can you get away?
- Nan Zhao!

259
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,610
- Capture these people!
- You go first. I'll cover the rear.

260
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,870
It's not my style to abandon comrades. We go together!

261
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,360
Hurry!

262
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,660
Ning Liang.

263
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,120
- Ning Liang?
- How are you?

264
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,310
I didn't do well. Please punish me, Young Master.

265
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,190
You fought by yourself. It's not easy to have endured for this long.

266
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,980
Don't waste anymore effort on me.

267
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,660
I know it's useless.

268
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,480
Young Master, can you agree to do me a favor?

269
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,020
Tell me.

270
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,270
After I die, bury me in the sea.

271
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,410
I want to forever stay where I started.

272
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,630
You are warriors in the Quanxian Army.

273
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,840
If you die, your names will be written with your blood

274
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,970
and forever remembered by the dragon deity and Quanxian's people.

275
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,540
From Heaven, you will see the Quanxian return to Biluo Sea.

276
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,480
Ning Liang!

277
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,120
Ning Liang, rest assured.

278
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,160
All of this will be over very soon.

279
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,120
Please... watch us from Heaven.

280
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,150
That's the place where the Emperor of the Sea cultivates and recuperates. It's at the end of the corridor.

281
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,480
Intruders will be punished by the elders.

282
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,540
This will belong to me someday.

283
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,830
A'Ying.

284
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,430
What are you doing here?

285
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,510
What's this place?

286
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,020
I don't know, either. But it's best that we don't linger here.

287
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,750
But I just saw someone who resembles Su Mo go inside.

288
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,640
That can't be. Zhi Xiu just told me that he went to rescue Yan Xi and the others.

289
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,090
He isn't in the main camp.

290
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,610
Was I mistaken?

291
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,810
You've only just recovered. It's likely that you were mistaken.

292
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,060
A'Ying, what's the matter?

293
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,570
It's nothing. You were saying... they went to find Yan Xi?

294
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,100
Yan Xi was captured at the Stranded Dragon Abyss. Su Mo went to rescue him.

295
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,060
Let's go then.

296
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,920
Princess Bai. Princess Chi. This is Emperor of the Sea's ice chamber.

297
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,840
Please don't enter without permission.

298
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,830
Sorry, we came the wrong way.

299
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,360
Let's go.

300
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,920
You actually survived that sword strike at the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

301
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,830
In order to save you, Su Mo was willing to suffer from the backlash.

302
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,300
Even I had to suffer as well.

303
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,700
By then, you can just die with Su Mo.

304
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,580
Why hasn't Brother Ice Cube returned after such a long time?

305
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,790
It's my fault. I shouldn't have let Yu Huan take Yan Xi away.

306
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,970
Where was Yan Xi taken by Yu Huan?

307
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,540
At the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

308
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,000
You and Brother Ice Cube were going to the Stranded Dragon Abyss to undo the seal on the dragon deity.

309
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,770
Sister Bai Ying, you don't remember anymore?

310
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,570
I remember going to the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

311
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,440
But everything else... I can't seem to remember clearly.

312
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,730
It's fine. You suffered such a severe injury this time

313
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,340
and have only just recovered, it's normal not to remember.

314
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,620
But I definitely won't forget Yan Xi.

315
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,350
I remember everything about Yan Xi very clearly. He has to come back safely.

316
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,440
They're back! They're back!

317
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,300
- Hurry!
- Where?

318
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,780
Are they back?

319
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,330
Sister Bai Ying, let's go. Let's go take a look!

320
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,190
Hurry! Let's go!

321
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,230
Hang on.

322
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,410
- Hang on.
- Yan Xi? Where is Yan Xi?

323
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,930
Yan Xi?

324
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,920
Yan Xi! How is Yan Xi?

325
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,470
He should be all right.

326
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,430
Take Ning Liang back to her room.

327
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,270
Let Zhi Xiu inspect Yan Xi's injury.

328
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,620
Yes.

329
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,260
Ning Liang, she...

330
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,640
I didn't protect everyone well.

331
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,520
Why did you come out here?

332
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,190
Na Sheng was worried about Yan Xi. I was keeping her company, waiting for your return.

333
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,970
Are you all right?

334
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,220
I'm fine.

335
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,500
But... Han Zhou,

336
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,270
Ning Liang, Ting, and the others,

337
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,010
all fell one by one on the way back.

338
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,290
I've been thinking sometimes.

339
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,730
If only I was a little stronger, could they have survived?

340
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,190
Could I have taken them home? Home to Biluo Sea?

341
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,370
Don't blame yourself too much.

342
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,010
No one can save everyone.

343
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,930
Don't bear all the responsibilities on your own shoulders.

344
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,650
It's fine now.

345
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,420
Go back and rest.

346
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,270
Oh, right! I saw someone enter the ice chamber today. I thought it was you.

347
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,020
But once I entered, I didn't see anyone inside.

348
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,960
Could outsiders have intruded into Quanxian's main camp?

349
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,470
Are you sure? Were you perhaps mistaken?

350
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,360
No, I wouldn't be mistaken.

351
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,880
They say no one would dare to intrude into Quanxian's ice chamber, but I'm still worried.

352
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,560
Don't worry. I'll have someone look into it.

353
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,930
Perhaps you really were mistaken.

354
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,980
Is anything else the matter?

355
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,460
Have I been to the ice chamber before?

356
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,970
Do you remember something?

357
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,130
I just feel...

358
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,630
that it seems a little familiar.

359
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,590
No matter what happens in the future, I won't let you disappear again.

360
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,920
I will always stay by your side.

361
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,340
Are you willing to believe me?

362
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,540
Don't think about it anymore.

363
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,350
Maybe after you are fully recovered, you'll naturally remember.

364
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,590
Go back and rest early.

365
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,320
Yan Xi.

366
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,810
Zhi Xiu said that you're all right.

367
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,930
But why aren't you awake yet?

368
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,550
You... Whenever you leave, you always return full of wounds.

369
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,560
In the future, I'll always stay with you no matter what. You won't be able to get rid of me.

370
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,650
I don't want a next time. I'm so afraid.

371
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,460
Those Cangliu people are so vicious.

372
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,780
How many more of our people will they kill?

373
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,200
I've completed what you assigned me to do. Master Peng, please don't worry.

374
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,960
I deliberately dragged out the time

375
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,440
and kept waiting until Su Mo appeared.

376
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,960
- He rescued the person from you?
- Yes.

377
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,670
In the battle at the Stranded Dragon Abyss, Yu Huan suffered heavy casualties.

378
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,080
But Su Mo wasn't harmed at all.

379
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,240
It would appear that abandoning that child, Yu Huan,

380
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,630
wasn't wrong at all.

381
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,940
A'Huan, you're awake?

382
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,580
Sister.

383
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,030
A'Huan, does it hurt anywhere?

384
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,900
Sister,

385
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,620
how are things outside?

386
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,290
Why am I here?

387
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,800
Who saved me?

388
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,050
It was Fei Lian.

389
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,390
He not only brought you back,

390
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,780
we also schemed together to force Master Lang to send a physician to treat you.

391
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,120
- Where is he now?
- Ever since Master Lang took him back,

392
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,840
we haven't had any contact.

393
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,170
Where is the prisoner Yan Xi that I caught?

394
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,460
Yan Xi was taken back to Jing City and was guarded under Master Peng.

395
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,040
Quanxian had help from the inside,

396
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,590
and the Emperor of the Sea personally came to rescue Yan Xi.

397
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,680
Cangliu's troops suffered heavy casualties at the Stranded Dragon Abyss this time.

398
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,870
Yan Xi was also rescued.

399
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,040
The Five Masters won't have any reason to let me go this time.

400
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,490
Master Peng, what are you doing?

401
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,610
Yu Huan, as the commander in the battle at the Stranded Dragon Abyss,

402
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,440
you caused great losses for Cangliu's troops.

403
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,590
By military rule, you should be executed right away.

404
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,970
However, I've pleaded mercy for you in front of the other four masters.

405
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,320
As long as you provide a full explanation of the loss,

406
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,530
I'm sure we'll give you a fair punishment.

407
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,960
Take him!

408
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,430
- What are you doing?
- Sister. It's fine.

409
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,380
You... You... Let go of him!

410
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,160
A'Huan!

411
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,390
A'Huan!

412
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,790
How is it? Are you all right now?

413
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,700
Yan Xi has returned.

414
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,500
But... Ning Liang has died.

415
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,440
How did it turn out like this?

416
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,840
How are things over at Taoyuan Province?

417
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,000
Just as you expected, with Gao Shunzhao's cooperation,

418
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,980
we easily took Taoyuan Province.

419
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,060
Taoyuan Province's Commander Guo Yanyun has received the governor's secret order.
[Taoyuan Province]

420
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,600
All of the troops in Taoyuan Province will follow General Xi Jing's command.

421
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,140
Where did these two people come from?

422
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,940
Who are they? Why do the generals have to listen to them?

423
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,880
I heard that Governor Gao was assassinated. Are they here to take the opportunity to take over Taoyuan Province?

424
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,600
The Cangliu people won't let this go that easily.

425
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,190
When that time comes, we will be the ones to get injured and die.

426
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,560
Taoyuan Province's soldiers swear to defend Taoyuan County.

427
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,920
We won't so easily surrender!

428
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,850
[Command Token]

429
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,560
[Taoyuan Province]

430
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,420
The Gold Two-Headed Green Finch command token!

431
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,890
The holder shall command Taoyuan Province.

432
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,350
[Command token]

433
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,710
A hundred years ago,

434
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,580
the Cangliu made it difficult for the people in Taoyuan Province.

435
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,040
A few months ago, they even dispatched the Wind Falcons

436
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,960
to burn Taoyuan Province to the ground.

437
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,850
If you are willing to follow the Kongsang,

438
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,300
we will bring peace back to Taoyuan Province

439
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,930
and let the people live in comfort again!

440
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,820
It's time to safeguard Taoyuan Province for your own sake!

441
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,270
I, Gu Yanyun, will follow Crown Prince Zhen Lan and General Xi Jing.

442
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,490
I hope everyone

443
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,090
will be united and fight against our common enemy!

444
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,520
Our Kongsang's several thousand troops are waiting right outside the city gates.

445
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,360
They are waiting to safeguard your homeland with you!

446
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,560
To bring peace back to Taoyuan Province!

447
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,210
I had Xi Jing stay in Taoyuan Province to plan and organize our next steps. Don't worry.

448
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,490
By the way, how is A'Ying? Has she woken up yet?

449
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,860
- She's already awake.
- She's awake?

450
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,620
Then... Then can I go see her?

451
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,550
Of course, you can.

452
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,120
Her injuries have been completely healed.

453
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,910
It's just that...

454
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,890
"It's just" what?

455
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,400
Her memory is a bit messy.

456
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,570
She only remembers that I'm the Emperor of the Sea.

457
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,210
But as for everything else... she doesn't remember anymore.

458
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,920
What about other people?

459
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,280
Just go and see her for yourself.

460
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,540
- A'Ying.
- Your Highness.

461
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,900
How are you doing? Are you well?

462
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,040
- I'm all right now.
- That's good.

463
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,060
Did you just come back from Taoyuan Province?

464
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,410
Yes. Xi Jing and I took over Taoyuan Province together.

465
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,410
He's staying there and will return after a few days.

466
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,800
Your Highness, do you know what this is?

467
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,230
This doesn't look like anything from Kongsang.

468
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,880
Why do I have this?

469
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,060
This is...

470
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,090
Bai Ying will suffer a terrible headache if she tries to recall the past.

471
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,370
Perhaps, by forgetting the feelings between us,

472
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,470
she might live more at ease.

473
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,100
Your Highness?

474
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,550
A'Ying, you've just recovered.

475
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,810
Just pay attention to your health, don't think about anything else.

476
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,150
Your Highness, I seem to have...

477
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,880
forgotten a lot of important things.

478
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,870
What things?

479
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,160
I don't know either.

480
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,040
But in my mind, all the memories about the Emperor of the Sea are fuzzy.

481
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,320
What exactly happened between him and me?

482
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,920
A'Ying, whatever happened between you and the Emperor of the Sea,

483
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,360
I think it's best that you ask him yourself.

484
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,100
A'Ying, is there anything you want me to do?

485
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,170
I'll do it for you.

486
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,160
A'Ying, I've wished for many things.

487
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,180
But not everything can be perfect.

488
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,920
I like you,

489
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,200
but I won't take advantage of someone's trouble.

490
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,600
However, if you were to make a different choice,

491
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,120
I don't want to let go so easily either.

492
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:58,200
You're awake. You're really awake.

493
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,900
What exactly happened between us?

494
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,970
Emperor of the Sea.

495
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,430
It's late. Why aren't you asleep yet?

496
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,140
I've bothered the Quanxian during this time.

497
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,090
It's all thanks to you that my body is able to recover.

498
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,180
I'd like to ask you about something.

499
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,650
Go ahead.

500
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,930
I know I've forgotten some things.

501
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,150
But these things seem to be related to you.

502
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,660
Sister Hong Yuan and His Highness the Crown Prince both hesitate in telling me.

503
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,800
So I can only come and ask you.

504
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,400
Did something happen to me?

505
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,110
Also, does this pearl have something to do with you?

506
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,840
Those things that you can't remember,

507
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,950
do they bother you?

508
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,290
I've been trying hard to reassemble those scattered memories in my head.

509
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,840
But no matter what, I really can't remember.

510
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,810
Even if I were to tell you,

511
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,290
it would only be just a story.

512
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,500
Why obsess over it?

513
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,490
Perhaps... these memories are very important to me.

514
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,230
Are they not important?

515
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,200
As long as you are alive, that's more important than anything else.

516
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,820
I plan on leaving Quanxian camp tomorrow.

517
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,710
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

518
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,090
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

519
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,640
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

520
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,570
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

521
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,060
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

522
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,510
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

523
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:17,560
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

524
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,970
♫ We've met several times ♫

525
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,420
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

526
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:31,520
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

527
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,920
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

528
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,440
♫ You live in there ♫

529
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,500
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

530
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,310
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

531
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,460
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

532
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,370
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

533
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,880
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

534
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,270
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

535
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,810
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

536
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:12,280
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

537
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,170
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

538
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:19,310
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

539
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:23,270
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

540
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,700
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

541
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,010
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

542
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:35,120
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

543
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:45,050
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
