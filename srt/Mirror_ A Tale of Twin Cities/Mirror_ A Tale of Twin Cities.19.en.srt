00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,400
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,270
Quanxian relied on you, the elders.

4
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,120
I hope you'll continue to give more

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,600
guidance in the future, so that we can return to Bilou Sea soon.

6
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,660
Now that young master is back.

7
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,920
- Quanxian finally has hope.
- That's right.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,930
Seven thousand years ago, it was fortunate that Master used the Jade Pearl to preserve the Emperor of the Sea's bloodline.

9
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,350
The Jade Pearl can preserve the bloodline of the Emperor of the Sea?

10
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,610
Emperor of the Sea.

11
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,070
Master,

12
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,720
does Quanxian have another pearl

13
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,290
that can preserve spiritual consciousness? I want to create a Sunlight Protection Pearl.

14
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,130
I will think of a way to separate a part of the spiritual consciousness.

15
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,480
Emperor of the Sea, please reconsider carefully. What if something were to happen? That wouldn't be good.

16
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,640
Water Dispelling Pearl. Water Dispelling Pearl.

17
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,350
Where did it go? This Water Dispelling Pearl...

18
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,870
Your Highness.

19
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,660
What are you thinking?

20
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,450
A'Ying, you're here.

21
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,940
I wasn't thinking of anything. I'm just here, with the High Priest, flipping through books

22
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,870
to check if there are any clues for the Water Dispelling Pearl.

23
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,440
Your Highness, ever since you returned from the camp, you've been restless.

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,310
Have I?

25
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,020
Did you encounter some sort of problem?

26
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,500
Is there a problem with the alliance?

27
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,300
Or did Su Mo make some requests he shouldn't have?

28
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,140
No.

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,060
Then, did I do something to make you unhappy?

30
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,820
There isn't.

31
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,920
Your Highness, if there isn't one, I'll look again.

32
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,320
I wasn't talking to you!

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,060
I really didn't cause you to be unhappy?

34
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,510
You really didn't. I'm just upset with that person at the top of Jing Pagoda.

35
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,550
Su Mo told me there's a sinister conspirator there. So I've been thinking—

36
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,690
Su Mo went to the Jing Pagoda?

37
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,500
He told you not to to tell me.

38
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,650
Since it's inconvenient for you to say, I won't ask any further.

39
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,430
I'll take my leave.

40
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,600
A'Ying, w-where are you going?

41
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,490
I'm going to go see Na Sheng and check on the progress of her swimming lessons.

42
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,530
- We can't delay going down to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.
- All right.

43
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,890
I...

44
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,980
What a beautiful scene. Eat some.

45
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
What are you day dreaming about?

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,700
Han Zhou and I grew up together.

47
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,290
When we were together, I only regarded him as my companion and senior brother.

48
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,960
It was only after he died that I realized,

49
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,080
I owe him more than just a life.

50
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,170
The world is always like this.

51
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,530
When that person was with you, we didn't know how to cherish them.

52
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,540
We had to wait until there was no turning back, to know how precious it was.

53
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,950
So, it's great to be just like Na Sheng.

54
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,890
She likes Yan Xi, so she sticks close to him the entire day.

55
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,650
The three of us made an oath.

56
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,720
Before returning to Bilou Sea, we would never want for love.

57
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,600
Should I say those two didn't stick to their oath?

58
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,380
When considering love in front of the great cause for a country, it is indeed insignificant.

59
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,460
However, for you and I to be able to walk with our loved ones in this world,

60
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,560
isn't that also rare?

61
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,530
- A'Ying.
- Senior Brother.

62
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,450
She pleaded on behalf of her own life to protect Na Sheng

63
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,130
and already hasn't slept for a few days.

64
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,580
Thank you very much.

65
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,180
I'm ashamed.

66
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,030
Why did you come alone? Where is His Highness?

67
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,570
His Highness is busy with other things. So I came on my own to see Na Sheng.

68
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,050
By the way, for the past few days, Su...

69
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,840
Forget it. I'm going to go look for Na Sheng.

70
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,680
These two both want to see each other,

71
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,150
but they dawdle too much.

72
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,040
In the future, don't have learned those ways from them.

73
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,940
By the way, go and notify Su Mo that Bai Ying is here.

74
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,830
Notify Young Master?

75
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,870
That's right.

76
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,380
Ghost and Deity Abyss is 64,000 feet

77
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,020
under the sea.

78
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,840
There are strange creatures and supernatural beings, and it's hard to access.

79
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,040
64,000 feet under the sea,

80
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,610
there are strange—

81
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,110
Your Sister Bai Ying is here.

82
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,380
Sister Bai Ying, you've finally come.

83
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,460
Brother Ice Cube was here before.

84
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,460
You and Brother Crown Prince are late. I thought you didn't care about me anymore.

85
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,370
He was here?

86
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,940
Then... did he say anything?

87
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,460
When you came to pick up Na Sheng that day, Young Master wasn't feeling well.

88
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,110
However, Young Master has always wanted to explain something to you.

89
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,530
Stop talking on behalf of Brother Ice Cube.

90
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,390
How is his health now?

91
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,320
He's much better, but he always puts on that icy face whenever he sees me.

92
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,020
What are you two doing?

93
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,720
Na Sheng is memorizing the records of the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

94
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,480
I have already learned how to swim.

95
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,150
I can swim in the lake freely now.

96
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,690
Yan Xi said he'll teach me how to walk underwater tomorrow.

97
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,020
However, it's not good enough to be able to walk underwater.

98
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,660
The Ghost and Deity Abyss is very deep.

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,730
The length of time an ordinary person can stay underwater isn't enough to reach the bottom of the abyss.

100
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,810
We're already trying to find the Water Dispelling Pearl for you now.

101
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,970
Once we've found it, Su Mo will take you down into the water.

102
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,820
Don't worry. You can do it.

103
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll definitely work hard on my training.

104
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,750
So many people were wounded or died in order to protect me.

105
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,690
I'll complete the mission for them.

106
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,810
There's also Yan Xi. He has great swimming abilities!

107
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,690
You...

108
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,120
Continue chatting. I'm going now.

109
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,200
No, wait. Yan Xi!

110
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,900
Aren't you too bold?

111
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,770
What's wrong? He's a great teacher!

112
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,750
I was even thinking if you weren't used to living in this place,

113
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,380
I could find another place for you.

114
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,510
No, no. This place is great. Having Yan Xi's company is great!

115
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,560
From his reaction, you must have been teasing him quite a bit lately.

116
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,410
I don't tease him. I just... like him.

117
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,500
I like to stare at him. I like to be by his side.

118
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I also like him when he's angry while teaching me.

119
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,490
What's wrong, Sister Bai Ying?

120
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,290
I really am training hard. Although I like Yan Xi,

121
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,650
but I've been training every day. I won't delay serious matters.

122
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,690
I know.

123
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,030
I'm just...

124
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,930
a bit envious of you.

125
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,750
Envious of me?

126
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,900
What are you envious of?

127
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,970
I'm envious that you can live such a simple life, without worries.

128
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,880
Sister Bai Ying, do you want to try the spell I just learned?

129
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,630
All right.

130
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,500
The world has suddenly become so quiet.

131
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,460
I don't need to think of anything... don't need to worry about anything.

132
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,920
It's just like being in another world.

133
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,660
I really wish...

134
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,040
I could live in this bubble forever.

135
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,960
Actually, there's so much I want to say.

136
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,360
But I can't.

137
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,970
It's been so hard holding it in.

138
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,960
That day when I was trapped in Ten Mile Pavilion

139
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,460
and thinking I was going to die under the sunlight,

140
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,810
I thought I saw you.

141
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,370
But when I wanted to hold onto you,

142
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,780
you disappeared.

143
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,350
♫ Listening to the continuous sound of rain from that day ♫

144
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,140
It's really great to have this bubble.

145
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,540
I can say what I want to say without worrying that anyone's listening.

146
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,590
Brother Ice Cube.

147
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,510
Why are you hushing me?

148
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,090
Na Sheng.

149
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,030
Sister Bai Ying, you can hear me?

150
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,210
Looks my spell hasn't been perfected yet.

151
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,660
I'm going back to Wuse City.

152
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,480
Why is Sister Bai Ying acting strange?

153
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,370
I'm leaving, too.

154
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,970
Hey, aren't you looking for Ning Liang?

155
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,380
You hiding from me, makes me feel even more guilty.

156
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,080
Master, I hadn't finished talking before.

157
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,060
Did you leave and disappear because you were disappointed in me?

158
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,810
Actually, I'm not trying to be reckless

159
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,820
or trying to disregard Quanxian's safety by willfully making the Sunlight Protection Pearl.

160
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,960
I merely want to make up for the mistake from a hundred years ago.

161
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,350
It is I who owes her from a hundred years ago.

162
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,040
If I hadn't gone into the Jing Pagoda, she wouldn't have fallen in love with me.

163
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,460
This misfortune wouldn't have fallen on her either.

164
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,370
I know you're gravely wounded because you saved me.

165
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,540
I'm a burden to everyone.

166
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,170
I know that, as the Emperor of the Sea,

167
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,520
I have the responsibility to protect Quanxian

168
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,330
and lead them home. But as a merperson who can only love once in this lifetime,

169
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,740
I couldn't even protect the woman I love.

170
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,460
How can I become an indomitable Emperor of the Sea?

171
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,320
Master, hopefully you can understand me.

172
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,540
Master, you've finally appeared.

173
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,850
The fact that you're a descendant of the Emperor of the Sea

174
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,290
is unchangeable and predestined.

175
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,800
Thank you for keeping the bloodline of the Emperor of the Sea safe.

176
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,550
You're the hope of the entire Quanxian Tribe.

177
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,790
I used to be only willing to follow my heart...

178
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,980
rather than living for others.

179
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,390
Even now, I still hope I have a choice.

180
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,450
Every Emperor of the Sea is unique.

181
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,350
I know you can't forget the responsibilities as the Emperor of the Sea.

182
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,020
You're both the Emperor of the Sea and a merperson.

183
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,670
Merpeople fall in love with only one person in their lifetime.

184
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,150
How can I separate you from the love of your life?

185
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,570
Your eyes are exactly like his.

186
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,060
7,000 years ago, I couldn't stop Chun Huang.

187
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,980
7,000 years later, I cannot change you either.

188
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,870
Maybe this is my destiny.

189
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,740
Take it. Fulfill your wish.

190
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,310
Infuse the Jade Pearl with spiritual consciousness.

191
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,410
If you feel like you can't keep it under control during the process, you must let me know.

192
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,670
I will.

193
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,040
Emperor of the Sea, please be careful.

194
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,890
This Water Mirror

195
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,650
is getting older and older.

196
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,940
What I can see is getting shorter, just like my body.

197
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,990
It must be buried eventually.

198
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,420
That's right. It's the Water Dispelling Pearl!

199
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,070
Water Dispelling Pearl? High Priest, did you remember something?

200
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,100
Your Highness, I know where the Water Dispelling Pearl is!

201
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,870
High Priest, where on earth is the Water Dispelling Pearl?

202
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,770
All you of you, look.

203
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
[Jiuyi Palace]

204
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,820
It's in the Jiuyi Mountain palace.

205
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,810
Exactly.

206
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,850
It's on top of Queen Bai Wei's phoenix coronet.

207
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,370
When Queen Bai Wei passed away 7,000 years ago,

208
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,860
it was buried alongside her in the tomb on Jiuyi Mountain.

209
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,420
Jiuyi Mountain? That's great.

210
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,720
One of my Six Directions Seal is also on Jiuyi Mountain.

211
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,000
Jiuyi Mountain? Isn't it killing two birds with one stone?

212
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,710
Isn't Jiuyi Mountain still part of the Qing Clan's territory?

213
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,190
It is. The new Prince Jiuyi has submitted himself to Cangliu.

214
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,870
Qing Clan is currently colluding with Cangliu.

215
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,350
Also, a powerful barrier is there.

216
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,190
Non-Kongsang people will have less power when entering Jiuyi Mountain.

217
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,330
The royal tomb on Jiuyi Mountain is even more complicated and has mischievous evil spirits.

218
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,090
Young Master, Ning Liang and Yan Xi are asking to see you.

219
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,110
Young Master, Aunt Ru has sent word

220
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,210
that she's set up Quanxian stations all over the Land of Yunhuang.

221
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:45,310
Very good. What about Cangliu?

222
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,430
Xiang said no Cangliu people have heard of anyone with a black robe at the Heavenly Temple of Jing Pagoda.

223
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,990
The Heavenly Temple is where the Saintess prays.

224
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,270
Only the Saintess can go in and out of Heavenly Temple.

225
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,280
Since Cangliu doesn't even know about the person in the black robe,

226
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,850
why did the person in the black robe help them then?

227
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,820
Yan Xi, send a sound pearl to Aunt Ru,

228
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,730
- ask her to look into something for me.
- What's that?

229
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,630
I want to look into the Mirror Technique and Splitting Technique.

230
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,420
These two techniques are forbidden outside Yunhuang,

231
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,810
but those at the top of Jing Pagoda can use them.

232
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,980
I want to figure out what the relationship is between the two, as soon as possible.

233
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,390
Yes.

234
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,890
Who else can use these techniques? Where did they originate from?

235
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,110
What exactly is this energy?

236
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,580
Have you found it?

237
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,400
I really am a dotard. It should've been right there.

238
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,040
I remembered so clearly

239
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,540
that it should be in the third roll on the second shelf.

240
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,610
It was right there 100 years ago.

241
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,510
High Priest, are you talking about

242
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,770
the Pavilion of Books at Jing Pagoda in Jing City?

243
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,390
Exactly! Exactly!

244
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,460
No wonder I couldn't find it after looking for it all day.

245
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,890
High Priest, the stranger the thing is, the better you remember it.

246
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,920
The more important something is, you just forgot about it!

247
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,890
Can't do it anymore, can't. I'm getting old.

248
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,280
Who's there?

249
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,210
Your Highness, what do you see in Water Mirror?

250
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,650
- Two eyes.
- Two... Two eyes?

251
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,090
I seem to have seen those eyes somewhere before.

252
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,240
Is it Jiuyi that you saw before?

253
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,610
No, no, no.

254
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,780
I seem... to have seen them in the Water Mirror.

255
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,300
Impossible. The Water Mirror is the only...

256
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,540
No, not only one!

257
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,340
There's also a Water Mirror in Jing Pagoda's Heavenly Temple!

258
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,940
So you're saying those eyes belong to someone in Jing Pagoda's Heavenly Temple.

259
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,790
Does it mean someone can watch us at any time?

260
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,110
Isn't that too dangerous for us, Kongsang?

261
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,190
Technically speaking, only the High Priest of Kongsang can use the Water Mirror.

262
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,070
Then explain to me, what's going on?

263
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,610
Well... Well... How would I know?

264
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,160
Come.

265
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,230
All of you, come.

266
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,890
- This is a Kongsang technique.
- What do you mean?

267
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,600
This is a barrier designated for merpeople.

268
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,960
Technically speaking, only the High Priest of Kongsang can use the Water Mirror.

269
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,040
Why did you want to see me?

270
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,300
I've found where the Water Dispelling Pearl is.

271
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,460
- Where is it?
- It's on Jiuyi Mountain.

272
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,290
The Splitting Sword and one of the Six Directions Seal are all on Jiuyi Mountain.

273
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,550
It appears that we must make a trip to Jiuyi Mountain.

274
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,440
Yes. This is why I asked you to come so that we can discuss it.

275
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,700
I can leave at anytime.

276
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,490
Are you prepared to go?

277
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,780
Bai Ying...

278
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,590
Bai Ying is doing much better now.

279
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,140
But I still have something else I need to do.

280
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,900
Once it's done, we can go.

281
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,340
What is it?

282
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,030
Previously, you told A'Ying that there's a mysterious person helping Cangliu from behind the scenes.

283
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,130
He made eye contact with me through the Water Mirror.

284
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,820
This person is mysterious and inscrutable. He's in Cangliu,

285
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,170
yet he seems to know all about Kongsang.

286
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,030
Now he's found me through the Water Mirror.

287
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,310
I'm worried that the entrance to Wuse City will be discovered soon.

288
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,090
Water Mirror?

289
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,790
It's a kind of magical device that can see Kongsang people.

290
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:07,050
I just don't understand why he activated the Water Mirror to reveal his whereabouts.

291
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,430
Who exactly is this person?

292
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,710
What does he want?

293
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,270
So... That's why I plan to go to Jing Pagoda and meet him in person.

294
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,870
How are you going to get up there?

295
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:24,590
After I barged in last time, the Cangliu people should have reinforced the barriers surrounding Jing Pagoda.

296
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,160
I'm afraid the next time won't be easy.

297
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,910
Don't worry. Leave that to me.

298
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,860
Be careful then.

299
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,510
We need to go to Jiuyi Mountain sooner than later.

300
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,480
While the Cangliu army is changing its commanding general,

301
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,680
we'd have fewer obstacles, too.

302
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,400
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

303
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,910
What's the matter?

304
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,510
Your Highness, please reconsider the Land-Sea Alliance.

305
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,240
Your Highness, please reconsider.

306
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,290
If you have any thoughts,

307
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,240
just speak openly. It's fine.

308
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,460
Your Highness,

309
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,400
Prince Zi and Prince Xuan believe that

310
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,940
Quanxian's abduction of Na Sheng ruined the Land-Sea Alliance.

311
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,260
There's no more need to cooperate with them anymore.

312
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,050
Besides, now that there's a clue to where the Water Dispelling Pearl is,

313
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,760
we only need to find the Water Dispelling Pearl

314
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,920
so that Na Sheng can go down to the Ghost and Deity Abyss to unseal the seal.

315
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,090
Do you really think that if we find the Water Dispelling Pearl,

316
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,510
we then won't need Su Mo?

317
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,870
There are many dangers in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

318
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,880
If Na Sheng goes by herself, she'll definitely be endangered.

319
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Besides, the alliance was already agreed upon.

320
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,960
Why are you changing your minds now?

321
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,550
The alliance was the Emperor of the Sea's idea.

322
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,630
But they damaged the alliance.

323
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,940
They didn't do anything for us, but actually—

324
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,590
I've said this long ago.

325
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,230
The Land-Sea Alliance isn't about exchanging one seal for another seal.

326
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,580
More importantly, we must unite to fight against Cangliu!

327
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,130
When Su Mo was in solitude,

328
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,830
he kept fighting against the Cangliu people by using his own methods.

329
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,100
He was the one who broke through Jing City's barrier,

330
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,650
and also burned down Cangliu's military camp.

331
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,320
That day, we were trapped in the Ten Mile Pavilion.

332
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,420
The person who called forth dark clouds to cover up the sun...

333
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,050
was also him.

334
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,240
Is that true?

335
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,230
But that day we all saw it with our own eyes,

336
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,440
Your Highness was wielding power towards the sky.

337
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,870
Hong Yuan, don't disbelieve.

338
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,930
If you look all over Yunhuang,

339
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,730
he's the only person with this ability.

340
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,760
Even though Quanxian committed a wrong first,

341
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,850
but they are doing their best to make amends.

342
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,710
For the past few days, Na Sheng is being protected

343
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,150
by Xi Jing and their people.

344
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,980
Anyway, Quanxian has shown complete sincerity

345
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,140
to safeguard the Land-Sea Alliance.

346
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,270
That's why I hope everyone here

347
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,510
will be united under the Land-Sea Alliance from now on.

348
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,750
Let's not have unnecessary suspicions anymore, all right?

349
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,830
If there's nothing else, go and rest.

350
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

351
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,740
Your Highness, did you already know about this that day at the main camp?

352
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,080
These past few days, what you've been hiding from me,

353
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,970
was also this?

354
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,620
That's right.

355
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:10,690
Did Su Mo ask you to keep it a secret?

356
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,090
Even though he asked me to keep it a secret,

357
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,570
but I also had my own intentions as well.

358
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,050
A'Ying,

359
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,100
now that I've told you everything,

360
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,220
at least I don't have to hide from you anymore.

361
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,270
I also won't feel like a despicable villain.

362
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,180
If you have nothing else,

363
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,300
you should hurry and rest, too.

364
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,870
I wonder how much Su Mo heard that I said that day.

365
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,970
Why did he leave in such a rush?

366
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,710
If he had heard it, he would've known that I didn't blame him.

367
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,360
If he has to leave again,

368
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,110
but he didn't hear me,

369
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,660
then is he angry with me?

370
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,840
He didn't want to tell me.

371
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,060
Could it be because

372
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,660
he's still using the Mirror Technique?

373
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,600
[Sunlight Blocking Pearl]

374
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,790
It's almost time for the Flower God Festival again.

375
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,840
I recall there used to be fireworks before.

376
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,370
Now there isn't anything to see.

377
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,040
Cangliu has suffered quite a blow this time. I think their patrolling force should probably have decreased.

378
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,660
Sister Hong Yuan.

379
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,990
I want to see the Flower God Tree bloom.

380
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,120
All right. It's a good opportunity and just the right time

381
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,090
for us to check out the situation in Jing City.

382
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,660
Sister Hong Yuan, we're celebrating a festival.

383
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,530
You should relax your tense nerves.

384
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,350
We should just relax.

385
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,740
- I'll go with you to patrol first thing tomorrow morning.
- No.

386
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,380
Why not?

387
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,120
If we both go, the High Priest will be the only person guarding Wuse City.

388
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,140
He's an old man. If he's all by himself,

389
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,420
it's too pitiful.

390
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,550
It's not the first time he has stayed by himself.

391
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,200
It's not appropriate.

392
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,860
Then, let Prince Zi and Prince Xuan stay and keep the High Priest company.

393
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,070
Oh, yes! There's also Qing Yuan. A child should stay home and not run around on the street.

394
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,940
Not good. Not good. If we go, it's best that we all go together.

395
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,120
Why do we have to go together? Are we going together to Jing City to reminisce?

396
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,850
Your Highness.

397
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,740
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

398
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,590
You two?

399
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,100
- Where's A'Ying?
- A'Ying...

400
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,560
She's not here.

401
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,590
Where did she go?

402
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,300
She didn't say.

403
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,320
Your Highness, it's the Flower God Festival tomorrow.

404
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,990
Why don't we ask Sister A'Ying to go together

405
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,860
- to browse the Flower God Festival?
- That's right.

406
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,030
Whenever A'Ying mentions the Flower God Festival, she always misses it with fondness.

407
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,760
Why not take this opportunity for you to take all of us to relax and enjoy?

408
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,060
Sure. When A'Ying returns,

409
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,760
I'll speak with her.

410
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,030
Walk under water.

411
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,710
Yan Xi. Yan...

412
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,070
Brother Ice Cube. Why is it you?

413
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,600
Disappointed?

414
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,820
A little bit.

415
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,810
Oh, right! My power has improved lately.

416
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,330
See? Last time the spell I used on Sister Bai Ying didn't last long.

417
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,410
This time, I'm sure it'll work.

418
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,250
What spell?

419
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,040
Let me show you.

420
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,870
Walk underwater!

421
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,690
Brother Ice Cube? Can you hear me?

422
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,780
Brother Ice Cube.

423
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,960
Can you hear me?

424
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,660
Brother Ice Cube. Here. Here.

425
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,160
How about it? You can hear me now, right?

426
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,280
This is your spell?

427
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,210
Awesome, right? Previously, when I cast the spell on Sister Bai Ying,

428
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,690
I forgot to say one phrase, so the spell disappeared quickly.

429
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,730
What a pity.

430
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,090
It's not a pity.

431
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,800
Brother Ice Cube, are you smiling?

432
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,900
Are you praising me?

433
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,100
You seem to be in a good mood.

434
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,300
Did Bai Ying come?

435
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
So turns out you're looking for Sister Bai Ying.

436
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,000
Why did you slip away so quickly the other day?

437
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,600
Sister Bai Ying said that she was coming tonight.

438
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Just wait here then. I have to get going.

439
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,400
Uncle, how do you use it?

440
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,800
This is amazing. Let me show you.

441
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,400
Why is he still here?

442
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,800
I'll go talk to him.

443
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,200
Hold on, Uncle.

444
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
He's waiting for Sister Bai Ying. Why do you want to talk to him?

445
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,600
Did A'Ying say she was coming?

446
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,800
Yeah, she did.

447
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,900
Why would I lie to Brother Ice Cube?

448
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,500
Night's fallen. Is Princess Bai still coming?

449
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,900
She'll definitely come. Sister Bai Ying often rests during the day and goes out at night, doesn't she?

450
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,900
It's fine. We can do our own things.

Brother Ice Cube.

455
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,000
Did you really stand here for the entire night?

456
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,300
Did she really say she would come to see you?

457
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,200
She really did.

458
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,700
Why didn't she come then?

459
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,100
Then, why don't you go look for her?

460
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
No, no, no.

461
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,400
I know you can't go to Wuse City. I can't either.

462
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Sister Bai Ying didn't come here to see me, so I have no idea where she went.

463
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,900
How about this? f you have anything to say, you can tell me so that I can relay it to Sister Bai Ying.

464
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,200
No need.

465
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,600
If she comes, tell Yan Xi to inform me.

466
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,770
Okay, okay. Yan Xi will keep waiting here.

467
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,200
Tell him not to leave then.

468
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,500
Where did Sister Bai Ying go?

00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,900
Come to Jing Pagoda alone tonight.

477
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,000
Then you'll know.

478
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,350
Tonight? Is this a trap?

479
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,600
I need to find Su Mo and discuss it with him.

480
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Your Highness, what happened to you?

481
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,400
I'm fine.

482
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Qing Yuan, I have to go somewhere. Don't tell anyone.

483
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,100
Your Highness, will you come back tonight?

484
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,440
Today's the Flower God Festival. We've promised Lan Xia and Na Sheng.

485
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
I'll try. When A'Ying comes back,

486
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,600
ask her to go to the Flower God Festival together.

487
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,420
I'm too amazing, right?

488
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,400
Not only did I learn to walk underwater, but I also dug up some gold.

489
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,980
I also dug up some gold!

490
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
There are often things at the bottom of the lake left behind by ordinary people from unfortunate deaths.

491
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,700
This gold should be one of them.

492
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,580
Why did you tell me this? I thought I got rich!

493
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,200
Na Sheng, this kind of treasure is worthless in Quanxian.

494
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Next time, I'll ask Young Master to give you some.

495
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,250
I don't want him to give me any.

496
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,800
What are you all talking about?

497
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,100
Brother Crown Prince, why did you come alone? Where's Sister Bai Ying?

498
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,800
I don't know.

499
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
You don't know? Where is she then?

500
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Su Mo even came to look for her last night.

501
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
She didn't tell me where she was going.

502
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,100
Now I know. You all think of my place as a relay station.

503
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,200
You come and go as you please, you're not really looking for me, just using this place.

504
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,200
You know what? If you keep doing this, I'll start charging you!

505
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Speaking of this, I found this place for you.

506
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,100
Can't I come?

507
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,400
You're right.

508
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,500
Where's Xi Jing?

509
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,800
Let's go.

510
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
It does sound suspicious.

511
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm not sure about other things. But back then, in the Liejing Battle, when Master Peng was fighting me,

512
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,500
he couldn't use any Kongsang techniques.

513
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,300
100 years later, he can use Kongsang formations.

514
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,400
And Yu Huan, too.

515
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,400
He covered the surface of Jing City with barriers for the Quanxian, which was very suspicious too.

516
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,400
That's right.

517
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,200
Now that I think of it,

518
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,700
Cangliu came back to Yunhuang, penetrated everywhere, won every battle,

519
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,250
defeated six tribes, and even broke and sealed my power.

520
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:53,800
All said, these are strange indeed.

521
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,600
Does Your Highness think that the strange eyes in the Water Mirror

522
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,800
belong to the black-robed person that Su Mo talked about?

523
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,300
Yes.

524
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,600
Through the Water Mirror, I heard a deep and sinister voice.

525
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
He seemed to be old.

526
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,410
I suspect that he's a person hiding behind Cangliu,

527
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,400
the person that also knows Kongsang really well.

528
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
In that case, inviting you to go alone

529
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,600
has to be a trap no matter how you look at it.

530
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,700
