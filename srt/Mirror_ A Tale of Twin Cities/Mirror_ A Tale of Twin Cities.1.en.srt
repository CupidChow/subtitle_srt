[Episode 1]

3
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,620
In ancient mythology, there was a holy land called Yunhuang.

4
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,660
There was Kongsang, Quanxian, and Cangliu:

5
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,450
the three major kingdoms that reside there.

6
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,790
Lang Gan and Bai Wei from Kongsang expanded their territory with the power of the universe.

7
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,570
In the depths of Yunhuang's Biluo Sea, the Quanxian Merpeople were nurtured.

8
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,190
They were music experts and their tears turned into pearls.

9
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,950
Cangliu is located far away in the mountains.

10
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,530
Seven thousand years ago, Lang Gan waged war across the lands.

11
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,420
He trapped the dragon deity and sealed the Biluo Sea.

12
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,390
The merpeople were unable to return home for thousands of years.

13
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,670
Seven thousand years later, in order to save his people,
[Tianque - Snow Mountain]

14
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,460
a merperson wreaked havoc in Yunhuang and disappeared after.

15
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,290
Now, he's back.

16
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,090
Careful.

[Su Mo - Quanxian Merperson]

18
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,720
Mother, I'm very hungry.

19
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,800
After we pass this mountain and reach Yunhuang,

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,450
- we'll then have food to eat.
- I have food!

21
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,190
I have food!

22
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,470
Thank you, miss.

23
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,460
- No need to thank me.
- Thank you, miss. Hurry, eat.

24
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,870
Girl, what are you doing?

25
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,530
We told you already, the ones with children can't cross Tianque.

26
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,880
They'll just be holding us back. Look at the snowstorm.

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,160
Where will we find food for them?

28
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,770
It's okay, it's okay. I don't eat much.

29
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,720
- Don't eat much?
- I can share mine, it'll be okay. Let's go.

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,440
We're going to Yunhuang to escape disaster.

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,610
Who's able to take care of that kid?

32
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,650
We all want to go to Yunhuang to have a better life, right?

33
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,010
Not everyone can get to the sacred land of Yunhuang.

34
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,330
Remember to forget.

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,010
Are you new?

38
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,960
What's your name?

39
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,840
I'm Na Sheng. I'm from the Central Plains.

40
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,420
There is a war over there, so I escaped.

41
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,790
I want to settle down in Yunhuang.

42
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,120
You're quite good looking, but why the constant long face?

43
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,300
Dull and uptight.

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,250
Since you won't tell me your name, then I'll call you Brother Ice Cube.

45
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,820
Why don't we go to Yunhuang together?

46
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,600
We can talk and laugh, and even take care of each other.

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,480
How about it?

48
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,100
Don't underestimate me! I'm quite capable.

49
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,590
Otherwise, how else would I have made it here?

50
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,230
Yunhuang isn't a good place to be.

51
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,200
How's that possible?

52
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,180
People from my hometown said Yunhuang has treasure and riches everywhere, and the people are healthy and happy.

53
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,190
It's a paradise to us Central Plains people.

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,150
Brother Ice Cube, let me read your fortune.

55
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm telling you my fortune telling is very accurate.

56
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,250
Ever since I was little, this is how I made money.

57
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,130
Things like spirit writing, reading dreams, etc. I'm good at all of it.

58
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,950
I'll read your fortune for free.

59
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,300
The goddess in heaven, please tell me this person's past, present, and future.

60

The sky is dark and the earth is golden.

61
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,690
A rare gift, my connection to the divine is.

62
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,160
The head is surrounded by a halo and feet are treading on stars.

63
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,380
Use your divine powers to shed me some light.

64
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,530
Please write down your prophecy on the ground.

65

Tell me this person's past, present, and future.

66
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,140
I'm done. Hurry, go take a look and see if the answer you seek is on the ground.

67
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,710
I can't read it just like how I cannot read my own fortune.

68
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,120
Hurry and take a look. After you're done, I'll wipe it away.

69
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,650
Every beginning starts with an end.

70
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,230
The only way to fight the void is through creation and protection.

71
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,500
What's the last line?

72
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,910
Write it again.

73
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,290
I don't know either. I can only read the same person's fortune once a year.

74
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,870
Small tricks.

75
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,240
Small tricks? My fortune telling has always been really accurate.

76
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,150
It didn't say anything about your Bai Ying?

77
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,410
If you lied to me about closing your eyes just now,

78
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,080
I'll kill you immediately.

79
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,120
I-I didn't read it. I didn't read it.

80

You were having a nightmare just now.

81

You kept calling her name in your dream.

82

I wasn't eavesdropping, I wasn't.

83
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,800
The village elders said that the person you remember in your nightly dreams

it's either a person you love or a person who's died.

uphold righteousness, protect the people.

Why are you being so cruel?

Looking at her appearance, she seems to be a disciple of the Holy Sword Sect.

We can't afford to offend her.

- Isn't that the same sect as Lord Xi Jing?
- Yes.

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,110
it has nothing to do with you.

162
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,640
Do you know what kind of place this is? Yet you forcefully broke in.

163
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,710
Aunt Ru, how do you plan to get the Sea Soul Pearl?

164
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,450
Don't you need a helper?

165
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,140
I've already arranged everything.

166
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,170
Just stop asking.

167
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,640
Once you leave here, continue walking forward.

168
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,980
When you walk to the end of the street, there's a house.

169
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,600
Wait for me there.

170
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,390
After I'm done, I'll come and see you.

171
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,770
There's something important I need to tell you.

172
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,510
Aunt Ru, the Pearl Showing is about to start.

173
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,160
Boss Jin has asked you to prepare.

174
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,880
I got it.

175
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,190
Here.

176
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,760
Wipe your face.

177
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,610
Please excuse me for not coming out. I didn't know that you would be honoring us with your presence, Princess Bai.

178
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,080
My surname is Jin. I'm the boss of Xinghan Paradise.

179
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,810
Boss Jin, the pearls sent by Lord Kong have arrived.

180
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,580
Today happens to be the Pearl Showing.

181
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,670
The whole city's great pearls and jade all happen to be at my Xinghan Paradise.

182
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,000
I've already organized a private room for you to rest.

183
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,550
This way, Princess.

184
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,730
The blood tear pearls that Lord Kong sent over aren't pure enough.

185
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,120
We have a Transformation Pool.

186
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,170
As long as they enter,

187
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,380
they can transform into a man or woman, anything they choose.

188
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,370
And the merpeople who fail to transform will become a pearl.

189
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,190
Could the Sea Soul Pearl be in there?

190
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,590
Have a look, yang qi is red,

191
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,530
yin qi is indigo.

192
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,440
When the vitality of yin and yang increases, it becomes a green jade.

193
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,650
When the vitality declines, it becomes black ink.

194
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,840
When it comes to our Pearl Showing,

195
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,970
this is the most interesting part.

196
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,690
If the princess would like to...

197
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,140
I don't understand pearls.

198
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,660
It doesn't matter if you understand pearls or not.

199
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,380
The quality of the merperson you choose is the important part.

200
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,990
Since you've come, I definitely won't let you leave empty-handed.

201
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,200
As long as you like, Princess,

202
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,060
you may choose any of the merpeople here.

203
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,840
Merpeople?

204
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,980
Boss Jin, you're quite straightforward.

205
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,930
Then... how many merpeople are there to choose from?

206
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,320
As long as Princess asks, however many you'd like, then there will be that many.

207
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,720
As long as you have this elegant desire,

208
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,490
in the future, as long as there are good quality merpeople,

209
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,840
I'll have them sent to your manor.

210
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,150
The Pearl Showing is about to begin.

211
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,550
Princess, please.

212
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,290
This princess isn't a good person either.

213
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,090
Stop chasing after me.

214
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,830
Your horse can't catch up to me.
 [Zhen Lan - Wrangler - Shuchu Tribe ]

215
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,590
Let me down.

216
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,570
I... I'm so thirsty.

217
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,920
[Xi Jing - Great General of Kongsang]

218
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,740
Go throw up.

219
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,790
Where are we?

220
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,680
The royal city of Kongsang.

221
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,900
Jing City.

222
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,330
Jing City?

223
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,020
Excuse me, Brother.

224
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,090
You can now tell me why you brought me here, right?

225
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,720
Someone wants to see you.

226
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
What?

227
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,060
You're saying that someone here in Jing City wants to see me?

228
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,450
Nonsense.

229
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,460
You haven't gotten it wrong, have you?

230
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,250
I've lived in the village since I was young.

231
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,780
I've never left the village before.

232
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,900
You'll know soon.

233
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,070
Then, what if I don't go?

234
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,580
- Be careful. Would you like some?
- Sure.

235
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,740
It's not bad.

236
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,680
Master, would you like some of this, too?

237
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,200
Save me! Save me, Brother!

238
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,140
Save me!

239
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,130
Away you go!

240
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,220
Many thanks, Brother!

241
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,340
Move out of the way! Get out of the way!

242
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,360
Hurry and move aside!

243
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,400
After him!

244
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,770
After him!

245
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,520
The Sea Soul Pearl isn't here.

246
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,420
It's you? Why are you here?

247
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,880
Why are you here again? Boss Jin told me to come here and get something.

248
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,270
Again? You knew that I was here before?

249
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,650
You're trespassing in Boss Jin's room.

250
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,680
What exactly are you up to?

251
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,590
I'll go and report this to Boss Jin right away.

252
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,620
There are two guards outside. Are you planning to just walk out?

253
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,010
What exactly are you up to?

254
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,380
I should be asking you that.

255
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,670
You hid in a prison carriage and entered Xinghan Paradise.

256
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,270
And you are now in Boss Jin's study.

257
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,990
What are you trying to do?

258
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,880
A princess from the Bai residence who isn't out there enjoying the food, drink, and fun,

259
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,820
is in here doing what?

260
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,030
You've been following me.

261
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,600
I wanted to know what you came here to do.

262
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,720
Do you know now?

263
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,610
Did you come here to save people?

264
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,950
Stop! Stop running!

265
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,410
Stop!

266
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,460
Hurry!

267
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,200
This is bad.

268
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
I knocked out those two guards.

269
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,490
Will we be discovered?

270
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,990
- I don't have a grudge or feud with you. Why are you chasing after me?
- Stop!

271
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,080
These two don't seem to be from Xinghan Paradise.

272
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,130
They seem to be chasing after someone.

273
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,190
Take these pearls.

274
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,710
A merperson's tears can transform into pearls,

275
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,710
it's also letting the pearls flow back to the sea.

276
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
Then let's go.

277
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,000
Act according to this plan. I've already made the arrangements.

278
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,550
When the Pearl Showing starts, there will be the least number of guards in the dungeons.

279
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,250
Rescue them.

280
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,200
I'll get the Sea Soul Pearl and meet up with you later.

281
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,740
I've already prepared clothes to change into.
[Xiao - Quanxian Merperson]

282
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,330
Just in case, I've prepared a token belonging to General Xi Jing's residence.
 [Ting - Quanxian Merperson]

283
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,170
- Rest assured.
- You must act carefully.

284
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,230
[Baihua Hall]

285
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,070
When the Quanxian were alive, they had nowhere to go.

286
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,220
Their souls couldn't return home after death.

287
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,130
The Quanxian will not be forgotten.

288
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,080
Even until now, the seven thousand years of sorrow will be settled today.

289
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,650
When you're taken down to the Transformation Pool, you'll be forced to transform.

290
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,650
We don't have a choice whether to transform into a man or woman.

291
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,100
You must endure the pain of having your bones erode

292
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,140
and find the Sea Soul Pearl at the bottom of the pool.

293
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,580
With it, we can open the barrier at the bottom of Jing Lake.

294
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,880
In the future, we won't be bullied or humiliated again.

295
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,160
This battle is critical. Do you understand?

296
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,020
Understood.

297
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,430
Great! Outstanding!

298
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,940
Dear prosperous merchants and gentry.

299
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,230
The Pearl Showing has officially begun.

300
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,520
Great! Great!

301
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,150
Boss Jin, the pearls for the showing are missing.

302
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,250
Hurry and find them. Also, notify the Qing Royal Residence immediately.

303
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,820
Yes.

304
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,550
- Go on stage.
- Yes.

305
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,890
Su Mo?

306
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,340
Aunt Ru?

307
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,700
Why are you here?

308
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm here to get the Sea Soul Pearl.

309
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,250
You don't need to meddle with the Sea Soul Pearl. I've already made arrangements.

310
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,450
Tell me, Aunt Ru.

311
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,110
Is the Sea Soul Pearl in the Transformation Pool?

312
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,180
I already told you to mind your own business. Just listen to me.

313
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,460
- This is?
- The pearls for the Pearl Showing.

314
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,490
Do you know what the consequences of going down into the Transformation Pool are?

315
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,790
I do. Actually, whether I turn into a man or a woman, it doesn't matter.

316
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,400
What nonsense are you spouting?

317
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,870
- That fellow is over there. Grab him!
- Help me!

318
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,420
Su Mo!

319
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,220
Stop!

320
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,620
Aunt Ru, leave the Sea Soul Pearl to me.

321
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,490
- Come back!
- I'm leaving now.

322
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,760
Hurry, go!

323
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,240
Go! Now!

324
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,270
Capture her!

[Transformation Pool]

326

[Sea Soul Pearl]

327
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,890
Elder Brother.

328
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,720
I didn't run. I just came here to wait for you.

329
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,800
By the way, I brought food for you too.

330
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,760
Surround them!

331
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,070
Capture them!

332
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,850
Stop! Who is this presumptuous?

333
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,390
Senior Brother.

334
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,730
General Xi Jing, this has nothing to do with you. Please leave.

335
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,310
I don't care about the others. Prince Bai has ordered the princess to return to her residence.

336
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,890
I need to take my junior sister with me.

337
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,590
Senior Brother, take him along too.

338
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,790
This person can't leave.

339
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,900
General Xi Jing, I don't want to make this matter any bigger.

340
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,950
Junior Sister, let's leave now.

341
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,790
Keep up with me.

342
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,530
They're escaping.

343
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,510
Hurry up.

344
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,100
Ting, what's going on?

345
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,830
There's a fire inside.

346
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,070
- Is anyone else left?
- There may be a few merpeople still inside.

347
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,520
Is anyone still here? This...

348
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,330
Why is it you? Why are you here?

349
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,800
- I was worried.
 - Save me!

350
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,720
Help!

351
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,360
Help!

352
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,860
Help!

353
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,360
Is anyone there?

354
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,730
Be careful!

355
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,160
Save me.

356
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,610
Save me.

357
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,150
Let's go.

358
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,790
Come. Grab hold.

359
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,950
Be careful! Come. Hurry and come up here.

360
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,560
Over there!

361
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,910
Capture them! Hurry!

362
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,650
Hurry, go! Ensure that they're safe first.

363
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,400
What about you?

364
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
Stop.

365
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,980
Bai Ying?

366
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,700
- Uncle.
- She—

367
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
[Qing Chen - Prince Qing of Kongsang]

368
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,120
Weren't you training on Kongji Mountain?

369
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,270
Why have you returned? And you're here messing around.

370
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,990
I received Royal Father's letter and came back to Jing City.

371
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,630
I discovered that someone here was trafficking merpeople.

372
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,590
This is against our Kongsang laws.

373
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,750
When something is against the law, someone will naturally deal with it.

374
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,120
However, as Princess Bai, your intervening is not appropriate.

375
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,410
You don't know the whole story, how do you know that I was intervening?

376
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,660
In any case, you shouldn't be here.

377
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,100
Ying'er, hurry home.

378
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,790
Don't keep your royal father waiting.

379
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,210
Aunt Ru, where are the others?

380
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,260
I've already had arrangements for them near Jing Lake.

381
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,900
Once we get the Sea Soul Pearl, we can go into Jing Lake.

382
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,550
The Sea Soul Peal isn't with me.

383
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,050
You went into the Transformation Pool, and didn't get the Sea Soul Pearl?

384
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,920
I did get it.

385
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,220
But the situation in the Xinghan Paradise was a complete mess.

386
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,300
So I placed it with someone else.

387
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,780
Are you talking about the princess from the Bai residence?

388
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,030
Yes, her.

389
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,130
However, later I didn't have time to get it back.

390
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,190
General Xi Jing and the princess are disciples from the Holy Sword Sect.

391
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,070
I can find an excuse to go to the Bai residence and get the Sea Soul Pearl back.

392
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,450
No, no. I should go.

393
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,750
If you fail, it'll be hard for you to stay in the Xi Jing residence.

394
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,660
Why don't I go? You went into the Transformation Pool

395
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,190
and into the fire, you shouldn't put yourself in any more danger.

396
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,230
We shouldn't do anything tonight.

397
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,980
Ting, go back to the Xi Jing residence. We'll think of a plan tomorrow.

398
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,420
Then, I'll head back with Ting. We'll discuss this tomorrow.

399
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:32,000
Why are there so many people trying to kill me as soon as I came to Jing City?

400
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,790
- Someone wants to stop you from going into the Jing Pagoda.
- Jing Pagoda?

401
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:39,070
I'm telling you! You have to tell me. Where exactly are you taking me?

402
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,970
And where is this place?

403
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,860
I told you that this is the royal city of Kongsang: Jing City.

404
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,420
This is Jing Pagoda.

405
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,920
Where we are standing right now is the royal palace of Kongsang.

406
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,700
What does this have to do with me?

407
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,830
Your father is the king of Kongsang.

408
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,530
And you're a prince of Kongsang.

409
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,520
Stop joking!

410
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,920
My birth mother was a typical herder out in the country.

411
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,940
Since birth, I've never seen my father.

412
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,800
Forget him being some king of Kongsang.

413
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,760
Elder Brother, if you want to trick a small kid. You have to put in some effort, right?

414
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,130
This story will take a long time to tell.

415
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,460
Right now, you're the only heir to the king of Kongsang.

416
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:46,900
At this time, Kongsang is experiencing difficulties. Only you can save Kongsang.

417
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,770
I'll take you to meet His Majesty right now.

418
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,860
Which is to say, your father.

419
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,600
I don't believe you.

420
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,260
I want to head back. Take me back.

421
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,630
- Let's go!
- We can't.

422
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,170
I don't understand! Why should my life and destiny be arranged by others?

423
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,350
Out of nowhere, I've been abducted by you to come here, to Kongsang, Jing City.

424
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,190
And I even have to save Kongsang!

425
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,100
Whoever wants to be this prince can be it. I'm not doing it!

426
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,430
Isn't it just death? What's the big deal?

427
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,050
I'm leaving.

428
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,750
- Do you not care about your father?
- No!

429
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,270
Don't you want to protect your village?

430
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,510
I don't!

431
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:31,700
Your mother's already passed away.

432
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:44,270
According to the secret messages, Cangliu has already passed the Shuchu Tribe and is approaching Ye City.

433
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,490
Your honored mother had a jade pendant shaped like a crane.

434
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,790
The messenger found your mother's body.

[Bai Royal Residence]

436
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,360
- Elder Sister.
- I haven't seen you in a few years. You've grown taller.

437
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,120
Elder Sister, you've changed, too.
[Bai Lin - Younger Princess of the Kongsang Bai Clan]

438
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,540
You have more of a heroine's aura now.

439
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,830
I want to tell Royal Father that I also want to go to Kongji Mountain to practice martial arts.

440
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,650
Elder Sister, there's so much I want to tell you.

441
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,670
Then let's not sleep tonight.

442
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,720
Let's have you say everything you want to say.

443
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,820
One night is not enough for me to say everything.

444
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,650
By the way, where is Royal Father?

445
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,310
Royal Father said he urgently needed to report to the royal palace.

446
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,260
Elder Sister, rest assured. He'll be back soon.

Your Majesty, I've brought the prince.

00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,060
Prince?

451
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,560

[Bai Liao - Prince Bai of Kongsang]

453

Tell me.

454
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,810
In the past few years, Kongsang has been involved in quite a few wars.

455
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,610
The crown prince died young while bringing glory to our ancestors.

456
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:15,890
Our king secretly ordered General Xi Jing to bring the prince back.

457
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,390
Prince Zhen Lan is the child between Kongsang and Shuchu.

458
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:28,320
He can be considered the king of Kongsang's heir.

459
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,970
Once the powers of Heaven and Earth are joined together, it will be a blessing for Kongsang.

460
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:40,040
Madam Ziya of the Shuchu tribe was gentle and virtuous. Her posthumous title is Zhenyi.

461
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,220
Your Majesty,

462
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,460
a country man from who knows where is also qualified to be a Kongsang prince?

463
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,810
If this gets out, won't we become the joke of Yunhuang?

464
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,550
What's more, this child's mother is probably some wild horsewoman who doesn't understand etiquette whatsoever.

465
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,830
Who can prove that he's of the royal bloodline?

466
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,200
Whether Zhen Lan's identity is legitimate or not,

467
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,440
we need to see if the heavens will acknowledge him.

468
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,100
High Priest, summon the six princes to the heavenly temple.

469
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,570
Yes.

470

Aunt Ru, do you have something to tell me?

471
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,880
You've gone into the Transformation Pool, is there anything different with your body?

472
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,620
There's nothing too different.

473
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,980
Right! I went into the Transformation Pool.

474
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,040
But I didn't transform.

475
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,480
Because you're different than other people.

476
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,160
Young Master.

477
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,770
The Heavenly Ring has been prepared.

478
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:22,070
Your Majesty, we can start the royal recognition ceremony.

479
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,900
Then begin, High Priest.

480
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,330
Young Master.

481
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,000
Aunt Ru, what are you doing?

482
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,190
Hurry, get up.

483
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,620
Young Master, you went into the Transformation Pool but didn't transform.

484
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,140
That's because you have the Emperor of the Sea's blood inside you.

485
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,200
You're the Emperor of the Sea.

486
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,350
Aunt Ru, you must've gotten it wrong.

487
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,370
Get up first.

488
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,640
Back then, you were still young.

489
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,380
I didn't dare to tell you this.

490
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:24,250
Perhaps everything that happened at Xinghan Paradise was destined.

491
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,950
Seven thousand years ago, when the late Emperor of the Sea died during battle,

492
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,400
he sealed his bloodline in a pearl.

493
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,320
Seven thousand years later, Her Ladyship consumed the pearl with his bloodline in it,

494
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,850
and had you and A'Nuo.

495
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,290
The mark on your backs is that of the dragon deity.

496
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:49,210
Perhaps that's why you didn't transform when you entered the Transformation Pool.

497
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,730
You're the master of Quanxian. Emperor of Biluo Sea.

498
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,970
Young Master, you've grown up.

499
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,550
Xinghan Paradise... it was because you were there that I went.

500
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,860
You wanted to get everyone out and obtain the Sea Soul Pearl.

501
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,330
Aunt Ru, you're my family.

502
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,090
I didn't want to see you get hurt. I had no other reason.

503
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,750
But you got the Sea Soul Pearl and saved us.

504
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,130
- Those were all coincidences.
- Young Master!

505
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,120
Don't call me that.

506
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,240
Aunt Ru, you should still call me Su Mo.

507
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,090
It's getting late.

508
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,070
Rest early. I'm going back.

509
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,880
Su Mo!

510
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:05,630
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

511
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,060
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

512
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,690
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

513
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:19,500
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

514
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,990
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

515
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,400
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

516
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,400
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

517
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,900
♫ We've met several times ♫

518
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,290
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

519
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:47,400
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

520
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,910
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

521
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,310
♫ You live in there ♫

522
00:44:54,310 --> 00:45:00,400
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

523
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,250
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

524
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,360
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

525
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,250
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

526
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,760
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

527
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,190
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

528
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,740
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

529
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:28,140
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

530
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,100
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

531
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,140
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

532
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,090
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

533
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,600
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

534
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,980
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

535
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:51,080
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

536
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:59,570
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
