00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
- After him! Hurry!
- Yes!

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
- This way!
- Stop right there!

6
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Capture him!

7
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Hurry!

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,000
- Split up!
- Yes!

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
- This way!
- After him!

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
Escaped again!

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,900
We searched every river channel but found no traces of him.

12
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,180
We can't find him when he's alive or his corpse when he's dead.

13
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,000
- Did he vanish into the air?
- We didn't come back completely empty-handed.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Someone recognized the culprit who broke the prisoner out of prison from a portrait.

15
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
He is Yan Xi, the Quanxian army's Commissioner of the Left.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,500
- I—
- That Commissioner of the Left

17
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,200
was injured when he escaped.

18
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,700
The channel between Ye City and Jing City has always been under our control.

19
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,300
I don't think he could have passed through the blockade. He can't have escaped far.

20
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,600
There is another possibility.

Taoyuan Province.

22
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,400
I will immediately inform the Cangliu soldiers

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
to assist the investigation.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,300
We'll leave the search for the Commissioner of the Left

25
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,700
to Nan Zhao.

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,000
Governor Gao Shunzhao of Taoyuan Province is very powerful.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
I heard he has an intimate, Quanxian friend.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,300
That's why the entire Taoyuan Province is tolerant of merpeople.

29

Taoyuan Province soldiers

may give them a way out.

31
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,200
Yes.

32
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,150
You should still

33
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,600
kill that person who crossed Tianque.

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Remember.

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,100
I want to see that person, dead or alive.

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
Yes.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,100
You two may leave.

- What is this?
- A sachet.

I'm not waiting for you.

50

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,800

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,000
can I use these to exchange for some buns?

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,800
What is that? Do you think I'm stupid?

55
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
You want to exchange these weeds for food?

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Go away.

57
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,100
No, wait. How is this weed?

58
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,600
This is valuable fairy grass. You can sell it for money.

Miss, buns.

62
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,000
You're hungry, right? Eat them while they're hot.

63
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
I was careless just now and bumped into you.

64
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,000
So embarrassing. I'm sorry.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
It's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.

66
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,200
You don't look like you're from here.

67
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Where are you from?

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I came from Central Plains.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Central Plains?

70
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
All by yourself?

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,700
Yes.

72
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know much about Central Plains.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,700
But here, life isn't easy when you don't have money.

74
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Just now, I saw you try to exchange your fairy grass for buns.

75
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,800
That shopkeeper really doesn't have an eye.

76
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
One fairy grass

77
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,400
can exchange for 10 buns and plenty more!

78
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,500
That's right.

79
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,100
By the way, Uncle, do you know where there is an apothecary?

80
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to sell these fairy grass for some money.

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because you called me uncle,

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
I'll take care of this matter.

83
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,000
There's a merchant I know very well who specifically buys valuable medicinal herbs.

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,800
I guarantee that he can give you the best price in Yunhuang.

85
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Really?

86
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
This is great!

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Oh, right, Uncle.

88
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't have much to repay you with

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,100
I have some of these to give you.

90
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,500
If it's not enough, I have more.

91
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,500
This... This fairy plant is too precious.

92
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,900
I can't take it. We have a rule in Taoyuan Province.

93
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,200
When we pass by and if we can help, we must lend a hand.

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,700
We cannot ask for compensation.

95
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,100
How about it? Follow me then?

96
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,600
All right, all right.

97
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,300
Let's go.

98
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,400
The assassination attempt failed today. You're no longer useful.

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I'll make it fast and pain-free.

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,300
Wait.

101
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
General,

102
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,300
what are you doing here instead of carrying out Lord Peng's order?

103
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,400
It's not up to you, to kill the person that I bought here.

104
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,600
Regular prisoners would have already confessed when they'd encountered the branding irons.

105
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,800
You're bones are quite hard.
 (T/N: unyielding person)

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Who are you?

107
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,010
What trick are you playing now?

108
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,400
You know me?

109
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,200
When I woke up,

110
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
I couldn't remember anything.

111
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,800
Did you interrogate her before?

112
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,100
She's very tough, and wouldn't confess anything.

113
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,200
I had the priest use the mind-control technique on her.

114
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
However, she resisted very strongly.

115
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,720
Maybe something happened to her brain.

116
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Then she's really lost her memory.

117
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,700
Then you are useless to Cangliu now.

118
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,900
I can give you a way to live. Be my weapon.

119
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,230
Partner with me to help me drive the Wind Falcon.

120
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,650
What do you think?

121
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
General,

122
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,000
she is just a prisoner captured for treason.

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,200
You want her to drive the Wind Falcon?

124
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,100
Isn't that against military rules?

125
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,030
Answer me.

126
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,380
I don't remember anything.

127
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,040
But I know you saved me.

128
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,050
A Quanxian person will always repay kindness.

129
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,960
Then, starting today,

130
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,280
your life is mine.

131
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,390
Guards.

132
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,750
Release her. Take her.

133
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,640
General, you mustn't.

134
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,210
Nan Zhao, don't forget that you're my vice general in the military camp!

135
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,560
You do not have the authority to interfere with my decisions.

136
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,100
Didn't Lord Peng give you an assignment?

137
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,840
You can go to Taoyuan Province to carry it out now.

138
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,260
Yu Huan.

139
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,810
Take her back to the training field, and get the best medical officer to treat her.

140
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

141
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,870
What are you doing?

142
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,760
Agile, strong-willed, and loyal.

143
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Also, a natural-born acuity.

144
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,790
She will be a good driver of Wind Falcon.

145
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,420
You should know better than I do.

146
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,420
Since she dares enter Banbu City to assassinate you, she must be a powerful figure.

147
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,450
- Is there anything she can't do?
- I know.

148
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,040
- Thank you for this time.
- Why thank me?

149
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,740
I should apologize to you.

150
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,060
If I had been personally on guard this time,

151
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,960
then everything that happened later on wouldn't have happened.

152
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,540
Also, you should give Lord Peng

153
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,600
a proper explanation about keeping this prisoner.

154
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,830
I've brought good merchandise.

155
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,740
Go on in.

156
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,790
You're here.

157
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,410
This young girl comes from the Central Plains.

158
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,830
All alone by herself.

159
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,600
Looking at her appearance, she's worth a good price. Right?

160
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,030
I can make the purchase.

161
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,210
But I must...

162
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,610
inspect the merchandise first.

163
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,160
That... The fairy grass is in here.

164
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,820
I brought them from the Central Plains.

165
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,900
What is this?

166
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,800
This... Boss, is an inspection really necessary?

167
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,740
Look at how good of a condition she's in.

168
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,660
Her birthplace is the Central Plains.

169
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,090
We've been friends for so many years, I wouldn't cheat you.

170
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,080
Young girl, you're all by yourself anyway.

171
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,320
When the time comes, I'll find a good husband for you.

172
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,910
I'll make sure you live a good life.

173
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,980
Aren't we selling fairy grass? Why sell me?

174
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,020
Save me!

175
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,500
High Priest. Your Highness. There's a reaction from the Heaven and Earth rings.

176
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,340
- What's the matter?
- Na Sheng is most likely in danger.

177
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,260
Na Sheng is wearing the Heavenly Ring.

178
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,470
We should be able to see her in the Water Mirror.

179
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,330
- Let go of me!
- Wait.

180
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,700
Su Mo.

181
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,480
Brother Ice Cube! Brother Ice Cube, how did you know I was in there?

182
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,310
I didn't expect him to be in Taoyuan Province, too.

183
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,060
With him there, he can protect Na Sheng.

184
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,960
Brother Ice Cub! Brother Ice Cube, how did you know I was in there?

185
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,990
You knew I was in danger? Good thing you were there to save me.

186
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,210
Brother Ice Cube, you are so good-looking. Why do you always have a stern face?

187
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,070
Look, you should smile more.

188
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,580
Don't follow me.

189
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,840
It's you who is following me.

190
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,500
How is it that I'm following you?

191
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,830
If it weren't so, how could you have saved me?

192
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,110
There is only this one road in Tianque Mountain.

193
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,990
Since there is only one road, why won't you let me follow you?

194
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,520
Don't you want to see Sister Bai Ying?

195
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,270
Don't you want to see Sister Bai Ying?

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,030
There are many bad people in the city. You should leave the city.

197
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,990
Brother Ice Cube!

198
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,010
I think it's better if you practice smiling more.

199
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,920
Come inside, guests.

[Ruyi Gambling House]

201
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,900
Aunt Ru, greetings.

202
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,790
- Be careful.
- Yes.

203
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,190
- Let's gamble two more rounds.
- Sure, we can.

204
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,940
- Aunt Ru is really pretty today.
- Thank you much.

205
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,600
- Your complexion looks great.
- Aunt Ru is wearing new clothes today. So pretty.

206
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
Have fun.

207
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,410
- Aunt Ru.
- Aunt Ru.

208
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,880
Hello, everyone.

209
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,150
Aunt Ru, you've come down.

210
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,860
I've kept an eye out for half a day. Nothing has happened.

211
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,790
Rest assured. I'm here, right?

212
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,210
Quickly! Quickly! Come on!

213
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,200
Place your bets and let go of your hands. Don't touch it.

214
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,370
Aunt Ru, I have a lucky streak today.

215
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,990
Your reward.

216
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,620
Thank you, boss. I hope you earn enough to overfill your pot today.
[Madam Ru Yi - Quanxian Merperson]

217
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,310
Okay.

218
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,080
Come on, come on, come on!

219
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,320
Take care.

220
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,200
Let's continue! Let's continue!

221
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,450
Bet either big or small! Bet either big or small!

222
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,720
Anyone else? Anyone?

223
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,180
Place your bet and then hands off!

224
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,810
- Big! Big!
- Open it!
- Boss.

225
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm having a lucky steak. You better not say anything that brings bad luck.

226
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,990
Someone came to sell merchandise earlier.

227
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,940
Not only was it fake merchandise,

228
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,220
- they even smashed our courtyard.
- What?

229
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,020
Let's roll again.

230
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,940
It's him! The cheat!

231
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,280
- Catch him!
- You bastard.

232
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,640
- Catch him!
- Stop!

233
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,510
- Thanks.
- Scram.

234
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,550
Some customers in the back are fighting.

235
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,430
Him!

236
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,560
Young Master, please.

237
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,890
Young Master, we received the news you sent through the sound pearls.

238
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,210
We've waited a long time, and you've finally appeared.

239
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,680
I should have met up with you all back then.

240
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,120
But a lot happened afterward.

241
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,370
I didn't expect our parting

242
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
to be 100 years long.

243
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,720
Back then, you only left one sound pearl.

244
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,870
You said you were going to search for strength.

245
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,820
There was no more news from you for 100 years.

246
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,700
Where did you go during all these years?

247
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,280
- Have you been living well?
- I've caused you to worry.

248
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,300
In the past 100 years, I was away from Yunhuang

249
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,110
to search for great powers.

250
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,630
Now, even though my power as the Emperor of the Sea have not awakened,

251
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,420
I'm different from 100 years ago.

252
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,750
I'll no longer let anyone slaughter us.

253
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,700
Young Master is even more mature and steady now.

254
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,260
You must have gone through a lot of hardship.

255
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,310
My hardship is nothing.

256
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,220
On the other hand, you have operated this gambling house

257
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,740
to raise money for Quanxian and to collect intel.

258
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,980
You've worked hard.

259
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,020
Don't say that.

260
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,380
In order to return to Biluo Sea as soon as possible,

261
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,910
this is all a part of my duty.

262
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,480
By the way, back then, I had you and Yan Xi

263
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,060
take those we saved away from Jing City.

264
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,340
I wonder what happened to them.

265
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,550
Most of our tribe people under Prince Qing's control

266
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,250
got away successfully.

267
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,910
It's just that, right before they left,

268
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,280
they were still backstabbed by that despicable Prince Qing.

269
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,590
Prince Qing has issued an order. Kill everyone without mercy!

270
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,520
Yes!

271
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,110
How is Prince Qing now?

272
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,950
We looked for Prince Qing.

273
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,600
In the past 100 years, we haven't heard any news about him.

274
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,040
Maybe he really is dead.

275
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,090
Will you help or not?

276
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,230
Su Mo, in this world,

277
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,660
there is still someone who can break your blood pact.

278
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,100
Aunt Ru, do you know something?

279
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,130
Back then, at the top of the Jing Pagoda,

280
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,680
I activated the blood pact,

281
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,590
but Prince Qing was not harmed at all.

282
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,520
How is that possible?

283
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,710
Quanxian's blood pact is drawn on life.

284
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,720
Unless it's extremely great powers,

285
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,890
the pact is very difficult to break.

286
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,480
Someone must have helped him behind the scenes.

287
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,520
Unless I see his corpse,

288
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,700
- I'll continue to doubt his death.
- Young Master is wise.

289
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,070
I will send people to keep searching for Prince Qing.

290
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,630
All right.

291
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,860
How is our Quanxian Great Camp?

292
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,990
The elders are already at the Quanxian Great Camp

293
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,090
waiting for Young Master.

294
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,600
Young Master, please.

295
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,230
We placed the Great Camp at the bottom of Jing Lake, in a very hidden place.

296
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,980
Jing Lake isn't far from Jing City.

297
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,440
The elders used their power to create an enchantment.

298
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,800
They hid the Great Camp beyond the common people's vision.

299
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,410
It's been safe, hidden from everyone.

300
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,200
It's just that the elders are old now and their powers are declining.

301
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,910
I'm afraid that they won't last much longer.

302
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,690
Don't worry about the enchantment.

303
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,400
I will reinforce it.

304
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,930
Aside from the spies placed in various places to collect intel,

305
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,280
we've done our best to conserve our strength.

306
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:28,560
Just recently, we sent a small unit to Banbu City

307
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,410
intending to assassinate Cangliu's General Yu Huan.

308
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,360
But we failed.

309
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,130
Yan Xi was able to escape, but Xiao got captured.

310
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,930
But Yan Xi sent good news just recently,

311
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,620
saying Xiao should have successfully escaped also.

312
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,730
Someone has gone to receive them early this morning. Rest assured, Young Master.

313
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,980
In the next few days, contact the others in Taoyuan Province first.

314
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,820
After Xiao and Yan Xi return, we will go back to the Great Camp in Jing Lake together.

315
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,430
Yes.

316
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,660
What do you have planned for later?

317
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,490
I'm going to the Entrapped Dragon Abyss to unseal the dragon deity's seal.

318
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,010
With the power of the dragon deity, I'll break the seal of the Sea Soul Plain in the Bilou Sea

319
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,180
and take everyone home.

320
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,820
But it's not easy to break the dragon deity's seal.

321
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,860
You need to go to Jiuyi Mountain to retrieve the Splitting Sword first.

322
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
It is indeed not easy.

323
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,800
The road back to Biluo Sea is full of difficulties.

324
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,720
We need sufficient manpower.

325
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,250
How many of our people are in Taoyuan Province?

326
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,840
About 1,000 in Taoyuan Province.

327
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,040
About eighty percent are adults though.

328
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,820
But Taoyuan Province's topography is very complex.

329
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,530
Plus, Cangliu has stationed many troops here.

330
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:51,340
To take away so many people, I'm afraid we need to think of another way.

331
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,650
All right. Aunt Ru, first contact the others in Taoyuan Province.

332
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,120
Yes, Young Master.

333
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,690
A few days ago, I also heard that

334
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,620
Cangliu people sent many soldiers

335
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,860
to Tianque to capture someone. I kept inquiring

336
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,780
but don't know who exactly they are trying to capture.

337
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,440
They want to capture those who passed through Tianque.

338
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,750
It's me and another girl.

339
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,510
That girl is carrying the Heavenly Ring.

340
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,970
The Heavenly Ring has reappeared?

341
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,150
What exactly has happened during the 100 years I was away from Yunhuang?

342
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,000
Cangliu invaded en masse.

343
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,240
They had magical weapons on the outside and spies cooperating from the inside.

344
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
They conquered Ye City very quickly.

345
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,440
Kongsang's Crown Prince Zhen Lan used the Heavenly Ring's power to lead troops against Cangliu,

346
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,350
but he still suffered a terrible defeat. Young Master?

347
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,500
Previously, I saw Bai Ying and Zhen Lan on Tianque Mountain.

348
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,420
If the Heaven and Earth rings reunite,

349
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,230
then the Kongsang people will surely want to take back Jing City.

350
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,490
Young Master, during this time, you should stay here at the gambling house.

351
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,280
This secret chamber is very safe. No one will disturb you.

352
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,530
All right.

353
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,530
Young Master, please rest for now.

354
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,160
I will prepare some food for you.

355
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,780
Thank you, Aunt Ru.

356
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,890
To me, what happened 100 years ago was a mistake.

357
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,160
Right now, I just want to make up for that mistake.

358
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,610
I've thought that if I never met you,

359
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,560
none of the tragedies would have happened.

360
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,490
During these hundred years, I never missed you.

361
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,400
I never longed for your return.

362
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,290
Even more so, I never thought I would see you again.

363
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,940
After I woke up, I sensed my other powers by using my monarchy powers.

364
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,750
They are separately sealed at Ghost and Deity Abyss,

365
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,100
Jiuyi Mountain, and also

366
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,050
Jing City's Jing Tower.

367
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,500
Good. Good.

368
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,890
We've wandered everywhere for the past 100 years.

369
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,660
Those places are all known to be dangerous.

370
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,000
Ghost and Deity Abyss is in the south of Yunhuang. Legend has it that it's difficult for even ghosts and deities to enter.

371
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,400
That's why it's named Ghost and Deity Abyss.
[Ghost and Deity Abyss]

372
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,000
Jiuyi was originally our Qing clan's domain.
[Jiuyi Mountain]

373
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,640
It's been shrouded in mist for a hundred years. It's once again haunted by ghostly creatures and isolated.

374
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,570
The Jing Pagoda is the center of Jing City.
[Kongsang Imperial City - Jing Citiy]

375
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,550
It's heavily guarded and very difficult to get close to.

376
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,950
The Cangliu people are really ruthless.

377
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,640
Given the current power of the heavenly ring,

378
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,340
I'm afraid it'll be very difficult to protect Na Sheng, to break through Cangliu's obstacles,

379
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,760
and to unseal the remaining seals.

380
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,310
This Earth ring can sense the Heavenly ring.

381
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,710
I should be the one who goes.

382
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,960
No way, no way.

383
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,720
Right now, none of the Kongsang people

384
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,770
can leave Wuse City during the day.

385
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,620
The six princes and princesses can only travel at night.

386
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,170
How can we safeguard Miss Na Sheng?

387
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,650
There won't be any sunlight under the water of the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

388
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,100
That's good because we can escort her there.

389
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,480
But Jiuyi Mountain is a long-distance away. Besides, along the way,

390
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,360
there aren't any places to hide from the sunlight during the day.

391
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,190
We have to think of a way to get someone else to escort her.

392
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,890
Do we have anyone else?

393
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,160
Who says Kongsang's 100,000 people are all in Wuse City?

394
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,110
Isn't there still a person in Yunhuang?

395
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,490
Senior Brother.

396
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,210
It is Xi Jing,

397
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,800
Kongsang's Great General.

398
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,430
[Xi Jing - Successor of the Holy Sword - Kongsang]

399
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,720
General, we are lucky today.

400
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,900
I caught a wild hare.

401
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,840
[Ting - Former Leader of Quanxian]

402
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,630
After we cross over the snow mountain in front of us, we'll arrive at the Central Plains.

403
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,020
We'll be away from Yunhuang.

404
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,820
To me, whether it's the Central Plains or Yunhuang,

405
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,700
it's fine as long as I can follow you, General.

406
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,580
But to you, as long as there's wine to drink

407
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,900
and money to gamble, it's fine.

408
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,990
There's no more wine.

409
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,170
There's still this much left?

410
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,670
Did you tell me yesterday that we were out of wine?

411
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,780
It will still take some time before we reach Taoyuan Province.

412
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,330
If you finish it all, General, you'll be miserable at night.

413
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,050
But can't you go a day without drinking, General?

414
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,160
Don't call me "General" anymore. I've stopped being one long ago.

415
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,490
I'll go clean the hare, and we'll have something to eat tonight.

416
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,200
Ting.

417
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,190
I've let you leave every year, but you never would.

418
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,970
A 100 years have flown by. You haven't seen your older sister in a long time, right?

419
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,960
Yes. It's indeed been a long time since I've received news about my sister.

420
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,110
You've suffered a lot following me.

421
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,390
You should leave. You are a free person.

422
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:30,590
Go find your family and reunite with your older sister.

423
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,970
General, during these 100 years, I've already said this over 100 times.

424
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,250
If I'm not around when you get drunk and lie on the road, who will drag you back.

425
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,610
If I'm not around, will you eat raw fish and uncooked vegetables every day?

426
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,420
If I'm not around when you gamble and lose all your money, who will bail you out?

427
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,950
What's the use in bailing me out?

428
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,080
I am no longer the Xi Jing from 100 years ago.

429
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,380
In my eyes, you are the same as 100 years ago.

430
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,500
Nothing has changed at all.

431
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,370
Konsang has become Cangliu.

432
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,650
How could I have not changed?

433
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,400
General, if we hurry,

434
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,220
we'll reach Taoyuan Province in half a day's time. There is a Ruyi Gambling House there.

435
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,610
The owner has good wine.

436
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,200
All right.

437
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,180
Brother Ice Cube is a good person, right?

438
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,810
He told me to go hide outside of the city.

439
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,480
It is quite safe.

440
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,580
But I'm so hungry.

441
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,850
I'm tired and hungry and hungry and tired.

442
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,440
No way.

443
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,660
What's going on with this girl now?

444
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,760
High Priest.

445
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,550
Hurry and activate the Water Mirror.

446
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,740
All right.

447
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,960
My goodness!. Are you hurt?

448
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,270
What should I do?

449
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,760
Wake up. Wake up.

450
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,410
What should I do? There is only grass around here, no medicinal herbs.

451
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,360
So cold.

452
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,300
What should I do?

453
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,800
Are you awake?

454
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
What are you doing?

455
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,350
You're hurt. I'm trying to help you.

456
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,150
There's poison.

457
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,410
What's your name?

458
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm...

459
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,860
I'm Na Sheng. I'm from the Central Plains.

460
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,420
Na Sheng, please help me with something.

461
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,270
Please take this necklace to Aunt Ru at the Ruyi Gambling House in Taoyuan Province.

462
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,330
Tell her I failed my mission and was killed in action.

463
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,160
No, you are not dead yet. Don't rush to conclusions.

464
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,980
I brought some medicinal herbs from the Central Plains. There is still hope.

465
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,640
Don't waste your time.

466
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,600
The troops that are after me will surely come. I don't want to implicate you.

467
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,120
No, just wait a moment.

468
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,320
That's right, I have a snow poppy. This precious snow poppy must be able to save your life.

469
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,310
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

470
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,520
To save your life.

471
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,680
Your Highness, why didn't Na Sheng protect herself with the Heavenly Ring

472
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,720
when she was in danger?

473
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,390
I don't know either. The Heavenly ring has clearly already recognized her as its master.

474
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,080
I will go to Taoyuan Province to bring Na Sheng back.

475
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,850
Before we find Senior Brother, I will protect her.

476
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,260
A'Ying, it's too dangerous for you to go alone.

477
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,280
Have Hong Yuan and Lan Xia go with you.

478
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,270
Your Highness, I often wandered the land over the years. I know how to avoid the sun.

479
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,690
Besides, it'll be dark soon.

480
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,050
But you were injured by the sunlight recently and haven't recovered yet.

481
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:02,020
What? Do you no longer listen to me?

482
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,140
Your Highness, are you afraid

483
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,240
I'll run into Su Mo on this trip?

484
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,830
I'll lose face if you expose me like this.

485
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,970
But all I care about now

486
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,850
is letting the people of Kongsang see the sun again.

487
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,500
I will not get involved with Su Mo anymore.

488
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,820
Very well, since you've said that.

489
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,050
However, you must be very careful on this trip.

490
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,240
So good looking.

491
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,090
If you weren't that good-looking, I wouldn't have wasted the snow poppy.

492
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,670
Are you awake?

493
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,440
This snow poppy can really save lives. He didn't trick me.

[Yan Xi - Quanxian Commissioner of the Left]

495
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,770
Did you use the snow poppy to save me?

496
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:26,060
Yes. You didn't expect I would have a snow poppy, right?

497
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,380
I'm surprised that those people who took the fairy grass didn't discover you.

498
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,920
Could it be that you really do have a spirit in you and hid yourself?

499
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,420
Na Sheng,

500
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,960
you're from the Central Plains so you might not know.

501
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,090
The snow poppy is Yunhuang's treasure and is priceless.

502
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,990
I know that. Someone told me that.

503
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,960
Yet you still used it to save a stranger's life?

504
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,760
It'll be extremely difficult for me to find another one to repay you.

505
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,570
It's fine, you are more valuable.

506
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,790
What?

507
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,940
I-I meant you don't have to return a snow poppy to me.

508
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,820
You can give yourself to me. That's fine, too.

509
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,430
W-What's wrong?

510
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,570
Us merpeople won't be slaves to anyone.

511
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,670
No, no! You've misunderstood.

512
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,330
That's not what I meant.

513
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:35,970
I wasn't asking you to be my slave. I want you to be my...

514
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,790
Wait! Did you just say merpeople?

515
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,260
My goodness. I thought that was only a legend.

516
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,500
According to the legend, there is a kind of fish...

517
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,770
No, no. A kind of people, people...

518
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,370
No, a type of fish. No, no. A type of people

519
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,570
who can sing and weave. The tears they shed become pearls.

520
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,660
Looking at you, aside from being a bit more good-looking than me,

521
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,070
there's not much difference between us.

522
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,620
Are those gills?

523
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,100
Wow, so interesting!

524
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,740
Stay still, don't move. I won't touch you anymore.

525
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,840
Although I used the snow poppy to stop the bleeding,

526
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,550
your wounds are still healing.

527
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:32,550
If your wound opens again, we won't have enough herbs.

528
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,400
Miss Na Sheng,

529
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,000
thank you.

530
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,870
If you want to cry, then just let it out.

531
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,530
It won't be as painful if you let it out.

532
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,990
You must be hoping that if I shed tears,

533
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,970
you can get pearls.

534
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,470
You can tell?

535
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,730
I see bloodstains.

Everyone, listen up. Starting from here,

538
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,320
search along the stream until we reach the border of Taoyuan Province.

We must be in danger.

542

I have wasted too much time. I need to return to Taoyuan Province right away.

543
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,390
Miss Na Sheng, we'll part ways here. One day, I will surely repay you for saving my life.

544
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,110
No, no. There's no need to part ways.

545

You might not believe me, but I'm heading to Taoyuan Province as well.

546
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,220
You will run into a lot of danger if you travel with me.

547
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,140
It seems you only know how to say you'll repay me.

548

Yunhuang is big. Once we've parted ways, how will you find me to repay my favor?
