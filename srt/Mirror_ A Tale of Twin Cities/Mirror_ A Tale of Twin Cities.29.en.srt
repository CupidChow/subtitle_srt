[Episode 29]

3
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,400
Your Highness.

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,900
Are you... worried about Qing Yuan and the others?

5
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,460
I'm not worried about him.

6
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,800
Then... are you worried about A'Ying?

7
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,300
I'm...

8
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,970
just feeling a little ashamed.

9
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,600
Everyone has...

10
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,800
dedicated themselves wholeheartedly for the things they want.

11
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,200
Li Zhu, in order to regain freedom,

12
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,600
lit the Perched Star Lamp with her life.

13
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Qing Yuan, for Kongsang,

14
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,300
offered up his young life.

15
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,300
Even Na Sheng, for Yan Xi,

16
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,400
has persisted all this way from Tianque.

17
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,300
But what about me?

18
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
I've been cared for by everyone.

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
But now,

20
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,500
I actually want everyone to contribute even more.

21
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,810
While I'm gaining strength little by little,

22
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm also losing her little by little.

23
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,000
If the dream of seeing the sun again

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
becomes reality,

25
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,100
then she'll... disappear forever.

26
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,900
Is there no way...

27
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,240
to stop A'Ying from scattering and disappearing?

28
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,000
I searched through the Xuan Huang Scripture. There is no record of it.

29
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
A'Ying chose not to tell me. Do you think

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
she knew that if I knew,

31
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,900
I wouldn't try to remove the seals?

32
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,920
All along,

33
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
A'Ying has looked gentle and quiet,

34
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,000
but her temperament is really stubborn.

35
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,610
Once she firmly decides, nothing can pull her back.

36
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,180
Your Highness,

37
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,510
if you feel bad,

38
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,660
you don't need to...

39
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,350
smile in front of me.

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Thank you.

41
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,200
If you hadn't brought me back from the prairie back then,

42
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,400
do you think I wouldn't have had to endure all this?

43
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,100
No.

44
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,300
I was born to belong to Kongsang. I am King Cheng Guang's son.

45
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I've been nailed to that glorious seat

46
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,800
with golden shackles.

47
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Everyone stares at me with fiery eyes.

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You all call me "Crown Prince,"

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,050
call me "Your Highness."

50
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
That's right.

51
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm the crown prince.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,500
I cannot be shaken.

53
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,300
Even when I saw with my own eyes A'Ying and Su Mo

54
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,000
falling from the Life and Death Pavilion,

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,600
I couldn't show a tiny bit of cowardice or hesitation.

56
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,990
But...

57
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,170
at the beginning, I was simply an ordinary person.

58
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,860
I get scared, too.

59
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,600
There are also times when I don't know if I've done the right or wrong thing.

60
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
I...

61
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,800
I can't bear losing A'Ying.

62
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,600
I can't bear losing Qing Yuan,

63
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Lan Xia, Hong Yuan, all of them.

64
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,190
If it were possible,

65
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,600
I would rather...

66
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,540
bear all of this by myself.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,100
It's been hard for you all these years.

68
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,010
You've always had to hold back your emotions.

69
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,400
I will continue to track him down

70
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
and take his life.

71
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,500
At that time, Lord Zhi Zhe, please let me live as a human again.

72
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,790
Search all corners, follow all leads.

73
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,700
If there is any news, report back immediately!

74
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes!

75
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Bai Ying?

76
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,200
Bai Ying, I've finally found you.

77
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,700
I never realized that everything I did

78
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,400
was pushing you towards turning into ash.

79
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
You've been facing me with such despair,

80
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
but I couldn't share your burden.

81
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,800
Bai Ying,

82
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,200
I'm willing to do everything with you, except for one thing that I cannot do.

83
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,100
That is losing you.

84
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,400
Let's not get the seals.

85
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,800
You won't turn into ash then.

86
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,400
I will be with you forever.

87
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,300
Bai Ying!

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Bai Ying!

89
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,650
What did you say?

90
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,470
My sister will turn into ash?

91
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,520
I will curse you for all your lifetimes.

92
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,380
You will never get what you really want in your whole life!

93
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,370
Su Mo!

94
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,140
Lin'er.

95
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,480
Older Sister, you came back for me.

96
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,760
Even if I die, then it's still worth it.

97
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,230
Older Sister, it's not true that you'll turn into ash, is it?

98
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,970
He's talking nonsense, right?

99
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,740
You'll turn into ash, I transformed into a bird spirit,

100
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,440
is this our fate?

101
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,410
Older Sister, I don't want this! I don't want this! What do we do?

102
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,180
I cannot change the fact that I will turn into ash when Wuse City reopens.

103
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,140
But I'll definitely do my best to help you become human again.

104
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,730
If you turn into ash, what's the point for me to become human again?

105
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,410
Older Sister, promise me.

106
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,530
Let's stay in Jiuyi Mountain and not go unseal the seals, all right?

107
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,390
It doesn't matter if I'm a bird spirit for life, all right? Promise me!

108
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,560
Lin'er, I'm sorry.

109
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,610
I cannot promise you that I'll stay here with you. Okay?

110
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,190
Since you're not willing to stay here, whatever I say is meaningless.

111
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,890
Just pretend that you've never had a younger sister, then.

112
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,470
Lin'er!

113
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,660
She'll come back. She just can't accept...

114
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,730
that eventually... she'll lose you.

115
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,160
Su Mo, I've thought a lot about this on the way here.

116
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,240
You gave me the Light Avoidance Pearl so that I could walk under the sun again

117
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,430
and made my heart start beating again.

118
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,780
Not telling you was probably because of my own selfishness.

119
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,790
Because I feared that if I told you, all of this would cease to exist.

120
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,920
So I had been deceiving myself.

121
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,000
I've been pretending...

122
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,690
that I already forgot about turning into ash.

123
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,950
But now... I have to wake up from the dream.

124
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,620
I cannot force you to continue to stay by my side.

125
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,820
The best result that I can think of...

126
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,220
is to return to...

127
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,530
where the two of us started.

128
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,460
Return to where?

129
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,550
Return to when you were Su Mo...

130
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,990
and I was Bai Ying.

131
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,720
Rather than having both of us suffer, maybe separation...

132
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,220
would be easier for you to bear?

133
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,150
Bai Ying.

134
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,100
If I can change this...

135
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,330
If I can protect you...

136
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,390
Will you come with me?

137
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,980
I also want to go with you, to a future where you'll exist.

138
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,730
I also want to go with you to the Biluo Sea.

139
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,330
But I don't have a future anymore.

140
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,580
You still have a long lifetime.

141
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,360
Sorry, Su Mo.

142
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,710
I... I can't.

143
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,150
♫ Stay until love is insoluble ♫

144
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,920
Everything will turn out as I wish.

145
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,810
Everything will turn out as I wish.

146
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:59,870
♫ Escape into the deeply buried waves of the sea ♫

147
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,960
♫ Give birth to blue branches ♫

148
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,840
Bai Ying,

149
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,660
everything will turn out as you wish.

150
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:19,960
♫ Perhaps this is your silent answer ♫

151
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:26,240
♫ All beginnings comes at the expense of having endings ♫

152
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:34,170
♫ I once walked over waves to borrow a bit of starlight ♫

153
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,160
♫ Yet, no matter what I do, I cannot see you clearly ♫

154
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,920
♫ I thought that closing my eyes would make my heart clear ♫

155
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,700
♫ Yet I'm just lost in reverie ♫

156
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,520
♫ All beginnings come at the expense of having endings ♫

157
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,150
♫ However, love makes even breathing so difficult to do ♫

158
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,950
Stop right there. Don't say anything else to me.

159
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,300
If you say it again, I'll start crying again.

160
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,620
It's embarrassing as a crown prince, don't you know?

161
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,360
You've finished venting.

162
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,080
But I still have to say something. I want to vent, too!

163
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,680
Sure. Go ahead.

164
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,250
Before, when I led the troops into battle,

165
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,390
Cangliu always sought opportunities to intrude.

166
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,960
Once, I was trapped in the Lingqiu Mountain and reinforcements hadn't arrived yet.

167
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,930
At the time, I was ready to tell the troops to retreat.

168
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,670
But the messenger made a mistake in sending out the wrong command.

169
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,670
Instead of raising the flag for withdrawal, he raised the marching flag.

170
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,960
What happened then?

171
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,990
My troops then...

172
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,640
experienced high morale and charged into battle,

173
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
and instantly reversed the whole situation.

174
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,320
When I saw you again after 100 years,

175
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,100
that firmness in your gaze made me feel

176
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,300
that you are that flag. Because of you, Zhen Lan,

177
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,210
we came together; we will live and die together.

178
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,550
Because you took the first step,

179
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,630
we were able to find the way home. Maybe it's like what you said,

180
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,870
being a royal descendant is to be "enslaved in shackles."

181
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,530
But on the other hand, it is also a belief and strength.

182
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,900
So, I want to thank you. Really.

183
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,950
I know, regardless if it's Bai Ying,

184
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,630
Su Mo, or yourself. You run and fight

185
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,180
not for your individual freedoms, desires, or hatred,

186
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,280
but for something high above that.

187
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,330
For opening Wuse City, for waking up the 100,000 people,

188
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,780
for Quanxian's return to the Biluo Sea,

189
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,260
this...

190
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,500
is why I respect you all.

191
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,560
Because none of you is doing this for yourself.

192
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,740
And you...

193
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,690
I understand you. Even when you don't want to,

194
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,090
you will always make the decision that is most right.

195
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,800
Therefore, if you ever feel bad from now on,

196
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,990
there is me, the heir to Holy Sword Sect, Kongsang's Great General.

197
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,020
There are also Na Sheng...

198
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,460
and Qing Yuan. Together we will

199
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,060
stay by your side to keep going forward.

200
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,170
You called me Zhen Lan.

201
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,370
Ever since I ascended the seat of the crown prince, you've always called me "Your Highness."

202
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,920
But I still prefer you to call me Zhen Lan.

203
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,760
Since the seal was removed your strength is stronger now!

204
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,760
- General Xi Jing!
- Uncle Xi Jing!

205
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,890
Uncle Xi Jing, Cangliu people are coming this way!

206
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,290
Get down! Get down!

207
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,690
So many of them. This isn't the time to fight them directly.

208
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,590
We need to divert them.

209
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,130
Search!

210
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,470
Yan Xi, Xi Jing and I will divert them. You two go down the mountain first.

211
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,930
- Let's go.
- How do we meet up again?

212
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,830
Tianxiang Tavern at the bottom of Jiuyi Mountain.

213
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,150
- Tianxiang Tavern. Go!
- Go!

214
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,970
They're over there. After them!

215
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,020
Hurry, go!

216
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,500
- What do we do?
- Your invisibility spell is about to come in handy.

217
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,680
But my invisibility spell doesn't always work. I don't know if it can deal with them.

218
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,560
Don't worry, just do it. I have my own way.

219
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,840
What do we do? Kill him?

220
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,410
Even though he's chased after us several times before,

221
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,130
but he's not like those brutal Cangliu people.

222
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,340
Let's release him.

223
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,760
But... we're enemies.

224
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,270
Either they die or we die.

225
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,820
Even if we let him go today,

226
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,280
he'll come back another day to kill us.

227
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,790
But we're in the wilderness,

228
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,970
if there's danger,

229
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,440
he'll definitely be taken away by the evil bird spirits.

230
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,020
How about we keep him as a hostage?

231
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,400
He is a Cangliu General afterall.

232
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,300
If we keep him, maybe it'll be helpful to our next plan.

233
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,830
That's right. What you say makes sense.

234
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,360
If the Cangliu people chase us again, we'll just push him out.

235
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,920
They wouldn't dare touch us then.

236
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,910
[Tianxiang Tavern]

237
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,940
Will Brother Crown Prince and Uncle Xi Jing meet us here?

238
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,050
I left marks along the way.

239
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,010
It should be no problem.

240
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,630
Do you have something on your mind?

241
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,170
Whenever I think about how this came from Sister Ya Ren,

242
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,630
my heart aches.

243
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,320
She exchanged it with her life.

244
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,770
We should cherish it.

245
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,220
I'll keep it safe.

246
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,320
If I put it on the phoenix crown, I bet it'd look really nice.

247
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,880
What's the matter?

248
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,440
Would I look pretty wearing a phoenix crown?

249
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,230
I should think so.

250
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,530
You...

251
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,550
You... I...

252
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,020
What's wrong? I only kissed you once.

253
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,600
Why are you reacting so strongly?

254
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,020
No, I...

255
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,960
It's so dangerous up in the mountains.

256
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,810
Every day all thought about was how to get down the mountain sooner so I could see you.

257
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,940
I've finally come down the mountain.

258
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,500
You've said nothing.

259
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,440
What are you two doing? Don't do anything shameful!

260
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,570
There is someone else here.

261
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,120
What nonsense are you saying?

262
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,980
He's wounded.

263
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,080
He probably got wounded when we dragged him here.

264
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,770
Get up. Let me take a look.

265
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,020
What are you doing?

266
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,120
This is a Quanxian herb. It's very effective in stopping bleeding and pain.

267
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,990
Who knows if your medicine contains poison or not?

268
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,460
It does, it'll poison you to death.

269
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,540
- Thanks.
- We've taken you as our hostage and you're saying thank you? Are you a fool?

270
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,950
Those are two separate matters.

271
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,610
Na Sheng, pour me some water.

272
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,470
All right.

273
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,890
If soldiers pursue and capture us later,

274
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,740
don't hurt her.

275
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,370
Agreed?

276
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,640
All right, I promise.

277
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,270
Here, returning this back to you.

278
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,480
General!

279
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,900
Good job.

280
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,350
You've done a great service.

281
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,180
No matter how capable you are, you still ended up in my hands.

282
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,950
Take him back to Jing City tomorrow.

283
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,730
- Don't delay a single moment.
- Yes.

284
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,990
- General.
- Why are you here?

285
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,270
The barrier at Jiuyi has been broken. However, we didn't hear any news from you.

286
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,180
Saintess Yu Zhu was very worried.

287
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,710
She ordered me to come here to assist you.

288
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,290
The news really travels fast.

289
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,960
I fear someone in the Imperial Court

290
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,650
has already filed a complaint against me.

291
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,350
Saintess Yu Zhu made clear that

292
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,000
we shouldn't go back if we don't succeed this time.

293
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,580
Why?

294
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,970
Master Lang slandered you in front of Master Xian.

295
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,280
As for Master Peng, he doesn't seem to have the intention of speaking up for you.

296
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,010
A killer has also been dispatched by Nan Zhao.

297
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,340
The five masters

298
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,000
are waiting for you and General Fei Lian to go back and be held accountable.

299
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,730
It's the intention of the lord on top of Jing Pagoda, right?

300
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,760
Lord on top of Jing Pagoda?

301
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,340
Nothing.

302
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,790
I'm giving you a task.

303
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,760
- I will listen to your instruction.
- I've caught Su Mo.

304
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
Set out and escort him back to Jing City tomorrow.

305
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,370
You alone are on patrol today. Don't let anyone get near him.

306
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,610
Don't disappoint me.

307
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,210
Yes.

308
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,320
Why did Xiao sneak in?

309
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,960
Young Master.

310
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,110
Don't bother wasting your energy struggling.

311
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,260
This Lapis Lazuli Rope is specifically used to deal with those who use spells.

312
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,050
Senior Sister.

313
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,200
So, this is your trick to lure out the enemy.

314
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,960
Where's Su Mo?

315
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,110
You didn't capture him at all.

316
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,760
From the very beginning, I was the one you wanted to capture.

317
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,290
That's right, you're the one I wanted to capture.

318
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,870
Go back and notify General Yu Huan.

319
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,230
I should thank you today.

320
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,750
Without your cooperation, I wouldn't have been able to capture Bai Ying.

321
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,220
I told you not to disappoint me but you still came to rescue him.

322
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,480
He's useless to me now.

323
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,430
If you want to see this innocent person die in front of you,

324
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,740
call him Young Master in a loud voice.

325
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,670

I'm giving you one last chance.

327
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,380
Between Su Mo and I,

328
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:09,500
you can only choose one master.

329
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,090
Relay this order. Increase the guards today.

330
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,850
Escort the earth royal back to the city tomorrow.

331
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,260
Whoever makes any careless mistakes, interrogate them!

332
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,530
General, General Fei Lian has not returned to camp. Should we wait for him?

333
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:28,850
No need. It's more important to escort the earth royal back.

334
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,120
Do this immediately to avoid problems during the night.

335
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,190
Fei Lian will handle his own problems.

- Did you decide where to hang it?
- Over there.

338
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,350
- Do you need my help?
- No.

339
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,070
It's only devout if I hang it myself.

340
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,870
It seems that this wish is very mysterious.

341
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,420
It's my secret with the Flower Deity Tree.

Then what was the wish you made a hundred years ago?

00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,120
Do you want to know?

347
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,480
I want to take you with me back to Biluo Sea.

348
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,550
To watch the seven seas and listen to the sound of the waves.

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:10,400
Su Mo, are you doing well?

353
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,630
Commissioner of the Right!

354
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,830
Commissioner of the Right. We found Young Master after he fell into Jing Lake. He's unconscious.

355
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,520
Hurry, take him to the ice chamber.

356
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,130
Yes.

357
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,330
What happened to Young Master?

358
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:34,630
He fell into Jing Lake. We didn't see anyone attack him.

359
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,480
I've roughly examined him; there are no obvious injuries.
[Zhi Xiu - Quanxian - Merpeople Physician]

360
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,090
But why is he still unconscious?

361
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,640
Could it be some internal injury?

362
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,860
What's going on with the blue-black vapor?

363
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,320
Could it be some sorcery?

364
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,630
I don't think so.

365
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,260
Find a way to call back the Commissioner of the Left and ask what happened.

[Tianxiang Tavern]

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,470
Tianxiang Tavern.

368
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,190
This should be the base Yan Xi was talking about.

369
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,630
Let's go in and take a look.

370
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,380
Did you hear? The day before yesterday we caught a member of Kongsang.

371
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,350
She was a woman in white and quite beautiful too.

372
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,200
I can't believe that Kongsang is still dragging out the inevitable.

373
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Really?

374
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,190
It's true.

375
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,860
I saw the guards escort her out of the city this morning.

376
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,390
Gentlemen.

377
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,600
You just said that a woman in white was caught?

378
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,040
Who caught her?

379
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,700
I heard it was a general from Jing City.

380
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,900
What kind of woman in white was she?

381
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,490
I don't know. We never saw her.

382
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,140
But the general caught a merperson at Banbu City before.

383
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,990
They were called something, called... the Emperor of the Sea.

384
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,530
Then he caught a woman in white.

Where is the woman in white now?

387
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,000
- We don't know about that.
- Thank you for your time.

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,580

What is he doing here?

- We captured him.
- You captured him?

392

It's a long story.

393
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,400
Why are you two so worried? What happened?

394
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,300
It seems that Su Mo and A'Ying were captured by Cangliu and taken to Jing City.

395
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,640
- What?
- What?

396
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,220
I just received news from the Great Camp that Young Master has returned.

397
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,960
Is your news reliable?

398
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,350
A'Ying fell into a trap.

399
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,970
If that's the case, A'Ying and Su Mo didn't meet at all.

400
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,220
Could it have been Yu Huan?

What information do you know?

402
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,080
You've already captured me. What could I know?

403
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,730
Tell me. Did you all capture A'Ying?

404
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,660
Why don't you catch up with them

405
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
instead of wasting time with me here?

406
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,040
From the looks of it, he must know the truth.

407
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,540
Don't get clever with me! Tell me!

408
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,940
Do as you please.

409
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,990
He probably really doesn't know anything. I caught him right after we separated.

410
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,490
I don't think he has anything to do with this.

411
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,670
Do you know where in Jing City she was taken?

412
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,790
The military camp or prison?

413

Even if I knew,

414
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,760
do you think I'd tell you?

415
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,480
Then stop talking.

416

Forget it. I'll start heading back with Xi Jing.

417

I'll have the High Priest search for her with the Water Mirror and try to save A'Ying first.

Okay. I'll take good care of Na Sheng.

What about him?

420
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,120
Take him with us. He'll be useful.

How are they suspicious?

423
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,440
They kept asking about the woman in white that was captured yesterday.

424
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,270
They asked for a lot of details. Then I realized they weren't from Cangliu.

425
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,930
Go on.

426
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,620
- I have to pee.
- You're so troublesome.

427
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,710
I have to pee.

428
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,830
- Make it quick.
- Don't rush me.

429

- Where did he go?
- He ran. Don't worry about him. Let's go.

General.

433
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,240
Why am I seeing you here? I heard Banbu City's Commander say that you were captured by the people of Kongsang.

434
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,560
I just escaped.

- What do we do?
- Let's go.

443
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,510
General, are you sure they went this way?

444
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,330
I'm sure. They ran this way.

445
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,070

Was it the Heavenly King who injured you?

448
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,840
I got a scratch from the fight just now. It's nothing.

449
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,550
I didn't expect Quanxian to still give preferential treatment to prisoners...

450
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,700
and treat their prisoners' wounds.

451

I treated the wound myself.

452
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,560
Then you really do have many connections, General.

453
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,790
You even have Quanxian's medicine.

454
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,500
How do you know it's Quanxian's medicine?

455
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,450
I've got many Quanxian concubines in my manor. They all use this on their skin.

456
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,270
It makes their skin extremely soft after applying.

457
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,560
Mine was also from a Quanxian female entertainer.

458
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,430
I didn't expect it to come in handy now.

459
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:31,550
General, I still can't let this go.

460
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,060
You've suffered a lot these past few days,

461
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:37,540
but I'm sure you know where their base is.

462
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,590
Why don't we go back first

463
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,390
and plan this out with Yu Huan?

464
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,050
It's not too late to come back and catch them later. Right?

465
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,810
You just said to quickly capture those rebels.

466
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,600
Why do you now want to return to Jing City now?

467
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,260
Are you colluding with the rebels...

468
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,160
and trying to cause a revolt?

469

Nan Zhao!

470
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,720
Framing a general means a death sentence!

471
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,640
When was I ever afraid to die?

472
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,070
As for you, General,

473
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:17,130
if you're not selling your friends to the enemy and just doing this to survive,

474
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,310
I'll exchange the lives of my brothers in Cangliu

475
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,370
for your freedom!

476
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,200

477
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,520
Who dares to move?

478
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,750
How dare you try to seize me?

479
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,330
I'm loyal to Cangliu and was ordered to capture the bandits.

480
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:38,090
But I refuse to trust in your actions today.

481
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,160
I wasn't able to catch the rebels for Cangliu,

482
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,160
but catching a traitor makes this battle worth it too.

483
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,300
Who is in that carriage?

484
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,150
I heard it's a remaining member of Kongsang. They seem to be royalty, too.

485

General Yu Huan has made great achievements this time.

00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:12,750
That's right. Who said he didn't?

487
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,520
Congratulations on your victorious return, General Yu Huan.

488
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,750
You captured Kongsang's Princess Bai alive. You are young and promising.

489
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,670
You've overpraised me, Master Peng.

490
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,350
I'm a soldier of Cangliu.

491
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,930
It's my duty to follow the orders of Lord Zhi Zhe.

492
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,260
General Yu Huan, come up to receive your order.

493
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,500
Order of Commendation. General Yu Huan is promoted

494
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,320
to first-rank general.

495
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,920
Thank you, Lord Zhi Zhe.

496
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,720
Lord Zhi Zhe's training really is effective.

497
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,920
You made such a great achievement so soon.

498
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,480
I'll never forget...

499
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,020
Master Peng's training.

500
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,300
How is Young Master doing?

501
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,160
It seems that his soul has been captured.

502
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,400
Only Lord Ming Huo can save Young Master.

503

Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

504
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,680
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

505
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,220
♫ A strange light in the night ♫f

506
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:34,080
♫ In the dream, there are longing and fear ♫

507
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,480
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

508
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,980
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

509
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:48,950
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

510
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,490
♫ We've met several times ♫

511
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,890
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our past fated relationship ♫

512
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:02,950
♫ Sighing for the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

513
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,380
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

514
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,920
♫ You live in there ♫

515
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,990
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

516
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,840
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

517
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,930
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

518
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,810
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

519
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,380
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

520
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,750
♫ Using ten finger to painstakingly ♫

521
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,240
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

522
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,700
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

523
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,760
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

524
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,790
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

525
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:54,710
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

526
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,170
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

527
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,540
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

528
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:06,630
♫ I would rather turn into ashes and be lost in a reverie ♫

529
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:17,430
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
