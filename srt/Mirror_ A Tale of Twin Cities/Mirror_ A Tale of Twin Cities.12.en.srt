[Episode 12]

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,790
Let them through!

4
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,150
From now on, we'll open the city gates.

5
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,110
Anyone who wants to can pass through!

6
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,630
Yes, sir!

7
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,510
This way! After them!

8
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,950
We can't keep running like this.

9
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,710
How are you doing?

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,960
Are you wondering if they got away safely?

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,980
Don't ask me how I knew. I can see it on your face.

12
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,110
Say, if we can lure them all here,

13
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,100
do you have a way to...

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,040
How boring would it be if they all died.

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,430
Sounds like you have a way then.

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,580
Wait here. I'll lure them over.

17
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,330
You got us out of there. If I don't contribute something, I'll owe you a favor.

18
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,880
Go on.

19
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,000
After him!

20
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,160
This way!

21
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,850
Catch him!

22
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,280
This doesn't feel right.

23
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,610
Will there be an ambush?

24
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,270
What are you afraid of?

[Taoyuan Village]

26
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,260
Why hasn't the Young Master and the others come back yet?

27
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,110
Should we go in first? I don't think Yan Xi can keep it together anymore.

28
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,980
Young Master!

29
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,730
Hey. Good working with you.

30
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,810
Give everyone some time to catch their breath.

31
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,680
But, Young Master...

32
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,260
Let them bid farewell to Ting.

33
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,130
Young Master.

34
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,430
Everyone's settled down.

35
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,340
Crown Prince Zhen Lan and Princess Bai Ying each have a room.

36
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,250
Na Sheng is looking after Yan Xi.

37
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,290
Aunt Ru, thank you for your hard work.

38
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,850
You still allowed them to stay here.

39
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,190
Will you tell them to leave after Ting's funeral?

40
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,330
Let them at least rest for a day.

41
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,250
Ting died saving Na Sheng.

42
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,590
That's right.

43
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,930
It was her choice.

44
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,180
What's yours?

45
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Aunt Ru, you agreed with me to let them stay here?

46
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,520
Young Master, you have your reasons.

47
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,910
It's just that I can't tell what they are.

48
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,110
Cangliu's troops and military equipment

49
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,040
are much more powerful than I imagined.

50
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,360
But, Young Master, you've also taken down one of their weapons.

51
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,650
They've also helped us in this battle.

52
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,090
Now that they're injured,

53
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,680
we cannot turn a blind eye to our comrades-in-arms.

54
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,380
Comrades-in-arms?

55
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,440
Aunt Ru, right now, our common enemy

56
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,850
is Cangliu, not Kongsang.

57
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,620
Cangliu is powerful.

58
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,880
We should gather all the strength we can get to fight back. This way we can return to the Biluo Sea sooner.

59
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,490
But seven thousand years ago, it was the Heavenly King of Kongsang

60
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,990
who sealed the entrance to Biluo Sea.

61
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,160
He took away our home. A hundred years ago,

62
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,970
it was also Prince Qing Chen of Kongsang, who was trading Merpeople as slaves.

63
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,850
This hate, how can we just forget it?

64
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,460
Aunt Ru, do you think it's more important to imprison our people in hatred,

65
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,640
or to give everyone hope?

66
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,070
Of course, it's for everyone to have hope.

67
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,620
Forming an alliance isn't to forget about the injuries inflicted on us.

68
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,200
Instead, it's to find a way out, while remembering the past.

69
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
We're fragile and not made for battle. Although I have this power,

70
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,520
but if it's just me,

71
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm afraid it'll be too hard to fight the Cangliu army.

72
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,810
I can take down one weapon today.

73
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,020
But what about a hundred of them? A thousand?

74
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,130
Kongsang shares the same goal as we do.

75
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,440
Maybe one day,

76
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,790
we can create an ideal Yunhuang.

77
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,880
Young Master, you have great and far-sighted vision.

78
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,670
What the Quanxian people hope for,

79
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,120
is just to live a peaceful life.

80
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,140
That's what I believe, too.

81
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,190
I hope that it'll come true soon.

82
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,280
A'Ying.

83
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,340
Your Highness.

84
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,190
Are we leaving after we bid farewell to Ting?

85
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,230
It'd be best if we can rest here for a day,

86
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,850
since Na Sheng can't go back to Wuse City with us.

87
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,450
Now that Xi Jing...

88
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,760
But... what about Su Mo and the others?

89
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,250
Us staying here might bring them more trouble.

90
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,880
You're right.

91
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,510
The Heavenly Ring has brought quite a bit of trouble to the Quanxian.

92
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,770
Su Mo has a weird temper,

93
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,540
but he's helped us many times already.

94
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,700
We should thank him.

95
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,780
It's my fault. My powers are scattered.

96
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,560
I can't give you much protection.

97
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,480
Your Highness...

98
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,470
I'll talk to Su Mo and see what he thinks.

99
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,390
I won't force it on him.

100
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,210
Don't worry.

101
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,940
General, if you're going to fight against Cangliu,

102
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,810
I'm willing to give you my assistance.

103
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,050
I ask General, please let me stay.

104
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,560
Every year, I told you to leave, but you wouldn't.

105
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,130
It's been a hundred years.

106
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,100
General, I've told you a hundred times over the century.

107
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,130
Without me, who's going to take you home when you're drunk and lying in the streets.

108
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,200
Without me, are you just going to eat raw fish and vegetables every day?

109
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,240
Without me, who's going to pay your debts after you gamble away all your money?

110
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,110
What's the use of paying off my debts?

111
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,380
I'm already not the Xi Jing from a hundred years ago.

112
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,860
In my eyes,

113
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,650
General, you're exactly the same as a hundred years ago.

114
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,850
Nothing's changed.

115
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,980
It's been a tough life with me.

116
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,940
You should leave. Go back to Biluo Sea.

117
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,100
Ting... Ting turned into a star.

118
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,760
She really turned into a star!

119
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,120
Young Master said that

120
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,040
you were all injured in the battle of Taoyuan Province.

121
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,070
For the moment, you can get some rest here.

122
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,580
Sounds good. Then, I'll go look after Yan Xi right now.

123
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,800
Would this be too much trouble?

124
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,170
Young Master doesn't mind.

125
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,740
Let's go.

126
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,000
This was Ting's choice.

127
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,860
She never saw you as enemies.

128
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,660
Kongsang never saw the Quanxian as an enemy either.

129
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,760
Over the past hundred years,

130
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,710
Ting followed me all over.

131
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,780
I'd long forgotten...

132
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,540
if I was a part of Kongsang or the Merpeople.

133
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,120
I know...

134
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,870
Ting had never forgotten about the Quanxian.

135
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,220
She also never forgot that...

136
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,180
the Quanxian should return to Biluo Sea.

137
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,010
Not a single one of us will forget.

138
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,950
I want to promise you something.

139
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,700
Xi Jing, the oldest disciple of Master Mo Yan of the Holy Sword Sect,

140
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,380
today, makes this promise to Su Mo, the Emperor of the Sea.

141
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,650
I will devote all I have

142
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,940
to assist the Quanxian in returning to Biluo Sea.

143
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,480
I promise on my honor as a swordsman.

144
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,550
I, Su Mo, will also promise you that

145
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,100
from today onward, General Xi Jing will be

146
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,050
Quanxian's most trusted ally.

147
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,170
Bai Ying, is that you?

148
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,010
They know everything that

149
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,790
you've been doing for the Quanxian.

150
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,130
They'll be grateful to you.

151
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,850
A hundred years ago,

152
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,680
I'd always stood quietly like this behind you.

153
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,060
I saw that there was a lot you didn't have control over in your life.

154
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,480
But it's only now do I understand

155
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,460
the enormous responsibilities you were shouldering.

156
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,910
Your power has strengthened greatly

157
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,820
in the past hundred years.

158
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,770
What magic exactly have you been studying?

159
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,380
Did you have to go through a lot of...

160
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,540
Are you concerned about me?

161
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,430
- At Ruyi Ganbling House—
- At the gambling house, I didn't purposely mean to hurt you.

162
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,000
Did your power backlash and hurt you when we were at the gambling house?

163
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,530
It didn't.

164
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,360
Even if it's just for the sake of the Quanxian,

165
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,790
you should look after yourself.

166
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,850
It's getting late. You should get some rest.

167
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,720
If you didn't want to see me,

168
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,380
why are you concerned if I was hurt by my power backlash?

169
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,560
If you wanted to see me,

170
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,230
why do you keep saying things like that?

171
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,380
Since you don't want to say,

172
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,160
I won't force you either.

[Ning Liang - Quanxian - Captain of Qianbu Battalion]

175
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,800
Who are you? There's a barrier around here. How did you get in?

176
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,850
This is the territory of the Quanxian. Of course, I can get in. Who are you?

177
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,100
- You haven't told me who you are first.
- How did you get in here?

178
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,990
- Na Sheng!
- How did you—

179
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,450
- What's going on?
- A Kongsang.

180
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,180
Hey, stop that!

181
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,890
Hold!

182
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,020
Greetings, Young Master.

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,390
[Taoyuan Village]

184
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,360
Young Master, you've finally returned.

185
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,580
Young Master, the elders are waiting in the base camp.

186
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,080
When can we head out?

187
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,830
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

188
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,630
Yan Xi hasn't woken up yet.

189
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,350
Should we wait until Yan Xi wakes up? Then we can head back to the base camp together.

190
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,550
Yan Xi's injured? Is it serious?

191
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,460
I've already treated him. You all don't need to worry.

192
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,700
Young Master, what about your injuries?

193
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,680
I'm all right.

194
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,500
It's just that during the fight in Taoyuan Province,

195
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,360
Yan Xi was hurt.

196
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,920
Ting...

197
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,330
passed away.

198
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,100
I won't forgive those people from Cangliu.

199
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,190
Don't be impulsive.

200
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,060
Cangliu's army is strong. They have many weapons, too.

201
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,030
We aren't strong enough to oppose them.

202
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,800
Now that Young Master is back, if we fight against them, why wouldn't we stand a chance?

203
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,810
How many people are left in the Quanxian camp?

204
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,780
Counting those who came back yesterday and those who heard of your return,

205
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,810
coming from different places around Yunhuang,

206
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,930
there's a total of 3,300 soldiers.

207
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,070
Even though there aren't many of them, they're all determined,

208
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,280
able-bodied elite.

209
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,710
We weren't good at military matters, to begin with.

210
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,300
Even if we have great generals, we aren't a match for the Cangliu's weapons.

211
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,000
During the fight in Taoyuan Province, we destroyed a Wind Falcon.

212
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,180
But if the sky is filled with them, it would be hard for me to handle them.

213
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,830
Young Master, what you want to say is, we should sit still

214
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,560
and continue to let the Cangliu keep bullying Quanxian,

215
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,150
and not open the way to return to Biluo Sea?

216
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,140
Of course not.

217
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,630
We must go back to Biluo Sea.

218
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,820
It's just...

219
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,680
the road home is long, we have to think long term.

220
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,180
Only by getting rid of the dragon deity's seal

221
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,650
and gaining the dragon deity's power,

222
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,610
then I can lead everyone and defeat Cangliu.

223
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,270
Therefore, before that happens, I don't want to see needless casualties again.

224
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,020
Young Master, you needn't worry.

225
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,470
Our Quanxian tribe has waited for 7,000 years to welcome the Emperor of the Sea.

226
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,280
Dawn is in sight.

227
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,080
We definitely won't make reckless moves.

228
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,770
The warriors that I need most are loyal,

229
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,740
steady, trusting,

230
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,790
as for everything else, just leave it to me.

231
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,080
Outside, just now, some merpeople came by.

232
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,490
They said they were your companions.

233
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,600
But they looked so vicious.

234
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,160
When I think about it, they looked a little like Brother Ice Cube.

235
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,920
They are all vicious.

236
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,530
But you're different from them.

237
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,850
You treat me the best.

238
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,120
When will you wake up?

239
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,320
Hurry and wake up.

240
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,280
Aunt Ru, we're about to return to Quanxian's main camp in Jing Lake.

241
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
- What do you plan to do?
- I'll listen to whatever orders you have, Young Master.

242
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,740
I need you to return to Taoyuan Province

243
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,370
and stay by Gao Shunzhao's side.

244
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,810
Go back to stay by Gao Shunzhao?

245
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Yunhuang is very large.

246
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,310
Cangliu's troops are also very strong.

247
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,200
If we can use Gao Shunzhao,

248
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,920
that would be the best.

249
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,500
Young Master, you want to do this to control

250
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,760
the troops in Taoyuan Province?

251
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,450
After such a disaster in Taoyuan Province.

252
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,870
Gao Shunzhao will be very dissatisfied

253
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,420
with what Cangliu did.

254
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,220
But, in the end, he's one of Cangliu's noblemen.

255
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,980
I'm afraid it won't be easy to persuade him.

256
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,740
I have a drug,

257
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,030
Aunt Ru, that can probably help.

258
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,520
- This is...
- It's a mind control drug.

259
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,450
These are Cangliu's dirty tricks.

260
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,580
We're using their own methods against them.

261
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,550
But we can't let ourselves become like them.

262
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,920
Do you hear me?

263
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,600
Aunt Ru, please do your best. If you can persuade him,

264
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,480
it'll definitely reduce Quanxian's unnecessary deaths.

265
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,080
Young Master, I'll definitely persuade him.

266
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,830
Young Master!

267
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,340
Let her speak.

268
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,670
We shouldn't have any discord amongst ourselves.

269
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,580
If I may ask, Young Master, what should we do about the Kongsang people in Taoyuan Village?

270
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,160
Let them continue to stay here?

271
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,590
They're only resting for a while. They'll leave tonight.

272
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,480
The battle in Taoyuan Village was more or less related to the Kongsang people. If the Kongsang people stay here

273
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,570
and are discovered by Cangliu people, then Taoyuan Village won't be safe. Please consider carefully, Young Master.

274
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,080
They're leaving tonight. It should be fine.

275
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,170
Our original enemy has been Cangliu,

276
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,270
not Kongsang.

277
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,920
What the Kongsang people are experiencing now is what we've experienced.

278
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,470
How can we ignore them and not help?

279
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,430
But what Kongsang did to Quanxian 100 years ago,

280
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,650
is Young Master pretending that it never happened?

281
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,150
Will they regard us as friends?

282
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,520
A hundred years ago, it was the Qing clan that enslaved Quanxian.

283
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,530
The one who blocked us from returning to the main camp in Jing Lake at the city gate was also Prince Qing.

284
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,680
For each grievance, there's a proper culprit.

285
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,150
- We cannot harm the innocent.
- Excuse me, Young Master.

286
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,110
It's just that, for the past hundred years,

287
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,450
Quanxian army's soldiers have experienced too many injuries and deaths,

288
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,080
and too many farewells.

289
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,450
So we're afraid something like this will happen again.

290
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,030
Everything I'm doing now

291
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,890
is because I wish to avoid repeating past mistakes.

292
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,230
Ning Liang, I hope you have some confidence

293
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,270
in me as the Emperor of the Sea.

294
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,210
Young Master, you need not be so serious.

295
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,330
I wasn't thinking thoroughly.

296
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,020
I hope Young Master won't take it to heart.

297
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,390
We originally aren't people who are good at fighting.

298
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,320
We only wish to be peaceful and stable.

299
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,480
This has been our constant wish for 7,000 years.

300
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,040
You won't even give me a sip of wine.

301
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,020
So stingy.

302
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,850
It's just plain water.

303
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,320
I don't believe it.

304
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,560
Goji berries?

305
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,770
So nurturing.

306
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,680
I promised Ting

307
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,880
not to wallow in drinking again.

308
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,050
I'll do what I promised.

309
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,360
My condolences.

310
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,690
I didn't get a chance to reminisce with you in Taoyuan Province.

311
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,140
You helped a lot and worked hard.

312
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,290
Why is Your Highness suddenly so courteous?

313
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,430
I'm not used to it.

314
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,160
I'm the one not used to...

315
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
how casual and informal you are.

316
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,230
Your mouth is even more glib than before.

317
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,330
Then I should... still thank you.

318
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,920
I've been drinking and sleeping for the past hundred years.

319
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,040
It's time I do something more serious.

320
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,100
I haven't wanted to interfere with anything in Yunhuang,

321
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,510
didn't matter if it was with Kongsang or with Quanxian.

322
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:31,460
When my wife died, I can at least tell you

323
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,790
that she died without regrets.

324
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,040
But now...

325
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,510
Ting is dead.

326
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,140
I can't keep lying and telling myself

327
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,830
that anything in Yunhuang has nothing to do with me.

328
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,910
Because everyone that I cared about...

329
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,560
is gone.

330
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,800
I don't want anyone else to suffer again.

331
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,560
Therefore...

332
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,360
you've decided to interfere?

333
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,730
Are you really ready

334
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,950
to draw your sword to fight for Kongsang again?

335
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,460
I'll do my best.

336
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,130
You're truly my good general.

337
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,760
My capability is limited after all.

338
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,790
But there's too much that I want to safeguard.

339
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,350
Your Highness,

340
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,430
I'm not just thinking about Kongsang,

341
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,810
I also want to help the Quanxian return to Biluo Sea.

342
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,560
Is this too ambitious?

343
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,440
I know what you're thinking.

344
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,190
I know it well.

345
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,460
Regardless of whether you're doing it for Kongsang

346
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,610
or for Ting who's now gone,

347
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,340
I'm happy that you can stand tall again.

348
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:19,130
[Cangliu - Royal Prison]

349
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,530
If you don't cooperate with us,

350
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,900
you'll be whipped to death.

351
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,530
What do you...

352
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,980
want me to cooperate over?

353
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,460
As long as you sign this confession of guilt

354
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,400
to testify that Yu Huan deliberately released the Heavenly Ring's holder.

355
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,060
Do you think there's nothing I can't do to you?

356
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,140
You're not afraid of dying. Very good.

357
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,250
But I have ways to make you yield.

358
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,090
- Deliver her to Xin Zhui.
- Yes.

359
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,550
If you confess right now, your life can still be saved.

360
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,300
If you fall into the king of the prison, Xin Zhui's hands, your skin and flesh will...

361
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,390
What? Scared now?

362
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,020
You acknowledged him as your master and served him loyally.

363
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,330
But in his eyes, you're simply a weapon.

364
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,500
Whether you're alive or dead, whatever inhuman treatments you suffer,

365
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,340
he won't care about at all. He won't even bat an eye.

366
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,060
If you confess, I'll release you.

367
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,010
I'll even bestow gold and treasures on you,

368
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,790
and send you anywhere you wish to go.

369
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,490
Just identify Yu Huan as the one who released the Heavenly Ring's holder.

370
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,540
Identiy him as Cangliu's traitor.

371
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,620
Then you'll be free.

372
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,360
I... am a traitor.

373
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,520
I want you to say it's Yu Huan.

374
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,700
What kind of place is the hard labor camp? Do you really not know?

375
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,470
It's a place to punish me.

376
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:33,630
He's clearly injured, but he still has to act strong.

377
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,310
I wonder how he is right now.

378
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,220
She should be safe inside the room.

379
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,620
Young Master, you were looking for me?

380
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,660
I want to ask you something. Having Aunt Ru drug Gao Shunzhao,

381
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,120
was it your own idea or the entire Quanxian army's idea?

382
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,530
The Cangliu has used drugs to control many people in our tribe.

383
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,580
We only wanted to use their method to repay them.

384
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,220
Has Gao Shunzhao ever used this drug to control us?

385
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,430
No.

386
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,520
These are Cangliu's dirty methods. We cannot use them.

387
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,240
If we use them, how are we any different from Cangliu?

388
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,130
It's been 100 years since the Battle of Liejing.

389
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,730
Although our Quanxian army fought hard,

390
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,990
but due to the disparity in strength, we frequently suffered from Cangliu poisoning us with drugs.

391
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,560
We really couldn't help but use it as a last resort.

392
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,650
Now that Young Master has returned,

393
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,130
we won't ever be easily controlled by Cangliu again

394
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,810
and won't use those methods again.

395
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,720
I know about the suffering you've all endured.

396
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,500
Go ahead and take your leave for now.

397
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,160
Yes, Young Master.

398
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:32,030
Young Master, I still have something to say if I may dare.

399
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,030
- Speak.
- Today, Young Master...

400
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,240
Today, I took care of Kongsang's Princess Bai.

401
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,500
Perhaps some of the officers and soldiers may worry

402
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,660
that I'd repeat the same mistake from 100 years ago because of my personal feelings.

403
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,160
I've already explained the reason for letting the Kongsang people stay here.

404
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,370
As to what was right or wrong from 100 years ago,

405
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:04,770
it's useless to explain any further.

406
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,710
But we need more trust among ourselves in the Quanxian tribe.

407
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,260
Yes, Young Master.

408
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,110
Brother Crown Prince. Uncle Xi Jing.

409
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,930
Aunt Ru gave me this. You can satiate your hunger a little bit for now.

410
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,460
Look at how you gobble things up, you probably ate a lot.

411
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,300
Then, you go ahead and chat. I'll go find some herbs

412
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,990
- to treat Yan Xi.
- All right, all right.

413
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:46,240
I don't think Aunt Ru would have sent this here on her own.

414
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,930
She must have been ordered to.

415
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,870
Even though Kongsang claims to have 100,000 citizens,

416
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,520
but the only ones who can really counter Cangliu

417
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,520
are only Your Highness, the six princes, the High Priest, and I.

418
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,920
Our most urgent need right now is to unseal the Six Direction Seals

419
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,770
to restore the Power of Heaven.

420
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,260
Who sealed the Power of Heaven 100 years ago?

421
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,460
I don't know. Cangliu is controlled by the Five Masters.

422
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,300
But do the Five Masters really have the power to seal the Power of Heaven?

423
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,400
Your Highness, do you know where the seals are right now?

424
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,140
After finding the Heavenly Ring in Tianque,

425
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,350
I could sense that tje three seals were located

426
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:50,930
separately in Jiuyi Mountain, Ghost and Deity Abyss, and Jing Pagoda.

427
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,860
Jiuyi Mountain makes sense.

428
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,760
It's the location of the royal mausoleum of generations of Kongsang's kings. The force is strong there.

429
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,210
It's not easy to enter unless you're Kongsang.

430
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,450
The Ghost and Deity Abyss, however,

431
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,630
runs deep into the ocean for 64,000 che.
 (T/N: 1 che is about 1/3 of a meter)

432
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,830
That's exactly the place.

433
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,440
How do we break the seal then?

434
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,780
They say only merpeople can reach the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

435
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,750
I'm afraid we'll...

436
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,360
Need to ask for the Quanxian's help.

437
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,860
The Jing Pagoda is an important place in Cangliu.

438
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:36,110
Unsealing the seal in the Jing Pagoda won't be any easier than in the other two places.

439
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,490
I already know everything that you're saying.

440
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,620
You know it all?

441
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,500
What do we do then? We only have the few of us left. Can we unseal the seals?

442
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,880
As of right now, with my great general's help,

443
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,770
the probability of success has increased somewhat.

444
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,410
What? Is General Xi Jing...

445
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,880
scared?

446
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,890
What a joke. What's there for me to be afraid of?

447
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,510
If you dare to go, then I'll dare go with you.

448
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,540
But to go recklessly would be to die for nothing.

449
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,480
Of course, we wouldn't go recklessly.

450
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,470
As for Jiuyi Mountain, myself and the six princes can go into the mountain to fight.

451
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,000
As for the Jing Pagoda, we have some chance for success as well.

452
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,880
But the Ghost and Deity Abyss,

453
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,030
there's no chance for us to get down there.

454
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,530
Young Master, I still have something to say if I may dare.

455
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,960
Today, Young Master...

456
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,460
Today, I took care of Kongsang's Princess Bai.

457
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,850
Perhaps some of the officers and soldiers may worry

458
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,370
that I'd repeat the same mistake from 100 years ago because of my personal feelings.

459
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,120
- Did you need something?
- Are you going out?

460
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,120
The sun is too strong outside. Let's talk inside.

461
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,540
I wanted to see how you were. The sun is strong outside.

462
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,190
You shouldn't go around randomly.

463
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:40,700
I... I was coming to look for you.

464
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,070

00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,660
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

480
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,190
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

481
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,660
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

482
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,210
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

483
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:45,660
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

484
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,630
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

485
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,630
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

486
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,610
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

487
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,100
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

488
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,440
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

489
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,500
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

490
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:18,830
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
