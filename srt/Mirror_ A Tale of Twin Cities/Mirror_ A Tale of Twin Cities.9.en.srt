It's indeed Yunhuang.

168

There are so many rooms in this gambling house!

169
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,140
But that person, Brother Ice Cube, where is he?

170
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,580
Sister Bai Ying, I'm going over there to check.

171
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,110
I'll go over there then.

You're not...

180
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,590
A hundred years ago, in order to open Wuse City,

181
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,840
our six princes lost their lives at Jiuyi Mountain.

182
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,620
You probably heard about this, right?

183
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,070
Actually, we've always been in Wuse City.

184
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
No one knows about this.

185
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,050
Junior Sister,

186
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,170
I've wronged you.

187
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,700
When Master entrusted you to me that year,

188
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,660
I failed in my duty.

189
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,870
I should have realized earlier

190
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,550
that fellow harbored evil intentions.

191
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,690
Senior Brother, don't say that.

192
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,020
Everything was decreed by fate.

193
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,580
Ye City fell a hundred years ago. Sister Yun Mo, she...

194
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,630
These hundred years, you've suffered too.

195
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,970
You've followed him for a hundred years. Why not go back to Quanxian Camp

196
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,970
and take over your older sister Xiao's position?

197
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,680
Older sister? Do you have news about her?

198
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,770
She went to assassinate General Yu Huan of Cangliu,

199
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,400
but was captured by them. I fear she's already...

200
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,900
How is this possible? Older sister...

201
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,720
This indeed only undid the seal on the right hand. It's still not powerful enough.

202
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,230
Your Highness.

203
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,770
Hong Yuan, you're here at just the right time.

204
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,670
This is the sunlight protection cloak that I created with a condensed spell.

205
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,200
However, because I haven't regained my magic power,

206
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,770
so it's only effective for four hours.

207
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,630
But I think it can support you enough for a return to Wuse City.

208
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,720
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- By the way, once this gem flashes,

209
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,470
it means its effectiveness in protecting you from the sunlight is gradually weakening.

210
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,870
The faster it flashes, the magic power is weakening that much faster.

211
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,080
You must be extra careful when you use this.

212
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,490
All right.

213
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,140
Your Highness, why is there

214
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,440
a snow cherry blossom

215
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,590
on this white sunlight protection cloak?

216
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,750
I don't have one on mine.

217
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,040
It... Th-There's no difference between them.

218
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,030
The effectiveness is the same.

219
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,770
There's no difference?

220
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,840
Doesn't A'Ying like snow cherry blossoms?

221
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,510
I randomly put one on there for her. It was just at random.

222
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,820
Seems like we're able to obtain this sunlight protection cloak,

223
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,500
all thanks to A'Ying.

224
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,440
So bold. You even dare make fun of my royal self.

225
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,390
I know my mistake. Your Highness, please don't be angry.

226

A'Ying's been gone for a long time.

Their mission is different from ours.

But we must be one step ahead of him and complete our mission first.

It's so late in the evening...

There's a gambling house in this city operated by the merpeople. Let's start searching from there first.

When did he see them? Where are they now?

248
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,810
I dare not say. I fear they'll retaliate against me in the future.

and a merperson in blue clothes.

253

After I help you find Su Mo, can you leave with me?

327
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,730
Oh, okay. Then, Sister, let's go to the second level to have a look.

328
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,330
Sister Bai Ying.

329
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,780
Sister Bai Ying.

330
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,950
I think there's someone in there.

331
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,240
Let's go.

332
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,840
Who's trespassing?

333
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,860
Sorry to disturb you, Madam,

334
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,360
we're here to find someone.

335
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,940
This is a gambling house.

336
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,680
I fear the person you're looking for is likely not here.

337
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,280
You are... Aunt Ru?

338
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,010
I'm the boss here.

339
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,320
It's written on the big signboard out there.

340
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,280
Other than for gambling and drinking,

341
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,470
the rest aren't welcome here.

342
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,800
We're here to find Su Mo, that person who's cold like an ice cube.

343
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,440
I don't know the person you're looking for. Please leave.

344
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,780
Aunt Ru, a hundred years ago,

345
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,440
we once met at Xinghan Paradise. Do you still remember?

346
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,480
A hundred years ago? Who would still remember?

347
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,670
Take care. I won't see you out.

348
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,380
It's fine if you don't remember me,

349
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,230
but you should remember Su Mo. May I ask where he is?

350
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,160
Let me say it again. I don't know the person you're looking for.

351
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,110
Su Mo, I know you're here!

352
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,620
Sister Bai Ying!

353
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,370
What happened to you?

354
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,830
At the bottom of Tianque,

355
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,690
you said it was better for us not to meet again.

356
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,070
But why did you come to find me?

357
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,090
Does your crown prince...

358
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,810
know about this?

359
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,130
Yan Xi was wounded and told me to bring him here,

360
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,110
but halfway here he was rescued by Su Mo. Is he here?

361
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,700
No.

362
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,100
How is that possible? Su Mo took Yan Xi,

363
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,310
If Su Mo is here, then Yan Xi is, too!

364
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,450
Why are you lying to me?

365
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
It's Cangliu people!

366
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,440
Did you lead them here?

367
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,310
Cangliu people? Why would I lead them here?

368
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:45,280
Everything was fine, why would Cangliu bring so many soldiers over?

369
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,160
Maybe they're here to capture Yan Xi?

370
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
What's your name?

371
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,140
I'm Na Sheng.

372
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,720
Miss Na Sheng, can you help me?

373
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,220
What kind of help?

374
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,430
Help me get this pearl out of the city.

375
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,690
I... I don't want to go.

376
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,890
There are so many people outside, what if they're here for me?

377
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,770
Didn't you say they're here for Yan Xi?

378
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,230
So, Yan Xi is here!

379
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,100
Help me get this information out,

380
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,330
otherwise Yan Xi's life will be in danger!

381
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,130
Rest assured, they're not here for you.

382
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,910
You can secretly leave from the back door, no one will notice.

383
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,690
- But...
- Don't you want to see Yan Xi again?

384
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,290
Yes, of course!

385
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,760
All right.

386
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,340
Then put this pearl in the river outside the city,

387
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,160
then we'll be saved.

388
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,870
Remember, you must be quick. If Yan Xi is discovered,

389
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,660
he'll lose his life!

390
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,450
Then I'll come back after I drop the pearl in. You must let me see Yan Xi!

391
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,770
Okay.

392
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,210
Everyone, come and gather.

393
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,870
Those from this region, over there. Those from other regions,

394
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,440
over here.

395
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,040
Stop there!

396
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,970
Have you seen this person before?

397
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,830
- No, no.
- Look carefully.

398
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,770
I really haven't.

399
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,700
Surround the place.

400
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,760
Greetings, General.

401
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,280
So you're here as well.

402
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,560
Then this place...

403
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,960
isn't that simple.

404
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,780
General, since you're worried,

405
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,060
why don't you go take a look?

406
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,690
So many military officials are here at my small gambling house.

407
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,240
Excuse me for not coming out to welcome you.

408
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,790
What is this black energy?

409
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,840
What have you done?

410
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,700
Are you concerned about me?

411
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,630
Su Mo,

412
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,920
why are you acting so strange?

413
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,810
Strange? How am I being strange?

414
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,800
Su Mo, I didn't do it on purpose.

415
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,520
On Snow Mountain, you said what happened a hundred years ago was just my obsession,

416
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,480
not my true emotions.

417
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,840
But how could you know?

418
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,810
Every night, when I dream, I dream of you.

419
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:10,160
Bai Ying, for how long do you want to torment me exactly?!

420
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,320
Su Mo.

421
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,380
Remember to forget.

422
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,710
Su Mo, what's wrong with you?

423
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,970
Hurry and leave!

424
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,890
General, we didn't find anyone suspicious.

425
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,510
I heard that your gambling house's business is doing really well.

426
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,270
I'm just making a living, that's all.

427
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,590
If you two generals would like to play a few rounds,

428
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,980
- I'll have someone attend to you immediately.
- No need.

429
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,250
I'm under orders to capture a criminal.

430
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,530
Just cooperate.

431
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:29,090
I wonder... who the general is trying to capture.

432
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,670
Someone said that a girl from the Central Plains came here.

433
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,600
Taoyuan Province is at the foot of Tianque Mountain.

434
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,920
My wines here are renowned as well.

435
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,180
There are indeed many caravans from the Central Plains

436
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,890
who come here to drink and gamble at the same time.

437
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,810
This Central Plains person came with a merperson.

438
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,010
She's also wearing a ring on her hand.

439
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,710
The caravans from Central Plains who patronized this place are all wealthy.

440
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,680
Everyone wears a ring.

441
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,250
If that's all you have to say, then I really don't know.

442
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,120
How about you sit down for a drink?

443
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,910
I'll send someone to inquire about it?

444
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,230
There may be many rings out there,

445
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,500
but faces are different. Right?

446
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,490
Take a careful look at these two faces.

447
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,520
Have you seen them before?

448
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,570
General, I indeed

449
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,750
haven't met these two before.

450
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,720
There are many people who enter and leave this small gambling house of mine.

451
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,210
However, these two...

452
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,030
Harboring criminals

453
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,720
is punishable by death.

454
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,450
General! Take a look at my gambling house, who could I possibly hide?

455
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,200
You truly know how to make jokes.

456
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,310
- I don't like smiling as much as you do.
- Why waste so much time talking?

457
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,060
If they're here, we'll know as soon as we do a search.

458
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,720
When was it your turn to give commands?

459
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,080
- I just want to remind you General—
- No need.

460
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,580
Just guard the first floor. As for the rest of the people,

461
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,180
- have them leave immediately.
- Yes, General Yu Huan.

462
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,680
If you don't believe me,

463
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,920
then feel free to search.

464
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,120
Such confidence.

465
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,880
There were no sounds of footsteps just now,

466
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,820
but you appeared at the staircase.

467
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,210
You probably have many hidden rooms and tunnels here,

468
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,380
I wonder how many I can find.

469
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,100
Su Mo.

470
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,160
Why haven't you left yet?!

471
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,290
You're the one who asked me to forget.

472
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,240
But I think of you all the time!

473
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,540
I transformed for you.

474
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,340
Do you know?

475
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,800
In this lifetime, I cannot possibly love another person.

476
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,820
Yet what about you?

477
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,310
In merely a hundred years, you've forgotten about me.

478
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,780
How did you do it?

479
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,510
Forgotten just like that?

480
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,000
♫ I bid farewell, not to go far away ♫

481
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,430
Didn't you survive?

482
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,700
Why didn't you come to find me?

483
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,820
Su Mo, let go of me.

484
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,920
I won't let go! Why should I?

485
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,780
If I let you go, you'll leave me.

486
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,640
If I let go,

487
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,000
you'll leave me to be all alone.

488
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,650
Do you know?

489
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,250
The moment you jumped off the pagoda,

490
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,630
I wholeheartedly wanted to jump off with you.

491
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,500
Bai Ying...

492
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,310
what must I do

493
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,890
to have your heart?

494
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:41,000
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

495
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
Let go.

496
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,710
I won't.

497
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,560
- Let go!
- I won't!

498
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:55,090
♫ I quietly listen to the story starting at the beginning ♫

499
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:01,990
♫ Why must deep love be greedy and long for such words? ♫

500
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:08,590
♫ Unforgettable longing is like wind and the snow is like cherry blossoms ♫

501
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:15,100
♫ It seems that your footsteps are light ♫

502
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,430
♫ In my dream is you ♫

503
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,500
♫ Awake from my dreams, I wait for you ♫

504
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,940
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

505
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,920
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

506
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,480
Su Mo, what sort of spell are you training in?

507
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,280
Why does it have such strong resonance?

508
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:53,040
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

509
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,490
This is your room.

510
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,560
I want to see exactly how many hidden rooms and passages

511
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
you have here.

512
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,440
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

513
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,840
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

514
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,380
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

515
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:30,240
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

516
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,770
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

517
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,230
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

518
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:44,130
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

519
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:47,640
♫ We've met several times ♫

520
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,080
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

521
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:58,120
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

522
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,710
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

523
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,110
♫ You live in there ♫

524
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:11,280
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

525
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,130
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

526
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,040
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

527
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,050
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

528
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,600
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

529
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,940
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

530
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,480
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

531
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,970
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

532
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,910
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

533
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,940
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

534
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,920
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

535
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,420
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

536
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,820
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

537
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,820
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

538
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:11,340
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
