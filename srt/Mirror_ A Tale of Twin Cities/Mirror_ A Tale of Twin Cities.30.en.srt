00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,300
Aren't you imprisoning me? Why did you remove the Lapis Lazuli rope?

4
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,210
It's what Lord Zhi Zhe wanted.

5
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,510
Who exactly is this Lord Zhi Zhe that you speak of?

6
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,250
What does he want with me?

7
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,580
Enter and you will know.

8
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,820
Yu Huan brought me back with such huge fanfare.

9
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,420
The news must have spread all over Yunhuang already.

10
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,560
I wonder if His Highness made it back safely.

11
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,210
Plus there's Su Mo, I must think of a way to get out.

12
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,030
This Water Mirror connects to Wuse City. It's been opened.

13
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,250
But isn't the High Priest the only one who can open it?

14
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,220
Who exactly is it that lives here?

15
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,720
Yu Zhu.

16
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,280
Master Peng.

17
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Zhi Zhe brought Kongsang's Princess Bai to the top of the pagoda.

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,020
What does he want?

19
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,320
I don't know.

20
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,730
Previously, it was the Crown Prince of Kongsang. It should be Princess Bai of Kongsang who should be imprisoned

21
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,630
but was instead sent to Mirror Pagoda instead. Could it be...

22
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,750
I dare not speculate what's on Lord Zhi Zhe's mind.

23
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,020
You and your younger brother

24
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,010
now are beginning to...

25
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,600
hide more things from me.

26
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,260
I don't have this intention. I really don't know anything.

27
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,890
Lord Zhi Zhe only instructed me to bring her here to Heavenly Temple.

28
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,150
As for the rest... I have no idea.

29
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,360
A disobedient wolf cub...

30
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,120
should be eliminated.

31
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,730
Lord Zhi Zhe actually wanted Yu Zhu to take

32
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,010
Princess Bai of Kongsang to the pagoda.

33
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,410
Speaking of this, Lord Zhi Zhe has been behaving strangely lately.

34
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,400
It has been a long time since he gave us instructions.

35
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,660
I wonder if he relays all instructions

36
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,590
to Yu Huan directly through Yu Zhu.

37
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,100
A'Wei,

38
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,290
it has been 7,000 years.

39
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,190
You...

40
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,010
Can you still recognize me?

41
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,130
Are you Zhi Zhe?

42
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,830
For a moment, I thought you were her.

43
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,420
You imprisoned me here. What are you trying to do?

44
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,120
I saw you flying down the pagoda

45
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,730
and also, jump up onto the city building and shout "Heaven bless Kongsang."

46
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,090
I want to see...

47
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,000
see if you are just like her.

48
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,980
Becoming more and more presumptuous.

49
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,480
You are not afraid of the sun.

50
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,340
Logically speaking, the six princes of Wuse City should be afraid of the sun

51
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,320
and live forever in endless darkness.

52
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,950
Since you know I'm afraid of the sun, you even made me come here in broad daylight.

53
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,050
If you want me to die, it doesn't have to be this troublesome, just kill me now.

54
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,780
How could I bear to let you die?

55
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,160
The Emperor of the Sea gave you the Sun Protection Pearl.

56
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,390
How did you know?

57
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,670
It was him again.

58
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,230
But he's also the only one

59
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,660
who can use the Splitting Technique

60
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,520
to strip off part of his spiritual knowledge

61
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,280
and inject it into this pearl.

62
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,380
In this way, it can absorb the sunlight around the body of the wearer.

63
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,730
From the day you wore this pearl, the burns from the sun

64
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,100
have transformed the spiritual knowledge into this pearl.

65
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,510
Su Mo, where did you obtain this Sun Protection Pearl from?

66
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,170
I traded this for something.

67
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,680
What was it?

68
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,590
Is it valuable? If so, it's better to return it.

69
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,950
Nothing is more important than for you to see the sun again.

70
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,530
This Sun Protection Pearl was actually obtained by Su Mo like this.

71
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,210
Master Si, please save Young Master.

72
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,050
Leave now. I'll treat the Emperor of the Sea's injuries.

73
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,140
Bai Ying.

74
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,360
Bai Ying.

75
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,460
You are that Zhi Zhe.

76
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,620
Why do you look for Bai Ying?

77
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,290
Why do you look like Zhen Lan?

78
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,200
He used half of his life for you

79
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
to be able to walk in the sun.

80
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,300
Bai Ying, I can protect you.

81
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,550
Will you come with me?

82
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you thinking?

83
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why are you so sad?

84
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The Emperor of the Sea knows only this trick.

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,700
It's just a game of creating this pearl which will bewitch a person's heart.

86
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,600
There's a spell in this pearl.

87
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Tell him, and have him save you.

88
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,000
When he previously trespassed into Mirror Pagoda, I repaired it.

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,200
See if he dares to come back here again.

90
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
He won't come here to save me.

91
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,300
Really?

92
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
You are going against Kongsang.

93
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Quanxian has nothing to do with Heaven and Earth.

94
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Who says so?

95
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,000
From the beginning till the end, it has been related to the Emperor of the Sea.

96
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Only by capturing you,

97
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
whether it's Emperor of the Sea or Crown Prince of Kongsang,

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
one of them will come here.

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Bai Ying.

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,400
This is great. Young Master, you are awake.

101
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,400
Master Si, what's wrong with me?

102
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,800
A part of your spiritual knowledge resonated with another power.

103
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,600
It's very weird. I can't go near it either.

104
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Emperor of the Sea, why are you so gravely injured?

105
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,000
[I'm willing]

106
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,500
At the time, I only remember being at Flower Deity Tree.

107
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,200
But, Young Master, how did you fall into Mirror Lake alone?

108
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
What happened at Jiuyi Mountain?

109
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Did you obtain the Heaven-Defying Sword?

110
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes, I did.

111
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,800
Is our next step to help Kongsang settle the Ghost and Deity Abyss Seal?

112
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Let's suspend this. Since we have the Splitting Sword,

113
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,300
I want to settle the Dragon Deity Seal first.

114
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,800
By the way, how's the situation at Kongsang?

115
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,500
There's no news.

116
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,700
Is Yan Xi back?

117
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,500
I transmitted a message to Jiuyi Mountain to tell him to come back as soon as possible.

118
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,000
Did you find anything when you asked about this?

119
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,600
I was about to report this to you.

120
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,900
- Fine. Let's go to the assembly room.
- Yes.

121
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,800
Emperor of the Sea, you haven't recovered from your injuries. You need to rest.

122
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no time.

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,400
Was it a dream just now?

124
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
High Priest.

125
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,000
High Priest, wake up now. Open the Water Mirror now.

126
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
- What's wrong?
- Hurry up.

127
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Your Highness, why are you so anxious?

128
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,300
Bai Ying is missing. Bai Ying has been captured.

129
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,800
My old back.

130
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,400
What did you say? What's wrong with A'Ying?

131
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Open the Water Mirror now.

132
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
Mirror Pagoda.

133
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Why did A'Ying go there?

134
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,600
There's a barrier at Mirror Pagoda. The Water Mirror can't probe inside it.

135
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,000
How did someone enter it?

136
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,200
It's that person dressed in black. What is his purpose?

137
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,800
Why has he repeatedly called us to Mirror Pagoda?

138
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,600
Your Highness, Heaven is not at our disposal now.

139
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Why not rescue her together with the Emperor of the Sea?

140
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,700
I will have Xi Jing go there with me.

141
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,600
I unlocked two seals and regained half of my power.

142
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Even more so, Su Mo went back to the camp.

143
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm also not sure if he will help us with the battle.

144
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
What's wrong?

145
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,700
We already know about the annihilation of the six princes.

146
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,300
Your Highness, please forgive me. I didn't intend to hide this from you.

147
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,600
Enough.

148
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,380
Regarding this, I will settle the score with you later.

149
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,200
The priority now is to rescue A'Ying.

150
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,900
Hence, we can only rely on ourselves for now.

151
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Young Master, based on your instructions, we checked the details of Cangliu.

152
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,800
Seven thousand years ago, Cangliu was defeated in the battle in Yunhuang

153
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,200
and was expelled from Yunhuang by King Xingzun. About a century ago,

154
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,790
Cangliu apparently received a revelation

155
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,000
and suddenly created a magical weapon.

156
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A group of wanderers was trained to be powerful warriors.

157
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,500
They frequently intruded into surrounding areas and eventually annexed them.

158
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,100
Did you find out who they got the revelation from?

159
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,200
Cangliu thought it was the strength and power of the five masters.

160
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,000
But the strange thing is that their five masters' appearances have not aged since that time.

161
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Just like Qing Chen.

162
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,200
And Qing Chen's medicine was given by that Zhi Zhe.

163
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Cangliu and Kongsang people only have a lifespan of 100 years.

164
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How can they live for a long time without aging?

165
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,800
Could it be there are people in Yunhuang who lived longer than our Quanxian?

166
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,400
What about the Mirror and Splitting Techniques?

167
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,400
The place of origin is not Cangliu. There are no more records in Cangliu.

168
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
A second person hasn't appeared in a hundred years

169
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
who knows these Mirror and Splitting Techniques.

170
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,000
I found this in the Wuse City library.

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,100
I learned the Mirror Technique outside of Yunhuang.

172
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,000
Why would the library in Kongsang have a record of this?

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,300
The library in Kongsang was specifically for the Heavenly King's use.

174
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,200
It was gradually opened to the royal family later.

175
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,600
If this is the case, the person who gave me power in the valley

176
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,500
could it be that person in the Mirror Pagoda?

177
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,000
As the Emperor of the Sea,

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,200
he's indeed more powerful than that person seven thousand years ago.

179
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,700
However, his cultivation is too shallow.

180
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,600
That Sun Protection Pearl can only protect you momentarily.

181
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,700
I can make one stronger than his and make you never fear the sun.

182
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,700
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

183
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,200
- Young Master.
- What's going on?

184
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I believe he can't use his power properly

185
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,200
and often suffers from backlash.

186
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,500
Just like me, he has attained perfection too.

187
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,400
It's him again.

188
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,200
Only then can you really use it for your own use and dominate the world.

189
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
That image just now was real.

190
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Am I inside the Sun Protection Pearl?

191
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Su Mo?

192
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,300
What did you say?

193
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,800
Only Bai Ying can hear my voice. Zhi Zhe can't.

194
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,200
Bai Ying,

195
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,220
if you can hear my voice,

196
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,400
don't react and don't answer.

197
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,100
He really resembles Zhen Lan. In the past, Zhen Lan suspected he was from Kongsang.

198
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,700
Seems like they are both related.

199
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,000
Ask him what he did to the Sun Protection Pearl and why he told me to come here.

200
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
What did you do to this Sun Protection Pearl before?

201
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,900
It won't be interesting if I tell you.

202
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,000
Ask him how he mastered the Mirror Splitting Technique.

203
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,100
Su Mo created this Sun Protection Pearl for me.

204
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,300
The people of Kongsang never had this technique before. How did you know this?

205
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Why would I not know?

206
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,790
But he's really foolish. He distinctly only cultivated just this little bit,

207
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,000
and even used it here.

208
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Right.

209
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,000
He used this on me who's going to turn to ashes.

210
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He's really foolish.

211
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,220
Hence, I will use all efforts to protect him.

212
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,500
Then I want to see...

213
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
if you can get out alive.

214
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
I can tell you.

215
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
When you went to Jiuyi Mountain, I took advantage of it.

216
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,400
The five masters and I created an even bigger barrier.

217
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Whether it's the Emperor of the Sea or Crown Prince of Kongsang,

218
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,210
they are just like moths attracted to the flame.

219
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,200
When that time comes, I will kill them in one fell swoop.

220
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Bai Ying, regarding the Sun Protection Pearl,

221
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,800
I will explain it to you later. Let's think of a way to get out first.

222
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Master Si, what's wrong with Young Master? Why is he in a coma again?

223
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,700
There are multiple powers in the Emperor of the Sea

224
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,200
that are entangling and colliding with each other.

225
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,600
These vicious and evil energies are putting him into a deep sleep.

226
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,200
Master Si, please save Young Master.

227
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,500
I will go all out and do my best.

228
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Xi Jing, what are you looking at?

229
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,400
Your Highness, don't you find it strange?

230
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
What's so strange?

231
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
There are no guards at all.

232
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,000
Isn't this good? Hurry up.

233
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,700
Where should we enter from?

234
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,730
Bai Ying, I can't get out now

235
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,340
and don't know why I'm in the Sun Protection Pearl, either.

236
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,050
Try to talk to him and see if you can get any information.

237
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:04,930
Who will come to find death first?

238
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:12,540
The Emperor of the Sea or Crown Prince of Kongsang?

239
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,140
Who do you wish will come first?

240
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,520
I don't wish for either of them to come.

241
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,360
Your wish is to die.

242
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,640
Don't worry.

243
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't need to do it,

244
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,020
and your ending will be the same.

245
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:55,230
This is how many things are in life.

246
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:02,480
You will never get what you wish for your whole life.

247
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,850
Things end up contrary to your wish.

248
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,980
If I can't get it, I won't force it.

249
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,400
To me, I have no regrets in this life.

250
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,320
No regrets.

251
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:28,390
Are people's desires so simple?

252
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,710
Strength, possession,

253
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,890
desires, jealousy, obsession,

254
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,770
and also... fear.

255
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,250
Can you really conquer them?

256
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,440
Bai Ying, don't let him probe you.

257
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,940
Try to shift the topic to him.

258
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,460
Everyone...

259
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,270
cannot conquer it,

260
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:17,240
so more people are harmed.

261
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,440
Is the person that you are talking about A'Wei?

262
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,490
A'Wei?

263
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,600
Y-Yes.

264
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,840
I am the one who harmed her.

265
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:43,160
She was the youngest daughter from a family of ship lords.

266
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,370
I was the astrologer they hired.

267
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:54,390
She and I only separated twice.

268
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,210
Twice?

269
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,650
The first time, she traveled far by sea

270
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,480
and encountered stormy waves. I searched all over Yunhuang

271
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,700
and found her in the Biluo Sea.

272
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,680
The second time...

273
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,410
was her death.

274
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,350
Biluo Sea?

275
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,090
The exit from the Biluo Sea was already sealed by Kongsang 7,000 years ago.

276
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,300
How could he have found A'Wei there?

277
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,340
Cangliu and Kongsang people only have a lifespan of 100 years.

278
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,500
How can they live for a long time without aging?

279
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,470
Bai Ying, ask him how long he's lived.

280
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,170
How long have you lived in this world?

281
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,850
Seven thousand years!

282
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,740
Time is already useless to me.

283
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,440
Someone who resembles Zhen Lan but has lived 7,000 years.

284
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,700
You've said before that the world is lonely,

285
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,160
and you wouldn't leave me here by myself.

286
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,570
But now, you've left me

287
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,810
with mountains and rivers silenced forever.

288
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,180
Mountains and rivers silenced forever?

289
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,290
Wasn't this written by the Heavenly King?

290
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:33,410
The sun rises and sets. To me, everything in this world

291
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:39,990
has already been transformed into dust.

292
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,590
You left me to be alone and hopeless.

293
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,440
I can only...

294
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,860
I can only look at...

295
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,240
your portrait.

296
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,690
Was this ripped from that book?

297
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,570
You are still exactly the same as back then.

298
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,410
You haven't changed.

299
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,280
Turning into ashes...

300
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,210
how good that would be.

301
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,810
To be able to die instantly

302
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:50,280
can be so enviable.

303
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,600
Back then, if I could have died along with you,

304
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,830
I wouldn't have had to now face...

305
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,350
the pain of not getting

306
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,040
what I wish for.

307
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,890
Bai Ying, don't be tempted by him.

308
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,470
Bai Ying, listen to me.

309
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,950
I went to the Flower Deity Tree and saw the wood plate you left there.

310
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,100
I know your innermost thought. You want to live more than anyone else.

311
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,410
You want to go back to the Biluo Sea with me.

312
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,590
Bai Ying, once Kongsang sees the sun again and

313
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,070
Quanxian returns to the Biluo Sea,

314
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,000
while everyone is overjoyed, I will not let you turn into ashes.

315
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,160
I don't believe that fate will be so cruel to me.

316
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,850
Bai Ying, believe me. I can change all of this.

317
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,100
One cannot change fate.

318
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,310
Furthermore, one cannot avoid fate.

319
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,370
Emperor of the Sea? You are always meddling!

320
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,920
It's right here.

321
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,470
Wait.

322
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,160
What is it now?

323
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,160
No wonder there are no guards. What should we do?

324
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,800
Another one has come.

325
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,380
He comes...

326
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,710
at the right time!

327
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,440
What exactly is this?

328
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,000
This power is so difficult to control.

329
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:23,430
This is the Splitting Technique.

330
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,970
Su Mo, hurry and run!

331
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,830
Young Master, you're awake?

332
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,030
Emperor of the Sea, I have already gotten rid of the extremely dark spirit inside your body.

333
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,020
In this entire universe, among the seven seas,

334
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,660
this evil spirit has never appeared in Heaven or on Earth.

335
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,730
I still need to obtain the dragon deity's power as soon as possible.

336
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,800
Ning Liang, take good care of Master Si.

337
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,330
Young Master, where are you going?

338
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,860
Mirror Pagoda.

339
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,640
You've trapped me here but won't kill me.

340
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,260
What are you planning to do?

341
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,970
Keep you here, so that I can see her.

342
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,130
A'Wei, it's been 7,000 years,

343
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,320
do you still recognize me?

344
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,120
I want to see if you are the same as her.

345
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,280
You still look the same

346
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,680
as you were originally.

347
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,410
Seven thousand years?

348
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,410
A'Wei?

349
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,830
Could he be Heavenly King?

350
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,920
A'Lang, I've been waiting for you.

351
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,260
Take me back.

352
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,680
I've been waiting here for you to rescue me.

353
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,910
My heart has always

354
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,160
belonged to you.

355
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,760
A... A'Wei.

356
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,270
She is not Bai Wei. Don't let her cheat you.

357
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,930
She is. She is waiting for me to rescue her.

358
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,850
If it weren't for the barrier, she would have sneaked away already.

359
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,070
She wouldn't have.

360
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,770
I waited 7,000 years for her.

361
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,690
A'Wei!

362
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,210
- Su Mo.
- Take me back to the main camp.

363
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,540
Su Mo. Su Mo.

364
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,040
Master Si.

365
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,520
Why is he hot all over?

366
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,500
Ning Liang, go ahead and leave.

367
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,040
Su Mo.

368
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,820
There are many forces inside his body.

369
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,670
Even though I got rid of the evil spirit,

370
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,750
but he went to the Mirror Pagoda before he was fully recovered.

371
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,480
Now he has even less power

372
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,050
and cannot suppress the backlash activated by the Splitting Technique.

373
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,930
- This is why he is unconscious
- Does he have insufficient force because

374
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,450
he infused half of his spirit sense into the Sunlight Blocking Pearl?

375
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,060
Is he unconscious because of the backlash?

376
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,040
Yes.

377
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:10,530
♫ I pray not for a fated moment ♫

378
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:17,550
♫ But to be able to meet you again ♫

379
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:23,550
♫ I smile not for joy ♫

380
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:31,840
♫ But to be brave enough to hold back tears ♫

381
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:43,330
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

382
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:50,030
♫ Yet you tell me to forget the memories ♫

383
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:56,660
♫ I quietly listen to the story starting at the beginning ♫

384
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:03,460
♫ Why must deep love be greedy and long for such words? ♫

385
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:10,150
♫ Unforgettable longing is like wind and the snow is like cherry blossoms ♫

386
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:16,700
♫ It seems that your footsteps are light ♫

387
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,210
♫ In my dream is you ♫

388
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,980
♫ Awake from my dreams, I wait for you ♫

389
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:29,160
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

390
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,430
[I am willing]

391
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,420
Su Mo.

392
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,080
You've been sleeping for a long time.

393
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,510
Do you know?

394
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,870
You are the most foolish person in the world.

395
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,760
You've done so much for me,

396
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,960
but you've never told me.

397
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,640
When will you wake up?

398
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,310
I have so much...

399
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,410
to tell you.

400
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,240
But I haven't had the chance.

401
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,660
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

402
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,770
- Are you awake?
- I was woken by your noise.

403
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,410
How do you feel now? Better?

404
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,280
I'm fine.

405
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,500
♫ We've met several times ♫

406
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,670
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

407
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,680
I'll be fine after resting for a few days.

408
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,180
You're lying. You infused half of your spirit sense

409
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,820
into the Sunlight Blocking Pearl. Isn't that right?

410
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,050
You've done so much for me,

411
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,800
but you've never told me.

412
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I've always thought about doing something for you,

413
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,320
but I never did anything.

414
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,040
I can't even...

415
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,470
stay by your side.

416
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
Bai Ying.

417
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,090
You don't need to do anything.

418
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,420
I'm sorry.

419
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,800
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

420
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,400
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

421
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,100
Bai Ying.

422
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,310
Don't say sorry anymore, all right?

423
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,530
No matter what happens in the future,

424
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,410
I won't ever let you disappear again.

425
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,790
I will always stay with you.

426
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,090
Will you believe me?

427
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:09,830
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫

428
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,980
You two are here.

429
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,820
Brother Crown Prince fainted.

430
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,160
How did His Highness turn out this way?

431
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,120
A'Ying was sent to the Mirror Pagoda by Yu Huan.

432
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,440
His Highness and I wanted to barge into the palace to save her.

433
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,640
But when His Highness attempted to use the Power of Heaven to break through the barrier,

434
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,870
an extremely powerful force suddenly flew out of the barrier and attacked His Highness.

435
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,560
- What kind of force is it?
- I have never seen it before.

436
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,840
Don't be anxious.

437
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,680
The High Priest says that if we can unseal another seal to strengthen the power of the king,

438
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,350
perhaps His Highness will recover.

439
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,020
I-I can. I can.

440
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,390
I have the Dispel Water Pearl, and I can undo the seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

441
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,320
- Can you go down by yourself?
- I'll go with Na Sheng.

442
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,540
Do you know what dangers you'll be facing?

443
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,560
I know. I've memorized them.

444
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,080
I also know the techniques to go underwater and be invisible.

445
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,120
Brother Crown Prince taught them to me.

446
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,880
I cannot let him die like this.

447
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,240
Before, whenever I was scared, all of you stayed with me and protected me.

448
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,710
Now, I will be the one to protect you.

449
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,590
Good.

450
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,440
After you undo the seal of Stranded Dragon Abyss,

451
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,370
there will only be the one left in the Mirror Pagoda.

452
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,650
Is there another solution about turning into ashes?

453
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,880
You... all know about it?

454
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,840
We already made the decision 100 years ago.

455
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,090
Please don't hesitate anymore. Hurry and save the people.

456
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,060
All right.

457
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,090
I believe His Highness would make the same choice.

458
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,110
I will escort them to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

459
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,800
- All right.
- All right.

460
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,970
Princess Chi. Prince Lan. Immediately take His Highness back to Wuse City.

461
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,910
Ask High Priest to review the ancient books.

462
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,170
If this method doesn't work, we must still find another way.

463
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:49,590
I heard that Princess Bai of Kongsang escaped right from under Lord Zhi Zhe.

464
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,990
And there is no order to capture her.

465
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,990
It was difficult to catch her,

466
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,410
how can she be released?

467
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,500
Have you received any orders

468
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,310
from Lord Zhi Zhe lately?

469
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,250
No.

470
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,380
Is it possible that Yu Zhu has concealed

471
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,480
or falsified orders from Lord Zhi Zhe?

472
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,060
I don't think she would dare.

473
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
She wouldn't dare.

474
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,050
But she might for her ambitious brother's sake.

475
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,040
This time, Yu Huan has come back alive from Jiuyi.

476
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,230
She's even achieved high merits.

477
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,880
Reporting.

478
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,690
My Lord, General Nan Zhao has sent a message.

479
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,000
Lord Master Peng, Fei Lian colluded with Quanxian.

480
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,860
He is being sent to the capital under escort.

481
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,050
It looks like I'm going to take this opportunity

482
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,900
to take back what was originally mine.

483
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,560
The Ghost and Deity Abyss is down there?

484
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,200
[Ghost and Deity Abyss]

485
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,920
Na Sheng, you've trained a long time.

486
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,040
Don't be scared, and don't rush.

487
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,980
Beware of what you see in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

488
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,270
I will protect her.

489
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,250
I, Na Sheng, will definitely do my absolute best.

00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:03,360
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

491
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,800
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

492
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,400
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

493
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,140
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

494
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,640
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

495
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,150
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

496
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:31,160
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

497
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,660
♫ We've met several times ♫

498
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,060
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

499
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:45,030
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

500
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,560
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

501
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,060
♫ You live in there ♫

502
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:58,120
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

503
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,040
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

504
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,080
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

505
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,980
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

506
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,560
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

507
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,910
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

508
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,400
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

509
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,880
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

510
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,880
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

511
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,950
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

512
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,840
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

513
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,340
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

514
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,780
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

515
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:48,840
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

516
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:59,330
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
