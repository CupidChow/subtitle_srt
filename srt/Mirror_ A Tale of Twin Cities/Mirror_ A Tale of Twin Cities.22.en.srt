[Episode 22]

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,700
Look over there. There should be cassava.

4
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,400
Go dig up some cassava.

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I only want to eat meat.

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,700
- What are you muttering about?
- Nothing.

7
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,600
I was just saying, in this wild place there isn't even a tea stall to rest at.

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,200
At the tea stalls in the Central Plains, there would be food and drinks.

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Even if there was a tea stall, we don't have any money.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,200
You really are too poor of a crown prince, aren't you?

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
I...

12
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,400
- Oh, right! We have Yan Xi.
- Hey!

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,000
You're not thinking of selling Yan Xi for money, are you?

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, no. Yan Xi's tears can turn into pearls. We can sell them for money.

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
We warriors of Quanxian would rather shed blood than tears.

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Really?

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Yes.

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Unless we suffer a great pain.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
We don't otherwise randomly cry.

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Look at how pitiful Na Sheng looks when she's starving.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Why don't you suffer just a bit?

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,500
Forget it. I'll look for something to eat on my own.

23
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,100
Come with me then.

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,500
I...

25
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,000
- I'll go get some firewood.
- Hey!

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,190
I'll dig by myself then.

27
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,690
This girl really does love to eat.

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,500
Your Highness, you must be hungry.

29
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,200
I'll go catch a pheasant.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,300
Sure. Thank you, General.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,200
Did you think I liked you?

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I wouldn't have torn apart our marriage agreement back then.

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,800
Such a big cassava.

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,700
Why is it so hard to dig out?

35
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,200
Even a stupid cassava is hard to dig out.

36
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,330
Loosen the soil. Loosen the soil.

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
Cangliu's new weapon!

38
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Na Sheng.

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Na Sheng! Na Sheng!

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Na Sheng, wake up!

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,860
Na Sheng!

42
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,000
Na Sheng!

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Na Sheng!

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
- Why did it explode?
- Na Sheng.

45
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Sorry, I shouldn't have let you dig cassavas out alone.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
Can you wake up?

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,300
Na Sheng. Na Sheng!

48
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Yan Xi, let me take a look.

49
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
How is she?

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,000
She's doomed. We can't save her.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,500
Yan Xi, let's dig a hole and bury her.

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,800
- Were you about to cry?
- You were pretending to be dead?

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Not totally.

54
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,000
- I got–
- You're still lying!

55
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,180
What happened exactly?

56
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,100
I found it hard to dig out the cassava,

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,800
so I wanted to use magic to blow it loose a bit.

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,300
But I didn't expect to pass out.

59
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,400
Since Yan Xi was so worried about me,

60
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,800
I didn't know if I should wake up sooner or later.

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Sooner, of course! How could you joke about your life?

62
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,130
Look at you.

63
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Go.

64
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,900
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

65
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,290
You've already grown up so much.

66
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Back then your mother Yu Ji, Madam Ru Yi, and I

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
were as close as sisters.

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,900
Later on,

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Yu Ji lost touch with you due to the war.

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
She got depressed and passed away.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Fortunately, Madam Ru Yi found you.

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Who would've thought, in the blink of an eye, so many years have passed.

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
Madam, you're my elder.

74
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you for taking care of my mother back in the day.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Young Master, please don't do that.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,500
Young Master. Young Master, please don't do that.

77
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
I just got emotional for a moment.

78
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,500
Back then you were just a baby swaddled in cloth,

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,200
but now you've become the powerful Emperor of the Sea.

80
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
It's just a shame that Su Nuo...

81
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
I did a terrible job back then. I didn't take care of her.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Let's not mention it anymore. It's nothing but sadness.

83
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,650
I believe your mother's spirit in Heaven has nothing to worry about anymore.

84
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,800
The future is hopeful.

85
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,530
Young Master. Princess Bai Ying.

86
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Cheers.

87
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,280
Cheers, Madam.

88
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
If you keep drinking, you'll get drunk. This wine is strong.

89
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm fine. This wine isn't strong.

90
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,750
What a great kid.

91
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,000
Am I right, Young Master?

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
Yan Xi. Yan Xi, can you not be mad at me?

93
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
How could I not be mad?

94
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
I just wanted to see if you'd be worried about me.

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Of course, I was worried about you!

96
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,100
Really?

97
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Are you telling the truth?

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,100
The mission the Young Master gave me was to protect you.

99
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,000
If anything were to happen to you, how could I explain it to Young Master?

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That aside, if Brother Ice Cube hadn't told you to protect me,

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,700
- would you have been worried about me?
- I...

102
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,600
So can you joke about your life?

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,100
Is it because your life in the Central Plains was so comfortable that you don't care about your life?

104
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,600
No, I...

105
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,800
I just wanted to see if you were worried about me.

106
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,300
Of course, I was worried!

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,000
They're back here again. They haven't even gotten out and I'm already done roasting my chicken.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,400
These two silly kids. Na Sheng just wants to know if Yan Xi likes her.

109
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,200
If Yan Xi didn't like her, he wouldn't have been mad this long.

110
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,400
Yan Xi is unbelievable. Na Sheng follows him all day long, makes him laugh,

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,400
and acts silly with him all the time. If she doesn't like him, I don't know what this is.

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,800
They can't even tell.

113
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Why are you looking at me?

114
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,800
You're good at talking about others.

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
Stop fighting. Come over and eat chicken.

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,700
- I'm not eating.
- I'm not eating.

117
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,700
We're going to the left peak of Jiuyi Mountain tomorrow.

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,500
- I'm not going.
- I'm not going.

119
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,000
All right. You and I can eat.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Yan Xi. Yan Xi. Yan Xi.

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,500
Keep me company.

122
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,800
Actually, I envy them sometimes.

123
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
What do you envy?

124
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,600
It's difficult indeed...

125
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,900
to confess your love.

126
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,590
You're here.

127
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,000
I've been behind you this whole time.

128
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Why did you come here alone?

129
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,100
I...

130
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,300
This.

131
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,760
Bai Ying, do you know that you're already drunk?

132
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,400
I know I'm drunk,

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,400
but I've never been drunk before.

134
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't ever get drunk!

135
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,400
A hundred years ago, you only got drunk once.

136
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,470
What are you saying?

137
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,430
You can't hold my hand.

138
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,790
Why?

139
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:18,050
Because... Su Mo would be unhappy.

140
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,820
He's often unhappy,

141
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,700
but he never tells me.

142
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,260
You're not allowed to hold my hand.

143
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,120
So you know everything.

144
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,460
So... who can hold your hand?

145
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,970
Su Mo.

146
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,920
Who am I then?

147
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,760
You... are as good-looking as Su Mo.

148
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,910
Do you know, if you do this, Su Mo will be angry, too?

149
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,990
But this is a trivial matter.

150
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,750
Trivial matter?

151
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,570
Are there bigger things that will make Su Mo angry?

152
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,340
I'm not telling.

153
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,290
It looks like you really are hiding something from him.

154
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm not hiding anything from him.

155
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,830
I just want...

156
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,970
♫ Using up all my fortune just to touch you ♫

157
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,820
♫ Even crying sounds so beautiful ♫

158
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,220
♫ Listening to the soft whisper of the rain from that day ♫

159
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,250
♫ That is the sound of my heart, so please listen ♫

160
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,530
Bai Ying.

161
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,420
I'm sleepy.

162
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,440
Su Mo.

163
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,630
If...

164
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,390

Young Master. Young Master.

Why don't you rest a little longer? After Princess Bai Ying wakes up,

182
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,130
- you can then go to Jiuyi Mountain.
- No need.

183
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,700
We've already been delayed too long.

184
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,280
There's still a long distance before reaching Jiuyi Mountain.

185
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,460
By the time we reach Jiuyi Mountain, she should be awake.

This is the recipe for the Drunken Essence of Lilac Daphne.

When the princess is awake,

please give it to her.

189

If the princess doesn't understand something,

190
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,400
she can use the Sound Pearl to ask me anytime.

Madam, you're so thoughtful.

192

I really like Princess Bai Ying.

193
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,140
Even though the situation in Yunhuang is in dire straits,

194
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,660
I still wish that she could relax occasionally.

195
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,610
She's thoughtful in handling things, dignified, and prudent,

It looks like she's really suffering.

198
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,980
If Bai Ying were to know how much you care about her,

199
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,550
she'd definitely be pleased.

That's good then. That's good then.

The fruit wine was sweet. I didn't know it would be so intoxicating.

00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,420
I won't drink anymore so that we won't delay our trip.

It's fine. You were quite adorable when you were drunk.

Let's go.

When the bright star appears, disorder brings calamity.

If the greedy wolf represents Su Mo,

his return to Yunhuang will lead to turbulence.

236

Then the bright star represents Zhen Lan.

What else did you think I meant?

296
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,240
I was talking nonsense. Don't make fun of me anymore.

But the misty is so heavy now, and the stars are covered up.

303

There's no way to discern the direction.

Everything in the world is mutually reinforcing and conquering.

305

Some of the most dangerous places are also where one finds a way to survive.

Because of the Land-Sea Nation Alliance, you should get used to having people help you.

326
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,200
All right.

327
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,280
This is the King of Jiuyi's Nine-headed Bird.

328
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,080
When the Nine-headed Bird comes,

329
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,830
it's when the King of Jiuyi wants medicine.

330
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,880
But why is it earlier this year than in the past?

331
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,690
The Nine-headed Bird has sent a message,

332
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,850
saying Su Mo and Bai Ying have reached Jiuyi Mountain's right peak.

333
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,240
They're looking for the Splitting Sword.

334
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,020
Summon Yu Huan here.

335
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,660
Yes.

336
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,020
We've walked so far, but haven't seen a water source.

337
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,210
Are you thirsty? I'll go look for some water.

338
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,630
There's no rush. I'll see if I can use a spell

339
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,680
to condense the water here.

340
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,460
Why would it do that?

341
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,830
Jiuyi Mountain is indeed sinister.

342
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,830
Let's look elsewhere to see if there's another water source.

343
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,440
Let's go.

344
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,890
A pool of stagnant water.

345
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,460
I think we're really in the Misty Forest that Madam Tianxiang described.

346
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,550
Everything in this forest, on the surface looks like other forests,

347
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,690
but actually everything is dead.

348
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,320
This scenery really looks like it came from a nightmare.

349
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,020
Jiuyi Mountain was originally Prince Qing's domain.

350
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,760
Unfortunately, Prince Qing betrayed Kongsang a hundred years ago,

351
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,530
so it became Cangliu's territory.

352
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,870
They say Prince Qing Chen has already died.

353
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,620
I'm still doubtful about Prince Qing Chen's death.

354
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,690
After I came back from Yunhuang, I asked Aunt Ru to check into it.

355
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,010
But there's still no news.

356
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,980
Why do you doubt his death?

357
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,320
Back then in the Jing Pagoda, he said Quanxian's blood pact

358
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,600
was ineffective against him.

359
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,990
I immediately used it.

360
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,070
But he indeed wasn't harmed at all.

361
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,120
How could that be?

362
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,960
I suspect that the black-robed person on the Jing Pagoda was helping him.

363
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,800
The black-robed person?

364
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,880
We also sent people to look into it.

365
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,890
There hasn't been any news about Prince Qing Chen in the past hundred years.

366
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,490
That's why Jiuyi Mountain

367
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,690
has been stationed by the secondary branches of the Qing clan.

368
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,360
It's unlikely that he's still alive.

369
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,390
No matter what, if Prince Qing Chen

370
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,790
is dead, I want to see the corpse. If he's alive, I want to see him.

371
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,450
A'Huan, what's the matter?

372
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,330
Why do you seem so unsettled?

373
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,800
Older Sister, don't worry. I probably just didn't rest well.

374
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,920
When I get back, I'll tell people to prepare a medicinal soup to supplement you.

375
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,800
Older Sister, I'm fine.

376
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm just worried about you.

377
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,400
A'Huan, you must be careful when you see Lord Zhi Zhe this time.

378
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,080
Older Sister, you seem to fear Lord Zhi Zhe.

379
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,090
Lord Zhi Zhe has strong powers and his temper is unpredictable,

380
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,460
especially during this time.

381
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,550
Anyway, you must be cautious about everything.

382
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,030
I know.

383
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,220
Go ahead.

384
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,190
Yu Huan greets Lord Zhi Zhe.

385
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm grateful for Lord Zhi Zhe saving my life.

386
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,130
Did your older sister tell you?

387
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,220
Older Sister told me that the real ruler of Cangliu

388
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,090
is you, Lord Zhi Zhe.

389
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,260
Also, Lord Zhi Zhe removed my Quanxian blood pact.

390
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,270
That's right.

391
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,620
Smart.

392
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,970
Stoic.

393
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,360
Ambitious.

394
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,550
As expected of the person I've chosen.

395
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,100
From now on, you'll report directly to me.

396
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,220
I shall not disappoint your command.

397
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,550
- I will do my best.
- Good.

398
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,400
I have an important mission...

399
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,030
to assign to you.

400
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,700
Yu Zhu.

401
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,620
Master Peng.

402
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,730
Lord Zhi Zhen summoned Yu Huan.

403
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,990
You've done a lot behind my back.

404
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,430
I wouldn't dare. It's Lord Zhi Zhe—

405
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,090
Lord Zhi Zhe?

406
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,290
That night, who was it that you took up the Jing Pagoda?

407
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,300
It was the person that Lord Zhi Zhe invited to a meeting at Jing Pagoda.

408
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,900
Someone that Lord Zhi Zhe invited. Who was he?

409
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,920
Didn't Master Peng engage in a fight with him in the library before?

410
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,830
Are talking in riddles with me?

411
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,390
Why did Lord Zhi Zhe want to meet a Kongsang person?

412
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,720
I don't dare question him.

413
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,770
If I have any intentions of prying,

414
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,780
Lord Zhi Zhe will surely punish me.

415
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,690
Please forgive me, Master Peng.

416
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,680
I really don't know who Lord Zhi Zhe invited.

417
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,380
Don't think that just because Lord Zhi Zhe summoned Yu Huan

418
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,870
that you have a new person to rely on.

419
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:00,620
Don't forget back then how you two crawled step by step to where you are now.

420
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,760
I don't dare.

421
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,550
I'm ordering you to immediately go to Jiuyi Mountain

422
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,350
to kill the Emperor of the Sea.

423
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,190
Am I going alone?

424
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,990
There's a Qing clan's barrier at Jiuyi Mountain.

425
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,500
Anyone who is not from Kongsang

426
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,590
will have his power reduced by half.

427
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,220
But half of the blood in your body is Kongsang blood.

428
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,810
You're the best person to go to Jiuyi.

429
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,340
It's also the best time

430
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,390
to get rid of the Emperor of the Sea.

431
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,650
I don't dare deceive Lord Zhi Zhe,

432
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,090
but I've been defeated by the Emperor of the Sea, Su Mo, many times.

433
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,720
You... fear him?

434
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,560
I have no fear.

435
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,980
But I also have to admit

436
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,700
that I cannot defeat him in my current state.

437
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,990
It's good to acknowledge defeat.

438
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,370
But you shouldn't be shackled by it.

439
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,900
Thank you for the teaching, Lord Zhi Zhe.

440
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,070
I'll teach you a fighting formation.

441
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,230
It's called the Fire Formation.

442
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,190
Used especially to overcome the Quanxian.

443
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,400
You only need to lure him into the formation.

444
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,930
Thank you, Lord Zhi Zhe.

445
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,640
Over there.

446
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,580
[Jiuyi Mountain - Left Peak]

447
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,780
We've arrived.

448
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,340
Yan Xi, you've achieved your mission by sending us here.

449
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,160
You can go back.

450
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,850
I'll be going into Jiuyi soon.

451
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,970
I probably won't see you for many days.

452
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,260
Can you calm down and not be angry anymore?

453
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,670
I heard the old granddad in the village say,

454
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,280
it's not good for your health to stay angry.

455
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,490
Then-Then I'll explain it one last time, just once more.

456
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,020
I-I really didn't mean to trick pearls out of you.

457
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,660
I didn't do it on purpose.

458
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,530
Forget it. It'll be good as long as you aren't angry.

459
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,500
When you go into the mountain, don't run around.

460
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,960
Don't stray too far from Crown Prince Zhen Lan and General Xi Jing.

461
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,390
You must listen to them. Be careful.

462
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,970
Enough now. The mission is more important.

463
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,010
Be careful on your way back.

464
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,610
I'll trouble the two of you to please take care of Na Sheng.

465
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,680
Let's go, Miss Na Sheng.

466
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,330
Let's go.

467
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,490
Na Sheng!

468
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,330
Yan Xi!

469
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,270
I just wanted to tell you.

470
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,820
I...

471
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,780
I'm not going back to the main camp.

472
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
I'll wait here to support you.

473
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,690
Really?

474
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,540
This is great. Then I'll go unseal the seal right away.

475
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,570
You must be careful by yourself here. Wait for me.

476
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,010
I'm going to go right now. Let's go!

477
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,410
- Slowly. Slowly.
- I'm going to unseal the seal now!

478
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,350
- Slowly.
- Let's unseal the seal.

479
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,770
- Go! Go!
- Don't trip and fall!

480
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,540
- Be careful!
- Let's go!

481
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,220
Wait for us!

482
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,100
Ever since the fall of Kongsang, the Jiuyi Mountain has been covered by the barrier.

483
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,480
Ting and I've passed by here many times.

484
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,390
But right now who the King of Jiuyi is, no one knows.

485
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,400
There probably aren't many people in the Jiuyi palace.

486
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,450
It's so gloomy and spooky, it's too scary.

487
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,340
That's why you can't run around. Stay close to Xi Jing.

488
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,660
Your Highness, later will we go directly up the mountain

489
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,150
to the Jiuyi Palace and meet the King of Jiuyi?

490
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,920
Yes. When the time comes, pretend you're Kongsang refugees.

491
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't reveal our identities.

492
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,280
The Heavenly Ring is lighting up.

493
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,590
Is something happening with A'Ying?

494
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,800
- No, it's not.
- Why were you shouting for nothing then?

495
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,030
We're probably not far from the other seal.

496
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,840
Wait a moment.

497
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,460
No?

498
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,310
Na Sheng, are you sure about this?

499
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,940
We've been walking with you for two hours in the forest already.

500
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,380
No, it should be right over there.

501
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,490
That should be Queen Bai Wei's tomb.

502
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,180
She seems to be luring us here on purpose.

503
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,030
- This singing—
- Be careful.

504
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,650
It could be a trap.

505
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,990
What is it?

506
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,140
Maybe it's Tu Luo?

507
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,460
Hurry and go.

508
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,010
It should be here.

509
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,980
That's not right.

510
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,460
This doesn't look like a tomb.

511
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,230
Let's go in to take a look.
[Be Wei's Former Home]

512
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,240
Queen Bai Wei was Kongsang's first queen.

513
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,460
Her tomb is a place for later generations to revere.

514
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,880
How could it be like this?

515
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,700
That's right. Isn't a tomb a grave?

516
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,020
But this is clearly a bamboo hut.

517
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,230
So strange.

518
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,530
Look. A mark of the rose.

519
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,500
Even if it's not a tomb,

520
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,690
I think it is still related to Queen Bai Wei.

521
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,000
Why don't we go in and take a look?

522
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,550
Your Highness.

523
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,520
You step back. I'll take a look.

524
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,040
Na Sheng, come here.

525
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,830
You bold treasure thieves!

526
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,100
How dare you barge into Queen Bai Wei's tomb!

527
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,870
Who are you?

528
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,090
[Li Zhu - Qing Clan's servant - Kongsang]

529
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,140
Who are you?

530
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,650
How dare you trespass here?

531
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,130
You're from Kongsang?

532
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,760
This girl isn't from Kongsang.

533
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,350
Miss, we're Kongsang people who rushed here from the Central Plains.

534
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,380
We came especially to pay respects to our ancestors.

535
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,460
To pay respect to the ancestors?

536
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,010
Kongsang fell a hundred years ago.

537
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,420
Why would there be anyone paying respects?

538
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:19,000
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

539
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,420
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

540
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,910
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

541
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:32,820
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

542
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,300
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

543
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,730
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

544
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:46,740
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

545
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,260
♫ We've met several times ♫

546
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,640
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

547
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:00,770
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

548
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,280
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

549
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,710
♫ You live in there ♫

550
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:13,880
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

551
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,600
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

552
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,670
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

553
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,600
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

554
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,210
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

555
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,510
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

556
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:35,020
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

557
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:41,530
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

558
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:45,510
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

559
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,530
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

560
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:52,450
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

561
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:55,970
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

562
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,370
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

563
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:04,450
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

564
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:15,070
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
