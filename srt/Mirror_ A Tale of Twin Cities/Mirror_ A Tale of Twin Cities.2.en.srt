00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,860
Elder Sister, smile!

165
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,930
Quit messing around. Quit messing around.

166
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,120
Don't think about it anymore, Elder Sister.

167
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,290
I'll keep you company tonight.

168
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,760
- Then I'll go get some snacks.
- Okay.

169
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,640
Wait for me.

170
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,290
It's me.

171
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,920
Why is it you again?

172
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,030
I-I didn't purposely

173
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,150
watch you change clothes.

174
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,080
Did you take the thing inside the sachet?

175
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,040
What thing?

176
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,500
That has nothing to do with you.

177
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,990
But that pearl is in my hands now.

178
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,500
If you don't tell me, I won't give it back to you.

179
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,750
It's useless for you to have the Sea Soul Pearl.

180
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,840
Sea Soul Pearl?

181
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,810
Then, what use would you have for it?

182
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,730
The Sea Soul Pearl can open the barrier at the bottom of Jing Lake.

183
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,660
We can then escape to the bottom of Jing Lake.

184
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,890
Then Kongsang people won't be able to abuse and bully us anymore.

185
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,230
Thanks for lending a hand and helping me in the prison last time.

186
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,500
I know you are different from them.

187
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,970
Not everyone... is as kindhearted as you, Princess.

188
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,740
But...

189
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,010
Here.

190
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,840
- Take the Sea Soul Pearl. You can save many people.
- Thank you.

191
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,720
So you planned it all right from the beginning, didn't you?

192
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll definitely return the favor I owe you.

193
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,890
Okay. I'll find you to ask for it.

194
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,780
Thank you for your help.

195
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,640
What's your name?

196
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,380
Bai Ying.

197
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,100
Su Mo.

198
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,730
What did you want to tell me a moment ago?

199
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,990
You look better holding a sword.

200
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,700
Are you the person who turned Xinghan Paradise upside down,

201
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,430
stole the Sea Soul Pearl,

202
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,790
and want the merpeople to escape to the bottom of Jing Lake?

203
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,480
Who are you?

204
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,850
I, Prince Qing Chen, admire a talented person the most.

205
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,670
If you are useful to me,

206
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,840
I won't mistreat you.

207
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,620
- Su Mo.
- Aunt Ru.

208
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,690
- Despicable!
- Su Mo.

209
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,320
Su Mo! Su Mo! Su Mo!

210
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,520
What do you want him to do? I will do it!

211
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,510
You won't be able to do it.

212
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,500
Everyone has a fate. I only want him.

213
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,730
Listen well.

214
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,160
Not only can I capture her,

215
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,220
I can also capture the others.

216
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,880
I advise you to listen to me.

217
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,250
Otherwise, I'll have them

218
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,940
die, one by one, in front of you.

219
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,940
Su Mo, don't agree to help him.

220
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,800
Can you not see now?

221
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,740
However, it's also a good thing to be blind.

222
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,040
In this world, seeing things too clearly

223
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,080
will hurt only yourself.

224
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,520
[Bai Royal Residence]

225
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,010
Royal Father.

226
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,030
- What is it?
- I'm here to keep you company.

227
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,950
What's great about keeping me company?

228
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,690
When I was young, I always thought that you would never grow old.

229
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,250
No matter what happens, I can rely on you.

230
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,700
Although I'm old, my body is still strong.

231
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,950
I can still be relied upon.

232
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,570
It's just that in regards to you being the crown princess...

233
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,400
I know I can't change that.

234
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,100
In fact, there's something else I would like to ask you.

235
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,780
If I don't ask now, I fear I won't have another chance to ask.

236
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,380
What do you want to ask?

237
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,510
What was my mother like?

238
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,700
She was the bravest, kindest, and

239
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,950
most responsible woman I've ever met.

240
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,710
She was also the best mother in the world.

241
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,750
She fell ill from working tirelessly for the Bai Clan and didn't recover.

242
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,980
I failed to give her, the life she wanted.

243
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,340
Ying'er, inheriting the power of the earth requires a sense of responsibility.

244
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,910
Even more so, it requires courage.

245
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,780
I'm sorry, Royal Father.

246
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,320
Your mother engraved the word "responsibility" into her heart.

247
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,700
You must be courageous like her.

248
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,640
Royal Father, rest assured. I will be a good crown princess.

249
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,250
I won't disappoint Mother or the ancestors of the Bai Clan.

250
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,710
You are always my pride.

251
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,010
The auspicious time is here.

252
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,450
Crown Princess, let us begin the Pagoda Entering Ceremony.

253
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,320
This seal represents the holy purity of the crown princess.

254
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,900
Before the grand wedding, Your Highness must be cautious with your words and actions and be well-behaved.

255
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,760
You must not overstep the boundaries.

256
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,600
After the grand wedding,

257
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,210
the crown prince will naturally remove the seal with a kiss.
[Bai Ying]

258
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,960
Crown Princess, you must bring this seal with you to enter the Jing Pagoda.

259
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,020
To meditate as well as practice the rules of the royal family and the rituals of Kongsang.

260
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:22,230
Wait for the wedding day with the crown prince.

261
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,660
It is this unfamiliar name

262
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,670
that will cast a spell to be entangled with me for life.

263
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:44,390
I didn't expect my life to be sealed like this.

264
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,990
Prince Bai, go say your last words to your daughter.

265
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,850
Thank you, High Priest.

266
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,600
Royal Father.

267
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,700
Royal Father, what are you doing?

268
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,380
Ying'er,

269
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,360
since you were born, I always wished you wouldn't grow up,

270
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,190
establish meritorious deeds,

271
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,100
and bring glory to our ancestors.

272
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,470
Instead, to live the life you dream of.

273
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,460
To not live for your royal father or mother.

274
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,650
Even more so, not for the common people.

275
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,800
It's best that you can have a husband whom you admire

276
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,620
and who will face everything in life with you.

277
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,850
I'm incompetent, always obeying fate.

278
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,570
I have implicated you.

279
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,190
Ying'er,

280
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,080
from today onward, both of us

281
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,390
must observe the proprieties of ruler and subject.

282
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,790
A'Yu and Yao'er are Your Highness's personal maids.

283
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,620
They will accompany you to Jing Pagoda.

284
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,720
In addition, there will also be dozens of attendants and female servants
[Jing Pagoda - Hall of the Crown Princess]

285
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,270
who will obey your orders at all times.

286
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,740
Your Highness, would you like to look at the name list?

287
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,850
No need. I will follow your arrangements.

288
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,700
For the next three months, you will stay here in this hall in this Jing Pagoda alone.

289
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,560
You must not have contact with any outsiders.

290
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,620
If Your Highness commits an impure deed,

291
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,690
your seal will disappear automatically.

292
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,370
Your Highness, please remember this.

293
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,750
All right.

From now on, no one is allowed to pass this floor level without permission.

296

Other than A'Yu and I, no one can enter the bedchamber of the crown princess.

297
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,350
Everything must be relayed to Her Highness through us.

You two will remain in the main hall.

You will be tasked with cleaning and guarding the main hall.

- Yes.
- Yes.

Why don't we keep him in the main hall to play music to relieve the princess of her boredom?

308
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,290
He should stay in the side hall.

Not only can I capture her,

I can also capture the others.

If you don't do as I say, I will kill them, one by one, in front of you.

However, it's also a good thing to be blind.

It'll be easier to complete your task.

324
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,430
Heavenly King Lang Gan and Queen Bai Wei

325
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,740
- established the world and built up Kongsang.
- Amazing, amazing.

326
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,320
This is the Pavilion of Books that Heavenly King built.

327
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,240
It not only includes the knowledge of Kongsang,

328
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,520
but also that of Quanxian, Cangliu, and others.

329
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,520
The crown princes of past dynasties have also rested here.

330
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,430
High Priest, what book is this?

331
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,680
That is just a book on calligraphy.

332
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,650
Your Highness the Crown Prince, you should first read about the history of Yunhuang.

333
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,360
No rush, no rush. I'll first read this.

334
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,740
Put that book aside first.

335
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,570
Your Highness the Crown Prince...

336
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,040
- You...
- High Priest,

337
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm prepared to study tirelessly here.

338
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,230
If there's nothing else, then you can go back and rest.

339
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,960
Oh, right. By the way, I am not full yet.

340
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,250
If possible, I'd like some delicious food and drinks brought here.

341
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,590
It will help with my studies.

342
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,650
"Dark Golden Classics"?

343
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,280
Yao'er, here, let me help you.

344
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,010
Here, give it to me.

345
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,240
W-What do we do?

346
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,610
Has something happened?

347
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,240
S-Su Mo, you are proficient at music.

348
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,800
Do you know how to fix this harp?

349
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,440
A'Yu, this harp is a rare item.

350
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,240
There are only a few in Kongsang who knows how to tune it.

351
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,940
How could he possibly know how to fix it?

352
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,510
Yao'er, how about we just let him try?

353
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,920
He can't even see, so how would he fix it?

354
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,590
- I should ask the princess first.
- All right.

355
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,270
Princess...

356
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,380
I-I was not careful

357
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,300
and damaged the harp.

358
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,770
It's all right. I'm just a bit upset.

359
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,690
A'Yu told me just now

360
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,770
that she found a musician here at the pagoda.

361
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,330
Perhaps he could fix the harp.

362
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,880
No need.

363
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,820
Princess, I know that are very few people who have knowledge of the harp.

364
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,580
However, I heard that this person is proficient at ancient and modern music.

365
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,500
That is why he was summoned here.

366
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,790
Then let's have him give it a try.

367
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,570
All right, Princess!

368
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,550
Princess, you should get ready.

369
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,310
Soon, High Priest will be here for your lessons.

370
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,750
Princess, why don't you go in?

371
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,290
The song you just played is...

372
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,600
Kongsang's "Moon Over Jing Lake."

373
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,080
Yao'er.

374
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,360
Today, I heard the musician play "Moon Over Jing Lake" using the harp.

375
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,270
This harp is rare not only in Kongsang but all of Yunhuang.

376
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,470
Yet he was actually able to fix it.

377
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,780
That's right, Princess.

378
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,160
A'Yu said it seems as though this musician is specifically here for the harp.

379
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,900
Then isn't it more convenient for him to be in the main hall?

380
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,560
Princess, before coming here,

381
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,250
His Highness Prince Bai instructed me to take care of you.

382
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,880
No mishaps can happen.

383
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,380
Otherwise...

384
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,200
I understand Royal Father's concern. I will be especially careful.

385
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,080
All right.

386
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,390
Princess, it's late. You should rest early.

387
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,180
- Tomorrow, you need to learn about etiquettes with the High Priest.
- All right.

388
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,490
I shall take my leave now.

389
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,960
A'Yu, when will the harp be fixed?

390
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,340
The musician said it still needs further tuning.

391
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,490
It will be done in a few days.

392
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,890
Princess, he may have lost track of time last night when he was busy tuning.

393
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,820
Thus, he disturbed your rest.

394
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,360
I'll immediately arrange for him to stay in a room further away.

395
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,900
After the harp is fixed, ask him to come to the main hall.

396
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,120
What?

397
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,500
- That...
- You may leave.

398
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,940
Yes.

399
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,930
The schedule for the next few days starts at sunrise

400
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,000
with transcribing scriptures

401
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,380
and learning Kongsang's history.

402
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,920
During mealtime, you shall head toward the main palace

403
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,380
to learn the palace rules and customs.

404
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,080
In the afternoon, you must practice wedding rituals.

405
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,820
Starting at noon,

406
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,950
you can rest for three hours.

407
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,770
High Priest.

408
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,080
Must I learn these things?

409
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,680
These are the rules.

410
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,280
These are also the customs that a crown princess must learn.

411
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,370
How to control the power of Earth,

412
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:04,690
how to protect Kongsang's Ye City and the royal city, will I not learn these things?

413
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,650
It is not time for that yet.

414
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,200
The priority now is

415
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,460
to learn to become

416
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,820
a crown princess who complies with customs and rules.

417
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,950
I have been here for some time now.

418
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,490
Is everything out there all right? Is my royal father all right?

419
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,010
Replying to Your Highness, they are well.

420
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,910
Your Highness just needs to nurture your heart and soul.

421
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,680
Don't concern yourself about the rest.

422
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,120
Your Highness, I have a few words to say.

423
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,230
If some things can happen as we wish,

424
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,920
then that would be the best.

425
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,860
However, how many people experience that?

426
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,990
If some things

427
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,830
are inevitable,

428
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,240
then can Your Highness open her heart

429
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,950
and try to slowly accept things?

430
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,930
That would be good for others as well as yourself.

431
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,370
What do you think, Your Highness?

432
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,840
High Priest, you are correct. I will remember this in my heart.

433
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:21,630
A'Yu and Yao'er, listen well.

434
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:25,460
Her Highness needs to practice needlework during the day.

435
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,830
During the evening, she must meditate.

436
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,280
Then, she must bathe and sleep.

437
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,650
Su Mo.

438
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,810
Su Mo, why is he here?

439
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,610
His eyes...

440
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,990
Princess.

441
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,620
Su Mo, the crown princess is here. Are you not going to greet her?

442
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,130
Greetings, Your Highness.

443
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,480
Your eyes...

444
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,380
My eyes are fine.

445
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,650
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

446
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,120
Why would he be here at the pagoda?

447
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,740
There's one more lonely person here at the pagoda now.

448
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,480
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

449
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,880
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

450
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,440
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

451
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,280
♫ In the dream, there are longing and fear ♫

452
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,750
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

♫ We've met several times ♫

456
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,060
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our past fated relationship ♫

457
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:02,240
♫ Sighing for the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

458
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,680
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

459
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,130
♫ You live in there ♫

460
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:15,250
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

461
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,080
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:26,090
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

464
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,670
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

465
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,080
♫ Using ten finger to painstakingly ♫

466
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,520
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

467

♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

468
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,940
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

469

♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

470
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,880
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

471
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,390
