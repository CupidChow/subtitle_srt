[Episode 36]

3
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,620
Dragon deity, come quickly.

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,850
Bai Ying! Bai Ying.

5
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,710
Don't use your Mirror Spell.

6
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,580
- I am fine.
- But you...

7
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,720
I am truly fine.

8
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,770
Your backlash...

9
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,080
I can handle this.

10
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,400
- Dragon deity.
- Dragon deity.

11
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,230
We can be saved.

12
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,100
Has dragon deity appeared?

13
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,760
Dragon deity.

14
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,000
It is truly the dragon deity.

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,620
Dragon deity is here at Stranded Dragon Abyss.

16
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,110
Dragon deity of Quanxian Tribe...

17
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,540
has immeasurable ancient prehistoric power.

18
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,710
Dragon deity...

19
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,430
is really coming back to life.

20
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,660
You still don't believe it. Let it go.

21
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,870
No. I still have a chance.

22
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,260
I won't give up. It should belong to me.

23
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,790
Dragon Deity is here. Run!

24
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,490
Our dragon deity is back.

25
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,820
- Dragon deity is back.
- Dragon deity is back.

26
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,970
- Dragon deity is back.
- Dragon deity is back.

27
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,040
Dragon deity.

28
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,390
Su Mo, I'm fine.

29
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,260
Go find the dragon deity.

30
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,570
But you...

31
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,490
I can still hold on for a while longer. Go and look for the dragon deity.

32
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,650
Then we'll leave together.

33
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,660
You wait for me.

34
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,190
Dragon deity.

35
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,160
Why are you hesitant? Why are you angry?

36
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,080
- Who are you?
- I am Emperor of the Sea, Su Mo.

37
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,090
Why did you become Emperor of the Sea?

38
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,470
There was no mark on the body of Chun Huang.

39
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,480
Please give me your power.

40
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,710
I want to fulfill my mission

41
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,060
to take everyone back to Biluo Sea.

42
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,620
No!

43
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,460
You're not the Emperor of the Sea who can take the Quanxian tribe back to Biluo Sea.

44
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,890
- You're not!
- Why not?

45
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,630
Someone who has the power of destructive force

46
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,360
is not worthy to receive my strength.

47
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,580
Looks like the dragon deity is in pain.

48
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,550
Have faith that the Emperor of the Sea can certainly calm the dragon deity down.

49
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,350
Destructive force? You mean a violent capability?

50
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,960
Yes. This is a spell cultivated by using the darkest power.

51
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,650
Although it's powerful, it's also extremely dangerous.

52
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,860
Chun Huang was so kind and honest, but how could his descendant

53
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,800
practice such a dangerous type of spiritual cultivation.

54
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,490
Kind and honest?

55
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,130
Can kindness and honesty protect all of the ordinary citizens?

56
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,970
Can kindness and honesty protect someone you love?

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
Only strength—

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,490
Only strength can help me fulfill my mission,

59
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,920
to take everyone back home.

60
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,530
I'll prove it to you right now.

61
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,790
Dragon deity! Dragon deity!

62
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:54,160
Dragon deity! Dragon Deity!

63
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,540
It can't be over just like this.

64
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,320
Su Mo, Emperor of the Sea.

65
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,510
Put your hand on my body.

66
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,020
Okay.

67
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,990
Are you ready to receive the strength of the dragon deity?

68
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,660
I'm ready.

69
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,060
Dragon deity, why has this happened?

70
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,070
Emperor of the Sea, your strength is from the cultivation art of violence,

71
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,020
so you cannot bear the strength of the dragon deity.

72
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,720
I can't bear the strength of the dragon deity?

73
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,850
Then, what do I do?

74
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,680
Everything is yet to be seen.

75
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,260
Dragon deity, let's go there!

76
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,520
Bai Ying!

77
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,290
Bai Ying!

78
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,420
Bai Ying!

79
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,310
Bai Ying.

80
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,470
Su Mo.

81
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,060
I'm content having met you

82
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,260
in this life.

83
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,460
I hope your wishes come true

84
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,790
and that you're happy and free in Biluo Sea.

85
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,100
Bai Ying. Bai Ying!

86
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,630
I'm definitely going to save you.

87
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,320
Dragon deity!

88
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,060
♫ I pray not for a fated moment ♫

89
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:35,810
♫ But to be able to meet you again ♫

90
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:41,820
♫ I smile not for joy ♫

91
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,730
♫ But to be brave enough to hold back tears ♫

92
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,390
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

93
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,990
You won't die.

94
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,030
You definitely won't.

95
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:11,750
♫ I quietly listen to the story starting at the beginning ♫

96
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:18,500
♫ Why must deep love be greedy and long for such words? ♫

97
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,200
♫ Unforgettable longing is like wind and the snow is
like cherry blossoms ♫

98
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,800
♫ It seems that your footsteps are light ♫

99
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,150
♫ In my dream is you ♫

100
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,090
♫ Awake from my dreams, I wait for you ♫

101
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:46,860
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

102
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:17,440
♫ Until the very last moment ♫

103
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:25,970
♫ The world's most precious tears ♫

104
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,590
Are these pearls... Su Mo's tears?

105
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,550
♫ Cool my cheeks ♫

106
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,090
♫ Yet I cannot bear to wipe them away ♫

107
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,410
♫ Somehow, this intoxicated me is silently worried ♫

108
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,150
Na Sheng, why are you here?

109
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,910
Crown Prince Brother, Sister Bai Ying seems to have gotten hurt.

110
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,330
Bai Ying—

111
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,350
What happened to Bai Ying?

112
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,320
Where is Dragon deity taking her?

113
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,740
Probably to the Quanxian main camp.

114
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,440
Your Highness, how taking Na Sheng to the Quanxian main camp?

115
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,730
I'll stay to care for Quanxian's wounded soldiers.

116
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,080
Then, Brother Crown Prince, let's go back to the Quanxian main camp right now.

117
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,830
I'm worried about Bai Ying. I don't know her condition.

118
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,610
Let's go.

119
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:26,070
♫ Help each other expand our horizons ♫

120
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,580
- Young Master, Princess Bai…
- She's hurt.

121
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,860
I'll treat her right away.

122
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,060
No need.

123
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,450
Sea Emperor, what happened?

124
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,820
Bai Ying was injured by the Heavenly Sword.

125
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,230
How is it?

126
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,460
She shut down the five rhymes and six senses.

127
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,170
Still Meditation? It was in Ruyi Gambling House.

128
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,520
She must have used this to shut down the five rhymes and six senses.

129
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,120
Princess Bai's breathing is faint. I'm afraid she won't last much longer

130
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,490
if we don't use magic on her.

131
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,800
No. The magic of the Mirror Technique will hurt her instead.

132
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,620
Since the dragon deity seal has been removed,

133
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,820
why can't we treat her with the power of the dragon deity?

134
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,150
Although I removed the dragon deity's seal,

135
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,660
I didn't get the power of the dragon deity.

136
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,240
Why is that?

137
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,360
Master Si, I'll explain this to you in the future.

138
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,330
In the meantime, is there another way to save Bai Ying?

139
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,880
Unless you forcefully open her five rhymes and six senses and

140
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,060
then use magic on her.

141
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,430
Force?

142
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,460
Yes. But if we force it,

143
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,630
it'll cause some injuries for Princess Bai.

144
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,880
This would save Bai Ying's life.

145
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,250
No matter what method,

146
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,320
we have to try it.

147
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,390
Are Sister Bai Ying and Brother Ice Cube in there?

148
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,240
Young Master is treating Princess Bai in the ice chamber. You'd better wait out here.

149
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,690
How are Sister Bai Ying's wounds?

150
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,670
Young Master will do his best to try and save Princess Bai,

151
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,430
but…

152
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,680
But what?

153
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,010
But I saw that Princess Bai was barely breathing.

154
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,320
I'm afraid she's in an extremely critical condition.

155
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,660
What is that supposed to mean?

156
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,310
I'll say it again. Young Master will try his best to save Princess Bai.

157
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,790
It was the dragon deity who brought back Brother Ice Cube and Sister Bai Ying.

158
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,730
Dragon deity... The dragon deity will surely help them.

159
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,190
Dragon deity?

160
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,620
If Young Master removed the dragon deity's seal, everything should be fine.

161
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,310
How many hours has it been? Why haven't they come out yet?

162
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,590
Theoretically, with the dragon deity's power,

163
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,530
Young Master should've been able to cure Princess Bai.

164
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,530
Then let's go in and see, okay?

165
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,260
That's forbidden. The consequences of rushing in are unimaginable.

166
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,770
But waiting out here forever...

167
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,140
Na Sheng.

168
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,470
Let's just patiently wait out here.

169
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,230
Brother Crown Prince, don't worry too much.

170
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,360
Brother Ice Cube will save Sister Bai Ying.

171
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,480
I will definitely use all my strength to allow you to wake up.

172
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,060
Emperor of the Sea? Emperor of the Sea?

173
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,530
Master Si, how is Young Master and Princess Bai?

174
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,000
Princess Bai's breathing has stabilized. She should be fine.

175
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,170
But the Emperor of the Sea lost a lot of power and I need to treat him.

176
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,590
Zhi Xiu, take Princess Bai to the guest room to rest.

177
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,090
Okay.

178
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,230
Don't be too worried, Your Highness.

179
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,900
Although Princess Bai's breathing is faint, it's stable.

180
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,160
Young Master has already treated Princess Bai. She'll definitely wake up.

181
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,960
Thank you. We'll take care of her.

182
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,170
Then I'll leave now.

183
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,230
Is it true what Zhixiu just said, Crown Prince Brother?

184
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,710
Sister Bai Ying will probably be fine, right?

185
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,070
Na Sheng, let's wait here for her to wake up.

186
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,090
Sister Bai Ying, wake up quickly.

187
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,350
Brother Crown Prince, I'll change Sister Bai Ying's clothes.

188
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,730
All right.

189
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,160
Lord Zhi Zhe, I have a favor to ask.

190
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,760
I haven't heard anything from Yu Huan about the battle in the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

191
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,590
Please help me find Yu Huan.

192
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,510
I gave him chances,

193
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,560
but he failed every time.

194
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,990
Lord Zhi Zhe, Yu Huan does lack power and ability,

195
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,400
but he doesn't deserve to die. Please help him.

196
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,570
It's his fault for being useless.

197
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,330
He caused this game to lose its fun.

198
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,650
Lord Zhi Zhe, please save Yu Huan.

199
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,170
He's worthless...

200
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,160
to me now.

201
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,470
I want to give the opportunity...

202
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,730
to those who are more worthy of it.

203
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,940
Quick!

204
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,320
Yu Huan!

205
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,130
Yu Huan.

206
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,640
Wake up, Yu Huan.

207
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,700
A'Ying, get some good rest.

208
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,890
I'm here.

209
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,070
A'Ying, you can finally take a break.

210
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,310
Before I fell into a deep sleep and couldn't wake up,

211
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,340
you kept vigil at my side, too.

212
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,570
Do you know

213
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,080
how selfish I am?

214
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,990
For an instant, I hoped you would sleep like this.

215
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,120
At least, in this way,

216
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,080
you won't be annihilated.

217
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,870
I know you will definitely wake up.

218
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,310
Isn't that so?

219
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,560
Where's the medical officer?

220
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,740
His Highness decreed that without a written authorization of Master Lang,

221
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,810
the medical offices are not allowed to treat the patients privately.

222
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:42,670
What did you say? Repeat it.

223
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,190
Do you know the reason?

224
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,570
I have no idea. Also, Master Lang

225
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,970
is checking the whereabouts of Junior General Fei Lian.

226
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,790
Please return to your residence immediately

227
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,070
to prevent Master Lang from worrying.

228
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,060
Leave.

229
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,660
Yes.

230
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,360
It seems like the five masters want Yu Huan's life.

231
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,020
He has been brought back here.

232
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,250
It's impossible that they are not aware.

233
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,390
They didn't allow the medical officer to treat him.

234
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,710
They want his life.

235
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,970
Elder Sister Yu Zhu,

236
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,140
why do they want Yu Huan to die?

237
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,300
Pawns...

238
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,590
are abandoned after being used.

239
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,300
The five masters have always been like this.

240
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,260
No,

241
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,540
I won't let Yu Huan die.

242
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,570
I'm going to seek help from Uncle.

243
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,650
Junior General Fei Lian!

244
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,360
If you go without any promises,

245
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,360
I fear Master Lang will not agree.

246
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,100
Why don't we do this?

247
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,200
Saintess Yu Zhu, you suddenly visited late in the night.

248
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,630
What's the reason?

249
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,470
Master Lang, you should recognize this jade.

250
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,110
Why is Fei Lian's jade with you?

251
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,580
Yu Huan brought it back.

252
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,430
When Fei Lian went missing,

253
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,250
I believe you must have been very worried, too.

254
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,520
I'm deliberately here to inform you

255
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,640
because Yu Huan knows the whereabouts of Fei Lian.

256
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,700
Bai Ying. Bai Ying.

257
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,290
You are awake.

258
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,990
Don't get up for now.

259
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,520
Where is this place?

260
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,180
Quanxian's main camp.

261
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,590
Do you know?

262
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,180
When you collapsed at Stranded Dragon Platform,

263
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,030
I thought that...

264
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,320
It's nothing. It's good that you are awake.

265
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,470
Bai Ying.

266
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,710
Bai Ying!

267
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,740
Emperor of the Sea.

268
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,350
Master Si, what's wrong with Bai Ying?

269
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,990
She has fully recovered

270
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,720
but she's still not awake.

271
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,840
It must be the outcome of forcibly opening the five rhymes and six senses.

272
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,150
We need to wait for Princess Bai to wake up

273
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,810
before we'll know if she's okay. As for you...

274
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,980
I'm okay.

275
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,180
The priority now...

276
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,160
is to quickly think

277
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,060
of how to let the power of the dragon deity to enter my body.

278
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,050
Dragon deity will protect you

279
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,260
and won't easily abandon you or Quanxian.

280
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,530
It must because of the Splitting Mirror Technique in my body.

281
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,550
That's why the dragon deity couldn't transfer his magic power to me.

282
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,510
How do we remove it?

283
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,440
I also have no idea.

284
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,160
When I was learning the Splitting Mirror Technique,

285
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,310
it was to unlock the dragon deity seal,

286
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,090
to gain its power.

287
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,810
But I didn't expect...

288
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,530
the final obstruction

289
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,500
would be this Splitting Mirror Technique.

290
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,240
Every Emperor of the Sea has had his own tests.

291
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,560
A true Emperor of the Sea does not need to be related by blood.

292
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,590
This century...

293
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,730
I have never shirked my responsibilities.

294
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,910
Could it be the Splitting Sword

295
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,220
doesn't belong to me anymore?

296
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,860
Emperor of the Sea, don't force it.

297
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,580
For a decade, I have been thinking

298
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,520
of unlocking the dragon deity seal

299
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
and gaining the power of the dragon deity

300
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,980
to let the people return to Biluo Sea.

301
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,110
But now...

302
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,010
Emperor of the Sea...

303
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,640
Am I really the Emperor of the Sea?

304
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,920
Regardless of whether the dragon deity seal is unlocked or not,

305
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,400
you are our Emperor of the Sea.

306
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,470
Brother Ice Cube.

307
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,260
How is she?

308
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,190
She is still unconscious,

309
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,970
just like she's sleeping.

310
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,630
You took care of her for a long time.

311
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,210
Go and rest now.

312
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,000
Brother Crown Prince said

313
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,960
he was going to Wuse City to relay information.

314
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,830
He's still not back.

315
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,320
Don't worry.

316
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
He won't go far.

317
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,210
Go and rest now.

318
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:07,170
Bai Ying, you're still asleep. Right?

319
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,300
Why is everything so difficult for us?

320
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,390
I want to have a future with you, too.

321
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,920
No matter how tough things are,

322
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,590
you must wake up.

323
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,230
Su Mo.

324
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,980
Su Mo.

325
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,170
Bai Ying!

326
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,980
Don't force yourself.

327
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,780
Take your time.

328
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,490
I will wait for you till you wake up.

329
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,760
A'Ying, she...

330
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,220
She's still not awake.

331
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,580
Has the information been relayed to Wuse City?

332
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,150
Yes.

333
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,310
Su Mo, I have something to discuss with you.

334
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,750
What did you want to talk about?

335
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,240
What happened in...

336
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,030
Stranded Dragon Deity Abyss?

337
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,360
How did Bai Ying turn out like this, too?

338
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,580
Someone suddenly appeared in Stranded Dragon Deity.

339
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,550
He took advantage that we were not ready and

340
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,820
used the Splitting Sword to injure her.

341
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,550
Who is that person?

342
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,120
I didn't see clearly.

343
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,930
The Seal of Six Harmonies is the only seal left

344
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,780
but you and A'Ying

345
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,190
are not fit to unlock another seal.

346
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,210
Are you saying...

347
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,870
After the battle at Stranded Dragon Abyss,

348
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,860
the army of Cangliu suffered heavy casualties.

349
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,000
Now is the time when their energy is sapped.

350
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,620
If we wait for them to gather their troops,

351
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,560
it's possible that all our previous efforts will be in vain.

352
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,210
Cangliu will definitely mobilize their troops

353
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,290
to guard Jing City.

354
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,260
So... we need to cut them off.

355
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,020
If we take down Jing City's neighboring provinces first,

356
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,910
not only will Cangliu not be able to mobilize their troops,

357
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,290
they'll also need to send troops to aid the neighboring provinces.

358
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,660
Qing Yuan stationed his troops in Jiuyi Mountain.

359
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,060
Banbu City's Cangliu army is often attacked,

360
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,330
but they're defended by the Qing Clan's military force.

361
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,530
There's another location we can take down first.

362
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,470
You mean Taoyuan Province?

363
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,180
Okay. Xi Jing and I will head to Taoyuan Province now.

364
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,160
Aunt Ru is also at Taoyuan Province. She'll be able to help you.

365
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,720
We're running out of time.

366
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,740
I'll figure something out.

367
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,520
Elder, I found the wounded soldiers in the Stranded Dragon Abyss

368
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,680
and took them back to camp.

369
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,290
You've worked hard.

370
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,480
The wounded soldiers are all getting treatment, right?

371
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,860
That's all arranged. Yu Huan poisoned the river during this battle.

372
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,430
Yan Xi got captured by Yu Huan when trying to steal the antidote.

373
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,050
Go get some information on Yan Xi from the Cangliu military camp.

374
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,160
I've already contacted Xiang,

375
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,570
but I haven't heard anything back yet.

376
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,870
Let's make a decision after we explain this to Young Master.

377
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,630
Yes.

378
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,610
Please give me power, Lord Zhi Zhe.

379
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,630
I can bear any amount of pain.

380
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,670
Su Nuo.

381
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,070
I can't stand

382
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,410
seeing you get hurt the most.

383
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm not Su Nuo anymore.

384
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,590
From the moment you saved me,

385
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,520
I became Huai Feng.

386
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,900
Good!

387
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,790
I already transferred the Skill of Lie

388
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,000
to your body.

389
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,980
From here on out,

390
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,820
I want you to absorb all of Su Mo's powers.

391
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,040
You're awake?

392
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,170
Who are you? Where am I?

393
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,990
I'm Han and he's Che.

394
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,410
You're in Quanxian's healing camp.

395
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,260
You're safe now.

396
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,300
It seems like I managed to sneak my way in.

397
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,980
What are you doing?

398
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,560
Take the medicine and you'll feel better afterward.

399
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,030
Mine is the right prescription.

400
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,250
Master said your injury is serious.

401
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,300
- You have to drink my prescription.
- Mine is the one that works.

402
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,170
- Mine is the one that works.
- Mine is the one that works!

403
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,740
Enough, enough, enough. Both of you, be quiet!

404
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:14,130
This... This... What are you two doing?

405
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,370
You're our first patient. You must let us treat you.

406
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,770
- Otherwise—
- Otherwise, we won't open the door for you.

407
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,180
- I wouldn't think of going out, either.
- That's the only right thing to do.

408
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,080
The Quanxian Camp is huge.

409
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,070
I often got lost when I first got here

410
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,270
because all the rooms here are very similar.

411
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,580
We'll take you around once you're better.

412
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,250
Che, the Quanxian Camp isn't a place to be strolling about in.

413
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,630
Plus, I know that you're not allowed in the ice chamber.

414
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,400
That's Quanxian Camp's forbidden area.

415
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,890
The ice chamber?

416
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,430
That's where the Emperor of the Sea cultivates and heals.

417
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:50,220
It's at the end of the hall. The elders will punish those who trespass.

418
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,230
Then, you should at least prove to me

419
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,910
that the medicine you're offering can heal me.

420
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,000
- It'll definitely heal you!
- It'll definitely heal you!

421
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,770
Our master is Zhi Xiu.

422
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,330
He's the best physician in Quanxian.

423
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,710
The prescription we followed is what he gives to Young Master.

424
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,900
Young Master?

425
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,070
Is the person you mentioned Su Mo?

426
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,860
Yes. The Emperor of the Sea, Su Mo.

427
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,080
What happened to him? Why is he ill?

428
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,650
About that, I don't know.

429
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,770
Did Su Mo get hurt from the battle at the Stranded Dragon Abyss?

430
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,250
Zhi Xiu is Su Mo's physician.

431
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,690
He understands Su Mo's health best.

432
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,680
Perhaps I can use these two children

433
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,070
to find out about Su Mo's condition.

434
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,940
Drink mine! Drink mine!

435
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,520
- Right! Quickly take the medicine!
- Quickly take the medicine!

436
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,550
Drink mine!

437
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,360
- Drink mine!
- Can I even drink this?

438
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,380
- Drink mine!
- Drink the medicine!

439
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:07,280
Young Master is awake. You don't have to worry.

440
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,690
If there's nothing else, I'm going to go check on the healing camp.

441
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,760
Thank you, Zhi Xiu.

442
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,860
Ning Liang.

443
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,170
Ning Liang, do you have news about Yan Xi?

444
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,220
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

445
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,760
Yan Xi has been captured for a few days now.

446
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,370
Can we tell Brother Ice Cube when he wakes up

447
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,620
- and have him save Yan Xi?
- We're already inquiring about the news from the Cangliu military camp.

448
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,700
This sound pearl came from Cangliu's Jing City.

449
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,020
Jing City?

450
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,570
Yan Xi?

451
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,330
You may leave.

452
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,080
What happened to Yan Xi?

453
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,310
Come on. Tell me. What happened to Yan Xi?

454
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,930
Xiang said...

455
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,110
Master Peng took Yan Xi to the Cangliu military camp.

456
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,000
They won't put him to death easily.

457
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,020
Yan Xi is Quanxian's Commissioner of the Left.

458
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,980
With Cangliu's cunning nature,

459
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,430
they'll definitely find a way to use him.

460
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,860
Then, did they torture him?

461
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,370
They definitely tortured him, right? Ning Liang,

462
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,080
we have to ask Brother Ice Cube to save Yan Xi.

463
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,630
Hurry up! Quickly go!

464
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,940
Brother Ice Cube.

465
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,190
Brother Crown Prince. Yan Xi…

466
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,870
We're currently discussing this matter.

467
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,900
Young Master, I'm guilty.

468
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,190
I failed to report this matter to you because you weren't completely healed.

469
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,270
Xiang just relayed a message to me

470
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,600
that Yan Xi is locked up in the Cangliu military camp.

471
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,750
The people of Cangliu will definitely torture Yan Xi.

472
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,880
Brother Ice Cube, you have to do something about this.

473
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,360
Young Master,

474
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,860
I plead with you to lead some Quanxian soldiers to save Yan Xi.

475
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,820
- Then I'll go, too. I'll also go.
- All right.

476
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,060
Both of you, stop being anxious.

477
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,900
Let your Brother Ice Cube finish.

478
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,130
The soldiers of the Land-Sea Alliance are all still injured.

479
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,510
Rushing to war now is not the best thing to do.

480
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,310
Brother Ice Cube, are you not going to save Yan Xi?

481
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,920
Zhen Lan and Xi Jing are going to Taoyuan Province to carry out a mission.

482
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,810
Cangliu will send troops to aid them when they get there.

483
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,740
Ning Liang, contact Xiang.

484
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,930
Find the right moment to save Yan Xi.

485
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,980
Yes, Young Master.

486
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:47,170
But, Young Master, how can you be sure

487
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,940
that Cangliu will swarm out?

488
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,600
The only person in Cangliu who can shoulder heavy responsibility is Nan Zhao.

489
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,650
Once there's chaos in Taoyuan Province,

490
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,730
Nan Zhao will definitely be sent over.

491
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,860
That's the best time to get Yan Xi out of there.

492
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,640
How can we cause such big commotion?

493
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,050
Gao Shunzhao. According to Aunt Ru,

494
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,970
Gao Shunzhao isn't a bad person.

495
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:13,670
He cares about the commoners and is quite dissatisfied with Cangliu's violence.

496
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,820
I'm sure he'll be willing to work with us.

497
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,670
If we're successful, not only will we be able to save Yan Xi,

498
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,840
Taoyuan Province will also become a great help to us. We'll kill two birds with one stone.

499
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,660
Besides, if we want to get the last seal,

500
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,900
we'll need more assistance.

501
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,450
Then, what should I be doing?

502
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,700
You should stay at Quanxian Camp.

503
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,240
It's best if fewer people go to the enemy's camp.

504
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,790
Plus, you have the power of Heaven.

505
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,920
We can't let you get hurt for Princess Bai's sake.

506
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,640
Na Sheng, there needs to be at least one person who stays here

507
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,320
to prepare for Yan Xi's arrival while we go to save him.

508
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,980
Okay. Ning Liang, you must make sure Yan Xi makes it back.

509
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,690
I definitely will.

510
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:31,620
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

511
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,120
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

512
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,570
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

513
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:45,480
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

514
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,930
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

515
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,410
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

516
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:59,250
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

517
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,950
♫ We've met several times ♫

518
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,380
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

519
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:13,430
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

520
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,850
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

521
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,290
♫ You live in there ♫

522
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:26,460
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

523
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,360
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

524
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,410
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

525
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,290
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

526
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:40,850
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

527
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:44,200
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

528
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,720
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

529
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:54,190
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

530
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,170
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

531
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,120
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

532
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,150
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

533
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,580
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

534
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,020
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

535
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:17,070
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

536
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:27,390
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
