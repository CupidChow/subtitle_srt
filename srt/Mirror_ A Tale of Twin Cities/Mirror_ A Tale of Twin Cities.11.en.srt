Everyone, hear my orders!

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,100
The target is Taoyuan Province. Prepare the Wind Falcons.

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,200
Yes!

How is she?

52
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,400
Her five rhythms and six senses have been shut off.

53
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,600
It's Still Meditation.

54
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,400
She's not dead yet.

55
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,200
Only because her body started using Still Meditation.

56
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Letting herself fall into deep sleep.

57
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,100
Your Highness can still probe into her spiritual consciousness.

58
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,800
What's Still Meditation?

59
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,200
It is a mental cultivation method,

60
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,000
practiced by the disciples of the Kongsang Holy Sword Sect.

61
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,600
It can be used to shut off the five rhythms and six senses.

62
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,400
To fall into a deep sleep to rest and recover.

63
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,300
But it needs her own willpower in order to wake up.

64
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,400
Under what condition would she use Still Meditation?

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,300
It could be that she's deeply hurt physically and mentally.

66
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,800
Where her only choice was to use Still Meditation to save her own life.

67
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,300
If she's only in deep sleep, we can just wake her up.

68
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,000
If she goes on like this,

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
her mental ability will be impaired.

70
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
I can't do it.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then go find Xi Jing. He's also a disciple of the Holy Sword Sect.

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
He can't do it either.

73
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
Then, who can do it?!

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Only she can.

75
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,900
The Still Meditation is only forcefully activated

76
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,200
when she's in danger, or when she's facing something she cannot face.

77
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,220
What in the world did you do to her?

78
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,100
Didn't you say you were going to save her?

79
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,300
Is this how you save her?

80
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Initially, only her spiritual consciousness had been hurt.

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,300
But now, because of you,

82
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,400
her body's activated Still Meditation for self-preservation.

83
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,200
Whether it was a hundred years ago, or now,

84
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,170
what you bring her...

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,400
is only harm.

86
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,300
You two, go over there. You, come with me.

87
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,800
Yes.

88
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,400
- What about you? Over there?
- Still haven't found anyone.

89
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
It's the same on my side too.

90
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Where did she go?

91
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,200
- We've looked for ages.
- We didn't find her either.

92
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,400
What don't you search that way and I'll go over this way.

93

That's all we can do. Let's go.

Using these types of weapons to catch people? Then, what happens to the ordinary people?

102

Her body now is like a tree without water.

No matter how much power you transmit into her, she won't wake up.

Su Mo, what are you doing?

You need to rest. Your spiritual consciousness has been burned by the sunlight.

You used Still Meditation to shut down your five rhythms and six senses.

Your body is weak right now.

If you go out there now, it's no different than giving up your life.

But I don't need your concern.

You can choose to reject it, but I can do what I want.

149

Don't you see how forcefully pushing your good intentions onto others

only increases their burden?

151

You don't need to feel burdened.

154
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,320
- I owe you this.
- You don't owe me anything.

♫ Yet, no matter what I do, I cannot see you clearly ♫

166
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,530
This medicine is made from fairy grass.

167
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,280
Your spiritual consciousness will heal quickly after taking it.

168
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,690
This is too precious. I don't need it.

169
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,020
♫ All beginnings comes at the expense of having endings ♫

170
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,810
♫ However, love makes even breathing so difficult to do ♫

171
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,290
♫ So let love be silent ♫

172
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,140
Thank you.

173
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,580
Let's go.

174
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,850
After wearing Your Highness' sun blocking cloak, I don't feel uncomfortable anymore.

175
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm asking, how much has your body recovered?

176
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,270
Su Mo transferred some magical energy to me, I'm almost recovered.

177
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,420
A'Ying, give me some time

178
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,520
to regain some of my powers back.

179
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,320
Your Highness, what are you saying?

180
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,160
I hopelessly watched as Su Mo took you away,

181
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,170
but I couldn't stop him. In the secret room just now, I—

182
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,870
Your Highness, I, Bai Ying, as your subordinate, should be protecting you.

183
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,960
But this time I made Your Highness worry about me. It's a dereliction of duty on my part.

184
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,850
No, it's me who's incapable.

185
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,530
But that'll change very quickly, believe me.

186
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,400
Let's go and find Na Sheng.

187
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,240
Master Peng has ordered me to help General Yu Huan catch the suspect!
[Peng]

188
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,560
Tell me about the situation.

189
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,150
General Yu Huan was chasing the girl from the Central Plains,

190
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,620
but that girl's ring suddenly put out a flash of lightning that shot into the sky.

191
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,510
It's like she was possessed by divine powers and it destroyed a Wind Falcon, too.

192
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,470
When we looked back, they had already disappeared.

193
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,500
The Heavenly Ring.

194
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,360
Burn oil water to force out the remnants of the Kongsang!

195
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,740
Especially the girl from the Central Plains who's wearing that ring, she must be caught!

196
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,680
Everyone, follow me.

197
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,020
- Young Master.
- What's the matter?

198
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,080
The people of Cangliu have started another search.

199
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,620
I've already given the water map to all the merpeople,

200
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,060
they've already started leaving.

201
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,870
How many of our people are in the Taoyuan Province?

202
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,650
Most of the merpeople have successfully left already.

203
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,160
There are still some of us left inside the gambling house.

204
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,120
Up north from here, there's Taoyuan village,

205
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,930
we can first move there and regroup.

206
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,880
It's just that Yan Xi hasn't come back.

207
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,000
Why hasn't he come back yet?

208
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,680
Ever since he went to send off Na Sheng and the others, he hasn't returned.

209
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,070
Did something happen to Na Sheng?

210
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,060
Do we still wait for him?

211
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,880
I'll go get him.

212
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,450
Young Master, you should leave with us.

213
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,830
Everyone is looking forward to seeing the Emperor of the Sea.

214
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,420
As the Emperor of the Sea,

215
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,550
my duty is to protect all Quanxian.

216
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,900
Not for them to protect me.

217
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,220
What is this?

218
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,880
This is oil-water from Lingqiu Mountain. It's more powerful than kerosene.

219
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,370
Looks like they're going to burn the streets and force us out of hiding.

220
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,170
Na Sheng.

221
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,900
In a moment, run towards the other side of the street.

222
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,070
Turn left and in about 50 feet it should be the main gate to Ruyi Gambling House.

223
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,530
If Aunt Ru and Young Master are still there, go find them.

224
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,300
Take my necklace with you, they'll definitely protect you.

225
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,290
Take off your coat, it's too conspicuous.

226
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,200
Oh, right, right.

227
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,500
Then, if I'm going in a moment, what about you?

228
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,210
Don't worry about me.

229
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,240
I'm going to lure them away. Hurry, run.

230
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,140
You can't go!

231
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,990
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

232
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,540
Why? Why did it come to this?

233
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,780
This is Yunhuang.

234
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,480
Simply put, it's hell on earth.

235
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,910
Who? Who can come and save the innocent people of Taoyuan that are suffering?

236
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
That way. Let's go!

237
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,390
Yan Xi, I won't let your sacrifice go to waste.

238
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,510
I'll live and do my best for those who've helped me.

239
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,750
We're flying! We're flying!

240
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,030
Brother, are you a deity sent from heaven to come and save us?

241
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,530
I came to take you all home.

242
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,780
Lord Zhi Zhe.

243
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,320
Who was sent to get the Heavenly Ring?

244
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,360
Master Peng has already sent Yu Huan to retrieve it.

245
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,900
Yu Huan will definitely get the ring back,

246
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,610
even if Taoyuan Province is burned to the ground.

247
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,080
Yu Huan has already gone ahead and brought the Wind Falcons.

248
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,890
The Heavenly Ring...

249
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,670
must be brought back.

250
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,790
Yes.

251
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:01,980
♪ The fog shrouds the nine towering peaks ♪

252
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:10,800
♪ The azure dragon pulls a chariot made of white jade ♪

253
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,760
♪ The wings of the holy bird ♪

254
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,780
♪ glow with the colors of the sunrise and sunset ♪

255
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:28,600
♪ The ruler who holds the highest power of the land ♪

256
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,570
This is Kongsang's battle song.

257
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,740
Why is Lord Zhi Zhe chanting Kongsang's battle song?

258
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,230
Na Sheng, I've finally found you.

259
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,560
- Let's go quickly!
- Hold on. Hold on.

260
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,150
Yan Xi went that way. It seems like he's been captured by the Cangliu people.

261
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,090
- Ting, help him!
- The Commissioner of the Left.

262
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,270
The Commissioner of the Left can surely turn the situation around.

263
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,360
But he's injured.

264
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,090
Oh no! The giant birds are here. Hurry, let's go.

265
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,160
Aunt Ru, Young Master has arrived.

266
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,540
Young Master, you're finally here.

267
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,730
Who are these children?

268
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,970
I ran into them on the way here.

269
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,700
They were left behind.

270
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,120
Take them with you and return to the Quanxian's Great Camp of Jing Lake.

271
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,110
Yes, Young Master.

272
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,600
This is Madam Ruyi. You can call her Aunt Ru.

273
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,310
She'll take you to the Quanxian's Great Camp of Jing Lake.

274
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,050
You'll find many other children like you there.

275
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,530
Really? We can live amongst others?

276
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,810
Older Brother, will you go with us too?

277
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,210
Of course. But not right now.

278
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,750
Do you have names?

279
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,220
We don't have names. Our master didn't give us names.

280
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,910
Then from now on, you'll be called Che.

281
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:09,080
- And you'll be Han.
- Han?

282
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,860
Once you have your own name, you are your own masters.

283
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,480
From now on, your future
 [Han - Quanxian Merperson & Che - Quanxian Merperson]

284
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,910
is in your own hands.

285
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,880
Young Master, aren't you coming with us?

286
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,980
I still need to find Yan Xi. Take them back first.

287
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,790
Young Master, please be careful.

288
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,300
Goodbye, Older Brother. Goodbye!

289
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,170
Burn it down!

290
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,750
Roger!

291
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,740
Ting? Ting? Ting!

292
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,440
Next to that girl from the Central Plains is one of your people. Can you do it?

293
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,500
I can. General, it's your mission to capture the girl with the Heavenly Ring.

294
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,330
It is my mission, too.

295
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,330
Ting!

296
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,290
Ting. Ting. Ting. Ting!

297
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,020
You can't die!

298
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,490
I'll find someone to save you. Please hold on.

299
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,710
Older Sister.

300
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,880
Ting.

301
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,460
Ting!

302
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,670
That's him. Capture him.

303
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,740
A disciple of the Holy Sword Sect?

304
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,630
Ting?

305
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,530
Ting!

306
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,190
General.

307
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:52,930
Take Na Sheng to Princess Bai Ying.

308
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,430
From now on, you should follow the princess.

309
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,100
I'm going to get you out of here.

310
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,510
I can't.

311
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,450
General...

312
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,740
the reason that I stuck to you never leaving

313
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,120
was because I was tasked with secretly learning the Holy Sword Sect's sword skills.

314
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,270
Hush, I already know.

315
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,330
- Forgive me.
- I know all this. Stop talking, okay?

316
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,220
- General, don't get drunk anymore.
- I promise.

317
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:21,200
I promise.

318
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,820
Come with me.

319
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,140
Sister, Xiao.

320
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,810
Sister...

321
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,230
My younger sister... what have I done?

322
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,300
General, this is my sister, Xiao.

323
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,480
Please don't kill her. Please don't.

324
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,140
Ting.

325
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,890
Ting!

326
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,570
Yu Huan, the third disciple of the Holy Sword Sect greets Senior Brother.

327
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,540
I've only ever heard Master mention you.

328
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,680
Today, I have finally met you in person.

329
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,900
You are very talented in the art of the sword.

330
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,760
However, the art itself is not everything. Your moral character matters more.

331
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,500
Today, I'll teach you what it means by "are the common people innocent?"

332
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,650
The Nine Questions for the Sword asks

333
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,160
"Are the common people innocent?"

334
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,760
Get lost.

335
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,600
The Wind Falcons are here.

336
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,110
None of you can escape.

337
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,780
How is this possible?

338
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,250
Xi Jing.

339
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,400
Senior Brother.

340
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Emperor of the Sea?

341
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,000
Thank you.

342
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,400
You...

343
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,670
Sister Bai Ying.

344
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,000
Where's Yan Xi?

345
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,710
Yan Xi...

346
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,460
That's right! Where's Yan Xi?

347
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,720
Sister Bai Ying, have you seen Yan Xi?

348
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,760
Young Master.

349
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,690
Ting...

350
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,290
Ting.

351
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,440
Aunt Ru, why did you come back?

352
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,520
Governor Gao sent me a message.

353
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,580
He said Cangliu soldiers were guarding the city gates.

354
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,930
They're checking everyone passing through.

355
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,830
No one can leave here by water.

356
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,990
I was concerned that you wouldn't be able to get out of Taoyuan Province.

357
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,770
So I sent the others on their way and came back.

358
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,690
The Cangliu troops are only gone temporarily. They'll definitely be back.

359
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,900
We should leave the city as soon as possible.

360
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,830
But...

361
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,890
They're all injured. Take them with us.

362
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,900
We have a sentry post ten miles away in Taoyuan Village.

363
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:54,970
But they're all outsiders.

364
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,210
Right now, Cangliu is our main enemy.

365
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,250
We can deal with everything else later.

366
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,250
Get into the carriage.

367
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,450
Th-Then what about Yan Xi? What about him?

368
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,760
Over there. Yan Xi and I hid there earlier.

369
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,740
Can we go take a look? Maybe he's inside.

370
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,010
Are you sure?

371
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,970
I'm certain, absolutely. It was just inside there.

372
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,820
- It was here that you were separated?
- Yes. I'm sure of that.

373
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,320
We were hiding right there earlier.

374
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,280
- I'll go find him.
- Na Sheng.

375
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,060
What's wrong?

376
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,470
I'll go take a look. I'll be back shortly.

377
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,580
Yan Xi.

378
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,700
Yan Xi.

379
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,850
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

380
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,860
Yan Xi. Get up, Yan Xi!

381
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,950
Get up!

382
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,950
Yan Xi.

383
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,350
There are a lot of things that I haven't told you yet.

384
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,350
I like you. I like you!

385
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,060
I want to be with you forever.

386
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,540
I haven't even told you yet.

387
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:39,640
I don't care if you're a merperson or whatever. I want to be with you.

388
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,390
Get up. Get up!

389
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,060
He's not dead.

390
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,960
Not dead?

391
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,130
But his hands are so cold.

392
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,930
We're born like that.

393
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,200
But... the arrow came through his heart.

394
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
What's going on?

395
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,470
We live in the water.

396
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,160
To keep balance, our hearts are in the middle.

397
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,220
We're different from you.

398
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,060
That's great. That's great.

399
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,810
That's a great place for a heart!

400
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,570
Now that you've found Yan Xi, can you come with us now?

401
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,060
You two, go over there. You!

402
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,240
This isn't good. The Cangliu troops are back.

403
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,560
Quickly, everyone, get into the carriage. We'll go distract them.

404
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,420
Be careful.

405
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,310
After him!

406
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,100
Why did the carriage stop? Are we there yet?

407
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,490
- Aunt Ru.
- Princess, what's wrong?

408
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,500
I'll take care of them. You take the carriage and charge through the gate.

409
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,220
How confident are you?

410
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,260
Even if there's only a one percent chance, we have to try.

411
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,060
We can't just turn ourselves in.

412
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,060
I'll go with you.

413
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,930
That carriage! Stop now!

414
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,890
Stop!

415
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,520
Stop!

416
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,290
Governor Gao.

417
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,590
Don't come out. I'll go talk to Shunzhao.

418
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,740
After you leave, will you come back again?

419
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,930
I don't know.

420
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,070
Looking at Taoyuan Province now, it's fine if you don't come back.

421
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,630
Thank you.

422
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,290
You should go.

423
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,370
Let them through.

424
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,570
Lord Governor, there's a military order to shut the city gates.

425
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,530
If they found out that we let someone out again...

426
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,570
Haven't enough commoners died in Taoyuan Province?

427
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,100
The Cangliu troops have killed so many innocent people,

428
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,130
all for their own military merit.

429
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,610
Why can't we use our responsibility to protect the common people?

430
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,890
Let them through!

431
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,250
From now on, open the city gates.

432
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,300
Release anyone who goes through the city gates!

433
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,870
Yes, sir.

434
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,260
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

00:43:53,910 --> 00:44:01,030
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫
