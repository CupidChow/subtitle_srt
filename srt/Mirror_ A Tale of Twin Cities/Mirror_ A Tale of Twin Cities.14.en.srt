[Episode 14]

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,020
Kongsang is willing to help us unlock the dragon deity's seal.

4
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,770
To us, it's really all that we can wish for.

5
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,890
Their proposal to collaborate is not a bad idea, but—

6
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,010
Aunt Ru, there's no harm in saying what you think.

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,960
The grievances between the Kongsang and Quanxian tribes for the past several thousand years,

8
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,450
how can they be eliminated so easily?

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,960
You haven't agreed to it and have come to discuss it with me.

10
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,550
I guess that your thoughts are similar to mine, right?

11
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,410
Ning Liang and the others' resentment against the Kongsang

12
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,470
has exceeded my expectation.

13
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,600
For the past few years, Kongsang's treatment towards our Quanxian people

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,040
has not fostered resentment. Right?

15
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,510
Now our common enemy is Cangliu.

16
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,720
Young Master, do you want to accept Crown Prince Zhen Lan's offer?

17
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,240
The collaboration that I want

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,660
isn't to exchange one seal for another.

19
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,420
Then, what?

20
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,990
Brother Ice Cube. Brother Ice Cube.

21
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,630
Can you tell me how to help the Quanxian Tribe return to the Biluo Sea?

22
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,140
It's none of your business.

23
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,780
Is there anything I can help with? Tell me. I'll go do it.

24
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,700
The matters of our Quanxian Tribe, do not need other people's help.

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,890
I'm serious. I sincerely want to help you.

26
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,640
No. It's the whole Quanxian Tribe.

27
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,460
As long as I can do it, I'm willing to do anything—

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,370
You're a little girl from the Central Plains.

29
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,130
What can you do?

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,810
Since it chose me, that means I'm a little different from ordinary people. Right?

31
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,330
After all, I have the power to defeat Cangliu's Wind Falcons.

32
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,150
You're just an accessory holder.

33
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,370
That's the power of the heavenly ring, not yours.

34
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,500
But you need me, in order to use the power of the heavenly ring.

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,140
When Cangliu wanted to set the city on fire, it was me.

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,830
I was the one who unleashed the divine power of the heavenly ring.

37
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,650
I even defeated a Wind Falcon.

38
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,360
Don't always think I'm messing around.

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,110
Although my power is small, you can't ignore my good intentions.

40
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,810
You've done so much, it's all for Yan Xi. Right?

41
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,810
N-Not entirely.

42
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,690
Miss Na Sheng,

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,190
we're about to leave.

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,640
Go bid a proper farewell to Yan Xi.

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,910
What?

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,020
Sister Bai Ying! Sister Bai Ying!

47
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,050
Na Sheng, what's wrong?

48
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,760
Su Mo wants to leave with Yan Xi now, and he won't let me go with them.

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,510
Na Sheng, you're wearing the Heavenly Ring. Of course, you should come with us.

50
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,210
A'Ying and His Highness went to Taoyuan Province in order to get you.

51
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,760
I know.

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,210
Since I'm wearing the Heavenly Ring, I'll definitely complete the mission.

53
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,750
But if I go with Yan Xi, I'll delay your matters.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,690
If I go with you, I won't be able to see Yan Xi ever again.

55
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,010
My mind is not very smart.

56
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,150
Brother Crown Prince, do you have any way that I can satisfy both sides?

57
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,760
Help me think of a way.

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,640
There is a way.

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,510
But whether it'll succeed or not, I can't say.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,070
Who says you can't say? I'll go scold the person!

61
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,570
Why must the Kongsang people and Merpeople be separated?

62
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,840
What reasoning is there for that?

63
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,940
I-I know that with just the few of you, we might not be able to break the seals.

64
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,060
Su Mo is bringing along his tribe people, which will be even more dangerous, too.

65
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,750
Yan Xi. Yan Xi.

66
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,750
Also, since all of you knew each other from before,

67
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,850
why can't you all fight Cangliu together?

68
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,350
They're so bad!

69
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,410
Younger Sister Na Sheng,

70
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,350
there are some matters between Kongsang and Quanxian that you do not know of.

71
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,310
But I know Brother Ice Cube!

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,550
Although he appears cold all the time,

73
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,190
he saved us all in Taoyuan Province.

74
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,320
In my heart, I know he's a good person. Can you all not hate him?

75
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,400
Na Sheng, we don't hate him.

76
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,300
- Then, come with me to go see Brother Ice Cube, Sister Bai Ying.
- Na Sheng.

77
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,210
- A'Ying.
- Hong Yuan.

78
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,090
The Heavenly Ring chose Na Sheng for its own reason.

79
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,580
Young Master, no matter what you decide,

80
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,600
I'll support you.

81
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,790
You are Quanxian's hope.

82
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,550
I certainly won't disappoint everyone.

83
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,300
The elders are eagerly waiting for you to return to the great camp.

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,110
About sending spies to inquire for news,

85
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,770
you must do that first once you return to Taoyuan Province.

86
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,770
Although our people are all over the place, we are not connected.

87
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,840
After we obtain the information, it will be more convenient to carry out matters.

88
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,780
Yes, Young Master.

89
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,930
I'll definitely get it done.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,820
The danger from the battle in Taoyuan Province hasn't subsided.

91
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,940
If you return alone,

92
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,270
you should be extra cautious.

93
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,860
Young Master, take care. I'll take my leave now.

94
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,430
Hurry.

95
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm looking for Su Mo. We want to go fight Cangliu together.

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,150
Young Master needs to rest now. He's not—

97
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,620
It's fine.

98
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,650
Young Master.

99
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,790
Aunt Ru, be careful on your way there.

100
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,890
Yes.

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,110
Brother Ice Cube, I have lots of important things to talk about with you.

102
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,710
You can't just leave like this.

103
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,380
If you just leave like this, we'll never see each other again.

104
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,610
If we don't see each other again, there will be many, many problems.

105
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,970
Also, it'll be very dangerous to break that seal. Anyway, we need you.

106
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,110
- Brother Ice Cube—
- Na Sheng.

107
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,300
What's wrong, Sister Bai Ying?

108
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Let me chat with Su Mo alone.

109
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,510
Okay, okay. It's better if you speak to him. That'll be better.

110
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,560
Brother Ice Cube only listens to you.

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,320
Don't say nonsense.

112
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,670
Let's talk inside.

113
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,150
Sister Bai Ying, you must convince him.

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,800
The sun is so bright today. Why are you out again?

115
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,660
You two spoke already?

116
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,250
About what?

117
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,010
The collaboration between Kongsang and Quanxian.

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,910
He's probably told you that I still haven't agreed to it.

119
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,120
If you don't collaborate with Kongsang,

120
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,050
how do you plan on bringing Quanxian back to the Biluo Sea

121
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,590
and breaking the seal in the Entrapped Dragon Abyss?

122
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,320
You will encounter various difficulties along the way. Then you—

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,440
Are you concerned about me?

124
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,140
When we were in the hidden chamber,

125
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,280
did you have a backlash?

126
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,940
In order to take Quanxian back to the Biluo Sea,

127
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,210
what exact magic did you cultivate?

128
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,560
What exactly did you experience?

129
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,710
You still care about me.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,670
Right?

131
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,840
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

132
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,750
I care about you.

133
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,480
I also care about the 100,000 sleeping people of Kongsang.

134
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,700
I also hope Quanxian can return to the Biluo Sea.

135
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,430
You still don't understand.

136
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,940
What I want to know...

137
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,010
is your truest thoughts.

138
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,660
I want Wuse City to open.

139
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,140
I want the 100,000 people of Kongsang to wake up.

140
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,160
I hope Quanxian can return to the Biluo Sea.

141
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,600
Those are my thoughts.

142
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,160
Can't we go back to how it was before?

143
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,440
We can't go back.

144
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,810
We can't...

145
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,900
go back to the past.

146
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,120
Then let's not go back to the past.

147
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,250
How about a future with just you and me?

148
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,910
Su Mo,

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,220
don't say anymore.

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,230
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

151
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,390
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

152
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,940
I'm very happy to have met you again.

153
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,380
But between us,

154
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,540
it's impossible.

155
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:40,070
♫ When I want to return, it will be time for my dream to come true ♫

156
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,730
I understand.

157
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,620
Cangliu soldiers are powerful.

158
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,610
On top of that, there are the Wind Falcons.

159
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,560
Kongsang and Quanxian collaborating

160
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,220
will indeed lead to a better chance of winning.

161
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,880
But the grudge from a century ago,

162
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,820
even with an agreement,

163
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,730
we'll encounter various

164
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,190
betrayals and misunderstandings.

165
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,570
Even if that's the case,

166
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,250
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

167
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,620
do you want to collaborate?

168
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,990
♫ ...play the ancient chords ♫

169
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,600
I understand.

170
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,600
Everything will be as you wish.

171
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,710
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

172
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,330
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

173
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,520
Greetings, General.

174
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,930
- Xiang, ready?
- Yes.

175
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,640
But, General, how will we find them?
[Xiang - Quanxian Merperson]

176
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,700
The one who possesses the heavenly ring went with the Quanxian people.

177
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,260
That means they must have taken a water route.

178
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,710
Based on the direction they left the city, look for water routes and underground rivers

179
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,170
outside of Taoyuan Province. We can definitely find them this way.

180
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,910
Yes.

181
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,140
I wonder how the discussion between Su Mo and A'Ying is going.

182
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,800
Sister Hong Yuan, do you approve of a collaboration with Quanxian, too?

183
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,630
Setting aside prejudices, what His Highness said makes sense.

184
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,840
Collaborating is indeed the most beneficial decision for us.

185
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,220
But Su Mo and Princess Bai...

186
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,430
What about Su Mo and A'Ying?

187
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,540
A Kongsang person and a merperson together,

188
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,450
in the end, would...

189
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,060
I'm talking nonsense, Older Sister Hong Yuan, don't take it to heart.

190
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,610
Yes. A hundred years have already passed.

191
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,510
Many things have changed.

192
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,890
We are the only ones who are still waiting in our original places.

193
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,020
We were able to wait for the crown prince's awakening.

194
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,950
Next, whatever we are waiting for, will arrive.

195
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,380
Hong Yuan... Older Sister.

196
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,740
A'Ying, what did he say?

197
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,090
He didn't reject the offer.

198
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,720
Really?

199
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
That's great.

200
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,380
He's agreed.

201
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,900
But he didn't fully agree.

202
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,940
If he didn't reject the offer, that means he's agreed to it. Let's take it that he agreed.

203
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,220
Then let's discuss this at length.

204
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,530
Everyone, go back to your rooms and rest for now.

205
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,780
Your Highness.

206
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,130
Yes, that's right.

207
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,130
A'Ying, go and rest now.

208
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,490
A'Ying, what exactly is Su Mo thinking?

209
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,540
Su Mo is not against a collaboration

210
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,160
but he's worried that if Kongsang and Quanxian collaborate, there will still be feelings of animosity.

211
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,990
I'm afraid such a collaboration won't last long.

212
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,330
Even more so, we won't unsettle Cangliu.

213
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,840
His apprehensions are reasonable.

214
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,960
Then we must let him see that

215
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,880
we let go of any resentments long ago.

216
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,660
Go and rest.

217
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,950
- Let me walk on my own.
- All right.

218
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,170
Why is Young Master looking for us?

219
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,130
No idea.

220
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,360
Before Aunt Ru left, she told us to assist Young Master.

221
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,650
Young Master must have his reasons for the decisions he makes.

222
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,110
- Could it be that Young Master...
- What?

223
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,510
Xiang, what are you doing?

224
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,220
General, the map shows an underground river in a Taoyuan village.

225
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,850
They must be there. Everyone, listen to my order.

226
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,880
Reverse direction, ready the crossbows, and advance to the underground river.

227
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,530
Yes!

228
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,650
Young Master, Aunt Ru has left for Taoyuan Province.

229
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,980
Did you want to see us to discuss our return to the camp?

230
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,830
Yan Xi's injuries have improved. We can set out anytime.

231
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,730
Young Master, my injuries have improved.

232
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,190
I called you here to discuss some other matters.

233
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,520
I wonder what urgent matters you have.

234
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,710
My humble opinion is that our priority should be returning to camp as soon as possible.

235
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,350
- Ning Liang.
- Young Master, please forgive us.

236
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,420
Ning Liang is merely eager to return to camp.

237
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,890
The soldiers of the Quanxian camp all look forward to seeing you soon.

238
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,160
Naturally, we will return to the great camp.

239
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,170
I called you here because I want to know, in regards to breaking the Dragon Deity Seal,

240
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,890
defeating Cangliu, and returning to the Bilou Sea,

241
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,410
what different suggestions do you have?

242
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,820
I will follow your lead, Young Master.

243
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,010
The generals and soldiers of Quanxian will listen to your commands, Young Master.

244
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,220
What about you, Ning Liang?

245
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,990
I am the same as them.

246
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,280
If I want to collaborate with Kongsang,

247
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,290
what are your thoughts?

248
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,900
I wonder why you said this. The generals and soldiers of Quanxian have bitterly waited for a hundred years.

249
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,830
This outcome is not what we want to see.

250
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,420
What do the soldiers of Quanxian want to see?

251
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,280
They want to see the Emperor of the Sea lead us into battle,

252
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,950
break the Dragon Deity Seal, and defeat Cangliu.

253
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,760
How many generals and soldiers are there in Quanxian camp?

254
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,900
- More than 3,000.
- What weapons are there to use?

255
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,440
But now that you are back, everything will be different.

256
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
You are our hope.

257
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,010
Even though Young Master has divine powers, it'll still be hard to resist tens to hundreds of Wind Falcons attacking together.

258
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,330
In terms of military power, Quanxian indeed cannot match Cangliu.

259
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,360
The priority now is to break the Dragon Deity Seal in order to protect Quanxian with the power of

260
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,350
the dragon deity.

261
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,890
If we want to break the Dragon Deity Seal, we need to go to Jiuyu Mountain

262
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,050
to retrieve the Splitting Sword and cut off the chains trapping the dragon.

263
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,130
Only Kongsang people may enter Jiuyi Mountain.

264
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,020
If we have help from the Kongsang people, it may be easier.

265
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,800
Why would the Kongsang people help us?

266
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,320
What if they do?

267
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,780
Young Master, they will only use us,

268
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,560
just like what Prince Qing did a hundred years ago.

269
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,710
They need our help to obtain the Six Directions Seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

270
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,640
- As expected.
- Even so, this is beneficial to us.

271
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,690
You want to collaborate with Kongsang?

272
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,350
I just think this is a way.

273
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,490
This is a way...

274
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,280
but it's not the best.

275
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Of course, it's not a good idea to collaborate with Kongsang.

276
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,190
Trading a seal for another seal,

277
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,520
this is called making a deal.

278
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,490
The best kind of collaboration is to form an alliance with Kongsang.

279
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,930
- Alliance?
- An alliance with Kongsang?

280
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,320
Based on the current strengths of Quanxian and Kongsang,

281
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,370
neither one, fighting alone, is a match for Cangliu.

282
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,250
Only an alliance to gain more power will give us a chance to defeat Cangliu

283
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,360
and return peace to Yunhuang.

284
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,530
But how do you form an alliance with resentments towards each other at heart?

285
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,490
That's why I called you here to discuss this.

286
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,130
Even if we don't mention the grievances from a century ago,

287
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,740
won't the people of Kongsang bring it up?

288
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,360
Go take a look.

289
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,440
Listen to my order. Strike the barrier. Release the arrows.

290
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,880
- What's going on?
- It must be Cangliu troops attacking the barrier.

291
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,830
How long can this barrier last?

292
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,610
If they're using the Wind Falcons to attack, it won't last for long.

293
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,450
This won't do. We have insufficient armed forces, and there are some who are injured.

294
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,480
I fear we can't resist them.

295
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,130
Notify the soldiers of Quanxian to use the water route to evacuate.

296
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,360
We can use the water route, but what will you do?

298
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,330
Us?

299
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,590
We can only fight to the death.

300
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,120
Look! The barrier is cracking.

301
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,610
Everyone, follow me.

302
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,870
Su Mo, Cangliu is menacingly bearing down on us.

303
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,230
- You all are weak against fire so leave first.
- Hurry and leave!

304
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,910
You can't see sunlight so you won't be able to hang on for long either.

305
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,290
Before, you said Kongsang and Quanxian going against Cangliu together will result in a better chance of winning.

306
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,520
Why not use this battle as an example

307
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,190
and see what our odds of winning are?

308
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,830
I'll protect Na Sheng and His Highness.

309
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,680
Su Mo, no matter what, you must protect Na Sheng and His Highness.

310
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,270
No, we can't leave you here.

311
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,280
- Your Highness, leave now.
- No.

312
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,550
- Leave now.
- Leave with His Highness now.
- A'Ying!

313
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,660
This way.

314
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,710
General, they seemed to have escaped.

315
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,790
Don't worry. They won't be able to escape.

316
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,890
I have placed barriers over all the water routes in Taoyuan Province.

317
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,370
- What's wrong?
- There's a barrier here. It must have been placed by the Cangliu people.

318
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,760
Let's go.

319
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,550
- What's going on?
- This barrier is specifically designed for merpeople.

320
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,570
What do you mean?

321
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,300
- This is Kongsang's spell.
- Kongsang?

322
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,570
If they can't get in from here,

323
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,860
why don't we go back to chase the Cangliu people away with Sister Bai Ying?

324
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,860
We have you and the Heavenly Ring in my hands. We might be able to.

325
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Those below, listen. If you continue to not disarm and surrender,

326
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,800
I will burn down the entire mountain.

327
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,540
I found a way to break the barrier,

328
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,620
but I don't have sufficient powers yet. I fear it'll be hard for me to do it.

329
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,890
Su Mo, can you share some of your powers with me?

330
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,540
No, Young Master! If you supply your magic power to him,

331
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,620
- what if—
- As I already said, our current common enemy is Cangliu.

332
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,760
I won't treat the lives of my tribe as child's play.

333
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,010
You also won't betray the 100,000 people of your Kongsang.

334
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,320
- Give it a try.
- Thank you.

335

Na Sheng, come here.

336

- Me?
- Come here!

337
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,200
Don't move.

338
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,490
The barrier has been broken.

339
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,200
- What's going on?
- Be careful.

340
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,670
Be careful.

341

343
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,710
But I can't swim. Won't I drown if I go in?

344
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,150
Come here.

345
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,020

- I'm going to retrieve them.

Look, there's no water.

362
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,570
Yan Xi, the Water Avoidance spell Su Mo cast on me was quite amazing.

363
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,890
Older Brother Crown Prince, is this Jing Lake?

364
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,450
Do you really live down there?

365
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,380
Yes. This is Jing Lake.

366
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,280
For thousands of miles, boats cannot pass through and birds will sink if they fly over it.

367
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,710
Then if we hide in there, we won't be afraid of the Cangliu people coming.

368
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,510
That is how it works. However, you are not a Kongsang person,

369
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,690
so you can't enter Wuse City.

370
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,870
I do know a very secretive place.

371
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:42,390
If you stay there alone, I'm worried...

372
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,520
Na Sheng, come with me, I will protect you.

373
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,500
I don't want to.

374
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,230
You can't go to Wuse City or the Quanxian camp. You can only come with me.

375
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,470
Na Sheng, the view at that place is especially great.

376

Moreover, General Xi Jing can go hunting for wild chickens for you.

Su Mo, I will ask you directly.

386
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,770
Do you have your response to a collaboration between Kongsang and Quanxian?

387
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,810
I decline.

388
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,760
Since that is the case, we shall part ways.

389
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,360
- A'Ying, let's go.
- Hold on.

390
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,560
I decline a collaboration where we use one seal to trade for another seal.

391
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,580
- Then you're saying...
- I hope Kongsang and Quanxian can form an alliance.

392
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,000
Are you saying that you're willing to not only help us obtain the seal from the Ghost and Deity Abyss,

393
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,540
but also obtain the other seal and go against Cangliu together?

394
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,160
That's right.

395
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,390
Fine. Kongsong will not break our promise.

396
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,460
We will surely help you release the dragon deity.

397

Then the powers of the dragon deity, heavenly ring, and earth ring will unite

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,160
is the power of the dragon deity.

477
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,530
This is also the wish of everyone in the Quanxian army.

478
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,260
Countless Quanxian soldiers

479
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,590
willingly bled and died for that wish. We have

480
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,840
engraved their names on this Records of Heroic Souls

481
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,260
to let them personally witness

482
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,470
the day we return to the Bilou Sea.

483
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,490
Young Master, please.

484
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,970
Welcome back, Emperor of the Sea.

485
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:29,880
- Welcome back, Emperor of the Sea.
 - Welcome back, Emperor of the Sea.

486
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,580
Rise.

487
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,860
Seven thousand years ago, Master Ming Huo left a divination.

488
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,170
A man with a mark of a dragon on his back will bring back the power of the dragon deity.

489
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,700
Now, we had finally awaited your return.

490
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,040
Then I shall hand this to you.

491
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,960
This is?

492
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,600
This is the ice crystal left by Master Ming Huo.

493
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,210
You can use this to summon the master

494
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,410
and ask her

495
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,890
to interpret fate and determine the future of Quanxian.

496
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,210
Young Master, you must take revenge for Quanxian.

497
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,880
We currently have little manpower and are weak.

498
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,590
What can we use to go against the powerful Cangliu?

499
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,240
That's why I want to break the dragon deity's seal.

500
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,910
I have already decided to form an alliance with Kongsang.

501
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:38,240
They can help us to unlock the dragon deity's seal.

502
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,920
We will help them to retrieve the Six Directions Seal.

503
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,570
Then we'll join forces to oppose Cangliu.

504
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,780
Young Master, you want to join forces with Kongsang?

505
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,020
Only a hundred years ago, we witnessed the people of Kongsang breaking their promise.

506
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,400
If we don't defeat Cangliu now,

507
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,610
it will be very hard for both Kongsang and Quanxian to regain our peaceful lives.

508
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,540
Do we still want to live like this, resigned to these circumstances?

509
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,200
How could we be willing to live like this?

510
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,320
- But—
- Elder Yu, I did consider the concerns you have.

511
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,460
But if we don't join forces now,

512
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,160
we will miss the best opportunity to oppose Cangliu for no reason.

513
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,790
To Quanxian, Kongsang, and even Yunhuang,

514
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,550
this alliance is a good thing.

515
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,330
Since Young Master has already thought this through,

516
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,080
we won't say any more.

517
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,480
I just hope when we join forces,

518
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
Young Master will make more preparations for Quanxian

519
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,050
so we have no regrets in the future.

520
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,480
Thank you, Elder Yu, for your advice.

521
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,870
[Quanxian Great Camp - Water Chamber]

522
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,860
Emperor of the Sea, you have finally shown up.

523
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,910
Master Huo Ming greets Emperor of the Sea.

524
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,420
Master? You know me?

525
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,610
On the eve of the destruction of Quanxian,
[Ming Huo - Quanxian Rituals Master]

526
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,570
I performed a divination.
[Ming Huo - Quanxian Rituals Master]

527
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,230
The next Emperor of the Sea would appear 7,000 years later.

528
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,790
That would be the beginning of all your pains.

529
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,180
However, for you, everything begins

530
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,250
after the end.

531
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,890
[Every beginning starts with an end. The only way to fight the void is through creation and protection.]

532
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,110
So, Na Sheng's divination wasn't a child's game.

533
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,300
7,000 years ago,

534
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,120
my fate had already been engraved on the Wheel of Life.

535
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:42,520

♫ We've met several times ♫

543

♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

544
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:24,280
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫
