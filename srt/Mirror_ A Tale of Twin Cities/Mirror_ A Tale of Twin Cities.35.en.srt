[Episode 35]

3
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Ya Ren, are you transforming?

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,200
Chun Huang, I made a mistake.

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Ya Ren, tell me quickly.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,200
Who exactly is this person?

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,710
Ya Ren, don't be sad.

8
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,000
Although you cannot be with him,

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,200
you'll still need to take good care of yourself.

10
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,400
I know, Bai Wei.

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Oh, yes! How is Chun Huang?

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Ever since we parted, Chun Huang has changed greatly.

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,600
He used to hate dealing with Quanxian's affairs most.

14
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Now, that's all he is concerned about.

15
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,800
But Quanxian is so much more prosperous than Kongsang now.

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
It's all thanks to Chun Huang.

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,970
But he only thinks about Quanxian.

18
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,200
He still hasn't married a queen.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,000
He has transformed, too? What kind of woman is she?

20
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,290
That woman...

21
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,200
He lost her after all.

22
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,180
What a pity.

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,400
However, I still want to go to Dragon Silk Palace to take a look.

24
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,000
You will always be the most welcomed visitor to Quanxian.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
Chun Huang...

26
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,400
We will all miss you.

27
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,300
Bai Wei, I'm leaving now.

28
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,800
Why don't you stay here tonight and rest well?

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Are you drinking by yourself?

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,400
His Majesty asked me to send this over.

31
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,800
His Majesty said this is the queen's favorite.

32
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,000
A'Lang knows everything about me.

33
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,100
Bai Wei, it's not good to drink wine on an empty stomach.

34
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,800
How about this?

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll drink with you another day. How about it?

36
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
[Wine]

37
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,380
- Your Majesty.
- How is Princess Ya Ren?

38
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,150
She talked with the queen for a while and then went to rest in the side hall.

39
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,280
There was nothing out of the ordinary.

40
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,900
Keep an eye on her.

41
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,600
Other than that, is there any talk inside or outside the palace about the Quanxian envoy?

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
All the city's residents were present for this visit.

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Everyone commented that they had never seen such precious and exotic treasures.

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,400
They all felt it was quite a feast for the eyes.

45
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Did the six princes say anything?

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
I attended tonight's banquet and heard the discussion among the six princes.

47
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
Among them, Prince Qing was outspoken about the alliance.

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,900
Prince Qing believes Quanxian is acting friendly on the surface but it's actually a provocation.

49
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,200
Quanxian is more prosperous than Kongsang.

50
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Kongsang has established a capital city, but the treasury is empty.

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Your Majesty is highly skilled, but the Emperor of the Sea is wiser.

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
What else did Prince Qing say?

53
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Prince Qing also said that if you can agree to his request

54
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,700
to attack Quanxian...

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Your Majesty, the queen...

57
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
What's the matter with A'Wei?

58
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,300
The queen is unconscious from poisoning.

59
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
What?

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,280
She treats you as if you were her own sister.

61
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,400
You actually tried to poison her.

62
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,700
That's truly vicious!

63
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
Why are you laughing?

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
I've never thought of harming Sister Bai Wei.

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
What I want is your life!

66
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,500
You are the one who delivered the poisoned wine to her.

67
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
You want to kill me?

68
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,800
- Feeling remorseful?
- Yes?

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,400
I regret that I saved you back then.

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,400
These years, you've been fighting battles in Yunhuang.

71
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
On the surface, it's for securing peace in Yunhuang.

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,000
But everything you do cannot cover up your wolf-like ambition.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
After the six divisions, you eyed Quanxian.

74
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,800
You've been jealous that my older brother has been in Bai Wei's heart.

75
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
Furthermore, you covet Quanxian's wealth.

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Shut up!

77
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm jealous? I covet?

78
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,200
Don't you know it yourself?

79
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Your gaze has already changed.

80
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,500
You are not the same person that I knew years ago.

81
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
It's you who has changed instead!

82
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Returning to what? You want to steal my queen!

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What alliance? You just want to show my incapability.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,800
And now, you want to kill me.

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,200
I hate you. I wish I could die with you.

86
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
The ancient powers are in my hands.

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,200
Within the seven seas, Yunhuang and the universe belong to me.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
I'll let you take a good look...

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
to see how I'll trample Quanxian.

90
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,300
Queen! Queen, no good!

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,600
His Majesty has led the troops to Biluo Sea to ask for an explanation.

92
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,700
What did you say?

93
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,600
His Majesty said that Princess Ya Ren poisoned you.

94
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,900
He wants...

95
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,000
Nonsense.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,700
Why would Ya Ren poison me?

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Go... Go bring my armor.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Queen, you just woke up.

99
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,200
Hurry!

100
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,430
I have to stop A'Lang. I must stop him.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,600
Emperor of the Sea, Kongsang's king has reached the edge of Biluo Sea.

103
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,000
He said... He said that Princess Ya Ren poisoned Queen Bai Wei.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,500
He said he wanted to trample Quanxian as revenge for the queen.

105
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,400
If he wants a crusade, why would he dispatch a nameless army?

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,100
Emperor of the Sea, this is the last year that the dragon deity is changing his bones.

107
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,600
Without the dragon deity's protection, we are unable to fight back.

108
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Besides, he wields the power of Heaven.

109
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
- Meet the battle.
- Yes.

110
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,100
Lang Gan, I told you that day.

111
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,200
To keep peace in Yunhuang,

112
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,600
why do you continue to wage battles everywhere?

113
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
You've betrayed your promise.

114
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,500
Kill him. Kill him.

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,510
You are wrong.

116
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,800
Possessing strong powers will not bring disaster.

117
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,400
The current plight of Quanxian...

118
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,200
is because of your desires.

119
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,200
What do you mean?

120
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,400
My ancestors lived in Dragon Silk Palace for generations.

121
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Even though we've been protected by the dragon deity, we've never waged war on anyone.

122
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,200
But you love a woman who you aren't supposed to love.

123
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
You even tried to grab her away from my side.

124
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Bai Wei told me, she asked you to send a letter to me.

125
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,100
But...

126
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,600
I never received any letter.

127
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,800
When I arrived at Dragon Silk Palace,

128
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,100
you even had Ya Ren trap me.

129
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,000
But this time,

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
you even had her use poison.

131
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
What exactly is your intention?

132
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,600
Bai Wei asked me to send the letters.

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I indeed hesitated.

134
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
But I did send the letters.

135
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,400
You say Ya Ren used poison,

136
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,800
I know nothing about it.

137
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,100
That's true, I do love Bai Wei.

138
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,000
But I never thought of grabbing her.

139
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,810
Even more, I never thought of harming her.

140
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,480
I've never even expressed to her how much I love her...

141
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,830
because I knew you were the only one

142
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,480
she loves.

143
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,230
If I hadn't arrived just in time,

144
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,980
you would've kept her by your side. Right?

145
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,240
You can't have her

146
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,430
and you can't stand that I'm at peace with her.

147
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,720
That's just your excuse for seizing Quanxian.

148
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,500
Lang Gan, I thought that you were pure and good natured and could suppress the demonic nature to conquer,

149
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
but you've already lost your mind.

150
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,010
You're not who you were before.

151
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,680
Kill him!

152
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,150
No matter who I become,

153
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,390
I'll do anything for Bai Wei.

154
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,860
I can share the world with her.

155
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,280
But I can't let you...

156
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,960
be in her life anymore.

157
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,400
A'Wei, why are you pointing your sword towards me?

158
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,050
Why are you doing this?

159
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,580
I wanted to confront him for you.

160
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,360
Confront him for me?

161
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,900
You're talking about Ya Ren poisoning me?

162
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,820
Then let me ask you. Why do you think Ya Ren would poison me?

163
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,190
- She…
- Let me ask you again.

164
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,200
Yunhuang has been quiet for years.

165
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,490
It takes time to set off an army.

166
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,200
How could you lead an army to attack Quanxian

167
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,040
as soon as I was poisoned?

168
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,480
Lang Gan, you've been planning to seize Quanxian all along.

169
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,010
Everything about Ya Ren poisoning her, is just an excuse of yours.

170
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,480
Ya Ren is kindhearted. She would never do such a thing.

171
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,390
Shut up!

172
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,210
A'Lang!

173
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,800
You don't trust me.

174
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
I would definitely trust

175
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,940
the you from before.

176
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,190
But you've changed.

177
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,370
Kongsang is what it is today because of Chun Huang's help.

178
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,220
You're returning their kindness with ingratitude.

179
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,590
His help?

180
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,270
He clearly had other ideas!

181
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,620
Why did you become like this?

182
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,130
Why does the world seem so evil to you?

183
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,570
Whether it's me or Ya Ren,

184
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,450
we're just excuses for you to conquer Quanxian.

185
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,540
Do you even remember that the Splitting Sword was given to us by Chun Huang

186
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,520
when you raised it?

187
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,240
It's for us to live in peace and to protect Yunhuang.

188
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,080
We've already achieved our original goal.

189
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,600
But what about you? You still don't want to put away the sword.

190
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,850
You'd rather listen to Prince Qing's bad advice.

191
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,260
You even pointed your sword at Quanxian!

192
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,580
And made a vain attempt to seal the dragon deity.

193
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,760
Have you gone insane?

194
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,390
Without the protection of the dragon deity,

195
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:34,630
generations will start obeying.

196
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,150
There'll be no more rebellion.

197
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,740
If you kill Quanxian today,

198
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,180
Kongsang will be destroyed by others in the future.

199
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,950
When will this never-ending cycle stop?

200
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,030
What are you doing?

201
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,440
You're no longer the kind astrologer A'Lang

202
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,830
that I grew up with.

203
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,300
You're now the Heavenly King I don't recognize.

204
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,510
I'm giving you back this Earth Ring.

205
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,520
The Earth Ring belongs to the queen.

206
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,540
You can't just take it off when you want!

207
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,040
You're Kongsang's queen.

208
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,240
You're my queen!

209
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,530
But now you're betraying me for an outsider.

210
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,870
Heaven, Earth,

211
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,240
the seven seas, and Yunhuang.

212
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,370
I'm sharing it all with you, but why are you doing this?

213
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,060
How can Heaven and Earth...

214
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,160
belong to us alone?

215
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,980
A'Lang, come to your senses.

216
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,320
Stop this.

217
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,750
A'Wei.

218
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,740
Why do you have to betray me?

219
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,790
Because of him?

220
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,060
If I kill Chun Huang,

221
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,510
all of this will come to an end.

222
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,490
Bai Wei belongs to me alone.

223
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,400
Why is this happening?

224
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,720
This illusion trapped all three of us in here.

225
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,180
If I don't wake up,

226
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,030
the Splitting Sword will kill Bai Ying

227
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,020
like it killed Queen Bai Wei 7,000 years ago.

228
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,510
I must wake up!

229
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,260
Bai Ying.

230
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,110
Wake up.

231
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,260
Bai Ying, wake up.

232
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,050
What's going on with her?

233
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,800
She must still be stuck in the illusion.

234
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,190
Bai Wei.

235
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,620
Bai Ying.

236
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,900
- Su Mo.
- You're finally awake.

237
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,700
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

238
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,660
Earlier I got sucked in by a ray of light.

239
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,120
Then the Splitting Sword was in my hands

240
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,460
and I was holding the Splitting Sword

241
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,220
while I was with you in the peaceful Yunhuang.

242
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,120
You saw the illusion, too?

243
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,090
Do you know about anything that happened in the illusion?

244
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,910
Previously, at the Heavenly King's tomb in Jiuyi,

245
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,420
I imagined the scene before Queen Bai Wei died.

246
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,000
But I didn't know that I was the one who stabbed her.

247
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,960
No, Lang Gan.

248
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,820
Why didn't you tell us you saw that scene from our illusions?

249
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,070
And why did you come here so suddenly?

250
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,690
- I looked at the parchment paper over and over again after you left.
- What did you notice?

251
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,960
These words were written on the paper,

252
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,820
"It's the day to meet with the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

253
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,930
You take off the ring and I return alone.

254
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,510
I'm depressed all day, my only hope is for you to return.

255
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,190
I'm filled with sadness and sorrow."

256
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,090
I didn't think anything was strange at the time,

257
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,180
but I felt more uneasy the more I read it.

258
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,890
Especially the words "You take off the ring."

259
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,680
So I thought that the history of the Stranded Dragon Abyss must've been a complicated one

260
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,800
and I rushed over here.

261
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,510
But I didn't expect to almost hurt you both.

262
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,840
What we saw in the illusion…

263
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,230
Perhaps they weren't illusions, but the truth.

264
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,690
Didn't you say there's been a pair of eyes watching us?

265
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,080
Perhaps that pair of eyes...

266
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,880
is the person who brought us into the illusion.

267
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,240
You mean, that pair of eyes are...

268
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,090
Queen Bai Wei.

269
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,280
The illusion from just now almost made the three of us

270
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,670
kill ourselves. Let's hurry to find the Stranded Dragon Rope.

271
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,240
Isn't the Stranded Dragon Rope over there?

272
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,540
Where is the Stranded Dragon Rope?

273
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,730
Here is the Stranded Dragon Abyss. How can this barrier

274
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,260
stop the Fire Formation?

275
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,530
Maybe this Stranded Dragon Rope is like the Xuan Huang Scripture.

276
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,650
Only you can see it.

277
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,370
I'll try it then.

278
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,780
You still came before me.

279
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,970
You're not too late.

280
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,810
If it weren't for those Quanxian soldiers making trouble,

281
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,290
I would've been here a long time ago.

282
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,840
What have you done to them?

283
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,910
Have you heard of the poison called Algae of Red Ghost?

284
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,220
It's now spread all over the water channels in the Cangwu Province.

285
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,650
No one can escape from it.

286
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,140
Also, your Commissioner of the Left Yan Xi.

287
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,720
Guess if he is dead or alive now,

288
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,530
including your spy, Xiao.

289
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,590
You're despicable.

290
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,600
Do you really think I'd forever be deceived by you?

291
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,870
Su Mo, hurry and undo the seal.

292
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,740
Leave this person to me.

293
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,470
Your Majesty.

294
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,250
Don't worry. I can handle it.

295
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,290
I'd like to see how fierce the Crown Prince of Kongsang is.

296
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,340
[Stranded Dragon Platform]

297
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,430
The dragon deity that's been sealed for thousands of years will finally see the sun again.

298
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,480
The Stranded Dragon Rope has been untied.

299
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,730
Why isn't the dragon deity out yet?

300
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,090
The dragon deity is right under us.

301
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,500
It turns out that the reef around the Stranded Dragon Abyss is the dragon deity.

302
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,750
Why hasn't the dragon deity come out after the Stranded Dragon Rope was cut?

303
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,940
Dragon Deity! I am Emperor of the Sea!

304
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,890
I'm here to save you.

305
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,030
Maybe it's not enough to cut the Stranded Dragon Rope?

306
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,540
What must really be done to save the dragon deity?

307
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,730
I've been waiting for you a long time.

308
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,040
Kongsang has already been destroyed and you've just come.

309
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,730
Queen Bai Wei.

310
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,780
I've remained in the Stranded Dragon Abyss for 7,000 years

311
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,950
thanks to the Earth Ring on your hand.

312
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,940
When I see you,

313
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,890
it's like seeing how we were all those years ago.

314
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,070
What exactly were those illusions we saw?

315
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,670
Everything you saw was true.

316
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,730
They are recollections

317
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,170
about Chun Huang, Lang Gan, and myself from 7,000 years ago.

318
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,640
Whenever I thought of how Lang Gan was back then,

319
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,480
I couldn't believe that my memory was genuine.

320
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,580
Jealousy and ambition can expand the darkness in man.

321
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,810
It will make one crazy.

322
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:28,190
Attacking Quanxian, sealing Biluo Sea,

323
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,230
making generations of Quanxian leave their home,

324
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,370
fortitude became stubbornness, love became possessiveness.

325
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,670
Those originally good attributes in Lang Gan's personality

326
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,260
unknowingly became twisted.

327
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,700
He became someone that I didn't recognize.

328
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,610
Ever since he found you in Biluo Sea, from that time on,

329
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,210
everyone's fate was changed.

330
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,660
It's an undeniable fate that made us start this journey.

331
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,170
For Yunhuang, I wanted safety.

332
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,870
But he wanted to control, to conquer.

333
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,120
Then we carried swords to walk in the battle fire,

334
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,460
it was predetermined that we would walk to two separate destinations.

335
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,090
Is fate really undeniable?

336
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,980
It's opened.

337
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,710
This water mirror...

338
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,180
Bai Wei...

339
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,950
Do you still want to get out?

340
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,190
A'Wei...

341
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,960
According to the Huang Xuan Scripture, the Splitting Sword can undo the dragon deity's seal.

342
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,180
But now, the Stranded Dragon Rope is already broken, why isn't the dragon deity coming?

343
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,790
There are two seals on the dragon deity.

344
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,770
The first one was set up by A'Lang.

345
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,880
It's this Stranded Dragon Rope.

346
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,150
In order to trap the dragon deity in the Stranded Dragon Abyss forever,

347
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,370
there is another seal that was set up by me.

348
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,340
When A'Lang was sealing the dragon deity,

349
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,040
I feared the dragon deity would be destroyed.

350
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,120
So I used half of the Earth Ring's power to make a seal for the dragon deity

351
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,640
to protect it forever. The other half of the power

352
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,480
was kept inside your Earth Ring.

353
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,890
Bai Wei.

354
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,810
How did this happen?

355
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,100
I didn't do it on purpose.

356
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,770
A'Wei, why?

357
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,580
I wish to die without my eyes closed

358
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,620
so that I can see you die someday.

359
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,480
Bai Wei, don't talk now.

360
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,700
A'Wei, I didn't do it deliberately.

361
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,060
I... I...

362
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,850
It's all because of Chun Huang.

363
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,840
Without him,

364
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,820
you would have been my queen forever.

365
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,970
Right! It's him.

366
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,360
It's he who is at fault.

367
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,150
I'll kill him.

368
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,100
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

369
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,880
Chun Huang, I can't release the dragon deity.

370
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,740
But I will protect the dragon deity for you.

371
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,650
As long as the dragon deity still exists,

372
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,040
Quanxian will not be destroyed.

395

Queen Bai Wei, what can we do

396
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,280
to release the dragon deitiy?

397
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,580
Follow me!

398
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,760
Put your hand on it.

399
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,540
I still can't open it.

400
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,270
Focus.

401
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:24,110
Condense your power into the Earth Ring.

402
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,880
Watch out!

403
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,510
I have endured so much suffering for hundreds of years.

404
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,110
I can't let go of that sword.

405
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,810
Dragon Deity of Quanxian, we finally meet again.

406
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,830
Seven thousand years already.

407
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,550
We've finally reached this moment when I can undo your seal.

408
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,440
I am here to correct the mistake made those years ago.

409
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,050
The dragon deity is angry.

410
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,410
It must still remember

411
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,540
that Chun Huang took the dragon tooth for my sake originally.

412
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,640
Then what should I do now?

413
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,320
Undo the seal and let the dragon deity fly out.

414
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,920
Queen Bai Wei, please let me borrow your power so that I can release the dragon deity.

415
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,890
I naturally will let you borrow the power.

416
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,140
Only you will be able to do this.

417
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,950
You used half of the spirit sense to open the Wuse City.

418
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,700
But with your physical body now,

419
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,450
you have to pay a huge price to obtain my power

420
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:20,400
by sacrificing your most precious thing.

421
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,230
Are you willing?

422
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,890
Did I just get poisoned by Yu Huan's Algae of Red Ghost?

423
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:40,160
No matter what, I will agree for Quanxian and for Su Mo.

424
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,650
Let's not continue the regrets and mistakes from the past.

425
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,850
Queen Bai Wei, I'm ready.

426
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,590
All right.

427
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,210
My descendant.

428
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,040
You already have all of my power.

429
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,850
Hurry and release the dragon deity.

430
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,220
Let the dragon deity acknowledge the Emperor of the Sea as master.

431
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,010
I will dissipate, too.

432
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,620
Kongsang, and also Yunhuang,

433
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,930
will be left to both of you.

434
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,890
A'Wei.

435
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,440
You actually want to transfer to me.

436
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,000
The dragon deity's seal is about to be undone.

437
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,050
Hurry and climb up there to kill Su Mo.

438
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,910
Why am I always the one

439
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,160
who is abandoned and harmed?

440
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,370
Why?

441
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,390
Bai Ying!

442
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:47,060
Bai Ying, what have you done just now?

443
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,150
To release the seal on the dragon deity,

444
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,300
this is the only way.

445
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,340
Years ago, Heavenly King sealed the dragon deity.

446
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,030
So now, it should be me, a descendant of Queen Bai of Kongsang,

447
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,190
who undoes the seal.

448
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,170
