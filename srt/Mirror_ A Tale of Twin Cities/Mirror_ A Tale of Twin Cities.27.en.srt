[Episode 27]

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,460
The Heavenly Ring seems to sense something.

4
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,560
It should be right in there.

5
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,160
I've found it.

6
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,030
Why won't the door open? Is it a trap?

7
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,170
It doesn't look like a trap.

8
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,210
Why is that?

9
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,590
I don't know.

10
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,890
It must be blocked from the inside.

11
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,230
Let me do it.

12
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,620
Your Highness, let me do it.

13
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,520
This tunnel does look strange.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,250
How are you going to do it?

15
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,830
Xi Jing, ever since we got to Jiuyi Mountain,

16
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,970
you've been shielding me at every moment.

17
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,020
Look at you. You're ready to die at any time.

18
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,830
If you keep doing this, I'll really be mad at you.

19
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,690
I don't want...

20
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,360
I don't want to see anyone else leave me.

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,760
- Your Highness.
- Enough.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
It's better that I do it.

23
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,220
No matter what, it's my ancestors lying inside.

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,900
They should at least protect their descendants, right?

25
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,060
Na Sheng, come here.

26
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,620
I-I'm still upset.

27
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,380
Na Sheng.

28
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,400
It's all right.

29
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,300
Na Sheng, I couldn't control my emotions just now.

30
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,940
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,040
I know.

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,740
Brother Crown Prince,

33
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,400
to you, the hundred thousand people are important.

34
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,070
But in my heart, I only have Sister Bai Ying.

35
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,680
That's why... we must hurry up.

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,940
Maybe we'll still have a chance to save them.

37
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,920
You only have one sister Bai Ying.

38
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,350
I only have one Princess Bai.

39
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,540
I won't stand by and watch her die.

40
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,290
Therefore...

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,730
Therefore, I know that this is not the time to fuss.

42
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,610
Good, Na Sheng.

43
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,370
Everyone else, move aside.

44
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,050
Everyone, remember.

45
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,910
There are many mechanisms in the tomb.

46
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,910
You must be careful.

47
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,350
Is that water above us?

48
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,580
This place is under weak water, so that should be the Ruo River.

49
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,480
Why doesn't the water come down here?

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,490
There's a barrier set up above. Otherwise, the tomb wouldn't have been established under the water.

51
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,680
Li Zhu!

52
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,830
- Your Highness.
- Follow her and take a look. Be careful.

53
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,430
Yes.

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,760
What happened to Li Zhu?

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,960
Don't worry about her for now. We must find the seal.

56
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Na Sheng!

57
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,150

Brother Crown Prince, someone just...

76

someone just abducted me. He also wanted to take my ring!

77
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,330
All right now. It's fine.

78
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,470
Why did they want your ring?

79
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,820
I don't know either. Just that he was pulling my hands.

80
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,280
And then I passed out.

81
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,930
Get up.

82
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,120
What is this place?

83
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,140
The Heavenly King's tomb.

84
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,530
Huh?

85
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,470
What is this?

86
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,630
It's the Heavenly King's coffin.

87

Oh yes! It's right here, right here.

88
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,720
He dragged me into this place.

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,070
And the closer I got, the more the Heavenly Ring would start to shine.

90
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,500
Why doesn't the Heavenly Ring shine anymore?

91
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,440
What's going on?

92

Someone's opened it already.

This is the Heavenly King's tomb. How can someone have moved the coffin already?

103
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,400
When you open the coffin, life and death will overlap;

104
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,380
the starting point and the ending point overlap.

105
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,860
Everything will be reincarnated, just like the mirror's reflection.

Your Highness, are you all right?

107
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,070
What memory is this?

108
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,040
Why does the Heavenly King have my face?

109
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,790
Queen Bai Wei also looked identical to A'Ying.

110
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,330
Did someone kill Bai Wei?

111
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,050
Your Highness, what exactly did you see?

112
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,700
Bro-Brother Crown Prince, don't scare me. What's the matter?

113

I just saw the Heavenly King, he...

114

What's happening?

115
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,090
There is no Six Directions Seal in here.

116
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,090
The Heavenly King's skeletal remains aren't here either. This is an empty coffin.

117
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,010
Who was the one that abducted me just now then?

118
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,160
Who would be so daring?

119
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,740
Could it be... a treasure hunter?

120
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,390
That's not possible.

121

If it's really as Li Zhu said,

122
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,620
no one could have come here through the Life Death Pavilion all these years.

123
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,550
There's only one possibility.

124
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,600
It's someone from the inside.

125
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,380
Then, who was the person that abducted me just now?

126
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,280
It's a ghost! A ghost!

[Mountains and Rivers are Silent Forever]

128

Ever since we entered here, someone used the opportunity to abduct Na Sheng,

129
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,790
and then used Na Sheng's ring to open this coffin.

130
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,650
I keep feeling something is wrong.

131
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,230
This coffin's design looks like it's waiting for someone to open it.

[Mountains and Rivers are Silent Forever]

133

Who exactly was waiting? Who was supposed to open it?

134
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,480
It looks like there are other people in the tomb.

135
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,650
Their goal is also the Six Directions Seal.

Go take a look.

- Don't waste your strength!

I should have executed you all those years ago.

This is Heavenly King's tomb. How dare you to barge in!

146

I'd like to ask you who you are.

147
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,430
He's our Qing Clan's tomb keeper.

148

But why are you the only one here?

149
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,240
Over the past hundred years, the tomb keepers either ran away or died.

There aren't many of us left!

Even if it's for the Qing Clan, it's still for Kongsang!

[Memorial Tablets of the Deceased]

162
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,220
Where is the Six Directions Seal? Did you move the Heavenly King's skeletal remains?

163
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,630
Skeletal remains? Right from the start, there have never been any skeletal remains of the king.

164

where is Heavenly King's real body?

167
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,660
Watch out!

168
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,380
Don't go after him anymore. The Heavenly King's tomb is like an ants nest.

169
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,070
Without the map, even if Li Zhui were to guide us, we'd still get lost.

170
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,210
He's deliberately trying to lure us into the dark.

171
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,950
Who are you?

172
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,670
There seems to be someone inside. Everyone, be careful.

173
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,380
A'Ying? Su Mo?

174
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,900
You're... still alive.

175
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,660
What's happening?

176
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,720
Previously, at the Life and Death Pavilion,

177
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,860
the Splitting Sword could split the mist. I thought maybe it could split the Ruo River.

178
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,380
But...

179
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,490
We'd better hurry and meet up with the others.

180
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,220
Su Mo! Thank you.

181
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,330
What is there to thank me for?

182
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,360
From now on, don't say things like "sorry" and "thank you."

183
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,490
After we leave Jiuyi, I have something to tell you.

184
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,720
All right, I'll wait for you.

185
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,470
We saw light ahead of us, so we followed this passage over here and saw him.

186
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,380
Sister Bai Ying! This is great. You're both still alive!

187
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,440
You can't scare me like this anymore.

188
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,230
All right. I've made you worry.

189
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,880
- Don't worry. I'm fine.
- That's good.

190
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,440
I've let Your Highness worry.

191
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,660
I trust you've been well since we saw each other last, Su Mo.

192
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,670
A'Ying!

193
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,460
It's Prince Qing Chen!

194
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,580
Where is he? Who was that person?

195
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,190
Prince Qing Chen.

196
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,580
Didn't he die 100 years ago?

197
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,380
It appears that he's been living here for the past hundred years.

198
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,120
There was no news about him for a hundred years, it's because he's been subsisting in this tomb.

199
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,100
Your Highness, is that the Six Directions Seal?

200
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,520
Why isn't the Heavenly Ring reacting?

201
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,460
Run!

202
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,910
- Are you all right?
- You're injured!

203
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,600
It's fine. Come.

204
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,830
What happened, Brother Ice Cube? What's going on?

205
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,420
- That seal...
- That wasn't a seal.

206
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,220
Na Sheng's Heavenly Ring didn't light up.

207
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,030
It means that this was a trap set up by Qing Chen.

208
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,060
Where is the real seal then?

209
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,220
He must have it on him.

210
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,180
Be careful!

211
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,050
It's not safe here. Everyone, follow me.

212
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,660
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

213
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,930
I'll hold the door. Leave this way.

214
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,830
- Quick! Quick!
- Uncle Xi Jing!

215
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,410
- Sister Bai Ying! Sister Bai Ying!
- Hurry, let's go!

216
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,580
Where is my Perched Star Lamp? The Perched Star Lamp is still inside!

217
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll get it.

218
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,720
- Go!
- Hurry and go!

219
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,480
We're blocked here, too.

220
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,410
What do we do then? We've already been through the Life and Death Pavilion.

221
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,630
This is still a dead end.

222
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,310
How is it?

223
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,700
Thank you, Emperor of the Sea, for helping me retrieve the Perched Star Lamp.

224
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,240
The explosion injured him and also triggered a backlash.

225
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,100
I used the "Catching Turtles in the Urn" strategy.

226
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,730
What do you all think?

227
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,660
What's that voice?

228
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,350
Qing Chen.

229
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,870
The tomb is about to collapse.

230
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,970
None of you will survive. All of you will die here.

231
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,230
It looks like Qing Chen has activated all the mechanisms in the underground palace.

232
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,930
- It cannot be reversed.
- What will happen?

233
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,200
To protect against grave robbers, the mechanisms will shut all exits.

234
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,810
No one can get out.

235
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,770
The explosion of Qing Cheng's fake seal broke one of the foundations of the underground palace.

236
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,450
So the entire underground palace will probably collapse.

237
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,480
Li Zhu, you lured us to here.

238
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,510
You must have left yourself an exit. Where is it?

239
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,390
Let me try.

240
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,250
[Mountains and Rivers are Silent Forever]

241
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,160
[Mountains and Rivers are Silent Forever]

242
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
Why is it like this? This isn't possible. It's what he told me to do.

243
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,000
Who told you?

244
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,700
Qing Jun. He told me that when it's urgent, I can stick the Perched Star Lamp on the stone pillar.

245
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,580
Use the magic power to imitate the Silence word.

246
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,450
This way, the cave will open up a passageway to escape.

247
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,840
Qing Jun has never found a way to enter the Heavenly King's tomb.

248
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,880
How would he know how to get out?

249
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,220
That's right. Right from the start, he intended for you to be buried here.

250
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,330
Li Zhu, why did you lure us here?

251
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,070
What is the pact between you and Qing Jun?

252
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,380
Li Zhu.

253
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,120
Tell everyone.

254
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,920
Extinguish the light.

255
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,290
You told us earlier that this was your choice.

256
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,220
That's why I didn't expose you. But now that things are already like this,

257
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,500
are you still going to trust Qing Jun?

258
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,940
The Dark Golden Classics say

259
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,490
this tomb is equipped with extremely powerful techniques and barriers.

260
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,110
Only the Heavenly King's Perched Star Lamp can light this place up.

261
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,530
It also takes someone special to light the Perched Star Lamp.

262
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,360
Right, right! I couldn't make that lamp light up, but it does in her hands!

263
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,040
This light is...

264
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,470
the life of the lamp bearer.

265
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,660
So terrifying.

266
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,370
The longer the light is on, the the life of the bearer will be consumed.

267
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,500
You've been holding the lamp for a long time already. Even if you completed Qing Jun's mission,

268
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,280
you'd still die when the Perched Star Lamp goes out.

269
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,850
Li Zhu...

270
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,750
What on earth is it that you're willing to sacrifice your life for?

271
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,890
Li Zhu, do you really want to

272
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,230
give up your life for this light?

273
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,810
Qing Jun and I put on this act,

274
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,370
because Qing Jun promised me...

275
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,920
that as long as I lit the Perched Star Lamp,

276
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,670
led you all to the underpass

277
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,460
and killed Qing Chen,

278
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,120
he would set my family free.

279
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,710
He and I made a blood pact!

280
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,960
But he...

281
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,750
he actually planned from the beginning to have me buried here!

282
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,570
Why?

283
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,300
I've done everything I could,

284
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,600
I only wanted to be free.

285
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,060
Even if I have one day to live,

286
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,040
I still want to go back to the sea.

287
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,130
Sister Li Zhu. Sister Li Zhu, I'm sorry.

288
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,810
Before... Before, I made you angry.

289
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,790
I can destroy the lamp for you.

290
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,910
I can also kill Qing Jun and save your family.

291
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,710
Because in your veins is Quanxian blood,

292
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,060
I must bring you home.

293
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,310
Li Zhu, do you believe me,

294
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,030
yourself,

295
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,080
or Qing Jun?

296
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,460
It's up to you.

297
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,520
I believe you, Emperor of the Sea.

298
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,680
Thank you, Emperor of the Sea.

299
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,420
General, the rocks for sealing the gates have already been moved over here.

300
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,760
Hold on.

301
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,640
[Qing Chen - Kongsang's King of Jiuyi]

302
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,640
I don't know why you brought me here, what do you want to say?

303
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,830
General Yu Huan, please follow me to see someone.

304
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,860
Who?

305
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,440
The real King of Jiuyi.

306
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,200
Greetings, King of Jiuyi.

307
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,570
Yu Huan greets King of Jiuyi.

308
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,830
General, you've really lived up to your name.

309
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,460
You could tell the medicine was for me.

310
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,760
When I brought the medicine over,

311
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,870
Qing Jun didn't seem to care.

312
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,880
So I realized he wasn't the one needing the medicine.

313
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,270
Also, he wasn't familiar with the changes in Jiuyi Mountain.

314
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,400
The soldiers of the Qing Clan didn't really protect him, so I concluded

315
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,870
the real King of Jiuyi was someone else.

316
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,530
Lord Zhi Zhe sent you here alone.

317
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,030
Do you have any follow-up plans for catching Su Mo and Zhen Lan?

318
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,090
In my opinion, why don't we turn it around...

319
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,900
by luring them to the tomb?

320
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,710
Why?

321
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,360
It's hard to enter the Heavenly King's tomb

322
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,280
and it's even harder to get out of there.

323
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,100
Then let the Temple Guardian stay in the tomb and make them take the bait.

324
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,340
In my judgment, you should be the bait.

325
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,600
If someone else did it,

326
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,150
Su Mo likely wouldn't easily fall for it.

327
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,320
If you're worried, you can keep the Six Directions Seal with you.

328
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,660
If you have the Six Directions Seal, Su Mo won't do anything to you.

329
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,170
The Six Directions Seal...

330
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,020
is kept in the coffin, which can only be opened

331
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,540
with the Heavenly Ring.

332
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,780
Greetings, King of Jiuyi.

333
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,120
- King of Jiuyi?
- King of Jiuyi?

334
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,360
As you expected,

335
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,500
killing two birds with one stone and catching a turtle in an urn.

336
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,400
[Jiuyi Mountain - Left Peak]

337
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,180
Everyone, be ready for an ambush at this cliff.

338
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,160
- Yes!
- Hold on!

339
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,930
Who are you?

340
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,050
I'm a General of Cangliu, Fei Lian.

341
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,410
Nonsense. You dare to impersonate me?!

342
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,540
[Command Token]

343
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,040
I have Master Lang's Jialing token.

344
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,190
Who dares to disobey me?

345
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,700
It's real.

346
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,990
General, can we see your token?

347
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,140
You were that woman who threw herself at me!

348
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,090
Who's a woman? How dare you be so rude to me!

349
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,990
Arrest him!

350
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,710
What are you waiting for!

351
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,850
- Who should we listen to?
- You thief.

352
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,100
I'll catch you.

353
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,740
Captain, do we need to help out?

354
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,020
What for? Do you know who they are?

355
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,360
Why can't we break the barrier after trying so many things?

356
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,070
Weak water on top and souls below. This barrier

357
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,710
was reinforced by Kongsang's ancestors.

358
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,540
It's unbreakable; otherwise, weak water will flow down the barrier as it breaks

359
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,800
and ruin the Heavenly King's coffin and memorial tablets for the different kings.

360
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,730
What should we do then? We're not going to die here, are we?

361
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,690
Neither the Heavenly Ring nor the Sword of Light is of any use!

362
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,860
If we keep fighting like this, there won't be an end to it.

363
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,480
Why don't we go our separate ways? You look for Yu Huan and I'll go look for Young Master.

364
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,980
How does that sound?

365
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,900
Be careful.

366
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,550
Thank you.

367
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,340
The ground isn't shaking anymore.

368
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,780
Does it mean the mountain won't collapse?

369
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,420
What's going on?

370
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,350
What... What is it?

371
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,780
What's this?

372
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,620
Wait! It's Tu Luo. Don't hurt her.

373
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,820
Tu Luo?

374
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,460
This is Tu Luo?

375
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,370
She's a merperson, who saved me and Su Mo in the Misty Forest.

376
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,930
Greetings, Emperor of the Sea. I'm late.

377
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,360
How did you get hurt?

378
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,500
After the Misty Forest, I was ordered to look for Bai Lin.

379
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,910
I saw her and the General of Cangliu plotting something.

380
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,160
When she left alone, I caught her.

381
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,900
But she escaped after ripping up all the vines. I don't know her whereabouts.

382
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,950
You mean Lin'er? Why would she be so cruel?

383
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,380
Why would I lie to you?

384
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,110
Tu Luo, since you are able to get into the underground palace,

385
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,930
could you show us the way out?

386
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,640
It's you?

387
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,310
Miss Tu Luo, what's wrong?

388
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,710
Don't you remember me?

389
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,590
Have we met before?

390
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,720
I was mistaken. You couldn't possibly be him.

391
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,970
But... you...

392
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,430
you both look so much alike.

393
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,450
We... Who do we look like?

394
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,720
This is fate.

395
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,900
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

396
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,780
Turns out even garbage found its way in!

397
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,380
Li Zhu, you really deserve to die.

398
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,250
- Move aside.
- What are you doing?

399
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,800
It's not your turn to talk.

400
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,500
Emperor of the Sea, she's the one who tricked everyone into coming here!

401
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,990
Don't blame her.

402
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,530
She was deceived by Qing Jun, too.

403
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,270
You know the way down the mountain after I open the passage, right?

404
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,400
If you dare betray me, I will capture your father and brother and bring them to Misty Forest

405
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,310
and reduce them to the most pitiful monsters.

406
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,010
Emperor of the Sea, in a moment, I'll open a passage leading to the back of the mountain.

407
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,390
This way everyone will be able to leave Jiuyi Mountain.

408
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,920
All right.

409
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,930
Once the mechanism opens, it won't close.

410
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,250
Su Mo won't die that easily,

411
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,410
but we can't let him escape easily either.

412
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,120
Tu Luo!

413
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,760
Someone's casting a fire formation.

414
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,820
My vines holding the passage open have been scalded.

415
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,950
I can't hold on for long.

416
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,600
Yu Huan!

417
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,790
The tomb may collapse soon. Hurry, go!

418
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,660
I'm going to open the path. Follow me!

419
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,240
Yu Huan, what's wrong?

420
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,350
The fire formation's been broken.

421
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,250
They've escaped.

422
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,690
- Dispatch soldiers to go after them!
- Let's wait a bit.

423
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,390
Your Highness is here. Su Mo will definitely come.

424
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,310
The Six Directions Seals is with you, right?

425
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,940
Their emperor can sense it.

426
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,370
- You want to use me as a bait.
- We can only go all out today.

427
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,640
I will do my best to protect you.

428
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,150
Li Zhu, lead them down the mountain on this path.

429
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,390
Hold on. We haven't found the Water Dispelling Pearl yet.

430
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,410
Did you go to Queen Bai Wei's tomb?

431
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,250
We did but we couldn't find anything.

432
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,310
Miss Tu Luo, do you know where the Water Dispelling Pearl is?

433
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,820
Why are you looking for it?

434
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,800
Only if we can get the Water Dispelling Pearl,

435
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,590
can Su Mo take Na Sheng down the Ghost and Deity Abyss

436
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,040
to unlock the Six Directions Seal.

437
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,020
Are they telling the truth?

438
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,740
The Water Dispelling Pearl isn't in the tomb anymore.

439
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,790
Where is it then?

440
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,470
Tu Luo, are you all right?

441
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,670
What's wrong with these leaves?

442
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,150
Miss Tu Luo, what is this?

443
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,560
I'll heal your injuries.

444
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,430
No need.

445
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,960
It's useless.

446
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,010
Hurry and go.

447
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,420
This is the final thing I can do for you.

448
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,650
In order to save us,

449
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,960
you had to pay such a high price.

450
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,470
Miss Tu Luo, for your great kindness,

451
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,840
Kongsang will never forget this.

452
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,670
You are much warmer than him.

453
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,100
Miss Tu Luo, from the start,

454
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,290
it seems like you know me.

455
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,900
Seven thousand years ago,

456
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,410
I fell in love with a young man from a foreign land.

457
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,210
Because of him, I committed many unforgivable sins.

458
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,260
I wonder if it's fate or not,

459
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,680
to have let me meet you again.

460
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,990
Crown Prince of Kongsang, your eyes have a different look than his.

461
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,560
I hope you'll have a different outcome.

462
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,810
After you've unlocked the Six Directions Seal

463
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,140
please remove the barrier of Jiuyi

464
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,110
and let the light back into this misty forest.

465
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,480
This way, the children can transform into clouds

466
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,880
and float along with the wind to the Bilou Sea.

467
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,940
All right. Don't worry.

468
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,600
- This is...
- This is the Water Dispelling Pearl.

469
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,750
[Water Dispelling Pearl]

470
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,950
I rely on this to absorb the weak water

471
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,850
to survive in the forests of Jiuyi.

472
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,960
The Water Dispelling Pearl originally belonged to the Emperor of the Sea.

473
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,480
It was given to Bai Wei seven thousand years ago.

474
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,130
It was kept in Bai Wei's coffin after her death.

475
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,850
I'm the one who stole it.

476
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,020
I didn't want it to be with Bai Wei.

477
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,850
Today, it's time to return it to the Emperor of the Sea.

478
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,470
Chun Huang gave this to Queen Bai Wei?

479
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,370
Tu Luo, what's wrong with your body?

480
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,760
Tu Luo, I will always remember your kindness.

481
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,070
Emperor of the Sea of this generation,

482
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,740
I can only protect you up to here.

483
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,640
Please, you must defeat Cangliu

484
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,200
and lead the people of Quanxian

485
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,820
back to our home, the Bilou Sea.

486
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,980
Tu Luo, what's wrong with you?

487
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,750
I should have died a long time ago.

488
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,030
It's just that I was trapped by Jiuyi Mountain and the weak water,

489
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,590
stuck in this body and unable to get out.

490
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:36,400
Now my wish has come true,

491
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,930
I can die now.

492
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,560
Lead the children out of here.

493
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,910
Let them transform into clouds and rain, fly to the sky,

494
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,700
and go back to Bilou Sea.

495
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,340
Ya Ran, this is my name.

496
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,190
Emperor of the Sea, please remember this.

497
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,170
Ya Ran, your name will definitely

498
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,660
be on Quanxian's Records of Heroic Souls.

499
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,550
Hurry and go.

500
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,840
I will definitely fulfill your wish

501
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,700
and get revenge for you.

502
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,880
The Emperor of the Sea of this generation,

503
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,830
you have a kind and warm heart.

504
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,110
Usually, no one comes to the back of the mountain. It should be safe.

505
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,910
- Take a seat.
- All right.

506
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,630
Na Sheng.

507
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,180
I'm handing the Water Dispelling Pearl over to you.

508
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,040
I will use and cherish this well.

509
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,710
On behalf of Kongsang,

510
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,480
I thank Quanxian for this kindness.

511
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,890
Only by overthrowing the Cangliu,

512
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,440
can we justify so many deaths.

513
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,470
That's right. The immediate priority is to find the seal.

514
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,490
Na Sheng, see if there's any reaction from the Heavenly Ring.

515
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,390
It seems to be that way.

516
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,670
It's with Qing Chen.

517
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,590
He... Why did he go alone?

518
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,190
I'm going to go take a look.

519
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,830
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

520
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,220
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

521
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,830
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

522
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:36,580
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

523
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,060
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

524
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,660
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

525
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,580
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

526
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,050
♫ We've met several times ♫

527
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,470
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

528
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:04,590
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

529
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,960
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

530
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,560
♫ You live in there ♫

531
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:17,660
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

532
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,450
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

533
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,470
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

534
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,360
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

535
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,060
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

536
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,360
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

537
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,900
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

538
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:45,340
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

539
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,300
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

540
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,380
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

541
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,260
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

542
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,750
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

543
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,190
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

544
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:08,240
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

545
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:18,540
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
