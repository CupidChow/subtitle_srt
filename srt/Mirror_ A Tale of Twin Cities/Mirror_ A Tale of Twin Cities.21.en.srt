00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,430
Xi Jing.

4
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,030
After we split up, how did it go with you?

5
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,160
At that time, I was searching in the library.

6
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,400
So, someone knocked you off of Jing Pagoda. Right?

7
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,700
Yes.

8
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Fortunately, the Jade Bone Paper Umbrella helped me to withstand most of the attacks.

9
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,300
After I flew off of Jing Pagoda, it helped to cushion the impact of falling to the ground.

10
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,400
By the way, did you find the Dark Golden Classics?

11
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,800
I rummaged through the library and couldn't find the next volume.

12
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
How's that possible?

13
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,100
Hold on.

14
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,200
It's written in this volume. It's estimated there would be text in the next volume.

15
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
But there's no text in this volume.

16
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
What's going on?

17
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
This is strange.

18
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,700
This volume of the Dark Golden Classics shows the contents of the next volume.

19
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Whatever you want to know,

20
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,600
go look for in the Dark Golden Classics.

21
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Promise me

22
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,400
that you'll lead the Kongsang so they can see the sun again.

23
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,700
It was him.

24
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,400
He gave me the authority to read this book.

25
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
Who's he?

26
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
The man at the top of Jing Pagoda.

27
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I suspect... he's my royal father.

28
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,200
- King Cheng Guang?
- That's right.

29
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,400
But you personally buried him.

30
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
How could he re-appear in Jing Pagoda again?

31
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Think about it. How did he know I was his descendant?

32
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,600
Moreover, how could I have the authority to read the next volume?

33
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,260
Does this mean...

34
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm from Cangliu?

35
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,400
You're the Crown Prince of Kongsang and chosen by the Heavenly King.

36
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Anyway, he told me to go to Jiuyi.

37
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm guessing that after we go to the late king's mausoleum in Jiuyi,

38
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,800
everything will come to light.

39
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,310
Why is she sleeping for so long?

40
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,580
After eating, drinking, and having fun all night, she's exhausted.

41
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,200
This girl is heartless.

42
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,700
We went through such a terrifying night and she's fine.

43
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,600
What did the two of you go do?

44
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Where's A'Ying?

45
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Princess Bai hasn't come back yet?

46
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Wasn't she with you two?

47
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
We got separated later.

48
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Was she alone?

49
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,900
- It's already dawn.
- A'Ying...

50
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,400
Don't worry. She...

51
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,300
left with Young Master.

52
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,200
I can freely walk in the sun in this way now.

53
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,400
Look. They're back.

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,400
Su Mo, where did you get the Sunlight Blocking Pearl?

55
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,100
I traded something for it.

56
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
What was it?

57
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Is it expensive? If so, it's better to return it.

58
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,900
Nothing's more precious than you being able to see the sun again.

59
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,460
I don't know how to thank you.

60
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,020
It's fine as long as you are safe.

61
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,100
By the way, when you went up Jing Pagoda alone before, weren't you seriously injured?

62
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,600
How is it now? Is it better?

63
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,200
I'm fine. It's just that it was hard to see you.

64
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,400
It's not easy to figure out where you are. Of course, I want to come and find you.

65
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Moreover, I can't go to Wuse City.

66
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,500
I also don't have your Water Mirror.

67
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,400
What do we do then?

68
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,000
I cast a small spell on this.

69
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,190
Try knocking three times on it.

70
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,480
Next time...

71
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,950
try it again when I'm not around.

72
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Senior Brother. Your Highness.

73
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,500
What happened?

74
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,400
We went on a night tour of Jing Lake and we were careless...

75
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Just the two of you? On a night tour?

76
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,010
Tell the truth.

77
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,500
We went to drink at a brothel last night.

78
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,200
We were careless and got kicked out.

79
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
After that...

80
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,200
No such thing happened. Don't listen to his nonsense.

81
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,900
Your Highness, when you go out again, you must call the five princes or myself.

82
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
All right.

83
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Talking about this, there's no sun blocking cloak. How are you walking about in the sun?

84
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,400
Su Mo gifted me with a Sunlight Blocking Pearl which allows me walk in the sun.

85
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Really? That'll be much more convenient in the future.

86
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,900
Su Mo, where did you get that pearl from? Can you get them for the five princes, too?

87
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,100
I drank too much last night and haven't come around yet.

88
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
I thought you didn't drink anymore.

89
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
It was tea.

90
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh right! Where's Yan Xi and Na Sheng?

91
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yan Xi left. Na Sheng's inside sleeping.

92
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,640
Your Highness.

93
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,400
Last night, we wanted to go to the Flower Festival with you.

94
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
We were caught up with some matters and didn't make it.

95
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
What was it?

96
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Nothing much.

97
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,200
I was just about to talk to His Highness about the seal.

98
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,000
I wonder if right now is convenient.

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Now is fine.

100
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,850
Tell me. What did you want to discuss with me?

101
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,190
Last night, you went up Jing Pagoda?

102
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,820
That's right. Xi Jing and I went together.

103
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,410
You broke that barrier.

104
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,860
Are you saying I can't break that barrier?

105
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,310
It's not that.

106
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,900
After going up Jing Pagoda,

107
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,330
did you see that man dressed in black?

108
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,060
Yes. I saw him.

109
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,100
It's just like what you said. This man is very strange.

110
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,130
I suspect...

111
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,130
I suspect he's from Kongsang.

112
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,920
Someone from Kongsang?

113
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,100
Someone from Kongsang... is at the top of Jing Pagoda, ordering around the people of Cangliu.

114
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,940
He lured me using the Water Mirror, to come up to the pagoda.

115
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,120
He had every chance to kill Xi Jing and me,

116
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,260
but he didn't do it. I can't figure out why he did that.

117
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,740
Since he's from Kongsang, have you seen him before?

118
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,810
No.

119
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,250
I don't even have a clear image of him.

120
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,760
If he's from Kongsang,

121
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,200
why did he help Cangliu to attack Kongsang then?

122
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,840
These are where my doubts lie as well.

123
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,620
Before, you said that the Water Mirror can be used to monitor the people of Kongsang.

124
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,530
Then he can spy on anyone, right?

125
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:00,450
He can't open the Water Mirrors. He can only connect them.

126
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,850
But based on what he said, he can do anything.

127
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,470
All this is only just a matter of time then.

128
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,850
So as to say, we must find the seal as soon as possible.

129
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,410
Currently, our goal isn't the five masters,

130
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,120
but that man dressed in black. We must investigate him.

131
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,880
Thank you very much.

132
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,600
Don't mention it.

133
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,660
Compared to that man dressed in black, our priority now

134
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,790
is to go to Jiuyi as soon as possible.

135
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,940
That's right.

136
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,120
Jiuyi Mountain is divided into right and left peaks.

137
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,820
Between them, there's a weak back flow of water, so they're not connected.

138
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,230
The tomb of Queen Bai Wei is on the left peak.

139
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,330
The Water Protection Pearl should be there.

140
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,830
On the top of the mountain is Jiuyi Palace, which leads to the tomb of the Heavenly King.

141
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,110
The Six Directions Seal should be here.

142
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,460
On the right peak, there's Kongsang's Valley of the Ancestral Kings and the Monument of Fallen Tears.

143
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,540
The Splitting Sword is at the Mourning of Fallen Tears.

144
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,950
Jiuyi Mountain is very dangerous and there are also evil spirits on the right peak.

145
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,770
The Splitting Sword is an item from the first generation of the Emperor of the Sea.

146
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,520
Go to the right peak. I'll personally go there.

147
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,330
But there's a problem.

148
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,380
There's a barrier at Jiuyi Mountain. Those who aren't Kongsang can't enter.

149
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,260
If you have magic powers, they'll be weakened.

150
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,470
If you don't, you can't even get in.

151
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,390
So you're saying, people from Cangliu shouldn't be able to enter either.

152
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,990
It's fine if only magic power is weakened.

153
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,830
Although the soldiers of Cangliu can't enter Jiuyi Mountain,

154
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,520
we haven't been to Jiuyu Mountain for a decade now.

155
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,360
Who knows what it's like now.

156
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,040
Let's do this. I'll dispatch my Kongsang royal clan

157
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,610
to assist you in obtaining the Splitting Sword.

158
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,240
Thank you.

159
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,080
You said it before,

160
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,580
we're allies.

161
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,770
What's most important is to work together.

162
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,540
Cangliu is our common enemy and target.

163
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,370
That's right.

164
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,760
Su Mo, when you talked about the Land-Sea Alliance,

165
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,740
did you have any personal agendas?

166
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,740
Are you referring to Bai Ying?

167
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,760
Whether the Land-Sea Alliance existed or not,

168
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,060
I've never changed how I feel about Bai Ying.

169
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,190
However, when I brought up the Land-Sea Alliance, every single word was sincere.

170
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,430
With or without Bai Ying, I would think the same way, too.

171
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,210
What if I don't want her to go?

172
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,020
Bai Ying is Kongsang's Princess Bai. She has her own will.

173
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,400
If she really doesn't want to go,

174
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,370
I won't force her too either.

175
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,660
You're right. I'll go back and ask her.

176
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,320
Since we've discussed the plan, let's set out tomorrow.

177
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,960
Tomorrow?

178
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,330
Fine.

179
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,950
I wish I could stay in the sun all the time.

180
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,200
Senior Brother, you don't know

181
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,140
how it feels to suddenly see the sun

182
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,540
after living a cold and dark life for a hundred years.

183
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,990
It's like... a kind of long-lost warmth and freedom.

184
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,150
I even hope that the dark night will never come again.

185
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,120
It's good to have feelings of hope.

186
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,090
I don't believe you and His Highness did a night tour of Jing Lake.

187
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,520
More so, I don't believe you both went drinking at a brothel.

188
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,200
His Highness won't allow me to talk about this.

189
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,810
Fine then.

190
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,680
A'Ying, tell me the truth.

191
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,720
- You and Su Mo...
- Su Mo and I...

192
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,660
I admit that I fell in love with him a hundred years ago.

193
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,650
I tasted the beauty of love.

194
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,250
But what there was more of, was pain.

195
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,690
I often ask myself.

196
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,890
If I clearly knew the outcome would be like this,

197
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,780
would I have it again?

198
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,030
So, I've always regarded him as an ally and dared not ask for a response.

199
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,170
At least this way, there's a space between us.

200
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,650
What about now?

201
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,320
Since the Land-Sea Alliance, he's repeatedly saved me.

202
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,860
I've never been able to return the favors.

203
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,310
The way he treats me,

204
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,030
if I still conceal my real feelings,

205
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,580
I'll really let him down then.

206
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,910
He gave me a ray of light. I want to cherish it.

207
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,380
After the Battle of Liejing, I think you kept

208
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,510
all your worries in your heart. You weren't a person anymore,

209
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,940
more like a saber of light. Everything's better now.

210
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,930
My good Junior Sister is back.

211
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,360
Life is like a gap between Heaven and Earth. Time flies suddenly.

212
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,970
No matter who it is, as your senior brother, I'll always support you.

213
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,690
Thank you, Senior Brother.

214
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:04,180
However, in the future, you're not allowed to stay out during the night without telling me.

215
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,680
His Highness... still worries about you quite a bit.

216
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,020
Bai Ying.

217
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,970
- A'Ying.
- Your Highness.

218
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,820
Where's Na Sheng?

219
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,760
Hurry, get up! I have an important announcement to make.

220
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,680
What's going on? Why did you call me out here?

221
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,680
Su Mo and I discussed it. We decided to set out for Jiuyi Mountain tomorrow.

222
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,470
Tomorrow? Jiuyi Mountain? Aren't we supposed to go to the Ghost and Deity Abyss?

223
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,260
The High Priest found out that the Water Dispelling Pearl is at Jiuyi Mountain.

224
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,170
Only after obtaining the Water Dispelling Pearl can we can go to Ghost and Deity Abyss.

225
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,260
- Am I going with then?
- Of course.

226
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,080
If we want to unlock the Six Directions Seal at Jiuyi Mountain, you need to be there.

227
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,660
Because the Heavenly Ring is on your finger.

228
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,230
We need to find the most simple way to take action.

229
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,620
The six princes can't see the sun. They won't go with us.

230
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,690
I can go with you. I have the Sunlight Blocking Pearl.

231
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,370
You want to go with us?

232
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,060
Jiuyi Mountain is an important mission. Of course, I must go.

233
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,400
All right then.

234
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,140
But there's still another matter.

235
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,290
Jiuyi Mountain isn't accessible to people who aren't Kongsang. Once they are in there, they'll be in danger.

236
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,490
Su Mo probably won't let Ning Liang and Yan Xi go.

237
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,400
What? Yan Xi won't be going?

238
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,370
No, no. This won't do. I'm going to talk to Brother Ice Cube.

239
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,510
Well... I'm going to pack up then.

240
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,960
Let's go back to Wuse City to prepare.

241
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,760
Your Highness.

242
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,200
Huh?

243
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,380
I came back late last night and caused you to worry.

244
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,430
What right do I have to worry?

245
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,990
Are... you angry?

246
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,130
No. I'm not angry.

247
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,680
I... I'm merely saying that you have this now.

248
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,180
You can walk in the sun now

249
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,950
and not be afraid of being burned. Naturally, I don't have anything to worry about.

250
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,500
Su Mo must've worked hard for this pearl.

251
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,330
To let you walk around freely in the daylight.

252
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,510
Your Highness.

253
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,420
A'Ying.

254
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,840
We all can see how Su Mo feels about you.

255
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,530
Whether it's a hundred years ago or now,

256
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,960
he's never changed.

257
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,950
Right now the most important thing is to break the seal.

258
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,650
If you feel comfortable thinking about it this way, go ahead.

259
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,300
Your Highness,

260
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,040
Bai Ying won't forget that I am Princess Bai of Kongsang.

261
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,410
I will never dare to forget my mission.

262
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,130
I'll absolutely assist Your Highness,

263
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,990
so that Kongsang can see daylight again.

264
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,700
What are you doing?

265
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,590
Come. Stand up.

266
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,710
I'm not angry. Don't treat me like a child.

267
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,200
I just thought that he somehow took my Princess Bai of Kongsang away the entire night.

268
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,720
I was clueless about your whereabouts. As the Crown Prince of Kongsang,

269
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,730
I can express my dissatisfaction. Right?

270
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,160
Na Sheng said you wanted to meet me under the Flower God Tree.

271
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,340
I thought...

272
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,240
What do you think?

273
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,600
You thought that I liked you?

274
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,840
If I liked you,

275
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,900
I wouldn't have torn apart our marriage agreement back then.

276
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,730
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

277
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,840
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

278
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,630
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

279
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,070
I'm joking.

280
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,230
Don't worry about it.

281
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,810
Right now, our relationship is that of a monarch and his official.

282
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,980
You just need to assist me

283
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,460
in helping Kongsang see daylight again.

284
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,150
Everything else... is your own business,

285
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,140
which I have no right to interfere in.

286
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,750
A'Ying.

287
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,840
When Kongsang can see daylight again,

288
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,690
when everything is over,

289
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,920
you can live your life as you wish.

290
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,540
In this world, everyone

291
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,920
has the right to live their life as they wish.

292
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,990
Myself as well.

293
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,670
Thank you, Your Highness. If that's possible.

294
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,450
Let's go now.

295
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,250
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

296
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,320
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

297
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,240

298

299

300
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:50,890

301
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:58,900
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫

302
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,020
Why did we see Cangliu soldiers again?

303
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,830
We've seen so many Cangliu troops already.

304
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,100
There will be a lot of Cangliu soldiers along the way.

305
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,090
I suggest splitting us into two groups so that we'll be less noticeable and will be less likely to be harassed.

306
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,550
I also think splitting up is better.

307
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,610
I discussed it with Zhen Lan yesterday.

308
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,730
I'll go to the right peak alone to get the Splitting Sword.

309
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,240
Na Sheng, go to the left peak

310
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,590
to get the Six Directions Seal and Water Dispelling Pearl.

311
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,530
It's dangerous on your way to the peak.

312
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,070
Xi Jing and I will accompany you.

313
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,780
Yan Xi and I can go to the left peak ourselves. The rest of you just go to the right peak.

314
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,090
Didn't I tell you already?

315
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,720
Yan Xi isn't from Kongsang and can't enter Jiuyi Mountain.

316
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,230
What are you thinking about?

317
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,670
Then, Brother Ice Cube can't get in either?

318
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,060
Su Mo has enormous power. Despite the fact that his power will weaken,

319
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,550
he can still enter.

320
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,380
Let Uncle Xi Jing accompany me then. The three of you just go to the left peak.

321
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,560
A'Ying, you've been to the Valley of the Ancestral Kings. Right?

322
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,170
I followed my father there a hundred years ago.

323
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,650
Great, then you go... go with Su Mo.

324
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,800
Na Sheng, let me and Xi Jing accompany you.

325
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,270
- Why?
- Because...

326
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,640
Because I'm worried you'll bully Xi Jing on the way there.

327
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,490
Then we won't get the Water Dispelling Pearl and I'll lose my Great General.

328
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,970
Brother Crown Prince, why would I bully Uncle Xi Jing?

329
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,870
It's settled.

330
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,500
When I learned how to use a sword from my master back then,

331
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,930
my senior brother and I often did this.

332
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,630
When the sun shined the brightest, we'd stroll in the woods,

333
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,840
pick fruit, hunt rabbits, and help the weak.

334
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,000
How carefree those days were.

335
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,780
Su Mo,

336
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,450
thank you for giving me the Sun Blocking Pearl.

337
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,710
It has let me see the sunrise which I hadn't seen in a hundred years.

338
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,770
It's just that... I have nothing to give you in return.

339
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,410
There's no need to repay or thank me.

340
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,330
But I still feel bad inside.

341
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,140
I have an idea. When your magic power is halved in Jiuyi Mountain,

342
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,400
I'll definitely do whatever it takes to protect you.

343
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,410
Entering Jiuyi Mountain only halves my magic power. It doesn't injure me.

344
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,800
Since we met again a hundred years later, you've done so many things for me,

345
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,460
but I can't pay you back.

346
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,620
I just want to tell you, that I want to fight alongside you

347
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,180
and I want... to be able to help you.

348
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,020
Okay.

349
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,780
Jiuyi Mountain is right up there.

350
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,910
Before we get there, I want to take you somewhere.

351
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,620
Where?

352
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,260
You'll know when you get there. Let's go.

353
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,270
Brother Crown Prince, do you have a long face because Sister Bai Ying is gone?

354
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,700
I don't have a long face.

355
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,910
You just did.

356
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,510
No. Look.

357
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,900
The thing is, if you didn't want Sister Bai Ying to go, you could've stopped her.

358
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,510
I'm late, aren't I?

359
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,720
You still won't admit it.

360
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,630
Silly girl! Leave what you see through unspoken. Do you understand?

361
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,020
Why unspoken?

362
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,210
Only if you say it out loud can you figure it out.

363
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,820
Is everyone supposed to hide things and see who goes crazy from them first?

364
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,370
You know what? Right now is when you should take the initiative.

365
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,430
Look! Look at how smart I am!

366
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,090
Ning Liang can't snatch Yan Xi from me, right?

367
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,860
Ning Liang is just my colleague and comrade-in-arms.

368
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,680
I don't think Ning Liang wants to snatch him from you.

369
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,060
How does she not? It's my instinct as a woman.

370
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,300
Uncle, you're just too slow-witted to realize it.

371
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,200
You're a girl, so you have nothing to worry about.

372
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,260
But me? The things I have to worry about

373
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,120
really are too many.

374
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,520
Despite worrying so much, Su Mo still beat you to it.

375
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,730
- You–
- Brother Crown Prince, don't keep a long face.

376
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,250
Although we don't know how long it'll be before we arrive at Jiuyi,

377
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,920
but look!

378
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,150
The views along the way are quite nice.

379
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,810
Doesn't matter how nice the views are, walk faster.

380
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:47,810
Later if Cangliu people come after us, watch out, I might leave you here.

381
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,270
Oh right! Do you think I'll get lucky this time

382
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,630
that I can break the seal right away?

383
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,150
Jiuyi is where the royal tomb is. It must be very dangerous.

384
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,750
It won't be that easy.

385
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,410
Each seal has its own obstacles.

386
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,760
What's more, we're unfamiliar with Jiuyi.

387
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,180
It'll definitely be more difficult than we can imagine breaking the seal.

388
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,530
I have the Heavenly Ring.

389
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,780
You don't have the power to handle the Heavenly Ring yet.

390
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,820
You should practice the techniques I've taught you more often.

391
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,200
There are a lot of times when things can't be solved with just the Heavenly Ring.

392
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,960
Most of the time we need to rely on ourselves to really solve things.

393
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,950
Okay, okay. But that's fine.

394
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,560
I believe we'll definitely be able to break it.

395
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,560
We surely will. Let's go.

396
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,510
I'm not going.

397
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,930
- Are you going or not?
- I'm not.

398
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,640
- Yan Xi! Put me down!
- General Xi Jing, put her down.

399
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,620
Are you saying they're all going to Jiuyi?

400
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,460
Yes, Lord Zhi Zhe.

401
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,500
Master Peng said so in the letter.

402
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,190
He asked if you

403
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,050
could send Nan Zhao to chase after and catch them.

404
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,020
No need. Tell them

405
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,880
to do nothing. I have my own arrangements.

406
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,380
Yes, Lord Zhi Zhe.

407
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,930
It should be about time.

408
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:52,040
[Tianxiang Tavern]

409
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,770
Welcome. Are you dining or checking in?

410
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm the owner here. You can call me Tian Xiang.
[Madam Tian Xiang - Owner of Tianxiang Tavern]

411
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,380
If you'd like to eat, you'll be stuffed.

412
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,860
If you'd like to stay here,

413
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,690
there's only... one room left.

414
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,090
We'll stay in the inn.

415
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,440
Good. Follow me upstairs to the suite.

416
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,460
Please come in.

417
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,100
Tianxiang greets Young Master and Princess Bai of Kongsang.

418
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,150
Madam Tianxiang, please sit.

419
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,880
Do you know where Quanxian's post station is?

420
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,710
Under Young Master's plan, Quanxian's post station is gradually getting established.

421
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,900
Including Xifeng Province, Taoyung Province,

422
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,640
Cangwu Province, Kangping Province,

423
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,620
the originally scattered warriors are gathering.

424
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,810
This unit is getting stronger and stronger.

425
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,180
That's good. Notify them to stay well hidden.

426
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,420
Yes, Young Master.

427
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,970
Oh yes. The two matters that I asked Madam to look into,

428
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,740
how are they coming along?

429
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,350
Replying to the Young Master. The most dangerous place in the right peak of Jiuyi Mountain

430
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,480
is Misty Forest.

431
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Misty Forest?

432
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,590
Everything is dead in the Misty Forest.

433
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,980
The only thing alive is Tu Luo.

434
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,000
According to the legends, Tu Luo wanders around and has no permanent home.

435
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,890
Capturing living people for food.

436
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,970
If you're spotted by them,

437
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,590
there's no way to avoid or escape.

438
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,020
You'll die without a full corpse.

439
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,070
The Misty Forest is a nightmare for the merchants and treasure hunters.

440
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,780
That's why it's also called Nightmare Forest.

441
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,110
Nightmare Forest? Tu Luo?

442
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,550
But why did I not hear about this a hundred years ago?

443
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:44,090
Princess Bai, it's been 100 years. Things change quite a lot with the passing of time.

444
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,770
You're right. Many things

445
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,820
have changed unknowingly.

446
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,590
On the right peak of Jiuyi Mountain,

447
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,370
there may be more unknown dangers.

448
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,640
It's just that, ever since the barrier was set up on Jiuyi Mountain,

449
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,800
our magic powers have weakened and we haven't been able to check.

450
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,790
As for... As for the rule that unless you're a Kongsang person, you can't enter...

451
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,280
It's fine. Now that Madam has found out about Tu Luo,

452
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,240
it's already of great help to us.

453
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,140
Young Master. Princess Bai.

454
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,470
It's rare for you to visit,

455
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,230
why don't I prepare some food? You can rest before rushing onward with your journey?

456
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,210
Thank you for your trouble, Madam.

457
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,210
I'll go prepare then.

458
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:47,160
So you had already made preparations before we started on the trip.

459
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,250
You've done so much for me. Why wouldn't you want others to know?

460
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,540
Some things you don't need to let others know about.

461
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,140
Go prepare some good food and deliver it to the customers upstairs.

462
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,850
- Yes, Madam.
- Wait.

463
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,020
Bring me my special, Drunken Essence of Lilac Daphne.

464
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,580
Madam, you've hidden this wine for many years. It's a treasure.

465
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,540
It's also very strong.

466
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,060
How many times can one get drunk in life?

467
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,900
It's rare for the Young Master to visit even once. Tonight,

468
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,010
we must leave them with a beautiful memory.

469
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,140
Yes.

470
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,810
You look so worried. I'm not used to it.

471
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,360
Why do I need to let you get used to it?

472
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,560
I heard what Na Sheng just told you.

473
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,760
I think she's quite right.

474
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,620
You like A'Ying, right?

475
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,510
Why don't you tell her?

476
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,310
How do you know that I haven't wanted to?

477
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,010
I originally thought, once Wuse City could see daylight again,

478
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,080
I'd find a chance to confess my feelings to A'Ying.

479
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,950
But maybe...

480
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,390
I just don't dare to.

481
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,090
Don't dare?

482
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,150
Xi Jing, do you know?

483
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,720
The first time I saw her at Xinghang Paradise,

484
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,770
I started liking her.

485
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,210
She's bright, heroic, and hates evil-doers.

486
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,460
But the first time I went to Kongsang, I inexplicably became the crown prince of Kongsang.

487
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,180
All I could think about was how to get rid of this status.

488
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,130
Then when I saw her again,

489
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,640
she had already fallen in love with Su Mo.

490
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,930
By strange circumstances, we missed out too much.

491
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,710
And me? I'm always a step behind.

492
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,880
You woke up a hundred years later.

493
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,660
A'Ying and Su Mo also haven't see each other for 100 years. You still have a chance.

494
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:38,470
Now, I have to be responsible for the 100,000 citizens of Kongsang in Wuse City.

495
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:44,050
I can't be totally dedicated to A'Ying.

496
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,750
Tell me! If there comes a day

497
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,510
when I have to choose between Kongsang's people and A'Ying,

498
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,610
how should I choose?

499
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,120
What are you thinking? There won't be such a choice.

500
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,300
I'm just asking.

501
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,220
I would definitely choose the people of Kongsang.

502
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,520
So that's why I'm not qualified to love A'Ying.

503
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,560
These things haven't happened. Why are you thinking so much?

504
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,470
Why do I think so much?

505
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,810
Don't you think my name is already gone from this story?

506
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,730
Ultimately, I wish for you and A'Ying to be safe and sound.

507
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,190
Same here. I also wish her to be safe and sound.

508
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,660
That's why it's fine that I just quietly safeguard her.

509
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,070
As long as she's safe and sound, everything is fine.

510
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:48,440
But if Su Mo dares bully her, I definitely won't allow it.

511
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,430
Enough now. I won't think much about it anymore.

512
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,630
Let's think about what's in front of us. Let's think about Jiuyi.

513
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,510
It's good this way. Focus your thoughts on Kongsang.

514
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,630
A hundred years ago, you wanted to play too much.

515
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,780
Now that you're focused. Be a good crown prince then.

516
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,130
That's right! The road is long, why worry too much?

517
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,010
You say that, so do you have any plans?

518
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,560
Jiuyi is where the tomb of my ancestral king is.

519
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,240
How can I let the Cangliu people occupy it?

520
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,550
What do you plan to do then?

521
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,600
Coming! Coming!

522
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,300
I tried so long but only caught this one little fish. So disappointing.

523
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,140
Wait!

524
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,480
This is pretty big.

525
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,810
This is a Wenyao fish. Hurry, release it.

526
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,210
But I'm hungry. I'm not like you.

527
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,410
The Wenyao fish are Quanxian's messengers. You can't eat them.

528
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,900
All right, little girl. Considering Yan Xi is a merperson, release the fish.

529
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,100
I'll release it then.

530
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,390
Look over there. There should be cassava.

531
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,150
Go dig up some cassava.

532
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,890
I only want to eat meat.

533
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,550
What are you muttering about?

534
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,700
Nothing. I was just saying, in this wild place,

535
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,250
there isn't even a tea stall to rest at.

536
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,920
At the tea stalls in the Central Plains, there would be food and drinks.

537
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,700
Even if there was a tea stall, we don't have any money.

538
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,880
You really are too poor of a crown prince, aren't you?

539
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,490
I...

540
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,840
- Oh right! We have Yan Xi.
- Hey!

541
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,670
You're not thinking of selling Yan Xi for money, are you?

542
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,720
No, no. Yan Xi's tears can turn into pearls. We can sell them for money.

543
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,430
We warriors of Quanxian would rather shed blood than tears.

544
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,760
Really?

545
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,950
Yes, unless we suffer a great pain.

546
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,790
We don't otherwise randomly cry.

547
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,700
Look at how pitiful Na Sheng looks when she's starving.

548
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,310
Why don't you hurt just a bit?

549
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:20,100
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

550
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,520
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

551
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,060
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

552
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,920
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

553
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,400
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

554
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,900
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

555
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:47,010
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

556
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,370
♫ We've met several times ♫

557
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,740
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

558
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,600
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

559
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,240
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

560
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,850
♫ You live in there ♫

561
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:14,910
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

562
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,860
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

563
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,800
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

564
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,710
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

565
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,260
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

566
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,710
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

567
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,180
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

568
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:42,610
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

569
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,580
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

570
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,610
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

571
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:53,570
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

572
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,070
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

573
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,600
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

574
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,530
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

575
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:14,170
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
