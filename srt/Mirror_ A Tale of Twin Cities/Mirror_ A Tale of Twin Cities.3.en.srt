[Episode 3]

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,020
A'Yu, why did you bring him here?

4
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,050
Princess, according to your command,

5
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,950
musician Su Mo has repaired the harp.

6
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,330
So I brought him to the main hall, to pay his respects to you.

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,250
He can play "Moon Over Jing Lake" to help you sleep tonight.

8
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,310
- That's unnecessary.
- If you prefer him not to play the harp,

9
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,160
he also excels at other musical instruments.

10
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,350
Ever since you came to the tower, you haven't slept well.

11
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,310
It's late now. All of you should go rest.

12
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,330
- Yes.
- Yes.

13
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,650
Mother. I didn't expect that after all these years,

14
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,260
I could hear "Moon Over Jing Lake" again.

15
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,610
Do you know where the Crown Princess' servants in the palace hall

16
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,890
come from?

17
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,880
Besides A'Yu and Yao'er,

18
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,550
the rest of the servants are from the royal residences of the five other princes.

19
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,390
They were meticulously selected.

20
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Princess. Princess.

21
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,780
What's the matter?

22
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,130
It's time for bed.

23
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,690
Okay.

24
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,950
Princess, are you worried about something?

25
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,610
Do you have the register of the palace servants that were selected for me as Crown Princess?

26
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,370
Do you know how they were selected to be in the pagoda?

27
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,770
Princess, why are you suddenly inquiring about this?

28
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,980
I actually do have the register,

29
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,390
but I don't know how they were selected to be in the pagoda.

30
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,110
They must've been selected by the high priest, right?

31
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,430
I'm just curious, that's all. You can go rest.

32
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,160
Yes.

33
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,610
Lin'er.

34
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,020
Greetings, Uncle.

35
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,750
You haven't come here for quite some time.

36
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,060
Why are you urgently looking for me?

37
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,460
It's nothing much. I just missed you.

38
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,800
Lin'er, you've recently lost weight.

39
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,180
My younger sister, your royal mother, passed away very early.

40
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,990
Prince Bai must've neglected you, right?

41
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,650
No. Royal Father treats me very well.

42
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,660
It's just that Elder Sister recently went to the pagoda. I don't know whether she's well or not.

43
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,920
I just miss her, that's all.

44
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,220
I know that although you and Bai Ying don't have the same mother,

45
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,420
your relationship has always been very good.

46
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,360
Elder sister went to Kongji Mountain to study martial arts for three years.

47
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,810
Originally, I thought she'd be able to accompany me when she came back.

48
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,160
Who knew that only several days after returning to the residence, she'd go up to the pagoda.

49
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,680
Lin'er, do you really miss your sister?

50
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,420
Since you miss your sister so much,

51
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,890
I'll think of a way to arrange for you to go up to the Jing Pagoda to see her.

52
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,020
- Really? Uncle.
- Of course.

53
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,790
But Royal Father said that when Sister is in Jing Pagoda,

54
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,450
no one, including family, can privately go up to visit her.

55
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,460
Your royal father.

56
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,760
Don't worry, Lin'er.

57
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,550
I'll definitely think of a way to arrange it.

58
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,650
Not only will you go up Jing Pagoda, I've also already prepared

59
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,440
a gift for your sister.

60
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,430
It's your sister's favorite Nine Brews.

61
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,780
Thank you, Uncle.

62
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,900
High Priest, I heard that there's a servant with an eye disease up in the pagoda. Is that true?

63
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,570
Reporting to Your Highness. It's true.

64
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,640
Then can he be free to go down the pagoda if we find a different person?

65
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,450
Up in the pagoda, the servants have their own officials who make arrangements for them.

66
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,630
Your Highness doesn't need to worry about it.

67
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,630
Your Highness, the most important thing is to learn these etiquettes and rules well.

68
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,870
Since I don't have the authority to decide if this person goes or stays,

69
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,800
in that case, is it possible to have a physician treat his eye disease?

70
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,540
It seems that Your Highness still doesn't understand my troubles.

71
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,610
Your Highness. Your Highness.

72
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,390
Your Highness.

73
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,080
High Priest, look at me from head to toe, where do I look like royalty?

74
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,630
Heaven has already recognized Your Highness as our master.

75
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,460
The master of Heaven is the master of Kongsang.

76
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,660
The master of Kongsang is above all other people.

77
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,390
Since you're above all people, you should be respected as Your Highness.

78
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,950
How could you be thinking of going down the pagoda all the time?

79
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,950
What Heaven? What responsibility?

80
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,900
I can't even go down the pagoda.

81
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,250
No one will give me any money. What power do I have?

82
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,950
Your Highness.

83
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,760
High Priest, I really can't do it.

84
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,450
How about you quickly find someone else and try it again?

85
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,860
Okay?

86
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,910
Your Highness, stop making trouble.

87
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,930
Open your mouth.

88
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,270
Why has Your Highness come to the army camp today?

89
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,810
I don't have any good food or drink here.

90
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm going crazy staying in this palace.

91
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,820
Furthermore, the High Priest makes me read this and recite that all day long. It's extremely annoying.

92
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,030
In all of Kongsang, I can only come to your place to relax.

93
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,680
Greetings, Crown Prince.

94
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,100
Come. Please stand up. Please stand up.

95
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

96
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,580
Has there been a reply?

97
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,100
When it comes to army provisions, Prince Qing controls all the rations.
[Lan Jian - Prince Lan of Kongsang]

98
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,670
When Prince Qing distributes the army provisions, he always supplies the army of the Qing Clan first.

99
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,990
If he can short the supplies to the other princes, he will.

100
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,960
When it gets to Xi Jing, there isn't much left anymore.

101
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,160
The military forces haven't moved. The army provisions go first.

102
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,410
Prince Qing wants to cut off Kongsang's escape route.

103
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,360
Prince Qing controlling the army provisions isn't something that just happened overnight.

104
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,030
In the past, no one attacked us so it wasn't a serious problem.

105
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,690
But now, the Cangliu Army is close, like a tiger watching its prey.

106
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,270
Prince Bai, Prince Lan, and Prince Chi have many achievements.

107
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,100
But it's all still the same.

108
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,470
I'll allocate some of my army provisions here to you first.

109
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,310
How many days can your army provisions last?

110
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,660
There's not enough to eat.

111
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,830
How can the soldiers have enough strength to fight a battle?

112
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,220
You can leave this to me.

113
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,100
- Leave it to you?
- Yeah.

114
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,950
Isn't it just issuing a decree? What's hard about that?

115
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,590
Really?

116
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,450
I... I'm a crown prince, right?

117
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,970
This isn't a joke, Crown Prince.

118
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,810
Prince Lan. General Xi Jing.

119
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,860
I'll definitely get it done.

120
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,910
Then I'll wait for your good news.

121
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,120
Miss—

122
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,490
Guess who I am?

123
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,080
Lin'er.

124
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,270
You're the only one who likes to play these tricks.

125
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,630
No one on the pagoda would dare play such a joke with me.

126
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,570
Sister, it's been such a long time since last saw each other.

127
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,380
How are you?

128
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm well.

129
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,640
You're always like this. Keeping whatever you're thinking to yourself.

130
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,430
You're used to being so carefree,

131
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,360
now you're trapped in the pagoda every day. You can't go anywhere.

132
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,130
It must be boring, right?

133
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,680
That's right! No one can come up Jing Pagoda without High Priest's permission.

134
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,230
- How did you come up?
- I...

135
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,980
Su Mo, come and greet Her Highness and Younger Princess.

136
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,100
Greetings to Your Highness and Younger Princess.

137
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,740
This Jing Pagoda has merpeople?

138
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,360
Sister doesn't like these kinds of flowers.

139
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,120
Doesn't Jing Pagoda have Snow Cherry Blossoms?

140
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,240
Reporting to Younger Princess.

141
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,580
High Priest transplanted Snow Cherry Blossoms at Jing Pagoda according to Princess' preferences.

142
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,240
They just haven't bloomed yet.

143
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,880
I'm really looking forward to the Snow Cherry Blossoms blooming.

144
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,460
You can leave after you put down the flowers.

145
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,830
Flowers will always wither after they bloom.

146
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,270
At least if they haven't bloomed, there's still something to look forward to.

147
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,580
I brought you some Snow Cherry Blossom petals from the previous year.

148
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,770
I had someone take care of them, so you can put some in your sachet.

149
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,650
This way, they will never fade away.

150
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,640
We always hope that good people and things

151
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,860
can last longer.

152
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,190
Did that person from just now have an eye disease?

153
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,180
His eyes are injured.

154
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,190
By the way, you came here to see me.

155
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,640
Did something happen to Royal Father?

156
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,080
It's Sister Hong Yuan.

157
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,250
She'll be marrying Prince Lan today.

158
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,140
In Jing Pagoda, I forget what time and day it is.

159
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,670
I sent your grand gift to her residence yesterday.

160
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,710
She said she hopes your wish will be fulfilled.

161
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,280
We made the same choice.

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,430
How can our wish be fulfilled?

163
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,520
You and Sister Hong Yuan have a lot on your minds.

164
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,790
Is it...

165
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,540
because the person both of you are marrying

166
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,130
isn't the one you love?

167
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,480
- Lin'er.
- I'm not a child anymore.

168
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,100
I already understand a lot of things.

169
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,210
Since it's not the decision you want to make, why don't you reject it?

170
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,410
As a part of the royal family, there are many times you don't have the freedom to act independently.

171
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,350
If even the members of the royal family can't decide our own preferences,

172
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,260
then who can?

173
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,990
By the way, I have a family letter. Help me give it to Royal Father,

174
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,340
so he can feel reassured.

175
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,560
But Royal Father hasn't been at the residence these days.

176
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,720
I don't know when he'll return.

177
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,740
He's not in the residence?

178
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,710
I heard the whereabouts of the Cangliu soldiers were discovered in Ye City.

179
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,930
Royal Father rushed there to investigate.

180
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,010
Does Cangliu want to start a battle with Kongsang?

181
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,100
Enough, Sister.

182
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,740
It's difficult for us to get together.

183
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,400
Can we not talk about the grand plans of the people?

184
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,030
Oh right! Guess what I brought you.

185
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,180
This is the residence's newly fermented Nine Brew.

186
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,020
I especially brought it here for you to taste.

187
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,940
I know you don't want to be the Crown Princess of Kongsang.

188
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,790
You must be feeling very sad.

189
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,650
It's better to get drunk and forget everything tomorrow.

190
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,360
Hurry. Take it.

191
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,740
Thank you, Lin'er.

192
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,640
Princess.

193
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,300
Younger Princess.

194
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,090
It's getting late. High Priest will be coming soon.

195
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,190
Sister, I'll be going now then.

196
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,380
I don't know if I'll have another chance to come up the pagoda.

197
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,670
You must take care.

198
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,240
You too, take good care of yourself.

199
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,940
As part of the Kongsang Royal Clan,

200
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,950
we never had the freedom to act independently.

201
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,130
We're part of the Kongsang Royal Clan, but our destiny is our own.

202
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,640
Why should we let others control our destiny?

203
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,330
Do you really want to marry someone you don't love

204
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,790
and make yourself suffer for the rest of your life?

205
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,290
Princess, it's getting late.

206
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,120
We should go study etiquette in the side hall.

207
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,140
A'Yu, stop working.

208
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,720
Hurry and get some rest.

209
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,510
I noticed that you haven't been sleeping very well.

210
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,670
I especially found sleeping coumarin incense so you can sleep more peacefully.

211
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,400
No need.

212
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,980
What's wrong?

213
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,730
Ever since you've entered Jing Pagoda,

214
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,000
I've noticed that you're very worried.

215
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,850
Do you want to leave Jing Pagoda?

216
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,850
No.

217
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,810
I'm willing to always accompany you.

218
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,420
It's just that...

219
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,090
Recently, I noticed Su Mo unable to move freely due to his eye disease.

220
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,790
He's almost fallen from the railings several times.

221
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,000
He's alone and the lower pagoda is without a door.

222
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,930
Since we work together at Jing Pagoda, I'm a bit worried.

223
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,080
I'll find a way to take care of this issue.

224
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,660
Yes.

225
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,830
It seems that Your Highness still doesn't understand my troubles.

226
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,680
Since it's not the decision you want to make, why don't you reject it?

227
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,560
Recently, I noticed Su Mo unable to move freely due to his eye disease.

228
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,120
You have to be careful.

229
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,730
He's almost fallen from the railings several times.

230
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,650
Princess, you want to personally ask a physician to treat the eyes of that servant?

231
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,500
It's natural to find someone to come and treat his eye disease.

232
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,830
Princess.

233
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,690
His Highness Prince Bai, ordered the servants

234
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,140
to be very careful

235
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,600
we can't make a single mistake.

236
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,560
If you send a person to treat that servant's eyes.

237
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,530
I'm afraid there'll be gossip.

238
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,280
It's only to treat a pair of eyes. That's all.

239
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,530
How can there be gossip?

240
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,100
Besides,

241
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,120
could it be that up in Jing Pagoda, I

242
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,710
can't even do this simple thing?

243
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,650
But...

244
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,180
Enough, Yao'er. Deliver it.

245
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,390
It's just to treat a pair of eyes. That's all.

246
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,260
There's no need to make a fuss.

247
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,090
Yes.

248
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,100
What's the matter?

249
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,820
Prince Qing, Master Peng seeks an audience.

250
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,630
[Qing Royal Residence]

251
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,060
We'll be attacking Kongsang soon.

252
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,590
At that time, we'll need Prince Qing to cooperate with us from the inside.

253
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,220
In a few days when they get married,

254
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,380
the power of Heaven and Earth will join together.
[Master Peng, One of the 5 Masters of Cangliu]

255
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,460
The consequences could be disastrous.
[Master Peng, One of the 5 Masters of Cangliu]

256
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,950
You and I have always written letters before.

257
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,630
I didn't expect you to personally pay a visit.

258
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,500
I've already sent people to infiltrate Jing Pagoda.

259
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,440
The crown princess' seal will be broken soon.

260
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,590
Lord, don't be impatient.

261
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,740
We think outsiders are unreliable.

262
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,640
How can you ensure nothing will go wrong?

263
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,100
This person was in my Xinghan Paradise, yet the crown princess insisted on taking him away.

264
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,070
She even returned to save him.

265
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,770
He's the most suitable for breaking the crown princess's seal.

266
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,040
I hope so.

267
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,010
Once you succeed on your side, I'll attack the city immediately.

268
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,180
After you're done, you can get what you want.

269
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,890
If you don't do as I say, not only will I kill her,

270
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,560
I'll make sure the others die, one by one, in front of you.

271
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,290
What do you want him to do? I'll do it!

272
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,360
You? You can't do it.

273
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,380
Aunt Ru, I will definitely save you and everyone else.

274
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,900
Su Mo, the prescription is here.

275
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,740
She's really helping to treat my eyes.

276
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,010
Can you tell me your name?

277
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:24,170
I'm A'Lin. I'm going to deliver a sachet to the crown princess.

278
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,120
Why is the crown princess pretending to be a maid?

279
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,980
It's her.

280
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,090
The physician said that Su Mo's eye disease was caused by poison.

281
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,430
You're A'Lin.

282
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,070
It's me.

283
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,490
Is this cloth supposed to be soaked in the medicine?

284
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,090
Yes.

285
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,180
How did you injure your eyes?

286
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,820
Before, when I wasn't being careful, I looked at something too bright and hurt my eyes.

287
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,790
Is the medicine ready?

288
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,110
Yes. I'll help you apply it.

289
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,690
Okay.

290
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,210
Are you really a maid?

291
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,540
Of course.

292
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,240
Using this kind of method has gotten you scolded many times before, right?

293
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,980
It's done. I'm leaving.

294
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,530
Today's the fifteenth. It'll be a full moon.

295
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,160
Let's... go and admire the full moon.

296
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,190
You can't see. How can you admire the full moon?

297
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,380
You can see it.

298
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,060
Everyone's resting now. No one will find out.

299
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,160
Can... you take me there?

300
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,190
It turns out the moon we see on top of the Jing Pagoda

301
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,160
is different.

302
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,650
Use this Sea of Stars leaf to view it.

303
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,130
You'll see something more beautiful.

304
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,080
Sea of Stars?

305
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,730
This leaf has a name?

306
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,710
How do I look at it?

307
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,690
I've never seen the moon like this before.

308
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,400
It looks like...

309
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,510
Do you see the sea?

310
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,550
I have never seen the sea. Have you seen it?

311
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,660
Wow! It's so pretty!

312
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,470
It's exactly the same as the sea, so magical!

313
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,710
Didn't you say that you've never seen the sea?

314
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,640
How do you know what the sea looks like? Aren't you afraid that I might've lied to you?

315
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,950
I haven't seen it either. I've only heard about it from others.

316
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,720
If you use this to view it, you can see the sea.

317
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,320
Is that person from your family?

318
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,390
Keep this leaf safe.

I don't have any family left.

320
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,870
My mother died very early on.

321
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,050
I'm sorry.

322
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,680
What's there to apologize for?

323
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,590
It's not your fault that I don't have a family.

324
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,100
I shouldn't have mentioned your grief.

325
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,630
It's been so long. I'm already over it.

326

Really?

327
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,380
Actually, my mom left when I was very young.

328
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,200
However, recently, I'd often think

329
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,100
about whether she's doing well on the other side or not.

330
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,040
When she's alone, does she feel really lonely?

331
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,170
Must I really harm her?

332
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,500
You should head back first.

333
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,420
I want to stay for a bit.

334
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,890
It looks like Your Highness isn't very pleased with me.

335
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,170
Prince Qing, you're aware of what you've done.

336
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,860
I've always been loyal to His Majesty.

337
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
I've done a lot for Kongsang.

338
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,400
I wonder what you're referring to.

339
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,370
You've done a lot?

340
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,370
All right, then. Let me ask you then.

341
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,810
Why haven't the front line weapons, provisions, and armor

342
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,420
been resupplied sufficiently?

343
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,220
How do you expect the soldiers to fight the enemy?

344
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,780
The enemy is at our border. Do you want our soldiers to march to their deaths?

345
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,520
And you've done a lot for Kongsang?

346
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,710
I understand now.

347
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,420
No wonder Your Highness is so angry. It turns out it's about this matter?

348
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,310
Crown Prince, you've only recently come back from the wilderness.

349
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,450
You may not understand Kongsang's politics and people that well yet.

350
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm willing to teach Your Highness a few things.

351
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,760
Xi Jing was only using resupplying the troops as an excuse

352
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,560
to put money in his own pocket.

353
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,770
Your Majesty, you also had agreed to this.

354
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,850
He's full of nonsense!

355
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,320
Crown Prince, you must not be impolite.

356
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,830
Your Majesty, protect your health.

357
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,370
Crown Prince, please don't continue to offend His Majesty anymore.

358
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,940
Don't fail his hopes for you.

359
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,950
All these years, His Majesty has been well-loved by the people.

360
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,140
Kongsang is peaceful. The land His Majesty rules

361
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,540
isn't something a just returned crown prince can question.

362
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,190
Kongsang. With you as the ruler and you as an official, it will be in ruins sooner or later!

363
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,970
Get a handle on Xi Jing's request.

364

The priority is to protect Kongsang.

365

You're Prince Qing.

He's the crown prince. To argue like that in court,

367

how is that appropriate?

♫ We've met several times ♫

480
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,680
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our past fated relationship ♫

481
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:37,840
♫ Sighing for the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

482
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,210
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

483
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,730
♫ You live in there ♫

484
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:50,860
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

485
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,680
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

486
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,750
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

487
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,620
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

488
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,230
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

489
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:08,600
♫ Using ten finger to painstakingly ♫

490
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,080
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

491
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,460
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

492
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,490
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

493
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,630
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

494
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:29,560
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

495
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,060
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

496
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,450
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

497
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,490
♫ I would rather turn into ashes and be lost in a reverie ♫

498
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:50,930
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
