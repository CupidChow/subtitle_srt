[Episode 17]

3
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,840
Cangliu people have sent another sound pearl,

4
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
informing us that they will viciously strike again tonight.

5
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,800
Previously, whenever our tribe's people were endangered, we would dispatch troops to give aid.

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,010
Now, we're told to do nothing but wait.

7
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,730
- I don't have such patience!
- Elders!

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,210
We merpeople are loyal and always keep our promises, so please believe in Young Master.

9
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,470
It's not that we don't believe in Young Master,

10
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,510
it's that Young Master doesn't believe in us.

11
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,630
He said that the person holding the Heavenly Ring

12
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,500
is as important as us.

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,910
Have many lives have we already lost?

14
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,430
Elder Yu, Na Sheng is just a person from the Central Plains, not a Kongsang person.

15
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,020
She got involved because she obtained the Heavenly Ring by coincidence.

16
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,230
Besides, she not only helped Kongsang, but she also helped us.

17
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,140
Are we going to commit treachery?

18
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,120
The killing has come so far,

19
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,690
do you think we have another way around this?

20
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,350
I have lived a thousand years.

21
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,460
I know Quanxian is now in a desperate situation.

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,710
Elders, please head back.

23
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,310
Elder, did you call me here to ask me to do something?

24
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,550
Are you so ruthless

25
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,640
to do nothing when you clearly know that Quanxian is suffering?

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,090
I want you to tell me what the person who has the Heavenly Ring looks like

27
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,610
and where she is now.

28
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,010
Elder, are you going to use—

29
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,950
Good child, protect our people.

30
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,050
Stay here. You still have many important things to do.

31
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,890
You're hungry, right? Just wait a bit longer.

32
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,950
For the fish we catch today, do you want to steam or grill them?

33
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,430
I don't want to eat.

34
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,390
Did you fail to pass through the wall and knock your head again?

35
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,890
No.

36
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,670
Then what is it?

37
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,910
Why doesn't Yan Xi come to see me?

38
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,100
Don't ask me.

39
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,960
Does he not want me? From now on, does he want to go our separate ways?

40
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,540
No, Kongsang and Quanxian have an alliance now, so a separation won't happen.

41
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,390
Since we're in an alliance, why doesn't he come to see me?

42
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,340
You need to be considerate of him.

43
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,570
Once he returned to the camp, he was no longer only your Yan Xi.

44
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,200
Firstly, he's the Left Commissioner of the Quanxian army. Those in the army must obey military orders.

45
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,070
Besides, if Su Mo doesn't say so, how would he come?

46
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,540
Besides, it's just been a few days of not seeing each other.

47
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,260
Restrain yourself a bit.

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
What are you doing? You're scaring all my fish away.

49
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,040
If he doesn't come to see me, I'll go to see him.

50
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,580
Go then.

51
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,940
Can you even get into the water? Catch a few fish for me.

52
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,300
I don't care, I don't care! I want to go see him and ask why he hasn't come to see me.

53
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,650
Brother Crown Prince and Sister Bai Ying have both come to see me. Only he hasn't come, don't you think it's illogical?

54
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,970
Zhen Lan told me to look after you, so don't even think about going anywhere, not to mention going to see Yan Xi.

55
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,090
Why?

56
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,670
There's no why. Stay here.

57
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,050
Uncle, I don't want to eat fish today. I want to eat roasted chicken.

58
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,000
Where would we go to get roasted chicken?

59
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,450
I've eaten fish so much, I'm sick of it. I haven't had roasted chicken in so long.

60
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,990
Plus, you are so skilled, so catching a chicken is nothing difficult. Right?

61
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,510
Half a day has passed and I haven't caught any fish. Now that you say this, I'm indeed hungry.

62
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,830
Fine.

63
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,340
You stay right here. Stay here, be good, and you'll have chicken to eat.

64
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,150
All right, all right. I'll be here, training. I won't go anywhere.

65
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,790
Let's go see Yan Xi, let's go see Yan Xi.

66
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,320
You must be Miss Na Sheng from the Central Plains, right?

67
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,010
Y-You are...?

68
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,180
I am Elder Yu of the Quanxian Tribe.

69
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,500
Elder Yu?

70
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,420
You are indeed a merperson,

71
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,180
but how are you going to prove that you are Elder Yu?

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Look. This is my Quanxian necklace.

73
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,830
That's right, that's right. It's quite similar to Yan Xi's necklace.

74
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,250
What do you think?

75
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,570
Here.

76
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,150
I didn't lie to you, right?

77
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,610
I'm sorry, Elder Yu. Uncle Xi Jing usually tells me to be extra careful,

78
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,540
so that's why I asked some questions.

79
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
Elder Yu, why didn't Yan Xi come to see me himself?

80
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,620
He's very busy right now.

81
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,520
Young Master entrusted him with an important task.

82
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,480
He can't leave for the time being,

83
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,310
but in his heart, he really misses you.

84
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,960
So he told me to come and take you to go see him today.

85
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
See him today? I can go see Yan Xi?

86
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,820
That's right.

87
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,780
- Then all right! Let's go now. Let's go.
- All right.

88
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,750
Miss Na Sheng, I'm sorry.

89
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,650
I'm doing this for the Quanxian tribe.

90
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,420
Elder Yu, what does Yan Xi usually tell you about me?

91
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,020
He talks about you every day.

92
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,440
Na Sheng is in trouble. Na Sheng is in trouble!

93
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,270
Your Highness, Na Sheng is in trouble.

94
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,790
High Priest, quickly use the Water Mirror to find out Na Sheng's location.

95
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,820
Help! Help! Help!

96
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,870
What are you shouting about?

97
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,340
Elder Yu.

98
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,130
Why did you come?

99
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,140
I was worried. Cangliu people are full of tricks.

100
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,360
I can't let you face them by yourself.

101
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,100
Is she all right?

102
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,910
She fainted, that's all. Let's quickly go.

103
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,430
Did you already reach an agreement with the Cangliu people?

104
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,820
I notified Master Peng to meet me at the Ten Mile Pavilion.

105
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,350
When we get there, you'll hide with her first.

106
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,310
Wait until Master Peng and I make a blood pact before you come out.

107
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,530
If he's not willing to make the pact, take her with you and leave.

108
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,660
- Then what about you?
- You don't need to worry about me.

109
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,640
As expected, we can't form an alliance with the Quanxian Tribe.

110
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,230
They faked the alliance and took advantage of us when we let our guards down

111
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,820
to take the Heavenly Ring directly to the Cangliu people.

112
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,060
They broke their promise again, so detestable.

113
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,130
That Quanxian elder dares to do such a thing surely because Su Mo ordered him to do so behind the scene.

114
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,530
Cangliu already spread the news that

115
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,480
Cangliu and Quanxian have already formed an alliance.

116
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,170
- Impossible.
- Why not?

117
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,860
Back then, at the Jing Pagoda,

118
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,490
- his actions were just as detestable as now.
- Prince Xuan,

119
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,240
I already told you not to mention the past again.

120
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,320
Besides, there's no conclusion on this matter yet.

121
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,250
Why are you speculating?

122
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,180
The priority now is to rescue Na Sheng and bring her back.

123
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,040
Your Highness, I will go rescue Na Sheng.

124
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,970
We will go, too.

125
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,440
All right, go rescue Na Sheng.

126
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,260
I will go to the Quanxian Great Camp to personally ask Su Mo for an explanation.

127
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,290
You must be careful.

128
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,140
Na Sheng, I caught a chicken.

129
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,010
Na Sheng.

130
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,510
Na Sheng!

131
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,230
Na Sheng!

132
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,350
This is bad. That little girl tricked me.

133
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,070
Could it be that she went to look for Na Sheng?

134
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,400
I must notify Yan Xi immediately.

135
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,040
Yan Xi!

136
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,530
General Xi Jing,

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,140
why are you here?

138
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,810
We were just on our way to go see Na Sheng.

139
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,180
She didn't come here to look for you?

140
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,870
Xi Jing!

141
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,830
Your Highness, why are you here?

142
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,730
- Na Sheng is in trouble.
- What do you mean?

143
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,040
In the Water Mirror, I saw a Quanxian elder take her away.

144
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
Could it be Elder Yu?

145
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,020
Why did you betray Na Sheng?

146
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,850
Cangliu threatened the merpeople. If they don't hand over Na Sheng, they will kill the imprisoned merpeople.

147
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,150
We have no intentions of breaking the alliance and betraying Na Sheng.

148
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,830
- Where's Su Mo?
- He's in seclusion.

149
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,510
Seclusion?

150
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,860
You still ended up summoning me.

151
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,090
Do you think you can suppress me by using

152
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,890
the power of six harmonies?

153
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,650
Aren't you still relying on my power now?

154
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,390
These past few months, whether it be the blood you shed

155
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,620
or the people who have died,

156
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,180
it's much more than the past few decades. Right?

157
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,880
What do you think, Su Mo?

158
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,470
I will help you take care of them.

159
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,290
Give me your power.

160
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,420
The Splitting Technique.

161
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,650
Elder Yu.

162
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm Cangliu General Yu Huan, here under the order of Master Peng.

163
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,550
I asked to see Master Peng.

164
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,680
There is no need for Master Peng to be here personally to hand a person over.

165
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,440
If we hand over the person holding the Heavenly Ring,

166
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,060
you will stop all killings, is that correct?

167
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,520
Of course. We only want the person holding the Heavenly Ring.

168
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,160
We have no intentions of implicating Quanxian.

169
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,960
A verbal agreement is not reliable.

170
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,220
Then I wonder what will cause Elder Yu to trust me.

171
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,050
To show our sincerity, we brought a few merpeople here.

172
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,540
Where's your Young Master? I need to see him immediately regarding urgent matters.

173
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,470
We have no intention of offending you.

174
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,570
Move aside.

175
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,380
Who is it?

176
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,680
Who are you? Why did you trespass in our Quanxian Camp?

177
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,550
I am the Kongsang Crown Prince, Zhen Lan.

178
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,980
You are the Kongsong Crown Prince?

179
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,260
Our Young Master instructed us that he will not see anyone while in seclusion. Please go back.

180
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Is it Su Mo's order to take Na Sheng to Cangliu?

181
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,930
If it was not,

182
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,090
how can you make an unauthorized decision

183
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,110
and why is Su Mo avoiding us?

184
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,810
This is the power of the Splitting Technique.

185
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,550
You are just like those who want to covet the power,

186
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,700
choosing to destroy themselves.

187
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,540
You won't understand what I want at all.

188
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,520
Go!

189
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,750
Then let's make a blood pact to ensure the promise.

190
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,650
If anyone violates the pact, Heaven will punish him.

191
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,060
- The blood pact has been made.
- The blood pact has been made.

192
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,990
Release them.

193
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,070
You can hand over the person holding the Heavenly Ring now.

194
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,790
Bring her here.

195
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,510
You! What are you trying to do?

196
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,110
Elder Yu!

197
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,900
Yu Huan, I cast a blood pact.

198
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,680
Are you really not afraid?

199
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,410
Yu Huan!

200
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,590
It's just a small blood pact. You can handle it, right?

201
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,600
Leave!

202
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,460
This way!

203
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,530
Quickly!

204
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,190
Yan Xi!

205
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,120
Other than the person possessing the Heavenly Ring,

206
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,800
kill the rest.

207
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,120
Where's the strongest power in Jing City?

208
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,200
Yan Xi, leave now and protect Na Sheng.

209
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,520
Lan Xia, escort them.

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,350
Leave!

211
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,600
Let's go! Hurry and leave!

212
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,450
Let's go!

213
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,720
Lan Xia. Na Sheng.

214
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,920
- Your Highness. General Xi Jing.
- Brother Crown Prince.

215
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,750
- What happened?
- Brother Crown Prince, hurry and rescue Sister Bai Ying.

216
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,330
They seem to have been captured by Cangliu.

217
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,580
Cangliu is well-prepared.

218
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,350
We can't break through from here.

219
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,100
It seems this magic cloak is losing its effectiveness.

220
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,680
The Splitting Technique.

221
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,910
A'Ying. Sister Hong Yuan. What's wrong with you?

222
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,450
Your Highness, this is the Lapis Lazuli formation, especially used to subdue Kongsong powers.

223
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,610
How is that happening?

224
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,660
Kongsong powers will all be absorbed in here.

225
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,030
Who is he? Why does he know the Splitting Technique, too?

226
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,360
Why was he able to absorb my powers

227
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,830
and transform into his dark power?

228
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,190
Who is he?

229
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,030
Such a degenerate.

230
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,080
The Emperor of the Sea

231
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,850
even practices this kind of spell.

232
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,490
Young Master, in order to rescue Na Sheng, the Kongsang princes

233
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,070
have been trapped by Cangliu.

234
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,600
Please leave your seclusion and rescue them.

235
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,090
Princess Bai Ying and Crown Prince Zhen Lan are trapped.

236
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,320
Young Master, please leave your seclusion.

237
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,780
Emperor of the Sea, you must not continue to cast spells.

238
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,500
Outside the seven seas, I can already sense the power of the backlash growing viciously.

239
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,580
If you cast another spell, you won't be able to endure it

240
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,630
and lose your life.

241
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,690
Emperor of the Sea.

242
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,300
I really...

243
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,410
cannot watch all this

244
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,550
happen again.

245
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,570
I will try again...

246
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,940
to see if I can summon some dark clouds.

247
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,060
I'm so useless.

248
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
My powers are low.

249
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,380
I cannot even cover the sunlight.

250
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,020
I'm so useless.

251
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,040
Your Highness,

252
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,000
this is not your fault.

253
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,920
It's just that we may...

254
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,190
not be able...

255
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,880
to accompany you to unlock the rest of the Six Direction Seals.

256
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,650
No, A'Ying.

257
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,850
Your Highness, please...

258
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,970
bury me beside my royal father.

259
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,570
A'Ying, I won't allow anything to happen to you.

260
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,050
I won't allow you to die.

261
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,460
If you die,

262
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,720
all this...

263
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,030
all this would be pointless.

264
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,000
Your Highness,

265
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,850
may Heaven bless Kongsang.

266
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,540
No. No, A'Ying.

267
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,360
A'Ying! A'Ying!

268
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,170
Master,

269
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,890
this person...

270
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,290
is the one whom I am most unwilling to lose.

271
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,040
We've succeeded. We've succeeded, A'Ying.

272
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,440
We've succeeded.

273
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,930
What are we waiting for? Let's leave right away. Let's go.

274
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,740
Older Sister Hong Yuan.

275
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,050
A'Huan! What happened to him?

276
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,750
The general was harmed by a Quanxian blood pact.

277
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,130
Master Peng had us bring the general back first.

278
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,370
Quanxian blood pact?

279
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,840
- Bring him up.
- Yes.

280
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,510
I beg Lord Zhi Zhe to save Yu Huan.

281
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,550
Yu Huan is under a Quanxian blood pact and is in imminent danger.

282
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,460
I beg Lord Zhi Zhe to save Yu Huan!

283
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,300
Quanxian blood pact...

284
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,360
appears once again.

285
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,160
Why is there such a big fire?

286
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,960
I also do not know how this fire started.

287
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,120
That fire is so malefic, no matter what, it won't be extinguished!

288
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,060
General, it is too dangerous here. You should quickly leave.

289
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,440
You go organize people to fight the fire.

290
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,830
Yes.

291
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,940
Help us! Save us!

292
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,570
Help! Please save us!

293
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,950
Quickly come out! It's the young master.

294
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,810
- The Emperor of the sea has come to save us.
- Go to the mountain.

295
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,010
Quick! Use the water route to return to the great camp!

296
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,740
Slowly, A'Huan.

297
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,850
A'Hua, didn't you accompany Master Peng to catch the person possessing the Heavenly Ring?

298
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,540
Why were you harmed by a Quanxian blood pact?

299
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,170
Fortunately, Master Peng sent you back in time.

300
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,960
Yu Huan, I cast a blood pact.

301
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,720
Are you really not afraid?

302
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,110
It's just a small blood pact.

303
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,980
You can handle it, right?

304
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,920
Isn't that in the direction of the Cangliu military camp?

305
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,120
Why is it on fire?

306
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,320
What exactly

307
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,690
happened here?

308
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,570
Elders, Xiang sent a message.

309
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,140
The Cangliu Wind Falcon Storehouse has been burned down and their Wind Falcons have been destroyed.

310
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,860
The Cangliu military camp is in chaos.

311
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,520
Xiang has already rescued our people.

312
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,280
The Wind Falcon Storehouse has been burned down.

313
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,250
Young Master succeeded!

314
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,790
It's good that they've been saved.

315
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,090
Now that everyone is saved, that's great.

316
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,210
High Priest.

317
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,770
Princess Bai...

318
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:26,330
has not fully recovered from when she saved the Emperor of the Sea last time.

319
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,310
This time...

320
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,310
it is one injury on top of another.

321
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,710
That is why she has not woken up yet.

322
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,950
Hurry and think of a solution.

323
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,200
Reporting to Young Master, I have urgent matters to tell you.

324
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,140
The Wind Falcons of the Cangliu Military Camp have been destroyed.

325
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,520
All of our tribesmen have been saved.

326
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,880
Master.

327
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,290
The emperor has suffered serious injuries. I'm healing him right now.

328
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,310
Could it be...

329
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,410
Young Master who destroyed the Wind Falcons at the Cangliu military camp?

330
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,610
The Emperor of the Sea has not woken up yet.

331
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,540
You shall take care of the camp affairs for now.

332
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,320
Master, please treat Young Master's injury

333
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,540
so that he can awaken soon.

334
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,290
Quanxian cannot go on without the Emperor of the Sea.

335
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,330
Yan Xi, I don't want to separate from you again.

336
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,740
Commissioner of the Left.

337
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,580
They're here, they're here. They're here to take me.

338
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,990
They won't.

339
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,670
Come in.

340
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,890
Left Commissioner, Right Commissioner cannot hang on much longer.

341
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,690
What?

342
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,950
Na Sheng, I must go see Han Zhou.

343
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,930
Then can I go with you? I want to see him, too.

344
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,910
Let's go.

345
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,000
Hang on for a bit longer. Quick, give me some cloth.

346
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,050
Han Zhou.

347
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,430
Han Zhou.

348
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,090
I'm sorry.

349
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,990
I have done all I can.

350
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,190
Good thing...

351
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,920
we didn't make a huge mistake.

352
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,840
Miss Na Sheng,

353
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,150
Elder Yu...

354
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,490
has already died.

355
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,580
Are you willing to forgive us?

356
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,690
I-I meant...

357
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,530
I don't blame you at all.

358
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,830
Where's Young Master?

359
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,150
Young Master is still unconscious.

360
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,740
Master Ming Hua is wielding power to save him right now.

361
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,050
Don't worry.

362
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,840
We've rescued all the other tribesmen.

363
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,060
That's good then.

364
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,880
That's good then.

365
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,520
Yan Xi.

366
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,130
All this time,

367
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,880
you've always been a step ahead of me.

368
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,440
But this time,

369
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,410
I may have to go first.

370
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,520
You must lead Quanxian

371
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,920
to return to Biluo Sea.

372
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,890
You must.

373
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,610
I definitely will.

374
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,030
Ning Liang.

375
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,760
I know that...

376
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,140
you were only acting on a sudden grievance

377
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,230
and gave Cangliu an exploiting chance.

378
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,170
From now on, you must listen to Yan Xi.

379
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,620
Obey the Young Master.

380
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,540
Don't be too impulsive.

381
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,230
Also, don't be too reckless.

382
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,600
Don't cry.

383
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,830
Don't blame yourself.

384
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,940
Live a good life.

385
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,850
I will watch over you from Heaven.

386
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,070
Han Zhou is...

387
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,280
His marking has disappeared.

388
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,200
Even if I'm to use my one life in exchange for two of them, it's worth it.

389
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,290
It's not worth it!

390
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,210
Can you please cherish yourself?

391
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,830
What's wrong with you?

392
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,240
Ning Liang, I hope we can return to the Biluo Sea together.

393
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,770
Of course.

394
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,540
Han Zhou, w-what's the matter with you?

395
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,330
I'm fine.

396
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,810
- Why are you here?
- I was worried about you.

397
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,000
Han Zhou!

398
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,280
Han Zhou!

399
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,210
Han Zhou.

400
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:37,980
[Records of Heroic Souls]

401
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:31,360
[Han Zhou]

402
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,270
I hope you will be relieved of all the shackles

403
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,000
and fly toward the sky.

404
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,190
Return to the sea and rest in peace.

405
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,300
[Han Zhou]

406
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,810
A'Ying, when will you wake up?

407
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,540
When I saw you getting burned by the sunlight

408
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,060
and I was unable to help,

409
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,230
I was really anxious.

410
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,270
A'Ying, I won't allow anything to happen to you.

411
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,760
I won't allow you to die.

412
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,730
If you die, all this...

413
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,080
All this would be pointless.

414
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,310
Your Highness, may Heaven bless

415
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,380
Kongsang.

416
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,950
A'Ying, you must wake up.

417
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,530
I still have things...

418
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,390
I haven't told you.

419
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,810
Your Highness.

420
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,580
- What is it?
- There's news from Jing CIty.

421
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,200
Yesterday, the Wind Falcon Storehouse of the Cangliu Military Camp was burned down.

422
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,500
All the Wind Falcons were destroyed, and there were many casualties.

423
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,820
Without these Wind Falcons, Cangliu is much weaker.

424
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,560
This is great.

425
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,890
In that case, we will be much safer in our movements from now on.

426
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,520
What exactly happened?

427
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,820
They say it was a strange fire that could not be extinguished no matter what was done.

428
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,120
Heaven has truly blessed Kongsang.

429
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,610
Let's go!

430
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,990
Are these two incidents a coincidence?

431
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,990
Did I really call forth the cloud and rain?

432
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,020
High Priest.

433
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,350
High Priest, wake up.

434
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,090
What happened with last night's fire at the Cangliu Military Camp?

435
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,910
What do you mean what happened?

436
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,080
High Priest, stop being sleepy.

437
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,400
Think hard.

438
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,590
This is very important.

439
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,090
Yesterday, I indeed saw

440
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,710
a dragon-shaped shadow

441
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,280
going toward the sky above Jing City.

442
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,970
With another dragon-shaped

443
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,730
shadow coming from the military camp, they met up

444
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,300
and broke through a barrier to become one

445
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,660
and go straight to the Jing Pagoda.

446
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,450
High Priest, wake up. High Priest?

447
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,410
- High Priest?
- Who was it exactly?

448
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,400
Who possesses such a great force?

449
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,160
Did I use my power to cause the lightning and thunder?

450
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,790
Or did this force bring them?

451
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,420
