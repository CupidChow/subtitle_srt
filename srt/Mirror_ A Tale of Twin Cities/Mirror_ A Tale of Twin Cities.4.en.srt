[Episode 4]

3
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,800
Princess, I asked the kitchen to make more of the pastries you like.

4
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,200
Since today's lessons end early, I will accompany you to the garden.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,500
Princess, I feel like you have been in a much better mood lately.

6
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,600
- Is that so?
- Yes.

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
When we first came to the pagoda, you were frowning all the time.

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,000
Lately, you seem much more refreshed.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,200
By the way, how come I haven't seen Su Mo these days?

10
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,800
He went to the side hall.

11
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,800
He said that since his eyes have recovered, he can do heavy work now.

12
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,700
- He went to the side hall?
- Yes.

13
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,800
I also think that Su Mo is a bit strange.

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Everyone else is battling to come to the main hall.

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
But he asked to go to the side hall.

16
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,200
Did he go to the side hall to avoid me?

17
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,000
Since my eyes have recovered,

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I should leave the pagoda as soon as possible and search for another way.

19
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,820
Your Highness.

20
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,800
Are your eyes healed?

21
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Thanks to your care, my eyes are healed.

22
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I'm heading to the Pavilion of Books to have a look.

23
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Why don't you come with me?

24
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
This Pavilion of Books is Jing Pagoda's restricted area.

25
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Those without permission aren't allowed to enter.

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,400
Then you...

27
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
I can't sleep anyway,

28
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
so I wanted to come and get a book.

29
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,300
By the way, are there any books you like to read?

30
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Highness should read whatever you like.

31
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,170
Thank you.

32
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,500
"Biluo Sea."

33
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,800
Isn't that where your Quanxian Tribe lives?

34
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,100
Is Biluo Sea prettier than this drawing?

35
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have never been to the Biluo Sea.

36
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,100
Then, you were born in Yunhuang.

37
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,700
Would you tell me your story?

38
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,000
My story isn't very happy.

39
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
The you I met at Xinghan Paradise, the you I met at the Bai Royal Residence

40
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,300
and the current you are not the same.

41
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,300
I want to know what happened.

42
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,100
I thought you didn't remember me.

43
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,800
I thought you kept thinking of me as a stranger.

44
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,420
We have always been strangers.

45
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Your Highness, do you know A'Lin?

46
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
She always helped me.

47
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,900
She also told me about a lot of her worries.

48
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,880
She's a really good friend of mine.

49
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,000
A'Lin is very fortunate

50
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,800
to have you as a friend.

51
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Thank you for treating me as a friend.

52
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Just pretend that my eyes aren't healed

53
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,100
and that you're not the crown princess.

54
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,700
All right.

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,800
It's so late.

56
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
Who's in the Pavilion of Books?

57
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,600
Who's in here?

58
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,400
You're so diligent. I should let you be the crown prince.

59
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
Who is it?

60
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
Stand there!

61
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,020
Stop right there! Stop right there!

62
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,200
It's you?

63
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,160
You're the one from Xinghan Paradise.

64
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
- You're mistaken.
- I'm not.

65
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,800
I saw you save that woman with my own eyes.

66
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,000
Tell me. Why are you here?

67
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm fulfilling the crown princess's order

68
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,400
to come and get a book.

69
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
Where's the book?

70
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,220
I didn't find it.

71
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,770
The Jing Pagoda is Kongsang's restricted area.

72
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,900
How did you get here?

73
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,300
How do you think I came here?

74
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,400
You're not really the crown prince, are you?

75
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm the Crown Prince of Kongsang.

76
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
I also don't believe it.

77
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Such a coincidence.

78
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,000
If there's nothing else, then I'll take my leave.

79
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,550
Is the crown princess doing well?

80
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,900
Crown Prince, you can go see for yourself.

81
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,300
I can't see her before our wedding.

82
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm very curious about what kind of woman I'm going to marry.

83
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,000
If the crown princess weren't as you imagined,

84
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
would you not marry her?

85
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If she's not the one you like, will you give her freedom?

86
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That is decided by the High Priest, the Heavenly Ring, and the Earthly Ring.

87
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
So you're resigning yourself to that fate.

88
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,650
Then, why are you still curious?

89
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,000
Your Highness.

90
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200
How did you escape?

91
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,800
He found out that I am the crown princess's servant, so he let me go.

92
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,650
Back then,

93
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,780
how were you chosen to become a servant?

94
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,190
I didn't come to the pagoda willingly.

95
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,810
There are people waiting for me at the bottom of the pagoda.

96
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,660
Now that your eyes are fully healed, perhaps it's time for you to leave the pagoda.

97
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,580
I still owe... Your Highness a favor.

98
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,620
I will pay you back.

99
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,140
Rest well, Your Highness.

100
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,450
You better remember my voice.

101
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,280
Do it when she is admiring the moon.

102
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,220
Why didn't you do it? Has your heart softened?

103
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,080
Think of a way to get into the main hall to be closer to the crown princess.

104
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,470
I've been at the Bai residence for so many years waiting for this exact moment.

105
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,670
Prince Qing hurt your eyes so that the crown princess would pity you more.

106
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,390
The wine is ready. Neither of us can escape.

107
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,110
Do it when she's drunk tonight.

108
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,060
If you fail the mission, all the Merpeople will die.

109
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,220
Tell me. Why are you here?

110
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,540
I'm fulfilling the crown princess's order to come and get a book.

111
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,880
When I first met him at Xinghan Paradise, I knew he was not a simple person.

112
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,030
Now he's here at the Jing Pagoda.

113
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,950
Who is he exactly?

114
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,500
Crown Prince.

115
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,250
High Priest, you came at the right moment. Come.

116
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,200
Your Highness, the wedding gown is ready.

117
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm here to have you try it.

118
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,190
That's not important. I have something important

119
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,340
I need to ask you about. Here. Please sit.

120
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,870
What would Your Highness like to ask?

121
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,460
Since I've arrived at Kongsang, I found that merpeople are everywhere here.

122
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,820
Aren't Quanxian people supposed to be living in the Biluo Sea?

123
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,930
Why are they in Kongsang?

124
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,380
Seven thousand years ago, the Kongsang king fought the Quanxian Tribe

125
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,230
and killed their sea emperor.

126
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,990
He also sealed Quanxian's dragon deity.

127
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,810
After that, they lost their protection.

128
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,480
They can never contend with Kongsang anymore.

129
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,520
They can only reside here in Yunhuang.

130
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,630
Why does Your Highness suddenly ask about Quanxian?

131
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,930
Did something happen?

132
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,220
When I first arrived in Jing City, I mistakenly entered Xinghan Paradise.

133
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,820
The people at that place are very pitiful.

134
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,250
High Priest.

135
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,240
Do you know what kind of business Xinghan Paradise does?

136
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,230
That... According to rumors,

137
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,380
that is Prince Qing's business.

138
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,550
At first, it was a place where the rich and nobility went for entertainment.

139
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,630
Later on, unspeakable deeds gradually began to take place there.

140
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,940
They torture Merpeople and use them as entertainment.

141
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,290
- Does no one care?
- His Majesty has many ailments.

142
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,090
How would he have time to take care of that?

143
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,920
Besides, it belongs to Prince Qing. Who would dare meddle?

144
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,800
Your Highness, why are you suddenly concerned about this?

145
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,910
It's nothing. I'm just casually asking.

146
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,540
Then please try on the outfit, Your Highness.

147
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,400
All right.

148
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,850
Come over.

149
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,970
Report!

150
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,340
Your Highness, a secret letter from General Xi Jing.

151
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,410
Prince Lan died in battle. Ye City is in danger.

152
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,340
High Priest, why didn't anyone report to me of Prince Lan's death outside of Ye City?

153
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,040
What?

154
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,950
I will go summon Xi Jing.

155
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,660
Your Highness.

156
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,320
Your Highness, since General Xi Jing sent you a letter in this specific manner,

157
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,710
there must be a reason.

158
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,410
You mean...

159
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,770
I need to see Xi Jing. The sooner the better.

160
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,250
High Priest, help me think of a way.

161
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,380
- I obey.
- Go quickly.

162
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,450
Prince Lan has died in battle. What do you plan to do next?

163
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,180
A Cangliu troop has been stationed outside of Ye City for some time now.

164
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,470
They most likely already know Ye City's patrol layout very well.

165
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,720
The leading officer is Master Peng, one of the five Cangliu masters.

166
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,070
With him leading the troops here to investigate the military situation,

167
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,620
I'm guessing Cangliu will soon send more soldiers to invade Kongsang.

168
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,480
We urgently need to mobilize soldiers to assist.

169
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,190
That requires His Majesty's personally written decree. I hope Your Highness can get it.

170
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,720
No problem. Leave it to me.

171
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,880
Your Majesty, General Xi Jing reported late last night

172
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,820
that Cangliu has been attacking Ye City, making it difficult for us to protect. Thus, we need to mobilize troops.

173
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,700
Then mobilize troops. Why didn't he report it himself?

174
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,850
Changyang Mountain is closest to Ye City, which Prince Qing oversees.

175
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,930
I understand.

176
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,380
If we insist on mobilizing Prince Qing's troops now,

177
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm afraid it won't be easy.

178
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,790
We need to give this further thought.

179
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,830
I know.

180
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,990
Why are you disregarding etiquettes again? Go down there to speak.

181
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,060
Look.

182
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,200
Tell me about it.

183
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,950
I captured Boss Jin of Xinghan Paradise during the night.

184
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,160
Xinghan Paradise is where Prince Qing colludes with other powerful people,

185
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,670
the wealthy make more money, and the merpeople are sold.

186
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,580
I heard about this long ago.

187
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,460
However, since I'm chronically sick, I cannot do much even if I want to.

188
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Shutting down this Xinghan Paradise

189
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,810
means cutting off his source of income.

190
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,430
But if you do that, you will be in direct opposition of Prince Qing and the others.

191
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,220
- I'm afraid...
- Afraid of what?

192
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,430
Cangliu is bearing down on the borders. The priority now is to fight the enemy.

193
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,600
You are my son indeed.

194
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,410
Come, come. Come here.

195
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,860
I feel at ease leaving Kongsang to you.

196
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,400
Your Majesty.

197
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,140
I'm just afraid that my body can't hang on much longer.

198
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,780
Can you call me Royal Father?

199
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,630
Royal Father.

200
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,540
Is it really that hard, you punk?

201
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,090
Royal Father.

202
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,000
My Lord, Xi Jing has mobilized the troops at Changyang Mountain.

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,380
I didn't expect King Cheng Guang would do such a thing.

204
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,160
I thought he couldn't come up with any new tricks and was about to die being so old and sick.

205
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,420
He dares to use Xinghan Paradise to threaten me.

206
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,680
Then, do we do nothing?

207
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,760
I must take this anger out on someone.

208
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,830
Since Xi Jing dares to mobilize my troops,

209
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,090
then I'm going to put a debt on his head.

210
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,520
[Kongsang - Ye City]

211
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,710
- General Xi Jing.
- General Hong Yuan.

212
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,990
These are new soldiers I recruited from the six areas.

213
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,410
They are brave, decisive, and confident.

214
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,920
They are willing to fight alongside you and destroy Cangliu.

215
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,140
Soldiers!

216
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,830
Cangliu has offended our Kongsang.

217
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,370
As the men of Kongsang,

218
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,670
are you willing to enter into battle with me and destroy Cangliu together?

219
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,100
Annihilate Cangliu! Annihilate Cangliu!

220
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,610
Xi Jing!

221
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,090
- Greetings, Crown Prince.
- Greetings, Crown Prince.

222
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,640
Enough, enough. So much etiquette with you all.

223
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,390
- Where are the Cangliu army now?
- Cangliu sent a great army of 10,000,

224
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,680
that pillaged and raiding the whole way, doing as they please.

225
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,690
I believe they will arrive at Ye City very soon.

226
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,790
You tell me honestly. Can we protect the city?

227
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,700
Even if we only have one person left,

228
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,490
we will protect Ye City with our flesh.

229
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,910
Princess, I lit the calming incense to help you sleep.

230
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,050
- You should sleep early, too.
- Yes.

231
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,930
What did you do?

232
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,080
In the end, Prince Qing chose the wrong person.

233
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,450
You always show up at the wrong moment. You failed even when everything has been prepared for you.

234
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,450
I might as well do it myself.

235
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,250
The princess has been having trouble sleeping lately. However, she will sleep very well tonight.

236
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,950
Your Highness!

237
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,980
Your Highness!

238
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,850
I'm sorry for offending you.

239
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,340
Su Mo.

240
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,990
Su Mo.

241
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
Your Highness, you are awake.

242
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,680
You were poisoned by the ghost spider.

243
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,030
That night,

244
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,190
the person who gave me water was not Yao'er, but you.

245
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,560
That day, you drank too much.

246
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,760
I could only give you water.

247
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,130
Thank you.

248
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,050
What happened to your lips?

249
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,780
Did you draw the ghost spider's poison to yourself?

250
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,840
I'm fine. There's no need to worry.

251
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,890
I'll find a way to force the poison out of me.

252
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,940
If you had a way, then you wouldn't have drawn the poison to yourself.

253
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,030
Since Your Highness is awake, I shall take my leave.

254
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,600
I'll have Yao'er come take care of you.

255
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,670
Come in.

256
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,780
This is the medicine that Her Highness wanted me to bring you.

257
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,080
Thank you.

258
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Let me ask you. How did you happen to know that the princess was poisoned?

259
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,820
Are you the one who attracted the ghost spider here to harm the princess?

260
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,970
- No.
- Then that's for the best.

261
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,680
Su Mo, let me tell you.

262
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,320
The princess treats you so well. You should conduct yourself well.

263
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,190
Don't betray the trust the princess has in you.

264
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,930
How is the situation right now?

265
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,790
The treacherous Cangliu troops are besieging Ye City from the east, north, and west.

266
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,010
According to our scout, there is a granary belonging to them 30 miles northeast of here.
(T/N: Chinese miles, one Chinese mile = 1/2 kilometer)

267
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,740
Their forces in the west are weakest.

268
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,620
It seems they are luring us on purpose.

269
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,920
So they know the principle of leaving an outlet free when surrounding an army.
 (T/N: The Art of War by Sun Tzu)

270
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,860
The city walls of Ye City are firm, so I'm afraid they don't have any other way.

271
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,840
Then we should put emphasis on defense and stop them quietly.

272
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,330
All right.

273
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,560
Reporting to General. The Cangliu army led by Master Peng has already fought their way here.

274
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,050
[Ye City]

275
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,830
Soldiers! Today's fight

276
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,260
is a matter of life and death for Ye City.
 [Ye City]

277
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,310
We shall live and die together with Ye City.

278
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,960
Live and die together! Live and die together!

279
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,990

[Ye City]

282
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,930
Stop!

284
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,790

[Yun Mo - Wife of Kongsang General Xi Jing]

286
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,390
Xi Jing!

287
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,500
Quickly open the gates and surrender.

288
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,580
If you delay it a quarter of an hour,

289
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,550
I will cut off one of your wife's arms.

290
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,820
If you delay it for half an hour,

291
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,560
I will chop off one of her legs.

292
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,300
Can you bear to see her suffer?

293
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,280
Yun Mo.

294
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,440
In this life,

295
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,430
I have no regrets.

296
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,430
A great battle is imminent. Nothing is more important than protecting Kongsang.

297
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,240
I also want to protect you.

298
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,520
General Xi Jing, you are hesitating.

299
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,810
Soldier! Let's first gift the general one of his wife's arms!

300
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,120
You are foremost Kongsang's general before you are Xi Jing.

301
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,910
General!

302
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,220
Bring her back!

- General Xi Jing!
- Madam!

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,020
Protect Ye City with your life!

306

[Ye City]

307
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,750
You may leave.

308
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,040
General.

309
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,740
I brought Madam's body back.

310
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,830
It was Madam's righteous sacrifice that protected Ye City.

311
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,340
I understand what you did.

312
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,400
It's all my fault.

313
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,930
I should have stayed at the residence

and protected Madam.

315
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,460
When I was born,

316
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,960
the Snow Cherry Blossoms had just bloomed.

317
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,370
So I believe...

318
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,060
whenever the Snow Cherry Blossoms bloom,

319
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,680
good things will happen.

320
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,120
Before leaving the Pagoda,

321
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,860
this is the last thing I will do for you.

- Su Mo.
- It's me.

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,670
You finally came. No one followed you, right?

325
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,710
No. Did you find out what I asked you to?

326
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,500
I have reported this matter to the elders.

327
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,770
They sent people to Jing City to search for Aunt Ru.

328
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,740
Prince Qing has three secret prisons in Jing City. Aunt Ru must be in one of them.

329
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,650
It's just that after you barged into Xinghan Paradise last time, the prisons are more heavily guarded now.

330
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,540
I'm afraid it won't be that easy to save her.

331
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,990
As long as we can find which prison it is, I can save Aunt Ru.

332
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,130
The prisons also hold many other people from our tribe.

333
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,240
The elders said that we shouldn't only save Aunt Ru, but the others too.

334
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,640
All right.

335
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,860
We must plan this carefully.

336
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,140
There's something else?

337
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,640
The elders worry that it won't be that easy to save them.

338
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,290
So, Elder Quan wants to make a blood pact with Prince Qing

339
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,480
and force him to release our people.

340
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,700
There are only three days until the grand wedding.
[Qing Royal Residence]

341
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,470
Don't worry. Before the wedding ceremony,

342
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,840
I'll surely fulfill my promise.

343
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:35,240
In the name of Quanxian Tribe, I'll make a promise to you, Prince Qing.

344
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,200
What did you do?

345
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,540
This is Quanxian Tribe's blood pact.

346
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,820
Once the pact is formed, we'll fight our enemies at the cost of our lives.

347
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,050
Release Aunt Ru and the others. Furthermore, promise to never hurt Bai Ying again.

348
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,290
Otherwise, I'll trigger the blood pact.

349
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,050
You should know of the consequences.

350
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,300
What joke is this?

351
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,680
If you were so powerful, how did you all decline to this state?

352
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,730
If you don't believe me,

353
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,800
you can give it a try.

354
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,430
- Your Highness.
- Princess.

355
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,140
High Priest.

356
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,070
What is it? What happened?

357
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,280
Both A'Yu and Su Mo are missing.

358
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,120
They're missing?

359
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,720
What do you mean?

360
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,870
Your Highness, I'm currently investigating the poisonous attack on you by the ghost spider.

361
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,720
Now, A'Yu and Su Mo are missing one after the other.

362
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm afraid both of them had something to do with it.

363
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,490
No. Su Mo surely had nothing to do with it.

364
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,360
How do you know it has nothing to do with Su Mo?

365
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,140
Could it be that Your Highness has not been truthful with me?

366
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,710
I have already told you about the matter truthfully.

367
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,200
I'll surely investigate it thoroughly.

368
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,710
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

369
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,760
Princess, what should we do? A'Yu and Su Mo are both missing.

370
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,260
- Do you think they were really in collusion?
- No.

371
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,310
When Su Mo came to the pagoda, A'Yu highly recommended that he stay and serve in the main hall.

372
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,390
Now that I think about it, it is indeed a bit suspicious.

373
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,490
It can't possibly be Su Mo.

374
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,570
P-Princess.

375
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,160
Then I'll go ask around again.

376
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,150
Princess, don't worry.

377
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,320
Su Mo, did you make the Snow Cherry Blossoms bloom?

378
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,150
You've already left, haven't you?

379
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,930
Princess.

380
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,200
You've been here for a whole day now. Let's hurry back to your bedchamber.

381
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,370
Princess, the wedding ceremony is in two days.

382
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,350
There are some things you should let go of.

383
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,360
Today is the Flower Festival, right?

384
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,370
Princess.

385
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,030
Do me a favor.

386
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,170
You shouldn't have used a blood pact with Prince Qing.

387
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:28,210
It's fine for me to die, but you're different.

388
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:31,750
We're all the same. I want to save everyone.

389
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,050
- But you are—
- Aunt, there's no need to worry.

390
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,340
This Prince Wang is greedy for life and is afraid to die. He'll surely give in.

391
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,710
Besides, we live longer than Kongsang people.

392
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,190
But I know the dangers of a blood pact.

393
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:49,630
It's not worth risking your life for Prince Qing.

394
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,380
Prince Qing isn't worth it.

395
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,440
However, you and the others are worth me doing it.

396
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,720
From now on, don't say that you're not the Emperor of the Sea.

397
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,890
Everything you've done is sufficient proof that you can bear the responsibility of Sea Emperor.

398
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,920
I should call you Young Master.

399
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,190
Young Master, let's go back to the Great Camp of Jing Lake.

400
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,270
I still have one more thing to do. I'll go back tomorrow.

401
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,530
Young Master, what else is there to do?

402
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,600
Aunt Ru, don't worry. It's just a small matter.

403
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,660
Such beautiful fireworks!

404
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,680
So pretty!

405
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,630
Look at how pretty it is.

406
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,000
It's quite lively.

407
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,020
Prin...

408
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,260
Miss, we came to see the Flower Festival.

409
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,250
Let's hurry back to the pagoda.

410
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,890
I haven't made a wish yet. Isn't that why we came?

411
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,350
Bai Ying, Biluo Sea is very beautiful.

412
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:04,380
Together, we can go see where the ocean meets the sky and listen to the soft sounds of the waves.

413
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,960
I wonder if we'll have such an opportunity.

414
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,840
[Qing Royal Residence]

415
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,940
Prince Qing,

416
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,410
Ye City suddenly has more guards. Do you know how that happened?

417
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,500
Master Peng, don't think too much of it.

418
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,660
Do they think they can defend Ye City with just a few more soldiers?

419
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,450
I've already cut off their provisions. They won't be able to last for more than a few days.

420
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,650
That's good then.

421
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,700
I still have one more thing to ask of you.

422
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,690
I'll report it to that lord.

423
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,020
Prince.

424
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,740
- Prince.
- What is the matter?

425
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,290
News has come from the Jing Pagoda saying that the crown princess has left the pagoda.

426
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,600
Slow down! Be careful!

427
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,900
Sorry.

428
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,390
Come here.

429
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,300
Wife, what did you wish for just now?

430
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,650
Tell me.

431
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,990
Look. What's that?

432
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,340
That's the Flower Deity Tree.

433
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,640
It's blooming so beautifully!
