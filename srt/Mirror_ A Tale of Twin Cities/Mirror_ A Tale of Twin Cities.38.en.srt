[Episode 38]

3
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,330
Emperor of the Sea.

4
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,980
It's late. Why aren't you asleep yet?

5
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,740
I've bothered the Quanxian during this time.

6
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,750
It's all thanks to you that my body is able to recover.

7
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,700
I'd like to ask you about something.

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,210
Go ahead.

9
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,400
I know I've forgotten some things.

10
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,770
But these things should be related to you.

11
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,210
Sister Hong Yuan and His Highness the Crown Prince both hesitate in telling me.

12
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,250
So I can only come and ask you.

13
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,820
Did something happen to me?

14
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,720
Also, does this pearl have something to do with you?

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,420
About those things that you can't remember, does it bother you?

16
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,660
I've been trying hard to reassemble those scattered memories in my head.

17
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,400
But no matter what, I really can't remember.

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,920
Even if I were to tell you,

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,750
it would only just be a story.

20
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,100
Why obsess over it?

21
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,980
Perhaps... these memories are very important to me.

22
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,710
Are they not important?

23
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,380
As long as you are alive,

24
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,920
that's more important than anything else.

25
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,610
I plan on leaving the Quanxian camp tomorrow.

26
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll take good care of Na Sheng at the cabin until Senior Brother gets back from Taoyuan Province.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,360
If you need anything...

28
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,620
Come find me if you need anything.

29
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:18,010
♫ I once walked over waves to borrow a bit of starlight ♫

30
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,430
♫ Yet, no matter what I do, I cannot see you clearly ♫

31
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,420
I don't have the power to protect you anymore.

32
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,090
I don't want you to be in danger because of me again.

33
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,260
As long as you are alive, that's good.

34
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,130
It is fine if you can't remember me.

35
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,950
You being alive is more important than anything else.

36
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,490
♫ So let love be silent ♫

37
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:51,000
♫ Help each other expand our horizons ♫

38
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,190
Why does he look so sad?

39
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,770
How am I supposed to regain my memories?

40
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,700
Emperor of the Sea.

41
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,450
Master.

42
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Bai Ying has forgotten her memories of me.

43
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,230
Is this what happens when you

44
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,480
force open the five rhythms and six senses?

45
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,000
Bai Ying and I...

46
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,900
are not destined to be together.

47
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,630
She removed the dragon deity's seal for me,

48
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,080
but I'm unable to bear the power of the dragon deity.

49
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,570
I saved her life,

50
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,460
but she has forgotten our love.

51
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,660
You've already done your best, don't blame yourself.

52
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,520
Master, I've decided to practice the Splitting Skill again

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
to fight against Zhi Zhe.

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,200
Absolutely not. The Splitting Technique's backlash is worse than that of the Mirror Technique.

55
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,010
I know, aside from the Splitting Technique,

56
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,920
there is no other way to defeat Zhi Zhe.

57
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,400
If there was another way to obtain the power of the dragon deity,

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,180
I wouldn't take the risk to practice the Splitting Skill.

59
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,020
Master, when it comes to this matter,

60
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,390
I don't want anyone else to know.

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,530
Sometimes I constantly wonder...

62
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,020
if the dragon deity doesn't think I'm the real Emperor of the Sea.

63
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,430
The dragon deity seems to have something else in store.

64
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,760
By the way, a mysterious power summoned me with ice crystals

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,090
a few days ago.

66
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,200
Summoned you?

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,860
They seemed to also have the blood of the Emperor of the Sea.

68
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,990
The blood of the Emperor of the Sea?

69
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,530
Ever since the dragon deity's seal was removed,

70
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,160
everything seems to have gotten more chaotic.

71
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,670
Perhaps we'll find a way to obtain the power of the dragon deity

72
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,260
if we put the chaos in order.

73
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,430
By the way, I saw someone enter the ice chamber today.

74
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,000
I originally thought it was you,

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,930
but I didn't see anyone when I went inside.

76
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,370
Who on earth could it be?

77
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,940
Na Sheng...

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,490
Yan Xi!

79
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,180
Yan Xi, you're awake!

80
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,300
That's great, that's great! You are finally awake.

81
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,070
You scared me. I thought I was never going to see you again.

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,420
Na Sheng.

83
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,090
You're crushing me.

84
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just too excited. I didn't hurt you, did I?

85
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,980
Did you suffer a lot in prison?

86
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,740
It's all my fault, because of me.

87
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,700
I shouldn't have let you come back alone. I caused you to suffer so much.

88
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm glad you are okay now.

89
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,220
If... If Ning Liang's spirit could see you from Heaven,

90
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,180
see that you're awake,

91
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,950
she would definitely be happy.

92
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,600
Yan Xi, don't get up yet.

93
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Zhi Xiu said that you needed to rest.

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,030
Have some medicine first.

95
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,340
I can drink it on my own.

96
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,420
Your body is still really weak after waking up. Let me.

97
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,740
What are you looking at?

98
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,030
It's nothing.

99
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,490
Your body is still weak after waking up.

100
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,860
I'll be here with you.

101
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,320
Here, I'll wipe it.

102
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
Young Master, your complexion has been getting worse the past couple of days.

103
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,550
Do you want me to take a look?

104
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,300
I'm fine.

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,020
There's one more thing I don't understand.

106
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,210
Since you've already removed the dragon deity's seal

107
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,480
and obtained the power of the dragon deity, why are there still backlashes?

108
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,570
I'm just not feeling too well. I'll be fine after resting for a few days.

109
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,120
Young Master, put your health first

110
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,480
no matter what happens.

111
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,520
If there is anything that needs to be repaired,

112
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,260
I'm at your disposal.

113
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,100
Thank you, Zhi Xiu.

114
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,050
Brother Ice Cube. Brother Ice Cube.

115
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,500
- Na Sheng.
- What are you looking at?

116
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,030
- Why are you still here?
- I'm going back to the log cabin with Sister Bai Ying soon.

117
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,150
Are you going to see us off?

118
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,230
There should be people to escort you.

119
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,370
Be careful on the road.

120
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,880
Master.

121
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,870
What happened? Why are you so weak?

122
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,040
My body's been feeling worse the past few days.

123
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,450
Is it because you're practicing the Splitting Technique?

124
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,580
Emperor of the Sea.

125
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,530
Master, I know what you are going to say.

126
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,010
There's something I want to ask you.

127
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,440
You've guarded Quanxian for thousands of years. I trust that you won't lie to me.

128
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,940
I want to know if I'm actually the Emperor of the Sea or not.

129
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,970
Of course, you are. You have the mark of the dragon deity on your back

130
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,890
and are able to summon me through ice crystals. You are the Emperor of the Sea.

131
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,390
Perhaps... I'm not the one

132
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,470
that the dragon deity is looking for.

133
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,430
7,000 years ago, I kept the blood of the Emperor of the Sea in a pearl.

134
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,640
Yuji swallowed it and gave birth to you.

135
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,820
You have the blood of the Emperor of the Sea running through you.

136
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,030
But my brother, Su Nuo, was born at the same time.

137
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,640
Su Nuo has already passed away.

138
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,930
What if he's still alive?

139
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,060
Perhaps he can bear the power of the dragon deity.

140
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,650
Perhaps he's the actual Emperor of the Sea.

141
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,430
Perhaps... the dragon deity is testing you.

142
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,090
You shouldn't have doubts about your identity.

143
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,740
Master,

144
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,350
it's my abilities that I doubt.

145
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,520
If I'm unable to take the Quanxian back to Biluo Sea,

146
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,210
how can I face everyone?

147
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,000
The poison has already reached Su Mo's body.

148
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,250
Now is the time to kill him.

149
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,500
Young Master.

150
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,720
Elder Quan, why are you asking for me?

151
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,350
It's been quite some time since you've returned from the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

152
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,960
We successfully rescued the Commissioner of the Left and Princess Bai has left after recovering from her injuries.

153
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,230
I wanted to ask what your plans are for attacking Cangliu and returning to Biluo Sea.

154
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,450
Quanxian's people are all looking forward to it.

155
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,200
Young Master,

156
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,010
have you encountered some difficulties?

157
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,930
Besides the Five Masters of Cangliu, the real one in charge of Cangliu,

158
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,460
is the one at the top of Jing Pagoda, Zhi Zhe.

159
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,840
Are you still unable to take down Zhi Zhe

160
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,690
even after gaining the power of the dragon deity?

161
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,070
Our attack on Zhi Zhe can't be rushed.

162
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,300
I don't want to see any more injuries and deaths of the Quanxian people.

163
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,660
Yes, Young Master.

164
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,560
However, Quanxian's generals and soldiers aren't afraid of sacrificing themselves.

165
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,930
After all, we've waited 7,000 years to return to the Biluo Sea.

166
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,890
We're finally seeing hope.

167
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,810
Young Master, are you heading out?

168
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,300
Do you need something from me?

169
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,650
How have you been feeling the past couple of days?

170
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,120
I've been feeling a lot better. You don't have to worry about me.

171
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,000
I should still check you out.

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,520
There's no need.

173
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,500
I feel that my health has almost completely recovered.

174
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,630
You don't have to worry.

175
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,140
Is there anything else?

176
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,000
That's all then.

177
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,450
By the way, Princess Bai left so suddenly the other day.

178
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,660
I wasn't able to give her the pill I refined for her.

179
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,890
I just finished it today and am about to have it delivered to the cabin for her.

180
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,070
Is there anything you want me to help you say to her?

181
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,030
Just leave the pill to me.

182
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,650
What are you doing here?

183
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,690
I came to deliver your medicine.

184
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,830
Have you gotten accustomed to staying here?

185
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Yes.

186
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,520
By the way, did you give me this Sunlight Blocking Pearl?

187
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,050
That's right.

188
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,860
It really was you?

189
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,390
Then what will happen if I tap on it three times?

190
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,930
I'll appear in front of you.

191
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,260
Is that why you're here?

192
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,060
This medicine is for you.

193
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,390
Did you also give me pills before?

194
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,700
Don't force yourself if you can't remember the past.

195
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,750
I'll get going.

196
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,130
A'Ying.

197
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,920
Your Highness.

198
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,890
What's the matter? Are you waiting for someone?

199
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,530
No.

200
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,030
You're disappointed to see me here instead, right?

201
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,760
Your Highness.

202
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,240
I'm just kidding. Where's Na Sheng?

203
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,230
She hasn't caused you any trouble lately, has she?

204
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,940
She said she was going to catch rabbits. She should be back soon.

205
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,660
Su Mo gave me this Sunlight Blocking Pearl.

206
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,930
You... know about everything?

207
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,590
About the Sunlight Blocking Peal and about him.

208
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,970
Do you know about everything?

209
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,640
Did he tell you?

210
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,920
He told me...

211
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,290
not to force myself if I can't remember.

212
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,090
I promised him.

213
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,600
That's not what you want though, right?

214
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,230
Otherwise, why would you be so upset?

215
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,810
I originally thought I still had a small chance.

216
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,330
Perhaps I'm just lying to myself.

217
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,310
Because even if you don't remember what happened in the past,

218
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,500
your feelings towards me won't change.

219
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,420
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to hurt you. I—

220
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,200
You don't have to say sorry and you haven't hurt me. You've never owed me anything.

221
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,720
A'Ying, if you asked me whether I hope you'd remember your past with him,

222
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,270
I would say, I hope so. Because only after remembering it all

223
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,020
will you be complete.

224
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,090
A'Ying, you forgot...

225
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,870
that you're deeply in love with Su Mo.

226
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,690
[Cangliu - Imperial Prison]

227
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,000
Open the door.

228
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,460
Yu Huan. General.

229
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,850
Why are you acting like a stray dog now?

230
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,410
You're at your last breath.

231
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,270
Do you like my cell?

232
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,800
I even have some more new and exciting things. Do you want try them out?

233
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,910
Staying silent...

234
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,540
I have plenty of ways to get you to talk. We'll see how long you can stay silent!

235
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm only here...

236
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,360
because I failed my mission at the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

237
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,530
As a soldier, I deserve to be punished.

238
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,290
It's not because I'm scared of you.

239
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,930
Typical of our General Yu Huan. How dauntless.

240
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,240
What are you smiling about?

241
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,460
You're just a mere blacksmith,

242
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,850
who devised some unheard of cruelty,

243
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,210
and you want to do as you please in this prison?

244
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,900
You're just one of Master Peng's dogs.

245
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,890
If I'm one of Master Peng's dogs,

246
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,490
then you, General Yu Huan,

247
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,880
are inferior to a dog.

248
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,880
You're not even worthy of being one of Master Peng's dogs anymore.

249
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,390
How do you think your saintess sister would feel

250
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,580
seeing you suffer like this?

251
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,420
Is she willing to do anything just to save you?

252
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,780
The smell her body gives off…

253
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,720
It's me!

254
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,120
Me, me, me... It's me.

255
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,820
Why did you come here?

256
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,030
I should be the one asking you this.

257
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,690
I came to save you. What are you doing here?

258
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,570
Save me?

259
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,210
You were going to break into prison?

260
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,270
I'm not that stupid. I have a token.

261
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,540
How could you do this?

262
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,110
I didn't get to save you anyway.

263
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,280
How did you get out?

264
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,250
Fei Lian, do me a favor.

265
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,730
I came to help you, didn't I?

266
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,410
Find me a temporary place to stay.

267
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,030
Sure, but you have to come with me.

268
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,740
Thank you.

269
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,450
Elder Quan.

270
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,070
Commissioner of the Left, why have you come out?

271
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,060
- Have you fully recovered?
- Yes.

272
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,800
Elder, why do you have a long face?

273
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,770
What happened?

274
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,940
Commissioner of the Left,

275
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,660
there are some things I've thought about for a while

276
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,050
and find a bit strange.

277
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,300
What's wrong?

278
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,360
I suspect that Young Master is hiding something from us.

279
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,800
What is it?

280
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,710
I suspect...

281
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,720
Young Master hasn't actually gotten the power of the dragon deity.

282
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,130
After Young Master broke the dragon deity's seal

283
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,960
and got the power of the dragon deity,

284
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,350
he should've led an attack on Cangliu

285
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,920
and taken us back to Biluo Sea.

286
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,360
But Young Master

287
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,280
not only hasn't done anything yet,

288
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,180
his body...

289
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,370
is increasingly getting weaker as well.

290
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,080
If Young Master really didn't get the power of the dragon deity,

291
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,390
he shouldn't have hidden it from us.

292
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,160
But now he doesn't talk about it at all.

293
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,800
Does he have some sort of secret or something?

294
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,610
It has to do with the everyone's safety in Quanxian.

295
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,820
If Young Master really didn't get the power of the dragon deity,

296
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,280
does it mean...

297
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,600
he's actually not the Emperor of the Sea?

298
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,300
He's not the Emperor of the Sea?

299
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,140
Th-Then we...

300
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,430
No, I need to ask and have him clarify.

301
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,170
Hold on, Elder.

302
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,190
Splitting Technique.

303
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,560
You didn't expect it, did you?

304
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,750
You thought you could beat me with the Splitting Technique.

305
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,330
The poison in your body was designed specifically for the Splitting Technique.

306
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,670
The more you use it, the more painful it gets.

307
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,910
Who are you?

308
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,260
Lock him up. Lock him up inside!

309
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,370
Get in there!

310
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,770
Lock the doors. Lock them.

311
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,620
I can't cry.

312
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,000
Su Nuo, I'm here to save you.

313
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,210
I can't cry. You've said before that we can't shed tears easily.

314
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,250
I did it.

315
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,390
Did someone bully you?

316
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,160
I must become stronger than others,

317
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,430
so that nobody can bully me!

318
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,560
I'll do it one day.

319
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,870
Who do you think I am?

320
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,300
You're Su Nuo?

321
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,530
I'm surprised that you still remember the name Su Nuo.

322
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,990
You didn't die?

323
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,520
Why didn't I die?

324
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,580
Why do I want to kill you?

325
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,980
We have the same mother,

326
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,250
but we had totally different experiences.

327
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,950
If I could,

328
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,710
I would rather not be Su Nuo.

329
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,550
As your younger brother,

330
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,190
I've only ever lived with pain!

331
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,390
To secure your throne as the Emperor of the Sea,

332
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,170
you've practiced the Mirror and Splitting Techniques

333
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,270
and made me suffer from the pain when it backlashes!

334
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,220
Let me ask you.

335
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,880
Is that really fair to me?

336
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,720
How is that possible?

337
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,300
Clearly I had backlash as well.

338
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,410
When you have backlash,

339
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,070
I also suffer from pain!

340
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,680
Isn't it funny?

341
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,340
I've never wished for any kind of power,

342
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,410
but I have to bear the pain from your backlash!

343
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,500
Why?

344
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,650
Back then I saved you from the nine-headed bird.

345
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,880
Why is this the consequence that I have to endure!

346
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,080
Then what should I do...

347
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,530
to relieve your pain?

348
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,800
I want you to give up on the Mirror and Splitting Techniques

349
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,210
or... die.

350
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,130
Then I won't have to suffer anymore.

351
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,640
You came here...

352
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,000
because you wanted me dead?

353
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,190
Of course.

354
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,370
Did you think I came to be reunited with you?

355
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,780
What exactly do you want?

356
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,700
I want all of your power.

357
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,500
I want you to die right now.

358
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,010
You've paid back...

359
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,370
what you owe me.

360
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,570
Young Master, are you here?

361
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,200
- Young Master.
- What is going on?

362
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,400
I have a question for you.

363
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
You came at the right time.

364
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,080
An assassin wanted to kill me just now.

365
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,760
But I've already subdued him.

366
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,630
Who was it? How did he get into the Great Camp?

367
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,360
My half-brother who has the same mother, Su Nuo.

368
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,110
Why does he want to kill you, Young Master?

369
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,790
Because of hatred.

370
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,910
Young Master, what should we do about him?

371
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,520
Ignore him for now.

372
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,680
He won't come to for a while.

373
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,140
Summon everyone to the council chamber for me.

374
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,500
Young Master, do you have an announcement to make?

375
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,700
Why are you asking so many questions?

376
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Hurry and go take care of it.

377
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

378
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,340
Master.

379
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,490
Why am I feeling so uneasy?

380
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,050
Is Su Mo in trouble?

381
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,940
Bai Ying?

382
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,300
No response.

383
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,810
Should I go look for him?

384
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,400
Emperor of the Sea.

385
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,390
Master, where am I?

386
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,980
You were attacked by Su Nuo.

387
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,490
I can only protect you here.

388
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,790
Master, I must get out of here.

389
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,730
I'm worried about Su Nuo hurting Quanxian.

390
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,250
I have to stop him.

391
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,070
Emperor of the Sea, the poison is running deep in your spiritual consciousness.

392
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,920
It could be fatal to forcibly wake up.

393
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,680
I have to get out of here to stop him no matter what.

394
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,060
I've thought it through.

395
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,280
All right.

396
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,570
I'll get you out.

397
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,360
However, please remember that you're the Emperor of the Sea.

398
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,540
You have to help the Quanxian return to Biluo Sea no matter what.

399
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,880
Do not hesitate. Do not be scared.

400
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,410
Thank you, Master.

401
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,320
I'll give you the power

402
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,520
to get you out of here.

403
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,280
Why can't I summon Master?

404
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,960
Master, what happened to you?

405
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,400
Young Master.

406
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,350
You've gathered us here, what important announcement do you have to make?

407
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,290
Gather all the men of the Quanxian army.

408
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,860
- We're setting out immediately to attack Cangliu.
- What?

409
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,770
Young Master, immediately? Do you have a plan of attack?

410
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,470
How are we going to attack them?

411
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,430
Don't you all want to return to Biluo Sea?

412
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,810
How are we going to return, if we don't attack Cangliu?

413
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
But I'm afraid we won't have a chance for victory if we attack without a plan.

414
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,460
Don't you all trust me?

415
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,270
Of course, we trust you.

416
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,770
But compared to the Cangliu army, our Quanxian army

417
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,290
doesn't have an advantage.

418
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,120
You all say you want to return to Biluo Sea,

419
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,400
but not a single one of you is willing to make an effort.

420
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,600
Fine. From now on,

421
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,080
we won't be returning to Biluo Sea anymore.

422
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,740
Young Master, what's going on with you today?

423
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,020
Why are you suddenly making such a big decision?

424
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,700
Why don't we discuss this some more?

425
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,450
That's right, Young Master.

426
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,260
Let's discuss this some more.

427
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,470
What is there to discuss!

428
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,050
I'm the Emperor of the Sea, what I say counts.

429
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,980
Su Nuo!

430
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,250
Stop messing around, Su Nuo.

431
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,630
What is this nonsense? Arrest him!

432
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,950
W-Why are there two Emperors of the Sea?

433
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,790
- What on earth is going on?
- That's his transformation magic.

434
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,860
Quick! Take him down!

435
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,520
Not so fast. Before we get to the truth,

436
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,850
Quanxian can't be at odds with each other.

437
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,520
Isn't that the big brother we healed?

438
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,560
Why is he fighting with the Emperor of the Sea?

439
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,910
You recovered sooner than I thought you would.

440
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,990
Why are you doing this?

441
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,570
Haven't you been longing to take Quanxian back to Biluo Sea?

442
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,000
That's exactly what I'm doing.

443
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,670
Su Nuo, who's control are you under?

444
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,780
Control? No one can control me.

445
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,870
You used to be good-natured.

446
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,010
Stop persisting in going down this wrong path.

447
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,710
Come back to Biluo Sea with me.

448
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,110
From the moment you abandoned me,

449
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,350
I've had nothing to do with Quanxian.

450
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,730
Zhi Zhe was the one who saved me.

451
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,220
Zhi Zhe, I'm the one you are after.

452
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,770
Leave my brother alone!

453
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,240
Su Nuo, if you want to become the Emperor of the Sea,

454
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,580
kill him...

455
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,200
Don't listen to him. Don't let him control you.

456
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,420
Only when you have absolute power

457
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,730
can you control your own destiny.

458
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,140
A'Nuo!

459
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,690
Only I can help you

460
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,240
become the new Emperor of the Sea.

461
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:03,010
Useless thing!

462
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,910
A'Nuo!

463
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,770
Why is Young Master on fire?

464
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,350
Is Young Master going to be okay?

465
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,820
What's happening to Young Master?

466
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,400
His backlash has dissipated.

467
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,960
It's the past life.

468
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,860
Young Master is inheriting the memories of all the past Emperors of the Sea

469
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,000
with the help of the dragon deity.

470
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,800
Young Master will be able to gain the power of the dragon deity.

471
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,170
Young Master is gaining the power of the dragon deity!

472
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,950
We can finally return home!

473
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,310
How wonderful!

474
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,560
How great!

475
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,410
We can go home! That's great!

476
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,390
Young Master has inherited the power of the dragon deity

477
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,490
and is merging with the Emperor of the Sea.

478
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,340
- Greetings Emperor of the Sea.
 - Greetings Emperor of the Sea

479
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,010
Seeing you safe and sound,

480
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm relieved.

481
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,700
Rise then.

482
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,950
- Congratulations, Emperor of the Sea!
- Congratulations, My Lord!

483
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,200
Congratulations on gaining the power of the dragon deity.

484
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,400
Is this the price I have to pay for gaining the power?

485
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,150
To lose my brother and to lose you?

486
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,880
Why did you bring me to your room?

487
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,720
The most dangerous place is the safest.

488
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,340
No one will suspect that you're hiding here.

489
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,570
They're looking for you everywhere out there. Where can you hide?

490
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,490
I'll only get you in trouble by being here.

491
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,220
Master Lang won't let you off if he finds out.

492
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,280
Get me in trouble Yu Huan?

493
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,000
Is this the first time you've gotten me in trouble?

494
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,980
You must listen to me this time.

495
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,830
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

496
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,310
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

497
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,810
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

498
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:02,620
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

499
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,120
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

500
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,600
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

501
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,430
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

502
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,090
♫ We've met several times ♫

503
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,520
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

504
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,580
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

505
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,000
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

506
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,490
♫ You live in there ♫

507
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:43,620
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

508
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,490
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

509
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,430
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

510
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,450
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

511
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:57,970
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

512
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,330
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

513
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,760
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

514
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:11,290
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

515
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:15,320
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

516
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,350
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

517
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,330
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

518
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,780
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

519
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,190
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

520
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:34,240
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

521
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:43,760
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
