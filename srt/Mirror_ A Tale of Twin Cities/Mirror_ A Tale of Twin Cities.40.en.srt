[Episode 40]

3
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,870
So, that antidote was really for anti-aging?

4
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,200
Yes.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
But you don't need to use that.

6
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,200
If you need something, I can prescribe something else for you.

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
What are you thinking?

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm a martial arts practitioner. I don't need these things.

9
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,800
When I get back, I'll prescribe medicines for healing wounds and leave some for you.

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
No need.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,500
A'Yuan.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
I can see that you're always frowning.

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Your eyebrows are always furrowed.

14
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Older Sister Hong Yuan!

15
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,700
This is...

16
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,100
Lan Xia, Prince Lan.

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you... Zhi Xiu?

18
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
Prince Lan, you know me?

19
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,300
I don't.

20
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,450
I'm... I'm going to go look for A'Ying.

21
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,100
Then I'll take my leave.

22
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,300
I'll go with you.

23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,000
If you want me to trust you,

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,400
first, tell me what's going on with that bottle of medicine.

25
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
What are you talking about? I have no idea.

26
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,000
Bai Ying discovered it. She's very worried about you

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
and wants to know what's in that medicine bottle.

28
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,400
You told her about this?

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,400
What's wrong with you?

30
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,900
That medicine...

31
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,070
is for my own consumption.

32
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,800
Since the barrier on Jiyi Mountain was removed,

33
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,400
I can no longer survive by absorbing weak water.

34
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
I'm a bird spirit. If I want to continue to live

35
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,000
without absorbing weak water, I need to eat other living things.

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,700
I've always wanted to transform back into a human being.

37
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,200
How can I commit such evil deeds again?

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,400
If you don't absorb the weak water, you'll gradually age

39
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,500
until you die.

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
That bottle of medicine won't sustain you for long.

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,400
You mustn't tell my older sister.

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,940
Since I was young, she doted on me the most.

43
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,700
Up to now, she still thinks I'm a young girl who's ignorant about the world.

44
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,760
How can I bear...

45
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,700
to let her see me, day by day wither away,

46
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,200
grow old... then slowly die?

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
What do you plan to do then?

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,400
The second day of the Flower God Festival is my birthday.

49
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,270
When that time comes,

50
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll find a place to go and die alone.

51
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,100
You can't rely on that bottle of medicine to last long.

52
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
I can help you.

53
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,230
Why would you help me?

54
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Bai Ying will be upset if you're in trouble.

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,000
Zhi Xiu said this really is medicine for anti-aging. Don't think too much.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Lin'er has also grown up. It's normal to love beauty.

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,200
Or perhaps, she fell in love with someone.

58
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
So, it's not unlikely she's thinking about her beauty.

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Anyway, as an older sister, don't worry too much.

60
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,340
Why would they be together?

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
Here. Take this.

62
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
The efficacy of this medicine can only last for a day.

63
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Stay here to heal every night. I'll wait for you.

64
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,100
In the end, I didn't expect that you would be the one helping me.

65
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,500
I hated you so much. Don't you hate me at all?

66
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,580
I merely don't want to waste time on unimportant matters.

67
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
You are indeed still so annoying.

68
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,000
However, I seem to understand now

69
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,600
why my older sister loves you.

70
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,000
For you.
[Zhu Yan's Notebook]

71
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
The Sea Oath of the Star Soul is the most advanced spell in Kongsang.

72
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Once you cast it, it can be life and death, going against the Wheel of Life.

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,400
Casting this spell is like holding a torch against the wind. It'll burn your hands.

74
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,700
Don't use this unless you are desperate.

75
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,600
This spell is carried by blood and supplemented by reciting its mantra to be concluded.

76
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
Are you sure you want to use it?

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,500
That's my problem.

78
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,300
What about the incantation?

79
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,560
I will think of a way.

80
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,200
What I hate to admit,

81
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,000
is that my sister didn't misjudge you.

82
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Did he... fall in love with someone else?

83
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,400
And after I had forgotten my feelings for this person,

84
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,970
could I fall in love with him again?

85
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,200
A'Ying, why are you here alone?

86
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
Your Highness, what brings you here?

87
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,100
I... I opened the Water Mirror and wanted to check the surrounding situation

88
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,300
and saw you standing here alone. So, I came.

89
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,100
What's wrong? Did something happen?

90
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm fine.

91
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Thank you for your concern.

92
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,000
Is... this because of Su Mo?

93
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,350
It's not. It's because I haven't seen Lin'er for a long time.

94
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,470
I'm just a bit emotional, that's all.

95
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,150
A'Ying, it's impossible to hide when you love someone.

96
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,380
We've experienced so much in the past 100 years

97
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,540
and have also lived longer than others.

98
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,970
During these long years, what sustained us

99
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,830
wasn't anything else,

100
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,420
but the emotions from our relationships.

101
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,500
The companionship among the six princes, the monarch-subject relationship between me and Xi Jing,

102
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,830
no, it's brotherhood.

103
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,520
It's because of these feelings that's why it's more meaningful.

104
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,300
Your Highness, what do you mean?

105
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,150
I'm saying that, no matter how many responsibilities we have

106
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,530
or how many tasks we have to complete,

107
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,370
we... are still ordinary people.

108
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,920
We must be true and face our feelings.

109
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,370
A'Ying, if it's hard to bear,

110
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,770
just cry and you'll feel better.

111
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,310
Na Sheng, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

112
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,070
I shouldn't have taken my anger out on you.

113
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,130
It's my fault. I shouldn't have pestered you to play with me.

114
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,820
You were upset. I should've been more understanding.

115
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,030
- It's my fault. I shouldn't have—
- Forget it.

116
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,710
I don't blame you. I'm very magnanimous.

117
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,920
You really aren't angry with me?

118
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,350
If I was angry, I wouldn't have talked with you this much.

119
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,990
Since we can't go outside today, why don't you teach me archery instead?

120
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,300
Hold this in the middle.

121
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,350
Are you all right?

122
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,660
Su Mo, why are you here?

123
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,090
Why didn't you come last night for healing?

124
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,640
I fear I can't make it anymore.

125
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,900
It's better to tell Bai Ying. Where is she?

126
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,760
Su Mo...

127
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,460
if you want to use the Sea Oath of the Star Soul to save her,

128
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,060
you'll have to pay a heavy price.

129
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,840
Will you tell her?

130
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,550
We're the same.

131
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,420
We aren't willing to let the ones we love most

132
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,240
suffer any harm.

133
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,100
I will treat you first.

134
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,310
Lin'er, what's wrong with you? How are you?

135
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,210
Sister...

136
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,950
You've always known. You've been helping her hide it from me.

137
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,590
That bottle of medicine isn't for anti-aging.

138
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,020
Come outside and talk.

139
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,350
Get some rest first.

140
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,140
Here.

141
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,110
Lin'er has been hiding this from me the whole time.

142
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,440
She merely wanted to spend her birthday with you.

143
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,720
So she's sustained herself up to now.

144
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,110
What about that bottle of medicine then?

145
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,320
It's to maintain her appearance.

146
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,460
Lin'er has always wanted to transform back into a human from a bird spirit,

147
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,920
but I couldn't do anything to help her.

148
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,690
When she was at Jiuyi Mountain, she didn't absorb any living things.

149
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,520
That's to say, she'd rather choose to die

150
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,370
instead of becoming a demoness. With such determination,

151
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,500
what's the difference between the body of a bird spirit or a human?

152
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,030
Su Mo,

153
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,180
do you know what I'm upset about the most?

154
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,310
I clearly know that my younger sister will be departing,

155
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,710
but I can't do anything about it.

156
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,140
I can't even protect

157
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,300
my loved one.

158
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,680
Lin'er, I'm sorry.

159
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,680
I found out too late.

160
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,230
Is there anything...

161
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,710
I can do for you?

162
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,290
Do you have any wishes?

163
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,780
I can help you fulfill them.

164
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,650
You're still here?

165
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
How is Bai Lin?

166
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,780
She's still the same. I don't know what else I can do for her.

167
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,280
Is the Flower God Festival that important to her?

168
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,270
The second day of the Flower God Festival is her birthday.

169
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,540
In the past, we would always go to the Flower God Tree to pray and make wishes on that day.

170
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,700
But with her condition now, I fear we can't go there again.

171
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:47,190
Since she can't go, let's create a Flower God Festival for her.

172
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,190
Here?

173
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,260
Go and take care of her. Leave the rest to me.

174
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,130
Yan Xi, I never imagined so many events would happen within this period of time.

175
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,820
I also would've never imagined that Brother Ice Cube would do all these for Sister Bai Lin.

176
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,050
Is she really going to die?

177
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,990
She's really pitiful. She's so young and she's going to die.

178
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,810
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to stand it.

179
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:28,210
She just came back from Jiuyi Mountain— Hey, Yan Xi!

180
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,270
Are you listening to me at all? Why do you keep walking?

181
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,170
I heard you.

182
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,870
Why don't you answer me then?

183
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,610
Yan Xi,

184
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,990
you've been acting strange lately.

185
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,250
Do you not like me anymore?

186
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,290
How could I not like you?

187
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,870
It doesn't seem like you like me.

188
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,700
I'm telling you. You can't like anyone else!

189
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,220
Besides, you were reborn because of me.

190
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,190
You can only like one person in your lifetime. Understand?

191
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,000
I was reborn because of you?

192
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,560
That's right. Isn't that so?

193
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes.

194
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,830
This is great.

195
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,890
We'll always be together.

196
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,940
Yan Xi, nothing can ever happen to you.

197
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,920
I...

198
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,800
Anyway, I can't be without you.

199
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,850
Since I recognize you, I want to be with you forever.

200
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,930
You can't avoid me or get rid of me.

201
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,520
If you dare hide from me, I'll follow you!

202
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,240
But lately, I keep feeling that you're behaving strangely.

203
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,280
Yan Xi, don't you have anything to say to me?

204
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,980
Na Sheng,

205
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,190
I dropped my things.

206
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,300
I don't care. I don't care.

207
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,470
Lin'er, why did you get up?

208
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,170
Sister.

209
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,200
Where did you go?

210
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Su Mo came to find me just now.

211
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,450
He said he's preparing something with Yan Xi and Na Sheng for you

212
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,660
to celebrate your birthday.

213
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,940
That's great. I can still celebrate one more birthday.

214
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,410
By the way, Su Mo prepared a wishing plaque for you.

215
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,020
The wish now isn't like before.

216
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,410
Just write your wish on this

217
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,490
and it'll come true.

218
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,860
Lin'er, what wishes do you have? I'll write them down for you.

219
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,160
If you were to write it for me, the wish won't be effective then.

220
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,630
Sister, in the days ahead,

221
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,660
you must always be happy.

222
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,790
Foolish Lin'er.

223
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,840
Look!

224
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,910
Our Flower God Festival will start soon.

225
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,760
It's so beautiful!

226
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,360
It's so beautiful.

227
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,440
Actually, the Flower God Festival isn't important.

228
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,790
What's important is,

229
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,580
being able to be with you.

230
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,550
I think...

231
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,010
I no longer have any regrets.

232
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,640
Make a wish.

233
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,900
Sister, I'm so happy.

234
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,890
It's really great to have you with me.

235
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,030
I hope you'll always be with me every day.

236
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,640
- Sister, what's your wish?
- May all your wishes come true.

237
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,760
You're cheating!

238
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,290
This is my last wish.

239
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,360
Please bless it...

240
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,390
This wish must be granted.

241
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:24,210
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

242
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,950
♫ Yet you tell me to forget the memories ♫

243
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:37,590
♫ I quietly listen to the story starting at the beginning ♫

244
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,880
♫ Why must deep love be greedy and long for such words? ♫

245
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,470
[The rest of your lives...]

246
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,460
I only have one wish.

247
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,740
That's to wish for you and Su Mo to live happily.

248
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,970
♫ In my dream is you ♫

249
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,010
♫ Awake from my dreams, I wait for you ♫

250
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,690
Kongsang has an auspicious bird named Lin,

251
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,930
who takes pleasure in filial piety,

252
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,150
whose soul has returned home.

253
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,870
Today, the auspicious bird is headed west. Don't grieve.

254
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,950
Princess Bai Lin

255
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,360
can finally return to the Valley of the Ancestral Kings
[Princess Bai Lin - Prince Bai]

256
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,160
to rest in peace.

257
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:37,990
[Prince Bai]

258
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,070
Time really flies.

259
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,050
That's right. Lin'er's funeral is already over.

260
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,930
I can see that you're in a better mood than two days ago.

261
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,830
I can't sit in grief forever.

262
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,440
We have to keep on living. What's more,

263
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,170
Lin'er would want me to smile more.

264
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,390
That's how it should be.

265
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,910
However, for you to recover so quickly

266
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,490
really is all thanks to Su Mo's companionship.

267
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,590
It's all thanks to him.

268
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,420
You still can't remember everything from your past?

269
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,030
I can't, but I don't think it's important.

270
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,460
Because whether I can remember him or not,

271
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,120
I know that he's in my heart.

272
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,830
It's just that I feel he...

273
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,490
Forget it. I may be overthinking it.

274
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,360
Did you tell him what was on your mind?

275
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,530
I... Do I still need to tell him what's on my mind?

276
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,190
Of course, you need to.

277
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,090
Previously you misunderstood each other so much. You also went around in circles for so long.

278
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,090
You were giving me anxiety.

279
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,020
But...

280
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,160
I don't know what to say to him.

281
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,390
Just tell him exactly what you think.

282
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,170
You missed out on so much time with him before.

283
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,690
This time, you must cherish him.

284
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,780
You were looking for me?

285
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,030
You came.

286
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,500
I want to tell you something.

287
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,200
What is it?

288
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,530
I've always wanted to do everything to the best of my ability.

289
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,300
But none of them were done well.

290
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,120
For you, or for Kongsang.

291
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,660
As long as you have a clear conscience, that's enough.

292
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,430
No, I do. I owe you.

293
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,830
What do you owe me?

294
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,820
I forgot you.

295
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,130
That's all right. Even if you don't remember,

296
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,050
my feelings for you won't change.

297
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,380
I know. We have a lot of good memories,

298
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,960
but I can't remember any of them.

299
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,060
Ever since I woke up, I've been cold to you.

300
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,240
And I avoided you.

301
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,550
I missed out on so much in the past

302
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,780
and lost so much.

303
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,140
I want to cherish you.

304
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:41,110
So, I don't want to worry about the past anymore.

305

♫ That is the sound of my heart... ♫

307
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,990
I like you.

♫ Because when it becomes sunny ♫

I still like you.

311
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,730
Did you hear what I said?

312
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,420
Do I need to say it again?

♫ Taking advantage of this light drizzle to caress you softly ♫

315
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,260
I heard it clearly.

must you go to Jiuyi?

323
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,180
I have an important matter to confirm.

324
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,530
What exactly do you want to confirm?

325
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,750
When I went to Jiuyi Mountain,

326
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,900
I found a strange barrier there.

327
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,420
Only the royal family of Kongsang has access to that area.

328
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,930
I want to know...

329
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:26,510
if that place will lead to Wuse City.

330
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,780
A'Huan, do you really have to confirm it?

331
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
A'Huan, why don't we escape?

332
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,800
We can live a peaceful life? Just the two of us.

333
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,170
Sister, actually Lord Zhi Zhe

334
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:43,100
didn't cure me of the Quanxian blood pact.

335
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,550
I'm sorry, A'Huan.

336
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,190
I didn't protect you well.

337
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,260
That's why I have to journey to Jiuyi Mountain this time.

338
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,530
If that barrier does have something to do with Wuse City,

339
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,320
then I can use it

340
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,870
to make a deal with Lord Zhi Zhe.

341
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,510
Only by doing this

342
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,050
can my Quanxian blood pact be cured completely.

343
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,690
When that happens,

344
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,290
we will truly have freedom.

345
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,480
My Lord, the people we sent carried out a search again

346
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,520
and have still found no traces of Yu Huan.

347
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,340
Issue an arrest warrant immediately

348
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,050
saying Yu Huan's on the run to avoid punishment. Once he's caught,

349
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,480
kill him.

350
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,440
Yes.

351
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,450
Yu Huan's a fugitive now.

352
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,260
As soon as he comes back, he'll fall into my inescapable trap.

353
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,350
Also, he became useless a long time ago.

354
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,320
Zhi Zhe won't use him anymore either.

355
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,690
Actually, even if we can't find him,

356
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:58,280
it won't impact the next step in our plan.

357
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,000
Report!

358
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,690
Master Peng, Master Lang is asking to see you.

359
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,990
- Let him in.
- Yes.

360
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,150
Master Lang is a rare guest.

361
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,160
Nan Zhao, you've been busy all day.

362
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,270
Why don't you go back and rest?

363
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,930
Yes.

364
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,590
Master Lang, just cut to the chase.

365
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,790
Have you...

366
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,640
found Yu Huan?

367
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,650
I should be the one asking you this question.

368
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,010
He escaped from your residence.

369
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,350
Even if nobody was caught with the evidence,

370
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:12,310
did you truly not know, Master Lang?

371
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,740
Master Peng,

372
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,590
Taoyuan Province and Jiuyi Mountain

373
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,390
have had successive rebellions.

374
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,500
You didn't send Nan Zhao there to crush them.

375
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,650
Lord Zhi Zhe didn't say anything about it either.

376
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,910
What was going on exactly?

377
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,640
You're scared.

378
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,630
Ever since Lord Zhi Zhe put Yu Huan in an important position,

379
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,120
he really hasn't cared...

380
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,200
about us Five Masters.

381
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,390
Tell me...

382
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,610
what is Lord Zhi Zhe thinking?

383
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,690
Instead of trying to figure out what's on his mind,

384
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,110
we may as well...

385
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,180
stop him from thinking.

386
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,020
Master Peng, you do have a plan up your sleeve.

387
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,570
Zhi Zhe, Yu Huan,

388
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,280
Kongsang, and Quanxian.

389
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,570
Only when they fight

390
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,320
will we have our opportunity.

391
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,870
May I...

392
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,550
join you then?

393
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,620
- Something's wrong with the barrier. Why is nobody here?
- Exactly.

394
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,960
Report to Prince Qing immediately.

395
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,830
- Okay.
- Yes.

396
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,600
Time's running out.

397
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,070
I have to work harder

398
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,400
on the turning into ash issue. I must come up with a way to stop it.

399
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,990
Your Highness, Qing Yuan reported

400
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,250
that someone had trespassed on Spirit Mirror Stage.

401
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,750
What's up ahead?

402
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,240
Why is there a flash?

403
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,700
What on earth is this?

404
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,510
Your Highness, what is this?

405
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,980
It's Yu Huan's Sword of Light.

406
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,290
Watch mine!

407
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,530
Rest for a bit first.

408
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:32,080
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

409
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,540
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

410
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,050
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

411
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:45,980
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

412
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,410
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

413
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,830
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

414
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:59,860
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

415
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,380
♫ We've met several times ♫

416
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,770
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

417
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:13,890
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

418
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,210
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

419
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:20,740
♫ You live in there ♫

420
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:26,870
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

421
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:30,750
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

422
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,770
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

423
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,640
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

424
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,220
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

425
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,580
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

426
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,230
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

427
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:54,660
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

428
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,620
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

429
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,640
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

430
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,510
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

431
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,070
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

432
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:12,420
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

433
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,530
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

434
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:27,920
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
