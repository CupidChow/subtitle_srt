- Did you need something?
- Are you heading out?

00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,380
The sun is too strong out there. Let's talk inside.

00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,240
I just wanted to see how you were.

6

The sun is strong outside.

7
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,530
You shouldn't go around randomly.

8

I... I was coming to look for you.

What's going on?

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,900
Thank you for helping us.

No. Your injuries...

I don't need this medicine for my injuries.

Then, what kind of medicine would work for you? I can go find it.

How are your injuries?

18

I'm much better after using the medicine.

How's Yan Xi doing?

20
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,700
We'll look after Yan Xi.

21
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
You don't need to worry too much about him.

That's good, then.

His Highness was awakened recently, and we've been chased around by Cangliu.

you said that we shouldn't see each other again.

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,400
and hinders the progress of campaigns...

164
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,760
Will be beheaded.

165
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,730
Master Luo,

166
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,340
you've always been in charge of

167
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,800
maintaining the communication and relationship with Taoyuan Province.

168
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,230
And this time, when the Cangliu troops went to Taoyuan Province

169
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,520
to round up the remaining Kongsang forces,

170
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,920
you didn't urgently inform

171
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,550
Governor Gao Shunzhao in time.

172
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,930
If we had the assistance from the local forces in Taoyuan Province,

173
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,050
we most likely would've captured the person with the Heavenly Ring!

174
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,440
Master Lang,

175
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,480
Lord Zhi Zhe bestowed you with the ancient text on immortal equipment.

176
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,340
You've spent thirty years developing them.

177
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,740
We've poured so much money and manpower into them.

178
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,950
Yet, they still crash frequently during battle.

179
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,290
It's obvious that there are issues with the materials used in their manufacturing.

180
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,600
I suspect there might be some embezzlement going on.

181
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,300
Ting died protecting Na Sheng, the holder of the power of Heaven.

182
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,150
The formal salute to Quanxian is to express our gratitude towards her.

183
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,740
It's been seven thousand years.

184
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,910
This must be the first time that Kongsang royalty has paid such respect to Quanxian.

185
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,540
How could we Quanxian deserve it?

186
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,130
Ting deserves it.

187
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,070
Quanxian deserves it as well.

188
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,360
If there's anything we can help with, please let me know.

189
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,810
I, Zhen Lan, and the six princes of Kongsang,

190
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,970
will surely give our all.

191
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,500
Now that I've returned,

192
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,790
I'm determined to bring everyone back to Biluo Sea.

193
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,410
The Entrapped Dragon Abyss, the power of the dragon deity.

194
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,430
Crown Prince, why did you suddenly bring up the power of the dragon deity?

195
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,860
Seven thousand years ago,

196
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,240
the Heavenly King united the power of the six clans

197
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,790
and drew Quanxian's guardian out of Biluo Sea.

198
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,960
He entrapped the deity in an abyss under Jiuyi Mountain.

199
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,310
That's when Quanxian lost their guardian

200
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,600
and became powerless against Kongsang.

201
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,640
I don't need you

202
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,960
to remind me of this.

203
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,480
Your bodies lack strength and aren't made for battle.

204
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,110
If the seal on the dragon deity is lifted,

205
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,180
not only you will obtain the power of the dragon deity,

206
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,950
all Quanxian warriors will have their powers enhanced as well.

207
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,770
At that time,

208
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,400
you'll be able to open the Sea Soul Plain with the power of the dragon deity.

209
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,300
You can then lead the Quanxian back to the Biluo Sea.

210
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,270
My Lords,

211
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,900
I have one more thing to report.

212
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,850
Other than the holder of the Heavenly Ring, there was also a merperson,

213
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,530
with his bare hands,

214
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,450
he destroyed a Wind Falcon.

215
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,220
Bare-handed and destroyed a Wind Falcon?

216
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,930
If you said that the holder of the Heavenly Ring caught us off guard

217
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,570
and brought down a Wind Falcon, then fine.

218
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,790
A merperson?

219
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,390
A weak merperson?

220
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,500
Yu Huan, Yu Huan,

221
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,370
you lost this battle.

222
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,300
If you wanted to extricate yourself from this, you should find a better excuse.

223
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,060
We can't identify any merperson this powerful in our registration.

224
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,540
Quanxian's Commissioners of the Left and Right

225
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,230
don't have such powers either.

226
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,760
Decrees from Lord Zhi Zhe.

227
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,590
[The Emperor of the Sea has returned.]

228
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,740
"The Emperor of the Sea has returned"?

229
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,820
As for the seal on the dragon deity,

230
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,460
I'll figure out a way to take care of it.

231
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,760
That seal isn't easy to break.

232
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,110
The power of the seal

233
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,230
is almost equal to the power of the Heavenly King from back then.

234
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,010
Moreover, to open the gold lock on the dragon,

235
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,470
you'll also need the Splitting Sword from Jiuyi Mountain.

236
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,500
If you're not from Kongsang and try to enter,

237
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,930
you won't get out unscathed.

238
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,420
Crown Prince,

239
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,930
what's your motive for telling me all this?

240
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,590
I and the hundred thousand Kongsang people

241
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,540
have slept under Wuse City for a hundred years.

242
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,800
Over these hundred years, I've experienced the pain

243
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,840
of not being able to go home.

244
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,500
I hope to see you all return home.

245
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,830
I also hope that I can witness

246
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,140
the hundred thousand people of Kongsang,

247
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,900
awaken.

248
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,440
Open Wuse City and see them go home.

249
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,210
Why are you telling me this?

250
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,090
I need your assistance.

251
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,010
I need the power of Heaven.

252
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,670
But right now, Cangliu has broken up my power

253
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,500
and sealed them in different places.

254
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,230
One of them is the Ghost and Deity Abyss,

255
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,890
allegedly 64,000 feet deep.

256
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,440
You can fit the entire Jing Pagoda in there.

257
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,310
I think you're the only people

258
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,780
who can reach the bottom and bring back the seal.

259
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,110
Trading the seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss

260
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,570
for the seal on the dragon deity.

261
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,520
This is what you came to me for?

262
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,160
So...

263
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,760
what do you say?

264
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,550
A hundred years ago,

265
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,770
another Kongsang person used me to cause harm.

266
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,800
As a result, we Quanxian suffered heavy casualities.

267
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,330
I'm sure that you haven't forgotten about this either.

268
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,160
Are you concerned that once I've regained my power,

269
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,690
I'll go against the Quanxian?

270
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,310
Rest assured.

271
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,420
If one day the rule of Cangliu is toppled

272
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,260
and Wuse City returns to the sunlight,

273
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,720
that will be the day when Quanxian returns to Biluo Sea.

274
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,580
That's not my concern.

275
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,270
What is it then?

276
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,430
We've both waited a hundred years.

277
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,020
This is the best choice for both of us.

278
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,190
I'll be awaiting your response.

279
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,890
Medicine god of the Central Plains, please give me the power to heal Yan Xi.

280
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,780
Medicine god of the Central Plains, please give me the power to heal Yan Xi.

281
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,270
Medicine god of the Central Plains...

282
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,530
Medicine god of the Central Plains, please give me the power to heal Yan Xi.

283
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,890
Medicine god of the Central Plains, please give me the power to heal Yan Xi.

284
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,640
Medicine god of the Central Plains,

285
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,710
- please give me the power to heal Yan Xi.
- What's going on here?

286
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,110
She said it's healing magic from the Central Plains and it can cure Yan Xi.

287
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,420
She seems like a trickster sent by the Kongsang

288
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,690
who wants an opportunity to harm Yan Xi.

289
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,350
Keep your eyes on her. I'm going to take a look outside.

290
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,310
Can I put the medicine on Yan Xi now?

291
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,280
If you're just putting medicine on,

292
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,300
why wouldn't Ning Liang let you?

293
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,040
She won't let me touch Yan Xi's body.

294
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,040
But how can I put medicine on if I can't touch him?

295
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Senior Brother.

296
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,920
Why did you come outside?

297
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,720
Hurry, go back inside. Don't get burned by the sun.

298
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm wearing the sun-blocking cloak. I'll be fine.

299
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,000
That's good then.

300
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,960
Have a chat with me.

301
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,390
These past hundred years,

302
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,080
I thankfully had Ting's company.

303
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,280
All these years,

304
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,870
so many people have come and gone, lived and died.

305
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,050
What did they all come to this world for?

306
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,700
We don't have control over that.

307
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,110
But luckily we were able to meet again.

308
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,140
I just hope that you won't leave us again.

309
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,500
Right now,

310
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,220
His Highness's seals are scattered all over the place.

311
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,120
Cangliu failed their mission in Taoyuan Province.

312
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,650
They'll surely come back and try again.

313
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,680
I'm afraid they'll be even harder to deal with.

314
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,140
We should give it a try no matter how hard it is.

315
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,720
Do you have any suggestions?

316
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,560
Kongsang and Quanxian should work together and break both seals.

317
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,120
Quanxian takes out the seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

318
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,040
We'll help them break the seal on the dragon deity.

319
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,560
Kongsang working together with Quanxian?

320
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,780
Does His Highness know about this?

321
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,650
It was his idea.

322
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,990
I'm afraid he's already talking with Su Mo right now.

323
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
A'Ying,

324
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,800
what do you think?

325
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,930
Since His Highness has made a decision, then we'll follow it.

[Imperial Prison - Cangliu]

327
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,990
Yu Huan!

328
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,710
Yu Huan.

329
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,240
I heard some noise just now.

330
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,840
All is well. Probably the cockroaches and mice running around all over.

331
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,380
What are you doing here?

332
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,880
Have you forgotten? When we were in Banbu City, you said you would treat me to some wine after we got back.

333
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,310
I understand that you're in a tough spot.

334
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,860
That's why this time I'm treating you instead.

335
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,620
I stole these from home.

336
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,650
It's been hidden for a decade already.

337
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,350
Try it.

338
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm imprisoned. Thanks though.

339
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,470
You're an idiot if you don't drink it.

340
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,990
You can only get drunk so many times in a lifetime.

341
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,100
I'm so happy that I have wine.

342
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,330
Yu Huan, you're a good person.

343
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,940
But there's one thing wrong with you.

344
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,510
You're too tough on yourself and everyone else.

345
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,260
Is it worth it to risk your life for honor?

346
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,430
I'm just fulfilling the mission that Master Peng gave me.

347
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,350
Everyone in this city loves comparing the two of us.

348
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,620
But in my mind, you're my best friend from Ruosong Hall.

349
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,220
My most trusted partner on the battlefield.

350
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,960
But of course.

351
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,800
So, Yu Huan, even if we were to die,

352
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,300
it should be on the battlefield!

353
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,920
Not in the power struggle between the clans.

354
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
Even drinking can't shut you up.

355
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,280
Do you believe what I said?

356
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,900
That someone destroyed a Wind Falcon bare-handed?

357
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,980
Of course I do.

358
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,630
If there really wasn't someone like that, with your abilities you would've definitely brought back the Heavenly Ring.

359
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,080
But what if I told you that I laid a trap when I was retreating.

360
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,970
That I still have a chance of capturing the holder of the Heavenly Ring. Would you believe me?

361
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,930
- My Lord, the mission failed.
- What?

362
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,100
Please don't be angry. General Fei Lian was there.

363
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,490
I wasn't able to make a move.

364
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,950
That bastard. I did this to clear your path.

365
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,490
Why did you ruin my plan?

366
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,610
Why is there a barrier here?

367
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,900
Wait up.

368
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,480
Someone's coming. Should we go check on it?

369
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,700
How should I address you?

370
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,430
Could you open the barrier.

371
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,130
They're people from Kongsang.

372
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,510
My name is Ning Liang. Young Master has ordered that no one can open the barrier.

373
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,810
Then I guess we'll have to talk to Su Mo.

374
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,480
If you two are going to ask Young Master, I have nothing to say about that.

375
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,190
Do as you wish.

376
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,650
What's going on.

377
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,220
Please open the barrier.

378
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,820
They're here to meet up with us.

379
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,920
Ning Liang said that she couldn't open the seal without your orders.

380
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,270
This is a Quanxian hideout.

381
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,900
We don't want too many people to know about it.

382
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,790
They are only here to escort us back tonight. They won't tell anybody.

383
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,360
Thank you.

384
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,870
What are you doing in a Quanxian hideout?

385
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,720
It's not a good thing to get too involved with them.

386
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,310
Did I just see Su Mo?

387
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,920
Let's talk inside.

388
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,970
His Highness is here, too.

389
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,310
All right. General Xi Jing, please lead the way.

390
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,400
General Xi Jing.

391
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,630
I really didn't expect to see you again.

392
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,040
Same here.

393
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,860
I also didn't expect that we'd meet in this manner.

394
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,560
Prince Zi often talks about you. He wanted to drink with you again.

395
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,170
- I don't drink anymore.
- Huh?

396
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,140
Seriously?

397
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,660
You're all here.

398
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,830
- Greetings, Crown Prince.
- Greetings, Crown Prince.

399
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Your Highness, why did you send a message asking us to meet you here urgently?

400
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,810
This is a Quanxian hideout.

401
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,120
Cangliu were after us in Taoyuan Province.

402
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,720
Luckily, Su Mo lent us a hand and we came into hiding here.

403
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,080
It was an opportunity for us to rest.

404
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,780
Su Mo has the power to defeat the Cangliu?

405
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,630
Su Mo is now the Emperor of the Sea.

406
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,710
What? He's the Emperor of the Sea?

407
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,120
- Then a hundred years ago...
- Enough.

408
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,820
You've been standing for so long, aren't you all tired? Have a seat.

409
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,480
A'Ying, sit.

410
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,480
Prince Lan, did you bring what I asked for?

411
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,020
Yes.

412
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,730
[Dark Golden Classics]

413
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,780
The Dark Golden Classics?

414
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,850
The High Priest said that we only have the the first volume in Wuse City.

415
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,690
He doesn't know where the second volume is.

416
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,150
The first volume should be enough.

417
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,040
It's blank.

418
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,120
Only the King of Kongsang can read the Dark Golden Classics.

419
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,360
When I first arrived in Jing City, the High Priest forced me

420
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,110
to learn the power to read this book.

421
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,960
I don't know if it'll still recognize me.

422
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,830
After all...

423
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,800
my power is very weak right now.

424
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,810
There's nothing in the Dark Golden Classics.

425
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,100
Can you really read it?

426
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,350
The seal on the dragon deity.

427
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,920
Your Highness, what's wrong with the seal on the dragon deity?

428
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,680
Everyone, I wish to collaborate with the Quanxian.

429
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,220
Your Highness, how can the Kongsang collaborate with the Quanxian?

430
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,790
It's true that Quanxian and Kongsang have thousands of years of grievances that can't be eliminated.

431
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,990
But now, both sides are being persecuted by the Cangliu.

432
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,280
Many Merpeople have been enslaved.

433
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,440
The Kongsang can't come out in the daylight either.

434
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,670
Only if the two parties collaborate do we have a chance against the Cangliu.

435
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,360
Your Highness,

436
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm willing to work with the Quanxian.

437
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,320
However, there's no foundation to build trust between us.

438
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,860
How do we collaborate?

439
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,730
I'm planning on breaking the seal on the dragon deity for them.

440
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,500
Seven thousand years ago, the Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei

441
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,250
combined the power of Heaven and Earth and sealed the dragon god.

442
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,100
As their descendants, how can we go against their wishes?

443
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,180
If they hadn't sealed the dragon deity back then,

444
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,590
there wouldn't be this feud between Kongsang and Quanxian for thousands of years.

445
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,730
It's time to put an end to it.

446
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,260
Moreover, the Quanxian want to return to the Biluo Sea.

447
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,910
We want our people in Wuse City to wake up.

448
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:49,400
We share the same goal.

449
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,600
Xi Jing had mentioned this to me before.

450
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,330
Breaking the seal on the dragon deity isn't an easy feat.

451
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,960
Your Highness, can you tell me why you want to do this?

452
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,920
One of my seals is at the bottom of the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

453
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,420
Only merpeople can reach this place.

454
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,650
I need their help.

455
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,050
Will that be dangerous?

456
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,200
- What I mean is—
- Su Mo hasn't given me his answer yet.

457
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,710
That's not what I meant.

458
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,120
I know that's not what you mean.

459
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,910
I'll leave it to you to decide, Your Highness.

460
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,410
I'd like to hear...

461
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,360
what you're thinking.

462
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,990
What should I do?

463
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,400
The elders in the village said that

464
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,860
if the patient can't swallow the medicine...

465
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,930
Then...

466
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,180
What are you doing?

467
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,400
What are you doing? These herbs are precious!

468
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,920
He'll catch a cold!

469
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,350
From birth, we're not good with heat. He doesn't need to be covered.

470
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,920
Doing this will only make him sweat and dry up. It'll make it worse!

471
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,720
I forgot about that.

472
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,260
I didn't do it on purpose.

473
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,780
How should I address you?

474
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,630
Sister... Ning Liang?

475
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,080
- I haven't transformed yet.
- Transformed?

476
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,840
Merpeople undergo transformation

477
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,810
when we fall in love with someone.

478
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,400
That's when we develop what you call a gender.

479
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,540
That means right now you're neither a man nor a woman...

480
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,260
That's not what I meant. Not what I meant.

481
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,860
It's fine.

482
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,540
So you've never fallen in love with anyone yet?

483
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,910
Wow.

484
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,560
You haven't fallen in love with Yan Xi have you?!

485
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,830
- Not allowed.
- You're saying nonsense again!

486
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,280
I didn't! You clearly just said that—

487
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,970
- Yan Xi!
- Yan Xi.

488
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,420
Yan Xi, you're awake!

489
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,240
That's great! Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?

490
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,080
Do you need anything—

491
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,110
Don't crush him.

492
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,180
Na Sheng, can you leave us for a minute?

493
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,480
I have something to tell Ning Liang.

494
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,720
Is it something you can't say in front of me?

495
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,560
Go on.

496
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,540
Fine then.

497
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,370
I've been taking care of you all this time, but you chased me out soon as you woke up.

498
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,420
That's not right.

499
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,500
Yan Xi only asked me to step out. He didn't say that I couldn't eavesdrop.

500
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,170
Young Master treated you himself.

501
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,420
You should be able to recover quickly.

502
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,010
I heard what you all were saying just now.

503
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,650
Don't take Na Sheng the wrong way.

504
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,890
She's just trying to take care of me.

505
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:20,100
You asked me to stay, just to speak up for her?

506
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,350
She's a very kind girl.

507
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:26,490
She saved my life. I owe her a lot.

508
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,830
Don't make things difficult for her.

509
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,030
I haven't.

510
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,670
Do you have feelings for Na Sheng?

511
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,140
- What?
- Do you remember the oath we took before?

512
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,680
From today onwards,

513
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,670
you will be warriors of Quanxian.

514
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,730
If you die in action,

515
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,580
your name will be written with your blood

516
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,670
and be remembered by the dragon deity and Quanxian people for eternity.

517
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,120
You'll see from Heaven

518
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,520
when Quanxian returns to Biluo Sea

519
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,230
and regains our peaceful life.

520
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,640
Now, say your oath in front of the dragon deity.

521
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,660
To the dragon deity in the abyss and to Jing Lake,

522
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,960
as a Quanxian warrior, I do not fight for honor or wealth.

523
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,760
I will have no personal feelings. I will not fear death in a hundred battles.

524
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,270
I devote my life and heart to Quanxian. I won't rest until I die.

525
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,100
If I break this oath, the dragon deity shall punish me

526
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,370
and I won't live one day in peace.

527
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,180
How could I forget?

528
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,960
Really?

529
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,720
We joined the army.

530
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,660
Swore to give up everything so that Quanxian can return to the Biluo Sea.

531
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,190
Including our lives.

532
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,840
You're my most trusted companion.

533
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,620
I hope that you won't doubt my commitment either.

534
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,710
I want you to swear as Quanxian's Commisoner of the Left.

535
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,130
I, Yan Xi,

536
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,180
Quanxian's Commissioner of the Left,

537
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,660
swear to the dragon deity in the abyss and to Taoyuan Village here,

538
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,490
as a Quanxian warrior, I do not fight for honor or wealth.

539
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,410
I will have no personal feelings.

540
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,320
I will not fear death in a hundred battles.

541
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,560
I devote my life and heart to Quanxian.

542
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,850
I won't rest until I die.

543
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,360
If I break this oath, the dragon deity shall punish me

544
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,570
and I will not live one day in peace.

545
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,400
What does all that mean?

546
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,050
They can't consider personal feelings before they return to Biluo Sea.

547
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,550
Then, what am I going to do?

548
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,960
Kongsang wants to return to daylight.

549
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,480
Quanxian wants to return to Biluo Sea.

550
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,500
They all share the same goal.

551
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,680
Brother Ice Cube! Brother Ice Cube!

552
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,070
Can you tell me how the Quanxian can return to Biluo Sea?

553
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,920
Miss Na Sheng,

554
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,450
we're getting ready to head out soon.

555
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,290
You should say goodbye to Yan Xi.

556
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,310
What?

557
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:27,070
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

558
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,550
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

559
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,040
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

560
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:40,880
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

561
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,380
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

562
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,930
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

563
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:54,910
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

564
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ We've met several times ♫

565
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,730
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

566
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:08,770
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

567
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,230
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

568
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,720
♫ You live in there ♫

569
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,900
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

570
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,770
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

571
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,760
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

572
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,750
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

573
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,290
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

574
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,600
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

575
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,080
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

576
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:49,640
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

577
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,570
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

578
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,630
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

579
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,540
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

580
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,050
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

581
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,440
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

582
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,490
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

583
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:22,830
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
