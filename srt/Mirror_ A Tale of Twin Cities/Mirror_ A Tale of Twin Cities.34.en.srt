[Episode 34]

3
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,410
Yu Huan... where's Xiao?

4
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,790
Had someone thrown her into the river,

5
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,450
she would have been poisoned by the Algae of Red Ghost and turned into stone.

6
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,660
Yu Huan, you have changed. I don't know you anymore.

7
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,450
You looked so murderous just now

8
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,660
and full of bloodshed. Is your heart made of iron?

9
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,580
She's just a spy planted here by Quanxian.

10
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,310
Why should we show compassion for our enemies?

11
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,990
By saying this, I also played a part today.

12
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,370
Why don't you execute me as well?

13
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,370
Xiao and you went through fire and water together.

14
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,060
So loyal. Taking old friendships into account, you shouldn't be like this.

15
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,890
Loyal?

16
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,930
Are you referring to the loyalty of

17
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,570
deceiving me for the antidote? How did you know about the Algae of Red Ghost?

18
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,550
Speak. Why aren't you speaking?

19
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,340
I know you too well.

20
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,390
Every time you stop talking, it must be due to a predicament.

21
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,660
Is someone forcing you to do this?

22
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,200
Who gave you the Algae of Red Ghost?

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,100
An insignificant Fei Lian,

24
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,690
what has he to do with me? What has Cangliu to do with me?

25
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,370
But since you are here personally to plead mercy on his behalf,

26
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,250
I can give him another chance.

27
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,970
I want you to release this in the water routes.

28
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,050
Thank you for giving Fei Lian a chance.

29
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,860
Fei Lian and I will do our best to stop Su Mo.

30
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,680
You don't need to know.

31
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,140
Yu Huan, if you don't tell me, starting from now, we will go our separate ways.

32
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,890
Fei Lian, Cangliu is far more darker than you think.

33
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,870
Why did I treat Xiao in this manner?

34
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,280
Do you know in Mirror Pagoda,

35
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,110
there's a Lord Zhi Zhe in Heavenly Temple?

36
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,800
Lord Zhi Zhe?

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,770
That's right. More superior than the five masters

38
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,960
and the real ruler.

39
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,700
He granted me the Algae of Red Ghost as my final chance.

40
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,350
He wants me to find a way to stop Su Mo from entering Ghost and Deity Abyss and releasing the Dragon Deity.

41
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,090
Yu Huan, be specific. What do you mean by last chance?

42
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,740
Yes. Of course, someone like you from a noble family won't understand this.

43
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,090
Do you know that in Cangliu,

44
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,420
how difficult it is for someone like me, from a humble background, not to be bullied?

45
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,990
I need to be stronger to be able to stand out.

46
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,720
I have been defeated by Su Mo many times.

47
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,410
Master Peng regards me as an abandoned child.

48
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,490
Master Luo and Master Lang hate me and hope I will die soon in order not to block your future.

49
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,190
If I didn't seek refuge with Zhi Zhe,

50
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,530
I fear I wouldn't know what would have become of me and my elder sister.

51
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,120
Yu Huan, where are you going?

52
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,670
Stranded Dragon Abyss.

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,900
You can't go. It's too dangerous.

54
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,930
Since childhood, you have been too well-protected by your family.

55
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,040
You are overly naive.

56
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,170
Let me tell you. As long as my elder sister and I don't get bullied,

57
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,970
I'm willing to pay whatever price.

58
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,730
Yu Huan.

59
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,280
Yu Huan.

60
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,500
Junior General, you can't go out.

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
Yu Huan!

62
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,300
It's quiet here.

63
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,890
It feels somewhat spooky.

64
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,890
I can't seem to feel the existence of living things.

65
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,760
I can feel there's a strong mind power in here.

66
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,090
We should be stranded here.

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,460
A pair of eyes appeared.

68
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,130
How is this pair of eyes related to the illusion?

69
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,510
Perhaps, we can find clues related to the

70
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,030
Stranded Dragon Ropes from these illusions.

71
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,340
I heard someone from Yunhuang is here at Dragon Silk Palace.

72
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,100
I was curious. So I had Chun Huang come and show me.

73
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,620
This is Ya Ren, we are from the same mother.

74
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,630
Hello, Ya Ren. Just address me as Bai Wei.

75
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,240
Hello, Bai Wei.

76
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,210
So how is it? Are you used to the food here?

77
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,430
We just caught these from Biluo Sea. They are very fresh.

78
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,110
Try them.

79
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,100
Give them a try.

80
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,400
How is it?

81
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,140
Delicious.

82
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,340
Eat more then.

83
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,200
Leave it here.

84
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,600
Leave it here.

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,830
- What is this?
- It's for you.

86
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,600
- Fish soup?
- Eat it while it's hot.

87
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,490
Delicious.

88
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,920
In the past, I didn't think in detail.

89
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,310
Later, I asked the elders and found out that people from Yunhuang are used to hot food.

90
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,440
You found out.

91
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,790
I didn't imagine there would be such a great difference between Yunhuang and Biluo Sea.

92
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,980
Can you tell me stories about Yunhuang?

93
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,560
Sure.

94
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,190
Once my older brother sneaked me onto a boat to see the sea of flowers.

95
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,110
There was a huge moon orchid blooming under the moon.

96
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,930
I didn't imagine it would be that interesting.

97
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,050
I really envy you. You can see so many interesting things.

98
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,830
When I'm much better, you can go back to Sea County with me.

99
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,280
It's my hometown. There's a lot of good food and fun things.

100
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay. I also hope to have the opportunity to visit the outside world

101
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,230
and take a good look.

102
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,250
Drink it now.

103
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,710
Come.

104
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,460
This illusion was so real

105
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,220
seen through the eyes of Queen Bai Wei.

106
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,060
I could even feel the taste of the soup and sense her mood.

107
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,110
Did you find any clues in the illusion?

108
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,750
There wasn't anything unique. Everything was very normal.

109
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,400
Queen Bai Wei doesn't seem abnormal either.

110
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,980
However, even in the illusion,

111
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,720
I could distinctly sense that a pair of eyes was looking at me.

112
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,030
We must find that pair of eyes immediately.

113
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,900
Perhaps, it's the crux for us to find the Stranded Dragon Rope.

114
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,460
You just recovered and you are practicing with your sword?

115
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,020
I have nothing to do anyway. Are you looking for me for something?

116
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,360
Here. This is for you.

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,740
This is...

118
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,310
This is Water Protection Pearl.

119
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,310
People from Yunhuang can't breathe freely here.

120
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,400
Chun Huang cast a spell on you in the past

121
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,990
but there's a time limit in that spell. This Water Protection Pearl is different.

122
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,480
Wear this and you can move freely in Biluo Sea.

123
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,500
Thank you, Ya Ren.

124
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,590
No need to thank me. You should thank Chun Huang instead.

125
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,440
This pearl was difficult to create.

126
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,050
It requires Lord Ming Huo's blue pearl and the spell of Quanxian.

127
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,330
He used a lot of magic power to create this.

128
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,710
He spent so much effort on this pearl.

129
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,990
I can't accept this.

130
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,700
Quanxian doesn't quibble with what we give to others.

131
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,020
If you return this to him, he'll be hurt.

132
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,060
Then I need to thank him in person

133
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,410
and ask what he needs along the way.

134
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,410
I'll definitely pay him back if possible.

135
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,120
If you truly treat us as your friends, don't worry about it.

136
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,730
All right.

137
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,450
So, Chun Huang had Ya Ren give Dispel Water Pearl to Queen Bai Wei.

138
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,050
No wonder the Dispel Water Pearl was in the hands of Ya Ren later on.

139
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,080
Based on the circumstances back then,

140
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,650
Queen Bai Wei and Ya Ren should've been quite close.

141
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,000
But why did Ya Ren appear in Jiuyi Mountain

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,080
and become Tu Luo in Misty Forest?

143
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,420
Reading between the lines, I'd say she hates Queen Bai Wei.

144
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,020
We have no idea what happened later on.

145
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,410
Maybe the eyes you mentioned belong to Ya Ren.

146
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,260
I don't think so.

147
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,320
The vision purposely showed us what it looked like 7,000 years ago.

148
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
It might be giving us a hint.

149
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,050
A hint about what happened to them

150
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,870
will also happen to us.

151
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,170
Lady Bai Wei, I'm Lord Ming Huo of Quanxian.

152
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,310
By order of Young Master Chun Huang,

153
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm going to perform a Quanxian ritual for your friends who died in the sea.

154
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,670
Thank you, Lord Ming Huo.

155
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,960
I ask for the dragon deity's blessing on your friends' return to home.

156
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,400
May they have peace and safety.

157
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,920
I ask for the dragon deity's blessing.

158
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,170
May your friends return home

159
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,460
and have

160
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,450
peace and safety.

161
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,160
Thank you for everything you've done for me, Chun Huang.

162
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,430
Where's this?

163
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,560
This is a forbidden area in Quanxian,

164
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,250
Dragon Cave.

165
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,720
Are there really dragons here?

166
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,370
Let me tell you a secret, which you can't tell anyone else.

167
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,540
The dragon deity is sleeping and changing its bones now, so we can get close.

168
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,130
Changing its bones?

169
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,660
The dragon deity changes its bones every 500 years, which takes 10 years.

170
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,170
If you do the math, it's just changed a...

171
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,650
A what?

172
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,480
A dragon's tooth.

173
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,680
I just saw you tense up and thought you were in a bad mood.

174
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,650
It could be Ming Huo's song I heard just now

175
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,300
that made me homesick suddenly.

176
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,530
Is it because we're not thoughtful enough or you don't like this place?

177
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,600
No, everyone takes very good care of me.

178
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,990
I just miss my family a little.

179
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,560
When can I go home?

180
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,120
You haven't fully recovered yet.

181
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,030
Biluo Sea is at high tide, so there are strong winds and huge waves.

182
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,200
It'd be very dangerous to go out.

183
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,190
If a huge wave came, no boats could dodge that.

184
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,620
But he must be so worried about me.

185
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,340
If you're still homesick, think of this place as your home

186
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,620
and us as your family.

187
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,660
It's not the same.

188
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,750
Why did you bring them here by yourself?

189
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,310
I'm curious to see why we need to pick so many flowers.

190
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,220
Something good. Why don't you pick all the buds off the flowers first?

191
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,760
Sure.

192
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,700
Why are you looking at me?

193
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,990
Nothing.

194
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,070
Smell it.

195
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,890
It smells so fragrant.

196
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,050
Bixin flowers are only available in Biluo Sea.

197
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,450
They have a unique smell. If I use them to brew wine, it'll surely taste good.

198
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,470
Did you brew all this wine for me?

199
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,190
I'll leave eventually.

200
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,960
That's why I want to give you a little gift before I leave.

201
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,670
Take it as a token of my gratitude for taking care of me all this time to you and Ya Ren.

202
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,400
This is Yunhuang craftsmanship. The wine we brew is especially sweet.

203
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,770
Do you want to go home?

204
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,140
I've been away from home for quite a while.

205
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,270
But before you go,

206
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,660
what should we do when the wine isn't done brewing?

207
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,390
Seal it in a vat just like this.

208
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,530
Wait a month before you open it and drink.

209
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,060
Isn't it drowning my sorrows when I drink alone?

210
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,000
What... did you say?

211
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,330
I said I'll keep it in mind.

212
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,480
But I still hope to drink it with you.

213
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,700
Sure. Then I'll drink the wine with you.

214
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,310
Okay.

215
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,080
Were you looking for me?

216
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,140
You're here. Take a seat. I want you to try this.

217
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,930
Give it a try.

218
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,540
What do you think?

219
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,630
What's this? Why is it so spicy?

220
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,450
This isn't water. You don't...

221
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,510
The way you drink is so interesting.

222
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,880
- Drink again. Drink again.
- No, no, no.

223
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,180
We can't drink wine actually.

224
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,170
All right. I'll try it.

225
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,350
The flavor is very close to that in my hometown.

226
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,370
Chun Huang, this is my gift for you before I leave.

227
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,910
Are you leaving right after drinking the wine?

228
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,010
I can't stay here forever.

229
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,550
Going to war is really tough, isn't it?

230
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,720
This is my responsibility as a part of the Bai Clan.

231
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
When people meet, they'll eventually part.

232
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,830
Chun Huang, it's a great pleasure to meet you.

233
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,960
Likewise.

234
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,450
Oh, the wine has no name. Why don't you come up with one?

235
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,790
And this letter.

236
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,120
Please send it to Lang Gan

237
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,160
in Wanghai Province for me. Then my family will come and pick me up.

238
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,530
Okay.

239
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,800
Bai Wei, your letter will definitely be delivered.

240
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,500
You'll definitely reunite with your family soon.

241
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,400
Previously at the Stranded Dragon Platform, I saw how Queen Bai Wei died.

242
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
At the scene were Chun Huang and also the Heavenly King.

243
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,800
But the Heavenly King still hasn't appeared. It's strange.

244
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,460
Maybe once the Heavenly King appears,

245
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,900
we will be able to leave this illusion.

246
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,800
Look! That pair of eyes is appearing again.

247
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
A'Wei.

248
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,800
- A'Lang.
- You're really here.

249
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,300
Chun Huang, this is Lang Gan whom I grew up with since childhood.

250
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,600
This is the Emperor of the Sea who saved my life, His Highness Chun Huang.

251
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,700
Thank you for saving her life.

252
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,100
You haven't seen each other for many days. I won't disturb you then.

253
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,900
Why have you just arrived?

254
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,400
I asked Chun Huang to send you a letter over 10 days ago.

255
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,500
I actually thought you were...

256
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
What letter?

257
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,400
You didn't receive the letter?

258
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
No.

259
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,300
I found your trail in Yunhuang via astrology

260
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,400
and then rushed over here.

261
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,000
It's not safe here. Let's leave now.

262
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,600
Not safe? They are all very good to me.

263
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,700
Very good?

264
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,400
I rushed here several days ago but was stranded by a merperson.

265
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,800
She even told me that you like someone else now.

266
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,000
Like someone else? How is it possible that I like someone else?

267
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,400
That's right.

268
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,770
A'Wei,

269
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,100
how can you possibly like someone else?

270
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,200
We're poor in hospitality.

271
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,400
I wonder if you are accustomed to the food?

272
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
I've grown accustomed to it during this time.

273
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,000
But A'Lang is probably not used to it.

274
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,800
Chun Huang gave me this pearl.

275
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,800
When I wear it, I can go underwater.

276
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,500
Brother Lang, a toast to you.

277
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,000
This is a wine that Bai Wei brewed herself.

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,600
I thought you couldn't drink.

279
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I can drink less.

280
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,400
I can hold back and not exhale bubbles.

281
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,400
Thank you for your hospitality.

282
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,210
Oh, yes! Where is Ya Ren?

283
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Ya Ren is not feeling well and is resting in her room.

284
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
I'll go and see her.

285
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
It's fine.

286
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,400
She needs to quietly recuperate.

287
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,000
If you stay a few more days, you'll be able to see her.

288
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,300
The war situation in Yunhuang is complicated. I'm afraid we can't stay long.

289
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,150
What's happening in Yunhuang?

290
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,400
Cangliu people ambushed the Wanghai Province.

291
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,600
Your royal father suffered severe injuries and is now recuperating.

292
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,400
It's you, not Royal Father, who came to pick me up.

293
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,600
- We should go back right now to fight back against those Cangliu people.
- Don't rush.

294
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,300
Even if we quickly go back, it's still useless.

295
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,800
The two of you care for the people.

296
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,500
The war is getting more critical.

297
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
I will definitely help you.

298
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,200
You still came.

299
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Please forgive me, Dragon Deity.

300
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,600
Why does Emperor of the Sea want to take away my dragon tooth?

301
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Generations of Quanxian have been safeguarded by you, Dragon Deity.

302
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,200
We've lived in happiness and comfort.

303
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,250
But in the land of Yunhuang which is 10,000 li away,

304
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,600
the people have been suffering from the turmoil of war.

305
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,000
I have met two friends from Yunhuang.

306
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,300
They want to quell the war in Yunhuang

307
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,200
and bring peace to Yunhuang.

308
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,000
Even though I am Quanxian's Emperor of the Sea,

309
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,500
I still would like to help them.

310
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,900
Therefore, I'd like to borrow...

311
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,460
borrow the dragon tooth

312
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,400
in order to make the Sky Opening Sword to give them.

313
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Sky Opening Sword?

314
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,600
You want them to unlock the Lazurite Lock that seals the powers of Attack and Protection.

315
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Do you know

316
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
when these two ancient powers reappear in the world,

317
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
the world may become turbulent?

318
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,300
I know. That's why the two powers were sealed off.

319
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,800
Emperor of the Sea, you may be eternally doomed with this decision.

320
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Let me ask you for the last time. Do you really want to do this?

321
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,400
I trust Bai Wei.

322
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,700
She is the kindest woman in the world.

323
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,200
She also has a heart that cares about all people.

324
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,000
I believe she will definitely bring peace to Yunhuang.

325
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,100
At that time, Quanxian and Kongsang will be friends,

326
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,000
and the world will be at peace. Won't that be the greatest happening?

327
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,200
All right, I agree.

328
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,800
But you must remember, the only way to fight against the void

329
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,900
is to create and to safeguard.

330
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,000
What do you mean, Dragon Deity?

331
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is the revelation given by the ancestors to the Emperor of the Sea.

332
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You need to comprehend it yourself.

333
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,100
I hope this prophecy

334
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,500
will never come true.

335
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,200
There is a small island in the middle of Jing Lake.

336
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Two ancient powers: Attack and Protection are sealed there.

337
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,000
If you can get these two powers, you will be invincible in Yunhuang.

338
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Why were the powers sealed? Who sealed them?

339
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,500
Someone in the past obtained the two powers

340
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,000
and unified Yunhuang, but could not keep them under control.

341
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,500
So he sealed the two powers on that small island in the middle of Jing Lake.

342
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,900
No one can get close.

343
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,000
We don't know if it'll be perilous or a blessing to have such strong powers.

344
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,600
The powers themselves do not differentiate between good and evil.

345
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
As long as the two powers of Attack and Protection are mutually coordinated,

346
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,700
the balance will be maintained.

347
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,820
How do we get the powers?

348
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,900
Unlock the Lazurite Lock, then you can get rid of the seal.

349
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,600
How to unlock it?

350
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,900
Leave.

351
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,720
Please sit.

352
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,860
Open it.

353
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,700
Such strong force!

354
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,500
This is the Splitting Sword, made with the tooth of the dragon deity.

355
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,400
The power of the dragon deity is embedded in it.

356
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,000
With it, you can open the Lazurite Lock

357
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,600
and get rid of the seal. I will give you the sword

358
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
as a gift of friendship between Yunhuang and Quanxian.

359
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,300
You will give us such a precious Splitting Sword?

360
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,300
I hope you can find the power to protect Yunhuang.

361
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Your benevolent gift of this sword shall never be forgotten.

362
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,620
I hope we will meet again.

363
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,610
A'Wei.

364
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,680
Oh, yes! Chun Huang, have you decided on the name for this wine?

365
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,560
Let's call it...

366
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,440
Nian Gui.
(Remember to Return)

367
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,590
Good name!

368
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,320
Chun Huang, I will miss all of you and Quanxian.

369
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,940
Someday, if A'Lang and I can bring peace to Yunhuang,

370
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,490
we will definitely return to repay your benevolence.

371
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,310
The scar on your hand was left when you went to get the Splitting Sword in Jiuyi Mountain.

372
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,050
Chun Huang from 7,000 years ago also had the same scar on his hand.

373
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,520
Those two prophetic phrases that the dragon deity told Chun Huang just now,

374
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,710
previously at Tianque Mountain,

375
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,580
Na Sheng also foretold it.

376
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,290
The only way to fight against the void

377
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,250
is through creation and protection.

378
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,690
[Every beginning starts with an end. The only way to fight the void is through creation and protection]

379
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,140
Ever since we entered the Stranded Dragon Abyss,

380
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,910
these things that have happened one by one

381
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,060
seem to be predetermined.

382
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,850
Not only do we resemble them,

383
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,500
there's also the seashell pearl for blessings, Heaven-defying Sword,

384
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,050
and the scar on your hand. These prophecies...

385
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,290
There are too many similarities.

386
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,580
Even if it's a predetermined destiny, so what?

387
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,860
We're us; they're them.

388
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,810
I never believed in fate.

389
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,300
I don't know what will happen later.

390
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,160
The turmoil in Yunhuang

391
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,640
is probably related to the two powers of Attack and Protection.

392
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,850
In the first year of the Era of Tai Chu,

393
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,410
the king and the queen arrived together at the island in Jing Lake.

394
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,960
They opened the Lazurite Lock.

395
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,560
The ancient powers of Attack and Protection that created the universe

396
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,090
were released into the world.

397
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,100
The divine powers were concealed into the Earth and Heavenly Rings

398
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:02,320
and acknowledged the king and the queen as masters to safeguard Yunhuang.

399
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,380
The two of them later fought together to expand control of the world,

400
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,160
pacified Yunhuang, calmed the Seven Seas,

401
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,330
established the capital in Jing City.

402
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,130
In the tenth year in the Era of Tai Chu, Quanxian's envoy

403
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,040
brought treasures to seek an audience.

404
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,150
A'Lang, this is Ya Ren who I've often mentioned to you.

405
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,700
A'Lang.

406
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,520
Your Majesty, King Lang Gan,

407
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,770
Princess Ya Ren.

408
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,860
As ordered by the Emperor of the Sea, I've come to congratulate Kongsang's unification of the six lands.

409
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,800
Emperor of the Sea has always respected Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei.

410
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,830
Your wisdom and valiance have blessed all the people.

411
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,470
Therefore, Quanxian would like to establish an alliance with Kongsang.

412
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,200
I've brought these treasures from Quanxian to show our sincerity,

413
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,780
in the hope that our friendship with Kongsang will last forever through the generations.

414
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,100
Many thanks.

415
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,470
This wine is Nian Gui.

416
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,170
I wonder if I may have the luck to drink with Your Majesty.

417
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,970
to express our congratulations.

418
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,360
I appreciate the thought.

419
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,620
Ya Ren, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

420
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,560
We didn't see you when we left last time.

421
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,290
It's been ten years now.

422
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,700
How about we go that way and reminisce?

423
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,490
A'Lang is still busy with other affairs.

424
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,910
All right.

425
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,860
A'Lang and I have been fighting in Yunhuang for many years.

426
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,000
We almost lost our lives several times.

427
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,930
When I see the present Kongsang, I can't even believe it myself.

428
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,090
Of course, if you and Chun Huang didn't help us back then,

429
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,090
I don't know when we would have seen days like these.

430
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,790
I came to Jing City and see that you have been elevated to queen

431
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:03,240
and are supported by 100,000 people. I'm truly happy for you.

432
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,270
You fought for the people, and Heaven bestowed you with the power.

433
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,510
Oh, yes!, I was going to ask you.

434
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,810
When did you transform?

435
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,790
It was previously when I was feeling unwell.

436
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,740
The person to have won our Princess Ya Ren's heart

437
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,190
must be a handsome man.

438
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,960
He was a prince from a foreign land.

439
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,090
He carried a sword and wandered to the Biluo Sea at that time.

440
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,010
I saved him and helped him heal his injuries.

441
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,960
But his heart belonged to someone else.

442
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,340
I transformed for him but also missed out for eternity.

443
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,430
Your people aren't from here.

444
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,960
You cannot breathe underwater.

445
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,600
I can only use water formation to help you heal.

446
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,720
Don't leave! Don't leave!

447
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,070
Don't go!

448
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,670
I won't leave.

449
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,070
I won't leave, just get let go.

450
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,670
Don't go!

451
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,140
I won't let go.

452
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,130
I won't let go.

453
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,990
I won't let go.

454
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,710
Don't let go.

455
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,510
Why do you insist on leaving?

456
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,020
She is the only one in my heart.

457
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,950
I'm going to find her.

458
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,550
She's already in love with someone else.

459
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,530
Don't leave!

460
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,330
Don't go! Don't leave!

461
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,160
Ya Ren, are you transforming?

462
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,560
Chun Huang, I've made a mistake.

463
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,750
I'm in great pain.

464
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,960
Why is it so painful?

465
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,610
You've fallen for someone from a foreign land.

466
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,410
I've made a mistake.

467
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,610
I've made a mistake.

468
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,260
The most painful thing in the world

469
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,510
is to love someone that doesn't belong to you.

470
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,370
Ya Ren, hurry and tell me.

471
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,660
Who exactly is this person?

472
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:08,120
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

473
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,580
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

474
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,110
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

475
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:21,980
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

476
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,410
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

477
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,880
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

478
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,840
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

479
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,440
♫ We've met several times ♫

480
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,850
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

481
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:49,870
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

482
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:53,410
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

483
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,740
♫ You live in there ♫

484
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:02,970
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

485
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,820
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

486
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,760
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

487
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,850
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

488
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,340
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

489
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,680
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

490
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,200
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

491
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,630
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

492
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,620
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

493
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,710
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

494
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,610
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

495
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,150
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

496
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,470
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

497
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:53,510
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

498
00:44:53,510 --> 00:45:04,060
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
