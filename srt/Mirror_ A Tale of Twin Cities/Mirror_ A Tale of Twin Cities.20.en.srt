[Mirror: A Tale of Twin Cities]

00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,950
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,030
Does Your Highness think that the strange eyes in the Water Mirror

4
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,230
belong to the black-robed person that Su Mo talked about?

5
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,730
Yes.

6
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,930
Through the Water Mirror, I heard a deep and sinister voice.

7
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,070
He seemed to be old.

8
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,830
I suspect that he's a person hiding behind Cangliu,

9
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,630
the person that also knows Kongsang really well.

10
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,530
In that case, inviting you to go alone

11
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,920
has to be a trap no matter how you look at it.

12
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,200
Then, what does Your Highness plan to do?

13
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,570
Su Mo thinks I should stay put.

14
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,660
But if I don't agree to this invitation to go,

15
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,620
many mysteries can't be solved.

16
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,720
Then, have him go with you?

17
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,490
I've looked for him, but he doesn't seem to be at the main camp.

18
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,800
This isn't good. It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

19
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,300
That's why I'm here to see you.

20
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,500
So you've been waiting here?

21
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,480
Big Brother, did your master leave you

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,610
something like a Jade Bone Paper Umbrella?

23
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,440
What did you call me?

24
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,010
Great General Xi Jing.

25
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,820
Lord Holy Sword.

26
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,360
Does the heir to the Holy Sword Sect have a Jade Bone Paper Umbrella?

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,640
The kind that can resist spells and conceal oneself?

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,570
Yes, yes, yes.

29
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,130
Bring it and go up there with me.

30
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,460
Sure, I can, but I don't know how strong the Cangliu barrier is.

31
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,320
- Will they see us through?
- What's there to be afraid of?

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,730
Let's take the gamble.

33
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,630
At worst, if we can't fight them off, we'll just turn around and run away.

34
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,850
Don't forget. I also know invisibility techniques.

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,730
Of course, there's a time constraint to it though.

36
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,280
All right. When we get up to the pagoda, I'll look for that person and you go to the library for me.

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,480
Check if the second volume of the Dark Golden Classics is there.

38
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,770
If you can find it, later on when I try to unseal the Six Directions Seal,

39
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,560
it'll be of great help.

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,410
When does Your Highness plan to go then?

41
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,510
- Should we wait for A'Ying to—
- No need.

42
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,130
I don't want her to go up there.

43
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,530
There are too many bad memories for her there. I don't want her to recall them.

44
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,420
Why didn't she come?

45
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,620
How would I know?

46
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,290
I don't know where she went or when she'll return.

47
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,710
All right.

48
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,360
Hey!

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,990
- I'm going to get the umbrella.
- Oh.

50
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,990
Xi Jing, hurry and look for it.

51
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,800
- Come here.
- What's the matter?

52
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,730
I see that you're diligently studying spells every day.

53
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,220
It's really not easy, so I should encourage you.

54
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,310
You want to reward me? Are you going to give me gold?

55
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,560
I said encourage, not reward.

56
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,610
I knew you weren't that generous. Not like Brother Ice Cube, he knows to give me money.

57
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,670
Little money grubber.

58
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,520
Brother Crown Prince, are there any fun things to do in Jing City?

59
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,920
It wasn't easy for me to finally get to Yunhuang, but I'm either running from pursuit or hiding in this hut to practice spells.

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,660
- Why did I come to Yunhuang.
- In Yunhuang, there are actually quite a lot of fun places.

61
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,320
But, right now—

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,520
Brother Crown Prince, there are no buts. Hurry and tell.

63
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,190
Such a coincidence. It happens to be the Flower God Festival today.

64
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,760
Flower God Festival? This sounds interesting. Tell me more.

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,930
There's an old tree in Jing City.

66
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,680
People call this tree the Flower God Tree.

67
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,910
When this tree blooms, people will go to the tree to view the flowers and make wishes.

68
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,490
It's so lively all over the streets.

69
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,750
Are you talking about 100 years ago?

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,800
Yeah.

71
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,160
After these 100 years, I wonder if the Flower God Tree will still bloom.

72
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,540
Yan Xi, let's go together today.

73
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,820
- This...
- This what?

74
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,850
Aren't you protecting me?

75
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,160
If I run into danger in Jing City, what will I do?

76
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,560
- Just don't go then.
- No, I have to go.

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,100
This Flower God Tree only blooms once a year. I've never seen an old tree that blooms before.

78
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,010
All right then.

79
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,580
Brother Crown Prince, are you going with Uncle Xi Jing?

80
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,650
Xi Jing and I have something else we need to do.

81
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,040
Let's go with Sister Bai Ying then.

82
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,060
I'll come later.

83
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,260
Brother Crown Prince, do you have a mission of some sort tonight?

84
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,550
As soon as I mentioned that Sister Bai Ying will go, then you're going too.

85
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,690
Therefore...

86
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,990
Don't worry. Just entrust Sister Bai Ying to me.

87
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,980
I guarantee that she'll be fine.

88
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,380
Fine. I'll entrust her to you. As long as you don't cause any trouble, that's good enough.

89
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,830
Be extra careful.

90
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,510
It's fine. We have Yan Xi.

91
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,210
- Let's go.
- What is this? What is it?

92
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,760
[Jade Bone Paper Umbrella]

93
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,500
This one?

94
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,080
What is this?

95
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,710
A secret.

96
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,840
- We'll leave Na Sheng with you then.
- Don't worry.

97
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,650
- Pay attention.
- All right, got it, got it!

98
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,020
Don't forget what I told you.

99
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,360
Got it, got it!

100
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,050
Yan Xi is still the best.

101
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,730
- When will Sister Bai Ying come?
- What's the matter?

102
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,360
Didn't we just talk about it? It's the Flower God Festival tonight. I must thoroughly enjoy it.

103
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,620
Of course, we should get Sister Bai Ying and go together.

104
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,160
Let me tell Ning Liang.

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,610
- Wait. Who are you telling?
- Ning Liang.

106
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,650
She's not allowed to go. I'm only inviting you.

107
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,320
But we need to protect you.

108
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,900
Didn't we already talk about it? Sister Bai Ying will go, too.

109
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,220
With you and her around, I'll be completely safe.

110
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,290
It would be safer with Princess Bai around.

111
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,050
Princess Bai?

112
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,250
I have to do something at the main camp. Wait for me here.

113
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,660
Wait. Wait.

114
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,160
Are you perhaps telling Brother Ice Cube so that he'll also go to Jing City?

115
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,660
Not allowed. Brother Crown Prince told me about this.

116
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,130
He's letting me only invite Sister Bai Ying.

117
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,120
Who's inviting me?

118
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,780
Sister Bai Ying, you've come.

119
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,020
Brother Crown Prince told me to take you to the Flower God Festival.

120
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,490
Where is His Highness?

121
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,350
He and Uncle Xi Jing went out. They were acting strange.

122
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,740
Oh, yes! I heard Brother Crown Prince say that the Flower God Festival existed 100 years ago.

123
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,330
- Have you been before?
- Yes.

124
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,290
He said to have you wait for him under the Flower God Tree, too.

125
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,360
Doesn't it sound like fun?

126
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,120
Xi Jing, when we get into the palace, I'll go and find that person.

127
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,180
- You go to the library. Don't forget.
- I know.

128
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,930
- Look carefully.
- Don't talk to the empty air. It's too strange.

129
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,920
Be careful.

130
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,830
This way, please.

131
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,790
He really is invisible.

132
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't say anything!

133
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,650
Be careful.

134
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,880
Nice to meet you.

135
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,540
I'm already here.

136
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,750
Why don't you come and show me your true identity?

137
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,280
Even if you see my true identity,

138
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,280
would you know who I was?

139
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,490
Your ring is still in the hands of the girl from the Central Plains.

140
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,510
You know about that, too?

141
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,950
There's nothing in all of Yunhuang

142
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,040
that I don't know about.

143
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,690
Who are you?

144
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,490
I've never met this old man before.

145
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,860
Why is there a sense of familiarity?

146
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,950
The Jing Lake barrier and Golden Formation

147
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,140
are all Kongsang's techniques. How do you know them?

148
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,110
Why can't I know them?

149
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,250
Also, how do you know how to use the Water Mirror?

150
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,190
Can't the Water Mirror only be opened by a High Priest of Kongsang?

151
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,870
I do it the same way you do.

152
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,740
How could that be possible? The Water Mirror requires the power of the king.

153
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,870
Unless...

154
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,680
you're not from Cangliu?

155
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,550
I'm the most powerful person

156
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,080
in the Land of Yunhuang.

157
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,360
Why is that not possible?

158
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,390
You're nothing but a brutal, tyrannical devil.

159
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,270
The most powerful people in the history of the Land of Yunhuang

160
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,070
are the Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei.

161
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,840
It's still the same. As long as I hear her name,

162
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,160
I can't help but want to stop it.

163
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,390
How ridiculous.

164
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,850
It's exactly because of this pathetic emotion

165
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,950
that I came back to this land.

166
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,100
What is he talking to himself about?

167
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,260
My descendants...

168
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,170
- This lantern is so pretty.
- It is!

169
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,080
So pretty!

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,770
I haven't seen it so crowded and lively for such a long time.

171
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,780
Sister Bai Ying, we'll go over there and look around. Take your time here.

172
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,400
We'll come back for you in a bit. Let's go.

173
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,160
Come take a look.

174
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,630
Miss, feel free to look around.

175
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,530
Would he like this pattern and color?

176
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,710
It could be considered... an apology gift.

177
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,660
All right.

178
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,200
- Hurry up.
- Take your time.

179
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,160
So beautiful. Look!

180
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,810
- Look at my sparkler.
- So pretty. Let's go.

181
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,670
- Okay.
- Be careful.

182
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,900
I want it too! I want it too!

183
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,760
- Hurry up!
- Don't fall.

184
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,770
Here. Take it.

185
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,540
Okay. Come on.

186
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,200
Hold it.

187
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,390
Hurry, look! The full moon will soon rise to the top of Flower God Tree.

188
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,530
No matter how beautiful the full moon is, it doesn't compare with you.

189
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,590
There's a wishing well over there. Let's go make a wish.

190
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,470
Maybe the Flower God will hear my wish!

191
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,890
Sure. Let's go.

192
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,380
Let's go.

193
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,260
Will he come?

194
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,670
Like the Flower God Festival 100 years ago.

195
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,650
Princess Bai.

196
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,220
Is Na Sheng ready? We should get going.

197
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,050
I have something to tell you.

198
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,920
What is it?

199
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,820
Actually that day, Young Master waited here for you the entire night.

200
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,030
Why?

201
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,580
Because Na Sheng told Young Master that you would come,

202
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,610
but he didn't know when you would come, so he kept waiting here.

203
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,630
Even though Na Sheng didn't want me to tell you,

204
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,310
I thought you'd probably want to see Young Master.

205
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,290
Su Mo.

206
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,400
Where have you been the past few days?

207
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,180
I'm sorry for making you wait by the lake the entire night.

208
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,550
I'm willing to wait no matter how long it takes.

209
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,020
In the future, I won't make you wait anymore. I'll let you know wherever I go.

210
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,640
In the future, I'll go wherever you go.

211
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,110
Young Master, are you going out?

212
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,830
I've reinforced the barrier, but you should still be vigilant tonight.

213
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,950
Don't worry. I'll guard the camp well.

214
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,780
I won't make mistakes again.

215
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,110
Ning Liang, let go

216
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,160
of the past. Han Zhou will be worried about you.

217
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,040
Young Master, are you going to Flower God Festival?

218
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,430
Yes.

219
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,780
Han Zhou always wanted to make a wish under the Flower God Tree.

220
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,110
If he could, he'd wish to be able to return to the Biluo Sea.

221
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,750
It's a pity that he missed it every year.

222
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,650
Young Master, you should hurry and go. Don't miss the Flower God Festival.

223
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,810
I'll guard the camp.

224
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,360
Come, come, drink a cup.

225
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,920
What are you looking at? Why aren't you with them?

226
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,090
How did you get out so quickly from Master Lang's?

227
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,600
It's crowded like a city at Master Lang's.

228
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,850
The door's threshold has almost been flattened. There's nothing for me to do if I stayed there.

229
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,030
Master Lang gave me a new set of armor.

230
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,020
But I can't bear to wear it. How about you?

231
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,180
Master Peng lost authority this year, so there are few visitors.

232
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,430
He gifted me a belt.

233
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,090
He's probably trying to remind me.

234
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,180
Reminding me that I'm only a grasshopper that's leashed to him.

235
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,130
You think too much.

236
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,980
What? Just this one jar?

237
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,040
You don't think it's enough?

238
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,010
Hey, why don't we go to Jing City?

239
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,250
There's definitely a lot of good food and wine in Jing City. How about it?

240
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,680
Forget it. I'd better watch over the camp.

241
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,480
- Let's go!
- I'm not going.

242
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,670
Go, go, go.

243
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,970
Young girl, you really do have a good eye.

244
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,600
I brought all these pearls back from the Biluo Sea.

245
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,320
See? The luster and size of these beads are the best.

246
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,610
They're quite pretty.

247
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,000
I guarantee they're genuine.

248
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,790
This one suits you the best.

249
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,560
Young Miss, come. Take one.

250
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,610
These are all fakes.

251
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,730
Young man, what are you saying?

252
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,490
Do you even understand pearls? If you talk nonsense, how can I do business?

253
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,630
- Let's go.
- How can you—

254
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,160
How can he be this way?

255
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,630
Look at that one.

256
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,410
Mom, I want a rabbit lantern.

257
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,190
All right, I'll buy it for you.

258
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,940
Yan Xi, it's lucky that you told me. Otherwise, I'd have been cheated.

259
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,370
Of course. I can see if it's real with one look.

260
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,140
Oh yes, Yan Xi. Did you tell Brother Ice Cube?

261
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,650
Huh?

262
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,150
I...

263
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,010
You told him. You must have told him!

264
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,210
Our young master has something to tell Princess Bai, too.

265
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,770
He waited a whole night already.

266
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,420
But there should be a first-come, first-serve order.

267
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
How does liking someone have any first come first serve?

268
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,220
Do you understand what liking someone is?

269
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,430
I don't, but at least I know how you like people.

270
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,120
Say that again.

271
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,860
W-We'd better go back to look for Princess Bai.

272
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,360
Wait. Wait. Sister Bai Ying is a descendant of the Holy Sword Sect.

273
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,170
She won't have any problems at night. You just stay by my side here, okay?

274
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,630
- This...
- Don't say this or that.

275
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,300
Let's go, let's go.

276
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,900
♫ I bid farewell, not to go far away ♫

277
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,450
♫ But to search for your footsteps ♫

278
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,020
Why am I thinking of those things?

279
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,960
♫ I'm silent not because I'm at peace ♫

280
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,370
♫ But to listen for your news ♫

281
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,800
♫ I pray not for a fated moment ♫

282
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,230
♫ But to be able to meet you again ♫

283
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,620
Is she here? Where would she be?

284
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,740
I must find her.

285
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:48,930
♫ But to be brave enough to hold back tears ♫

286
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:57,140
♫ I'm not willing to waste this time alone ♫

287
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:03,840
♫ Yet you tell me to forget the memories ♫

288
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,610
♫ I quietly listen to the story starting at the beginning ♫

289
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:17,310
♫ Why must deep love be greedy and long for such words? ♫

290
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,380
Miss, if you want something to come true,

291
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,470
you can make a wish to the Flower God.

292
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,210
Miss, you must believe it. My wishing tablets

293
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,020
really work.

294
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,180
As long as you write down your wish,

295
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,650
the Flower God will hear it.

296
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,660
♫ Awake from my dreams, I wait for you ♫

297
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:45,970
♫ In my heart, you're the center of my small world ♫

298
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,340
Why are you here?

299
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,990
I came to see whether the hundred-year-old Flower God Tree

300
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,070
has bloomed.

301
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,240
How about you?

302
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,690
I...

303
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,400
I came with Na Sheng to take a look.

304
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,850
She went off with Yan Xi to have fun.

305
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,620
Have you thought of a wish?

306
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,280
I hope Kongsang's people will wake up.

307
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,820
I hope Quanxian can return to the Biluo Sea.

308
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,060
Don't you have your own wish?

309
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,140
What about you?

310
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,250
My wish from a hundred years ago hasn't come true yet.

311
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,060
Maybe my wish is too big.

312
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,140
The Flower God Tree doesn't dare accept it.

313
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,870
Then, what's the wish you made a hundred years ago?

314
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,920
You want to hear it?

315
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,040
I want to take you to the Biluo Sea,

316
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,690
to see the water, the endless skies, and listen to the constant waves.

317
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,200

♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

479
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,650
♫ We've met several times ♫

480
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,070
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

481
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:58,880
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

482
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,580
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

483
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,060
♫ You live in there ♫

484
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:13,170
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

485
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:17,100
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

486
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,030
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

487
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,970
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

488
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:27,520
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

489
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,940
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

490
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,420
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

491
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,840
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

492
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,900
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

493
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,830
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

494
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:51,870
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

495
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,360
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

496
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,830
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

497
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:03,790
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

498
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:12,340
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
