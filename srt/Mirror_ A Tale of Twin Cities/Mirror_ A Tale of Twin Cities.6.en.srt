We don't even know who our rivals are.

How would we fight? Kill all passersby from Tianque?

You must know that Taoyuan Province is Gao Shunzhao's territory.

It is not under our control. We cannot act rashly.

It's been a hundred years and there's finally a reaction!

132
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,660
The Heavenly Ring is at Tianque Snow Mountain now. I ask Your Highness's

133
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,220
to go there immediately to look for it.

134
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,100
Yes.

135
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,750
You'll do anything I say, is that right?

136
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,470
No, no! I said nonsense in a moment of desperation just now.

137
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,030
Take the ring back.

138
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,490
Then take the ring off.

139
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,020
But I can't seem to take it off!

140
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,740
Thus, it's ordained by the heavens. It's too late to regret it.

141
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,890
Then you tell me, what do you want me to do?

142
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,280
I want you to wear the ring,

143
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,470
and go to Taoyuan Province.

144
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,510
Taoyuan Province?

145
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,930
It sounds so familiar.

146
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,570
It's the small town closest to Tianque Snow Mountain.

147
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,580
If they know that the Heavenly Ring has appeared,

148
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,120
they will surely go there to receive me.

149
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,660
I can't go any farther. I'm so tired!

150
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,810
I'm going to sleep for a bit.

151
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,390
Hey, little girl, it's better for you to go down the mountain quickly.

152
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,180
No, no. The village elders said we shouldn't travel at night.

153
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,390
One of the four seals has broken.

154
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,230
The Heavenly Ring has reappeared. Relay my order immediately.

155
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,640
Kill those who pass through Tianque.

Yes, Lord Zhi Zhe.

157
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,470
Zhi Zhe said that the calamity is coming from Tianque.

158

One of the four seals has broken.

159
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,010
Please guard the rest of the seals and dispatch soldiers immediately to Tianque.

160
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,070
Those who pass through Tianque must be killed.

161
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,620

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,930
and was sent to Banbu City as punishment. It's been three months now, right?

164
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,690
Yes.

165
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,760
It's time to let your younger brother come back.

166
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,810
Thank you very much, Master Peng.

167
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,320
I watched you both grow up.

168
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,690
You are my children. I cannot bear to truly punish him.

169
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,890
If you didn't take us in back then,

170
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,180
I fear we would have died in the mouth of jackals.

171
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,440
There's no need to mention that.

172
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,430
As long as you two remember, it's enough.

173
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:42,590
By the way, Banbu City is the closest to Tianque.

174
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,570
Are you saying

175
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,500
to let Yu Huan kill those who pass through Tianque?

176
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,540
This is a good opportunity. If Yu Huan succeeds,

177
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,280
Master Lang will be unstable in his position.

178
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,210
I understand. I will send someone to relay the message to Yu Huan.

179
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,830
Yu Zhu,

180
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,520
how long have you been by Lord Zhi Zhe's side?

181
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,600
- It has been fifteen years.
- The previous saintesses

182
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,620
were only by his side for ten years.

183
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,220
Not a single day less or more.

184
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,730
He acts strictly and cautiously. There have been no mistakes in the past hundred years.

185
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,650
Yet when you are the saintess,

186
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,220
he is acting abnormally.

187
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,910
Why does he keep you and not let you go?

188
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,910
I have no idea.

189
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,650
He trusts you.

190
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:02,130
Master Peng, I dare not speculate what is on Lord Zhi Zhe's mind.

191
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,790
Serve him well.

192
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,660
Yes.

193
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,800
[Banbu City - Desert]

194
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,800
[Yu Huan - Cangliu General]

195
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,800
[Xiao - Previous Leader of the Quanxian Tribe]

196
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,200
Such meager skills yet you dare to attempt to assassinate me.

197
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,300
Yu Huan, Cangliu's dog. Everyone wants to kill you.

198
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,800
Right now, it looks like you'll die first.

199
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,700
You might as well kill me right now.

200
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,600
Kill you? Isn't that going easy on you?

201
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
Answer my question.

202
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,700
Who was the other person who tried to assassinate me with you?

203
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,200
You won't get a word of information from my mouth.

204
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,000
We are 30 miles from Banbu City. I'm going to kill you by keeping you here.

205
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If I die, you won't be able to leave here either.

206
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,400
From what I know,

207
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,900
once you are away from water for three days, you will dry up and die.

208
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,400
You haven't drunk water for a day now.

209
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,000
If one of us dies, you will die before me.

210
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,590
Then I feel a bit regretful.

211
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,230
I can't personally see you waiting for death.

212
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,410
You want to die?

213
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,200
Not that easy!

214
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,700
Younger sister.

215
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,370
Younger sister.

216
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
Drink this water.

217
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,200
You spilled the last bit of the water.

218
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm tired to death. So tired.

219
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,000
It's daytime again so quickly. Soon I have to get going.

220
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,100
Heaven, I beg you to protect me.

221
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,400
Please don't let me meet any more strange people.

222
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,000
You won't be able to take it off.

223
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,800
Why can't I take this worn ring off?

224
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,200
That is not some "worn" ring.

225
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,000
It's called the "Heavenly Ring."

226
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,600
I don't care if it's heavenly.

227
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,200
I really am just a common person from the Central Plains.

228
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Immortal Brother, just let me go.

229
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't have a choice either.

230
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,300
This ring is really stubborn.

231
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,400
Once it recognizes someone as its master, no one can change that.

232
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Unless...

233
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,900
Unless its next master appears.

234
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,500
Then, what should I do?

235
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,100
Didn't I say?

236
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,500
Wear it and go to Taoyuan Province.

237
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,600
- Really?
- Yes.

238
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,600
Something's not right.

239
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,000
Who exactly are you?

240
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,600
- I'm an immortal.
- You're lying.

241
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,940
I...

242
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,600
am the last master of the ring.

243
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,780
Then, why doesn't it want you anymore?

244
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,600
It's a long story. If I have the chance in the future, I will tell you.

245
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,000
Since you're so powerful, why don't you take it there yourself?

246
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm...

247
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,000
actually a knowledgeable spirit bound to the ring.

248
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,200
Only the person who can wear the ring can see me.

249
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,600
The real me is in a deep sleep.

250
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,200
Say, little girl, I'm giving you a chance to repay my kindness.

251
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,800
Besides, with that small body of yours,

252
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,100
it'll be very difficult for you to leave Tianque without my guidance.

253
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,800
All right. I'll do it.

254
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll only take the ring there but I won't be responsible for anything else.

255
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
All right. Go on then.

256
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Wait.

257
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,100
Do I get anything out of repaying your kindness?

258
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,500
"Get anything?"

259
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,800
I didn't get anything beneficial for saving you yesterday!

260
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,300
Yet you're asking me for something.

261
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,600
Forget it. I'm a very benevolent person.

262
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,400
As long as you safely take the ring to Taoyuan Province,

263
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll naturally give you something beneficial.

264
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,200
What is it?

265
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,300
What do you want?

266
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,700
I don't want much.

267
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,000
Just give me a bit of Yunhuang money.

268
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
A greedy person who doesn't care about her life.

269
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
All right then.

270
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,200
- Really?
- Of course.

271
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,400
That's great! That's great! Let's go now.

272
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,600
Wait.

273
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,000
Remember, don't let anyone see you wearing the Heavenly Ring.

274
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,400
All right, all right. Don't worry.

275
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,600
If you deceive a handsome man like me,

276
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,800
I will have retribution.

277
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,600
By the way, your name is Na Sheng, right?

278
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,000
- How did you know?
- I'm an immortal.

279
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,000
Enough. Hurry and go.

280
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Then I'll get going now. I'm going.

281
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,800
We've found the general!

282
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,300
Where's that convict?
 [Banbu City - Military Camp]

283
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,800
We gave her some water, and someone is watching over her.

284
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,600
Rest assured. You worked painstakingly hard to capture her.
[Fei Lian - Cangliu General]

285
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,800
Surely, you'll be the one to interrogate her.
[Fei Lian - Cangliu General]

286
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,400
But I'll have to trouble you. Help me send that convict back to Jing City.

287
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Don't worry. We will wait for you to come back to conduct the interrogation.

288
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
I hid some good wine in the residence.

289
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Then we won't stop drinking until we get drunk.

290
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,600
Report! A secret order from Jing City.

291
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,000
Master Peng has ordered you to rush to Tianque immediately

292
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,800
and kill those who pass through Tianque. This pearl has strong powers.

293
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,600
It could help you escape danger in time of crisis.

294
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Only you and I know about this. Yu Zhu.

295
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,400
Immortal Brother? Immortal Brother?

296
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,600
Hey! Here!

297
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,560
- Who's there?
- Hide.

298
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,500
- Just now...
- There's no one. Did you hear wrong?

299
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,100
The higher-ups have ordered all those who pass through Tianque to be killed.

300
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,200
No one can be spared.

301
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,700
Every year, there are so many who pass through Tianque. Do we kill them all?

302
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,700
I also heard there was an avalanche.

303
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,200
I'm guessing that those who were passing through have died in the avalanche.

304
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Who could possibly be alive?

305
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,800
It's so cold. Let's go make a fire.

306
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,700
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

307
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
Come on out.

308
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,000
Immortal Brother, they won't kill me, will they?

309
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Rest assured, I will warn you if there's any danger.

310
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,300
Even though I don't know if you are a human or a ghost,

311
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,400
you seem to have some loyalty, unlike that stinky Ice Cube.

312
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,500
He left me all alone here on this snow mountain.

313
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,100
Who's stinky Ice Cube?

314
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,100
It's a person who is a bit good-looking but has a very, very bad temperament.

315
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,300
Usually, those who are good-looking have bad temperaments.

316
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
No wonder your temperament is all right.

317
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,800
I won't care about you either, you stinky girl.

318
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Immortal Brother! Immortal Bother? Immortal Brother!

319
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,800
You're good-looking!

320
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
Unbelievable.

321
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Look at this.

322
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,000
I've never seen pearls so big.

323
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Look at mine.

324
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,500
Is this the reason why you are failing to do your duties?

325
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
- General.
- General.

326
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,000
Have you encountered anyone passing through Tianque?

327
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,400
We have been guarding the entrance and didn't see anyone.

328
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,700
Drinking and roasting meat. Your eyes are full of money.

329
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,700
How could you encounter anyone who is passing through Tianque?

330
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,800
General,

331
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,800
have mercy on us. We don't dare to act this way again.

332
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
Take them away.

333
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,400
- G-General! General!
- General!

334
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,000
- We don't dare act like this again.
- That's right.

335
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,600
- Have mercy of us, General!
- We know we were wrong.

336
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,000
Spare us, General!

337
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,580
The sun will rise soon.

338
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,370
I have to find a place to hide quickly.

339
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,440
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

340
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,940
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

341
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:48,790
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

342
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,300
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

343
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,710
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

344
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:01,100
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

345
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,860
[Tianque - Heavenly Temple]

346
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,310
♫ We've met several times ♫

347
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,630
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

348
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:16,710
♫ Sighing over the past that is as frivolous as smoke ♫

349
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,150
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

350
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,650
♫ You live in there ♫

351
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:29,790
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

352
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,590
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

353
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,610
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

354
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,590
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

355
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,120
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

356
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,550
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

357
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:51,010
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

358
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,640
Kongsang and Quanxian

359
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,090
have a distance between them that has been around for hundreds and thousands of years.

360
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,780
Not to mention, we can't walk in the sunlight.

361
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,520
Su Mo,

362
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,070
we are destined to not be able to live under the same sun.

363
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,220
It's better to end your longing for me early.

364
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,460
Besides, my life now

365
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,190
belongs to Kongsang. I have more important things to do.

366
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,640
I must quickly find the person passing through Tianque.

367
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,950
The person is Kongsang's hope.

368
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,680
Those soldiers must be looking for him, too.

369
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,910
I'm so hungry.

370
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,650
- There's a mushroom!
- Hey!

371
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,090
Don't eat it. It's poisonous.

372
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,080
Don't touch it either.

373
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,170
Be careful, your hands and feet may decay.

374
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,960
- Then this should be all right.
- You can't touch that.

375
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,530
- Then I'll—
- If you want to die, no one can truly stop you.

376
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:04,780
No, but if I can't touch this or that,

377
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,510
then I can't eat anything.

378
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,250
I can't eat this. I can't eat that.

379
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,650
What is it? It looks so familiar.

380
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,190
Snow Poppy. Foolish people do have foolishly good fortune.

381
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,950
Snow Poppy?

382
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,100
I remember now!

383
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,310
Before, a lot of people on the snow mountain fought over this.

384
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,700
It even caused an avalanche.

385
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,200
At the time, a lot of people died.

386
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,160
In Yunhuang, this snow poppy is the

387
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
most precious medicinal plant.

388
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,330
There are only a few on the whole snow mountain.

389
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,050
Most importantly, it can save a person's life.

390
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,600
Since you've found it, it means this encounter is fated.

391
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,620
Hurry and pick it.

392
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,590
I've picked it.

393
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,860
- I've picked it!
- Quickly use your hairpin

394
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,610
to hold it. Otherwise, it'll run away.

395
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,600
Yes, yes. My hairpin is very precious, too.

396
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I must not lose it.

397
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,460
Little Miser, let's go.

398
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,290
Be careful. If Cangliu people catch up to you, then your little life is over.

399
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,960
Let's go, let's go.

400
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,560
What are you looking at?

401
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,040
There are so many soldiers there. They aren't here to capture me, right?

402
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,340
Why aren't you moving?

403
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,570
Wait for me!

404
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,750
Immortal Brother! Immortal Brother.

405
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,320
Those people just now are not here to kill me, right?

406
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,070
Not only will they kill you, but they'll also eat you.

407
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,300
No, wait. Don't joke around with me at a time like this.

408
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,970
They all say Yunhuang is like a world of immortals.

409
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,010
Why is it full of lies and bloodshed there?

410
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,560
Who told you that?

411
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,510
The eldest elder of my village.

412
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,930
He told me Yunhuang is the place most protected by immortals.

413
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,480
There is no war, killing, or bloodshed.

414
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,030
He told me I must go to Yunhuang.

415
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,190
That elder who told you that never left the village before, right?

416
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,720
If you want to preserve your life, then get going.

417
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,470
This path is very hidden.

418
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,770
Normal people would not know about it.

419
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,670
Then why do you know a path that even Cangliu people don't know of?

420
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,860
That's because...

421
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,620
That's because I know a girl who loves to talk.

422
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,470
What she normally likes most is traveling the world.

423
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,570
She's seen all the wonders of the world.

424
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,530
Most days, she would tell me about all kinds of interesting things

425
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,510
about the land for hours.

426
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,470
She's like a nagger who loves nagging.

427
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,140
Let me tell you. It's not only this path.

428
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,290
- There's not a place in Yunhuang that I don't know about.
- Wow.

429
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,960
Then is she like the people in stories,

430
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,900
holding a sword as she travels to the end of the world?

431
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,020
Are you dumb? You're a grown person yet you trip while walking.

432
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,890
You don't help me up, only know to make jokes.

433
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,100
Brother Ice Cube is better.

434
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,800
What Brother Ice Cube?

435
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,110
What? Brother Ice Cube even saved me last time.

436
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,290
Not like you. You just talk all day.

437
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,180
If you like that Brother Ice Cube,

438
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,970
why don't you go find him?

439
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,790
That's because he won't let me follow him.

440
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,620
Brother Ice Cube?

441
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,480
Brother Ice Cube! Brother Ice Cube!

442
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,670
Su Mo!

443
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,480
Su Mo!

444
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,370
Su Mo!

445
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,230
His name is Su Mo?

446
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,980
That's right.

447
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,390
We must search thoroughly and not miss a single person.

448
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,070
There are soldiers coming. What do we do? What do we do?

449
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,780
I'm a spirit. I can't help much.

450
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,200
Besides, your ability to use the Heavenly Ring is limited.

451
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,130
You might not be able to see me.

452
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,100
How about this. Quickly catch up to Su Mo

453
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,000
and have him help you.

454
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,240
What should I do if he refuses?

455
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,710
If necessary,

456
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,090
let him see your ring.

457
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,590
Immortal Brother! Immortal Brother!

458
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,670
Immortal Brother!

459
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,430
Brother Ice Cube!

460
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,990
Brother Ice Cube! Brother Ice Cube!

461
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,050
Brother Ice Cube!

462
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,550
Brother Ice Cube! Wait for me!

463
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,980
- Why are you following me again?
- C-Can you save me?

464
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,910
Take me to Taoyuan Province!

465
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,520
Why?

466
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,760
Look.

467
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,510
Heavenly Ring?

468
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,000
There are people over there. Who is it?

469
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,910
I'm begging you. Please.

470
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,780
Let's go to take a look.

471
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,580
Quickly report this to the general. We found two people passing through.

472
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,040
A merman wearing blue clothes

473
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,860
and a girl who looks to be from the Central Plains. Hurry and go!

474
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,370
Yes!

475
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,760
Now can you tell me why the Heavenly Ring is on your hand?

476
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,170
I didn't expect there to be a heavenly temple in the wilderness.

477
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,550
Let's go in to rest for a bit.

478
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,380
You want to run away?

479
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,840
Just now did you say Heavenly Ring?

480
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,630
What Heavenly Ring?

481
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,470
I found this on the snow mountain.

482
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:10,090
I don't know what happened but it ended up in my hands.

483
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,840
Also, I can't take it off no matter what. How would I know what it is?

484
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,650
Su Mo?

485
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,090
Ending OST: Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

486
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,500
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

487
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,070
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

488
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:18,850
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

489
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,370
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

490
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,910
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

491
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:32,850
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

492
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:36,400
♫ We've met several times ♫

493
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,740
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

494
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:46,800
♫ Sighing over the past that is as frivolous as smoke ♫

495
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,300
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

496
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,810
♫ You live in there ♫

497
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:59,950
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

498
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,770
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

499
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,690
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

500
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,670
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

501
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,250
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

502
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,660
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

503
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,110
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

504
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:27,650
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

505
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:31,600
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

506
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,600
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

507
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,490
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

508
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,110
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

509
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,360
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

510
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:50,490
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

511
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:59,980
♫ When I want to return, it will be time for
my dream to come true ♫
