[Episode 26]

3
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,180
Your Highness, please rest assured.

4
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,530
We... are on the same side.

5
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,530
Your Highness, there's one more thing.

6
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,180
When I entered Jiuyi, I could feel shaking at the bottom of the mountain.

7
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,740
A white light pierced the sky at the top of Left Peak.

8
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,650
In that case, we must hurry and find the Heavenly King's tomb.

9
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,220
Miss Li Zhu, please lead the way.

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,410
General.

11
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,850
I wonder what Lord Qing Jun wants to discuss with me.

12
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,960
The Splitting Sword has been pulled up.

13
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,920
General, have you caught them already?

14
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,100
They haven't left Jiuyi Mountain yet, we still have an opportunity.

15
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,970
I will... definitely do my best to cooperate with you.

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,460
There's one thing I'd like to clarify with you.

17
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,160
When I was at Monument of Fallen Tears,

18
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,390
I discovered a Spirit Mirror Stage there.

19
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,060
There's a barrier, right?

20
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,750
That's right. Only descendants of the Kongsang royal family

21
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,410
can touch the barrier. Anyone else who touches it

22
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,690
will suffer severe harm from the barrier.

23
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,100
Only Kongsang's royal family can touch.

24
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,390
Then, if that's so,

25
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,620
how did Su Mo pull out the Splitting Sword? Did Bai Ying pull it out?

26
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,610
They say the Splitting Sword is made from the dragon deity's fang.

27
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,030
Su Mo has obtained it. The Splitting Sword is in their hands now.

28
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,680
I'm afraid it'll be even harder to get, right?

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,500
Don't worry about this My Lord, I'll get it sooner or later.

30
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,250
But there's one thing. I only saw Su Mo and Bai Ying.

31
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,950
The Kongsang Crown Prince, Zhen Lan,

32
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,240
does your lordship know his whereabouts?

33
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,310
I have not received any news about the Kongsang remnants.

34
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,020
But I noticed recent marks of Kongsang outside the palace.

35
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,570
What... What mark?

36
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,420
Don't pretend. I already know you met with some people of Kongsang.

37
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,760
General, you accuse me wrongly.

38
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,210
I am loyal to Cangliu!

39
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,670
After you came, I transferred all the troops in the city under your command

40
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,380
- to help you capture—
- I said, no more pretending Lord Qing Jun!

41
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,800
Is it worth your effort to conceal a half-baked crown prince like Zhen Lan?

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,790
Did you ever think

43
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,410
that he is only using you to find the Six Directions Seal?

44
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,970
Once the mission is accomplished,

45
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,220
do you think he will give the throne of Prince Qing

46
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,710
to you, someone who pledged allegiance to Cangliu a hundred years ago?

47
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,950
Or give it to the young and devoted

48
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,080
Qing Yuan who has saved Kongsang lives?

49
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,630
I know that you've waited a long time for that throne.

50
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,060
So how much longer do you want to wait?

51
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,720
That Qing Yuan...

52
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,380
is really young.

53
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,610
I've ruled Jiuyi for many years, and the people live in peace and comfort

54
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,400
with a prosperous life.

55
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,410
Am I not suited to become King of Jiuyi?

56
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,400
- I cannot accept it!
- That's why I have an idea

57
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,330
that can help you secure the King of Jiuyi's throne.

58
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,930
Please guide me, General.

59
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,280
This pathway will lead to the royal tomb.

60
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,160
Will there be more traps on this pathway?

61
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,370
Since Your Highness the Crown Prince doesn't trust me, I'm willing to go first to show my sincerity.

62
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,170
Once I pass through it safely, you can follow.

63
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,720
Then won't you be in danger yourself?

64
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,400
Judging from Miss Li Zhu's movements just now, you must have studied martial arts from childhood.

65
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,160
Just simple fighting skills for self-defense.

66
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,080
I am a guide, so this is what I should do

67
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,430
and hope to remove the doubts from Your Highness.

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,020
Careful everyone.

69
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,900
There's a trap here. Everyone, avoid the bricks with patterns under your feet.

70
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,860
Patterns?

71
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,040
This has no patterns. Let me see.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,920
Probably only the Seven Star Lamp can show the patterns.

73
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,680
Li Zhu and I will go in front. Everyone else, follow my footsteps.

74
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,720
Wherever I step, that's where you step.

75
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,580
Stay close to me.

76
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,080
All right.

77
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,720
Careful.

78
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,360
What if it's weak water?

79
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,770
It's just regular water.

80
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,300
You must have thought it was weak water, that's why you blocked it.

81
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,360
Don't do that again.

82
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm going ahead to have a look.

83
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,390
We're here.

84
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,550
[Life and Death Pavilion]

85
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,020
It's right here.

86
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,160
This is weak water?

87
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,730
It is.

88
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,670
- Na Sheng.
- It's hot!

89
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,640
Be careful. Don't be rash.

90
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,690
You won't be able to see Yan Xi again if you're not careful.

91
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,720
- I won't touch anything at random.
- I won't.

92
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,620
This weak water is very deep. The evil aura of Yunhuang is in here.

93
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
It flows to the end of the sky to be cleansed.

94
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,650
If you fall in, there's probably no chance at all of survival.

95
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,950
There's a mechanism here.

96
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,790
We can't get out!

97
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,460
What's happening?

98
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,970
Miss Li Zhu!

99
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,080
Crown Prince. Zhen Lan. I am sorry.

100
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,280
Tell me. What is this place?

101
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,840
Why did you lead us here? Where exactly is the Heavenly King's tomb?

102
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,150
Sorry, Crown Prince Zhen Lan.

103
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,280
However, this is indeed the only path to go to the Heavenly King's tomb.

104
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,110
[Life and Death Pavilion]

105
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,710
We've sent many people in the past to try

106
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,190
to enter the Heavenly King's tomb through the Life Death Pavilion.

107
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,470
Unfortunately, none ever came back.

108
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,680
Qing Yuan, what's the meaning of the Life and Death Pavilion?

109
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,430
Excuse me, Your Highness. Even though I am from the Qing Clan, I'm from a side branch.

110
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,820
As to the secret passages of the tomb of the Heavenly Emperor in Jiuyi Mountain,

111
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,710
only the princes through the generations knew the secrets.

112
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,720
I ascended the throne in such a rush

113
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,650
and haven't even seen the ascension book of the princes of Qing. So I don't know the secrets to the tomb.

114
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,290
It's not your fault. You accepted the command in a time of crisis.

115
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,990
Tell me. Why did you do what you did?

116
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,700
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

117
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,710
So... this was a trap from the beginning?

118
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,600
Yes.

119
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,800
You bold treasure thieves! How dare you barge into Queen Bai Wei's tomb!

120
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,970
I was at Queen Bai Wei's tomb on purpose.

121
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,680
I waited for everyone to arrive and gained your trust.

122
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,200
Are there any other ways out?

123
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,910
I really don't know if there are other exits. Lord Xi Jing, even if you kill me now,

124
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,000
you can't go back anymore.

125
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,860
You can only keep going forward.

126
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,860
You are lying to us.

127
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,810
She must be in some trouble and can't say it out loud.

128
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,090
Even if she is, she's still a liar.

129
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,360
She trapped us all in here. We can't find a way out either!

130
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,660
Miss Li Zhu, you wanted to use us to figure out how to get to Heavenly King's tomb.

131
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,800
But why were you certain that we could definitely get in?

132
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,550
If we get killed by the traps, you wouldn't be able to go back either.

133
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,890
This bet of yours isn't a safe one.

134
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,650
Since I'm with you, I've already been prepared to die.

135
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,820
If... If we really can't find a way out,

136
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,770
I'll accept my fate.

137
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,330
You're very... Forget it. I don't know what to say about you.

138
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:57,130
All right. In this case, let me see

139
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,570
what makes the Life and Death Pavilion so amazing.

140
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,490
Your Highness.

141
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,190
Are you sure you want to keep going forward?

142
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,760
We have nowhere else to go now,

143
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,150
why not keep going and see how it goes

144
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,680
and defeat whatever we encounter?

145
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,700
Na Sheng, follow me.

146
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,530
Why did it turn into this?

147
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,280
Uncle, we're not in danger, are we?

148
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,880
We're fine.

149
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,410
There's a barrier here. We can't get out.

150
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,600
It looks like this pavilion is our only way.

151
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,080
Let's take a look.

152
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,010
Xi Jing, I'm so glad you're here.

153
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,510
[Life and Death Pavilion]

154
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,050
Water and Sky for Life.

155
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,960
Dawn and Dusk are everywhere.

156
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,150
I didn't expect the barrier to be so powerful.

157
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,450
I can't even see the path we took to get in.

158
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,690
What exactly is this?

159
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,530
Na Sheng, don't touch it!

160
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,190
The arrows are heading that way.

161
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,750
But... what's over there?

162
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,860
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

163
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,510
Watch out!

164
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,110
The arrows are here again. Can we go back?

165
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,760
We can't keep doing this.

166
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,040
Brother Crown Prince, you're amazing.

167
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,240
Qing Yuan, find the key for the mechanism.

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,060
Right now, I want you to tell me everything, including your next steps,

169
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,780
who exactly is over there and why are they attacking us.

170
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,350
If those people successfully made it into the Life and Death Pavilion,

171
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,370
that should be... them.

172
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,790
Are you saying it's A'Ying?

173
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,360
Is that Sister Bai Ying?

174
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,580
A'Ying! Is that you?

175
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,140
It's His Highness the Crown Prince.

176
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,790
Your Highness, I'm Bai Ying. Su Mo and I are in the pavilion.

177
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,560
How are things on your side?

178
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,920
We don't have arrows shooting towards us anymore.

179
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,070
There's a thing at the pavilion that can shoot arrows.

180
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,140
Same here.

181
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,100
So we were fighting Brother Ice Cube and Sister Bai Ying.

182
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,580
Fortunately, you didn't make a huge mistake.

183
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,220
Yes, it was my fault.

184
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,940
But it's so foggy here that they must want us to attack each other.

185
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,710
The traps here are designed for people to attack each other.

186
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,350
It's so foggy that we can't see the entire pavilion.

187
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,740
If we hit the traps by accident, it'll be more dangerous.

188
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,680
If the fog could be dispersed, that would be great.

189
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,420
The weak water here is too strong. The wind from the sword of light is unable to remove the thick fog.

190
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,330
This thick fog is created from the vapors of the weak water. It's purged evil.

191
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm afraid only powerful techniques can make the fog go away.

192
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,330
Let me try.

193
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,120
With all the fog here, we can't find a way out.

194
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,960
We're stuck at the pavilion right now. If we stay longer,

195
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,140
there's no telling what kind of danger we'll be in.

196
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,840
The fog here is from purged evil spirits.

197
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,360
We have to come up with a way to make it go away.

198
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,890
Another stronger killing intent?

199
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,790
- Your Highness.
- Brother Crown Prince, are you okay?

200
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm fine. It's no use, I'm still too weak.

201
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,500
I can't get rid of all this fog.

202
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,610
The fog has gone away.

203
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,930
Thank you all.

204
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,600
Thank you.

205
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,780
I'm sorry.

206
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,960
What happened?

207
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,180
Na Sheng hit the trap by accident, some stones fell from under us,

208
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,670
and Li Zhu fell. But fortunately, she's fine.

209
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,740
A'Ying, how did you two get here?

210
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,430
After getting the Splitting Sword, we found a passage.

211
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,250
We followed the passage and came here.

212
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,150
Your Highness, how did you all get here?

213
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,800
It's a long story. I made a mistake and got us all in danger.

214
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,090
Miss Li Zhu, since we just saved you,

215
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,910
now can you tell us

216
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,430
why you led us here?

217
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,930
You're a merperson, right?

218
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,610
No wonder you're the Emperor of the Sea.

219
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,030
You saw through me right away.

220
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm a merperson.

221
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,520
In addition, I am from Kongsang's Qing Clan.

222
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,120
You knew our identities from the beginning.

223
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,130
Yes. From the moment you came up the mountain,

224
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,590
we knew everything.

225
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,320
Who else?

226
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,930
Since you acknowledge me as the Emperor of the Sea,

227
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,010
then tell me everything you know.

228
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,260
Miss Li Zhu, what exactly is this pavilion?

229
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,720
This is the first time I've seen the Life and Death Pavilion.

230
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,190
I really don't know what it's about.

231
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,220
As I've said already just now,

232
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,850
this is the only path toward the Heavenly King's tomb.

233
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,390
Therefore, the two doors across from us

234
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,230
is the entrance towards the Heavenly King's tomb?

235
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,790
It is indeed this way.

236
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,210
Life and Death Pavilion, one life and one death.

237
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,860
You die, I live.

238
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,080
You live, I die.

239
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,460
That's right.

240
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,930
Ever since the start, you knew that we would come up from both sides

241
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,020
to open the Heavenly King's tomb for you.

242
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,270
But has no one entered it in the past?

243
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,800
No. We dispatched people to try many times.

244
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,890
- They all failed.
- Why?

245
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,480
Because the people in both pavilions wanted to live.

246
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,250
So, to live,

247
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,590
they have to attack the people in the other pavilion.

248
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,570
Yes.

249
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,860
Then, no one can live if an exit can't be found.

250
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,160
Didn't those trying to find a path die for nothing then?

251
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,820
That's right. They simply died.

252
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,000
So cruel.

253
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,700
One always has to pay a price to reach one's goal.

254
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,220
Why don't you do it yourself then?

255
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,920
Me?

256
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,930
How do you know that I haven't paid a price!

257
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,600
Li Zhu.

258
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,210
You know what I want.

259
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,370
After you've killed him,

260
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,580
you'll get your freedom.

261
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,980
But he's been hiding in the Heavenly King's tomb this whole time.

262
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,970
All these years, haven't you been trying

263
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,860
to enter the Heavenly King's tomb through the Life and Death Pavilion?

264
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,690
But we've never succeeded.

265
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,100
We didn't succeed,

266
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,010
but it doesn't mean others won't.

267
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,760
The Emperor of the Sea, Su Mo, and Kongsang's Crown Prince, Zhen Lan

268
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,550
will soon arrive at Jiuyi to obtain the Splitting Sword

269
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,540
to unseal the Six Directions Seal.

270
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,080
This is a great opportunity.

271
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,490
What do you need me to do then?

272
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,860
I want you to guide the way for them

273
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,280
and lead them to the Life and Death Pavilion,

274
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,590
to the Heavenly King's tomb.

275
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,840
I want you to use the mechanism in the Seven Star Lamp.

276
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,770
Will you do it?

277
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,400
We'll set up a blood pact

278
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,310
If I renege, I will die.

279
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,290
Of course, if you renege, you will die.

280
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,480
Once it's accomplished, please fulfill your promise

281
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,390
to return my freedom to me.

282
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,590
Good.

283
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,810
It's a deal.

284
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,820
Miss Li Zhu, what are you thinking about?

285
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,170
Prince Qing Jun told me to lead you to the Life and Death Pavilion.

286
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,410
Use you to open the entrance to the Heavenly King's tomb.

287
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:31,210
Why do you have to enter the Heavenly King's tomb?

288
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,070
It's probably because Prince Qing Jun has always been bothered that he isn't the real King of Jiuyi

289
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,520
and can't obtain the secrets of the Heavenly King's tomb.

290
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,540
If it's only because of Prince Qing Jun's insistence,

291
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,080
then, Miss Li Zhu, you're paying too high a price.

292
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,490
- This Seven Star Lamp—
- Your Highness,

293
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,790
it is my own choosing.

294
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,190
He promised that he'd grant me freedom after I'd completed the mission and let me go home.

295
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,430
All right then. Since it's your own choosing, I won't make it difficult for you.

296
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,890
Once I return to Yunhuang, I will lead everyone home.

297
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,000
Li Zhu, don't be controlled by Qing Jun anymore.

298
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,650
But, Emperor of the Sea,

299
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,420
I met you too late.

300
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,290
At the moment right before now,

301
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,760
when you hadn't entered the Life and Death Pavilion,

302
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,560
perhaps there was room to change everything.

303
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,380
But now, you're already inside the pavilion,

304
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,540
there is no turning back.

305
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,490
Besides, I already made a pact with Qing Jun.

306
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,560
So what? Just go back on your word.

307
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,670
Quanxian always stay true to promises. Once a pact is made, we never break it.

308
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,470
Have you discovered something strange here?

309
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,440
The weak water is rising.

310
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,630
Why is the water level getting higher and higher?

311
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,870
Its temperature is increasing, too.

312
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,140
We must hurry to find a way out.

313
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,300
That smoke is...

314
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,980
The Splitting Sword has been taken out.

315
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,410
All the mechanisms in Jiuyi Mountain will be activated.

316
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,600
Everywhere they go, if they touch a mechanism,

317
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,940
five-colored smoke will be released to report their location.

318
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,620
Just follow the smoke to find them.

319
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,270
Very good. Where are they now?

320
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,460
The Life and Death Pavilion.

321
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,750
The Emperor of the Sea and Kongsang's Crown Prince are both very cunning.

322
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,120
If we want to capture them, I'll still need to make preparations.

323
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,020
I will help you, General, to capture the remnants of the traitorous Land-Sea Nation Alliance.

324
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,810
Gather all the troops. Let the first and second units

325
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:12,460
separately guard all the exits on the east and west sides of the Jiuyi Royal Palace.

326
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,930
All the entrances must be sealed and no one is allowed to escape.

327
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,050
General, are you sure they'll survive

328
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,320
and walk out of the Heavenly King's tomb?

329
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,710
Whether it's the Emperor of the Sea or Kongsang's Crown Prince, neither one is easy to deal with.

330
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,040
Not to mention that they have two Kongsang's Holy Sword Sect masters with them.

331
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,290
So we must seal off all the exits,

332
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,290
so that we have the chance to capture them all at once.

333
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,030
General, you are wise.

334
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,500
The third unit will go up the mountain with me

335
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,370
and be ready to fight at any time. Once it's accomplished,

336
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,020
you will be the real King of Jiuyi.

337
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,380
Good luck, General.

338
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,700
Gather the troops now. We don't have much time left.

339
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,260
Yes.

340
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,460
I really am General Fei Lian.

341
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,960
Master Lang ordered me to come and assist Yu Huan.
[Banbu City - Military Camp]

342
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,400
I need half the troops in Banbu City.

343
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,520
You don't even have any credentials to prove your own identity.

344
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,210
Are you new? Tell your commander to come. He'll recognize me!

345
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,810
I only acknowledge the command token.

346
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:19,070
You are unreasonable. Stubborn!

347
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,590
If you continue to cause trouble, don't blame me for being impolite.

348
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,990
What are you looking at?

349
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,690
Su Mo,

350
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,400
what are you doing?

351
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,650
Even though Life and Death Pavilion is split between life and death,

352
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,490
but at least it gives each other a way to live.

353
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,140
That's right.

354
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,240
I'll stay.

355
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm alone, without any ties in life.

356
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,790
I am the most suitable person.

357
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,860
No, if we go, we'll go together.

358
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,500
Your Highness, it's enough that I've journeyed this far with all of you.

359
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,670
I was originally a Kongsang general and Kongsang's sharp blade.

360
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,290
I am willing to open the pathway for Your Highness.

361
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,400
You're talking nonsense.

362
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,970
You're my general, my senior, my friend.

363
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,600
I think of you as family.

364
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,610
But you want me to use you like a blade to open up a path?

365
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,240
Your Highness.

366
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,570
You are, above all, Kongsang's crown prince, before you are Zhen Lan.

367
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,490
Same with me. I am Kongsang's general before I am Xi Jing.

368
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,410
Why do we want Kongsang to see the sun again?

369
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,720
It's not for an empty symbol,

370
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,340
but for 100,000 living souls!

371
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,380
Xi Jing, you are also a living soul.

372
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,620
Being hot-blooded will never make you a king.

373
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,710
Then I won't be.

374
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,480
Su Mo, I...

375
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,340
I disagree.

376
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,640
Why do you always want to sacrifice yourself to save others?

377
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,080
Don't you know there are people who want you to live?

378
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,440
I want to live, too.

379
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,060
But if my life can be used in exchange for Na Sheng

380
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,180
and His Highness' lives to bring hope to Kongsang,

381
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,430
to me, it's just dying once more.

382
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,730
It's just that, I feel...

383
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,600
the only person that I've let down...

384
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,240
is you.

385
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,730
How have you let me down?

386
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,810
I shouldn't drag you down.

387
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,350
Actually, I was already...

388
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,600
Already what?

389
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,760
Sorry.

390
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,410
I shouldn't be the one to decide life or death for the two of us.

391
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,550
Not until we get to the last moment,

392
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,810
don't give up the last bit of hope. All right?

393
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,810
Your Highness, all of you go first.

394
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,540
No! We will go together!

395
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,000
This is our only way out.

396
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,900
There must be another way.

397
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,840
This is not a trap, but a test.

398
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,180
We'll find a way out!

399
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,130
A'Ying!

400
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,840
Time's running out!

401
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,060
If we wait any longer, nobody will be able to get out.

402
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,430
Your Highness, don't forget

403
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,870
that you're responsible for 100,000 Kongsang people!

404
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,130
Then why...

405
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,770
A'Ying!

406
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,710
Use this Sea of Stars leaf to view it.

407
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,710
Sea of Stars?

408
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,630
This leaf has a name?

409
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,110
Sea of Stars.

410
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,250
This is the only gift you gave me a hundred years ago.

411
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,240
I'll give you another one in the future.

412
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,570
- Are you afraid?
- I'm not.

413
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,740
You jumped from such a high place a hundred years ago.

414
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,840
I couldn't be there with you.

415
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,240
This time I'm here.

416
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,820
I was the one who was too weak,

417
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,990
so before,

418
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,620
I never dared to tell you my true feelings.

419
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,570
What do you want to say again?

420
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,550
Something like what to remember or forget?

421
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,170
I don't want to hear those words again.

422
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,960
If I don't say it now, I probably won't have another chance.

423
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,400
Do you remember, in the miasma forest,

424
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,760
what you said to me?

425
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,710
I said...

426
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,520
I wanted to become a Holy Sword Sect master and help people.

427
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,820
You said you would rather come with me...

428
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,550
and not return to Jing Pagoda.

429
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,810
- Su Mo.
- Promise me.

430
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,280
If we manage to survive,

431
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,430
to always be...

432
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,720
honest with me in the future.

433
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,020
I promise...

434
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,210
to always...

435
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,310
be honest with you.

436
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,320
Then say, "Everything will turn out as I wish."

437
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,840
Everything will turn out as I wish.

438
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,160
"We will survive this."

439
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,890
We... will survive this.

440
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,620
We will definitely survive this.

441
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,340
Don't be afraid.

442
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,070
We will definitely...

443
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,940
survive this.

444
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:08,920
♫ All beginnings comes at the expense of having endings ♫

445
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:17,090
♫ I once walked over waves to borrow a bit of starlight ♫

446
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,620
♫ Yet, no matter what I do, I cannot see you clearly ♫

447
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,710
♫ I thought that closing my eyes would make my heart clear ♫

448
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,430
♫ Yet I'm just lost in a reverie ♫
♫ All beginnings comes at the expense of having endings ♫

449
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,660
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

450
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,380
♫ However, love makes even breathing so difficult to do ♫

451
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,750
♫ So let love be silent ♫

452
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:50,190
♫ Help each other expand our horizons ♫

455
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,080
Come on.

456
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,960
I'm not scared of you all!

457
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,550
What noise was that?

458
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,290
What?

459
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,900
Brother Crown Prince, Sister Bai Ying and Brother Ice Cube fell in there.

460
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,220
Hurry and save them!

461
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,330
- Your Highness.
- Hurry and save them!

462
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,330
Oh, right! I have the Heavenly Ring.

463
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,810
We can use the Heavenly Ring and save Sister Bai Ying.

464
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,850
- Na Sheng.
- What's going on?

465
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,650
- Stop messing around.
- Why...

466
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,120
Why can't I save them?

467
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,820
What's going on?!

468
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,870
- Na Sheng.
- Brother Crown Prince, is this broken?

469
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,400
Why won't it work?

470
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,410
- Why can't it save–
- Stop it!

471
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,000
If they're alive,

472
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,180
we should be looking for the seal

473
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,320
and then save them.

474
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,580
If they're already...

475
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,750
we should...

476
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,430
break the seal all the more...

477
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,730
and retrieve the Splitting Sword

478
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,340
then finish what they wished.

479
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,510
Your Highness, upfront, seems to be the entrance to the Heavenly King's tomb.

480
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,670
Stop it.

481
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,850
Let's go.

482
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,230
[Banbu City - Military Camp]

483
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,790
Why are you here again?

484
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,980
[Command Token]

485
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,800
I failed to recognize you. General, please forgive me!

486
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,380
Cut the crap. Arrange a small troop and follow me to Jiuyi Mountain.

487
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,210
As for the rest, rush to the entrance of Jiuyi Mountain before sunset.

488
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,130
Yes, but the commander...

489
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,270
You go. Do I have to do it myself?!

490
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,510
I'm pressed for time. If I can't complete the mission on time, I'll blame you!

491
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,440
I understand. I'll respond to the commander immediately.

492
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,980
Luckily, I rushed here and he didn't see my token clearly.

493
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,670
General, this is a token I had a craftsman make.

494
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,210
With so little time, we could only do this much.

495
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,970
If you gave me more time, I could make it even more realistic for sure.

496
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,400
The real owner wouldn't even be able to tell it apart.

497
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,800
That's it. Good enough.

498
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,570
Na Sheng,

499
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,810
did the Heavenly Ring

500
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,960
do anything?

501
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,390
Na Sheng.

502
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,290
The Heavenly Ring seems to sense something.

503
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,390
It should be right in there.

504
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,990
I've found it.

505
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,950
Why won't the door open? Is it a trap?

506
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,990
It doesn't look like a trap.

507
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,050
Why is that?

508
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,650
- I don't know.
- It must be blocked inside.

509
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:55,330
- Let me do it.
- Your Highness, let me do it.

510
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,230
This tunnel does look strange.

511
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,890
How are you going to do it?

512
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,490
Xi Jing, ever since we got to Jiuyi Mountain,

513
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,620
you've been shielding me at every moment.

514
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,790
Look at you. You're ready to die at any time.

515
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,310
If you keep doing this, I'll really be mad at you.

516
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,350
I don't want...

517
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,270
I don't want to see anyone else leave me.

518
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:52,460
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

519
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,920
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

520
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,540
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

521
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:06,260
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

522
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,750
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

523
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,270
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

524
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:20,170
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

525
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,690
♫ We've met several times ♫

526
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,080
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

527
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:34,210
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

528
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,580
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

529
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,140
♫ You live in there ♫

530
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,310
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

531
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,130
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

532
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,120
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

533
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,110
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

534
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,660
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

535
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,030
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

536
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,560
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

537
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,000
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

538
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

539
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,060
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

540
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,020
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

541
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,440
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

542
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,850
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

543
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,920
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

544
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:47,430
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
