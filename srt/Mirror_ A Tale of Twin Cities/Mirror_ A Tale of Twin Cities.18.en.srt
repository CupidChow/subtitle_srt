[Episode 18]

3
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,830
High Priest.

4
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,420
High Priest, wake up!

5
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,210
What happened with last night's fire at the Cangliu Military Camp?

6
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,090
What do you mean by what happened?

7
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,120
High Priest, wake up.

8
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
Think hard.

9
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,460
This is very important.

10
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,180
Yesterday, I indeed saw

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,690
a dragon-shaped shadow

12
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,330
going towards the sky above Jing City.

13
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,970
With another dragon-shaped

14
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,710
shadow coming from the military camp, they met up

15
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,210
and broke through a barrier becoming one

16
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,320
and going straight to the Jing Pagoda.

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,280
They broke through Jing City's barrier?

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,440
Isn't that barrier enchantment extremely powerful?

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,720
That's why I also thought it was incredible.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,850
And then, I calculated.

21
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,620
This force seemed

22
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,980
to have come from the dark side of the moon.

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,970
That's a force that can go beyond the nine heavens

24
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,720
and has the power to change fate.

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,010
High Priest, can you please be serious?

26
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,050
What is this about the dark side of the moon and changing destinies?

27
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,410
Why does it sound more and more evil when you talk about it?

28
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,560
I, the High Priest, never tell lies.

29
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,630
High Priest.

30
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,550
Wake up, High Priest.

31
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,980
High Priest!

32
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,770
Who was it exactly, it was such a powerful force?

33
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,370
Did I use my power to cause that lightning and thunder?

34
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,920
Or... did this force bring them?

35
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,980
- You're awake?
- You're here.

36
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,710
Why didn't you call for a doctor?

37
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,100
I did. No one came.

38
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,070
Maybe they're all treating the injured soldiers on the front lines.

39
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,970
The soldiers with burn injuries from last night?

40
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,250
They say that fire was evil.

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,930
Evil?

42
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,900
This fire was extremely strange. No matter what we did, we couldn't put it out.

43
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,590
We faced heavy casualties.

44
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,160
You know as well that ever since we got the Wind Falcons,

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,120
we had installed water channels in the camp to defend against fires.

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,270
There's a water vat every hundred meters.

47
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,410
This was all to prevent fires.

48
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,220
Yet, all the water was used up last night.

49
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,920
The Wind Falcon Storehouse was completely burned down.

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,020
That scene was really horrifying.

51
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,160
What happened next?

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,020
How did the fire go out?

53
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,360
That's even stranger.

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,060
The fire suddenly appeared and strangely disappeared, too.

55
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,650
We couldn't put the fire out no matter how we tried,

56
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,680
but it went out by itself.

57
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,600
Oh, right!

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,910
I found this under the water jar in the Wind Falcon Storehouse.

59
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,420
This isn't even the most important part. Do you know

60
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,810
there are strong wards protecting Jing City and the military camp?

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,980
I heard that some black smoke broke through the wards

62
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,100
and flew towards Jing Pagoda.

63
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,850
- Jing Pagoda?
- Yes.

64
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,580
Do you know who lives in Jing Pagoda?

65
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,190
My uncle has never let me go up there.

66
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,390
Your older sister has never told you?

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,270
What is this wound? Why is it so scary-looking?

68
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,100
- Blood pact.
- Blood pact?

69
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Why? Do you know about this technique?

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,030
Master Lang has said that this is a Quanxian defense technique.

71
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,570
If they encounter a huge calamity, in order to protect themselves,

72
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,780
it'll be activated.

73
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,980
They have a long life, so it doesn't matter. But the other person would definitely die.

74
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,420
How did you survive?

75
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,120
Master Peng must know about it, too.

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,890
But he let me...

77
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,860
General, Master Lang is looking for you.

78
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,240
All right, I'll go report to him.

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
Xiao, take good care of Yu Huan.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,500
Yes.

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,770
Here.

82
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,180
You've been injured by a blood pact.

83
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,600
Who would have known that you Quanxian would have such a vicious technique?

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,140
Yet it's still not as vicious as Cangliu's techniques and poisons.

85
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,840
You're quite rebellious today with your words.

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,530
- I wouldn't dare.
- Wouldn't dare?

87
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,850
You're someone who isn't even afraid of death.

88
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,890
What? Starting to become timid in front of me?

89
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,220
I've never feared death. General gave me this life.

90
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,490
If General needs it, just take it.

91
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,170
This is the Xiao that I originally met.

92
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,310
Have you seen that stone before?

93
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,410
I've... never seen it.

94
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,100
Is that so?

95
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,480
It's all my fault.

96
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,340
Was it Young Master who burned down the Wind Falcons to save everyone?

97
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,490
Ning Liang, you and I are the only ones left.

98
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,320
If you continue to act so self-sacrificing,

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,010
who will safeguard Quanxian?

100
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,850
Let's do this. When Young Master wakes up,

101
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,260
I'll go with you to admit guilt and ask for punishment. How about it?

102
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,320
Yan Xi.

103
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,590
Na Sheng. You're awake?

104
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,430
You said you'd stay with me.

105
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,950
But you were missing when I woke up.

106
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,600
Sorry. A lot has happened.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,650
I need to handle this.

108
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,060
I know that.

109
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,790
General Xi Jing came by.

110
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,880
I promised him that I'd escort you back to the hut once you woke up.

111
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,030
Can you go back there now?

112
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,250
I... I don't know.

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,850
Na Sheng.

114
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,970
I didn't have malicious intentions.

115
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,490
I don't believe you!

116
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,540
I'm willing to help Quanxuan, but it doesn't mean I'll forgive you.

117
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,010
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,300
I was momentarily obsessed. I...

119
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,830
Kill me or slice me, do as you wish.

120
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,410
Does this give you a profound sense of justice?

121
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,280
I don't want you to die. I want you to remember

122
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,140
that you owe me and Han Zhou.

123
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,070
You'll have to pay it back later!

124
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,780
I will remember. I will always remember the mistake I made today.

125
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,750
This is my necklace.

126
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,580
Please take it. My life is in your hands. You can take it whenever you want.

127
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,750
I don't want you to die!

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,270
Please accept it.

129
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,670
Get up.

130
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,830
Thanks.

131
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,570
I didn't think that Han Zhou would die just like that.

132
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,980
It's all my fault.

133
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,990
I should've listened to Young Master.

134
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,630
This way Elder Yu and Han Zhou wouldn't have died.

135
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,380
Han Zhou shouldn't have blocked that arrow for me.

136
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,690
I'm getting what I deserve.

137
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,470
Han Zhou wouldn't want you to be like this.

138
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,820
Before, whenever you laughed, Han Zhou would laugh, too.

139
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,310
But you usually never smile.

140
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,030
Surely Han Zhou would want you to be happy and carefree.

141
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,460
Thank you for consoling me.

142
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,970
But I've made too many mistakes.

143
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,590
Just make sure you do the right things from now on.

144
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,750
I only unsealed one seal.

145
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,120
Do I have such power?

146
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,420
Or is Su Mo secretly helping us?

147
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,580
Your Highness.

148
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,680
A'Ying.

149
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,710
You're finally awake.

150
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,920
Thank you for helping, Your Highness.

151
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,530
If it wasn't me...

152
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,360
Your Highness?

153
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,100
- What's wrong?
- Where is Na Sheng? How are they?

154
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,850
Na Sheng and Yan Xi are in the main camp.

155
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,760
Xi Jing is also there. He'll protect her.

156
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,110
What about Su Mo? Did he say anything?

157
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,400
He didn't appear again?

158
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,300
A'Ying, I'll find him to clarify it with him.

159
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,920
If Master Lang didn't control half of the Cangliu army,

160
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,280
I would've already captured the holder of the Heavenly Ring.

161
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,090
Why don't you say

162
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,610
that both Yu Huan and Nan Zhao who went with you are both good-for-nothings!

163
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,240
Master Peng, it's precisely because you were so sure of yourself and made arbitrary decisions

164
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,540
that Cangliu suffered this calamity.

165
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,000
All the authority that I have

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,330
is from Lord Zhi Zhe.

167
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,410
If Master Lang has doubts,

168
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,850
why don't you go and ask... what Lord Zhi Zhe thinks.

169
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,180
- Impossible.
- Master Peng and Master Lang have been fighting for many years.

170
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,760
They're just using me as a pawn.

171
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,670
He doesn't care at all if I live or die.

172
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,280
If I continue to seek shelter under him, sooner or later I'd be abandoned by him.

173
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,020
Lord Zhi Zhe has recently gone into seclusion.

174
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,680
I'm unable to see him, too.

175
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,050
Looks like someone is using their powerful connections to intimidate people.

176
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,650
Master Lang, don't think that I don't know

177
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,860
your secret thoughts.

178
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,000
My secret thoughts?

179
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,160
Whatever thoughts do I have,

180
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,260
I don't mind talking about them in the open.

181
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,290
I think, Master Peng,

182
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,680
you, don't deserve to command Cangliu's troops!

183
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,380
Get lost!

184
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,570
Yes.

185
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,190
My Lord.

186
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,320
You've recovered well?

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,810
Yes.

188
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,380
I heard that it was your older sister

189
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,630
who sent you to the Heavenly Temple

190
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,060
to beg Lord Zhi Zhe to treat your injuries.

191
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,240
After all, the Saintess has been by Lord Zhi Zhe all this time.

192
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,550
Her capabilities now...

193
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,170
cannot be underestimated.

194
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,720
My Lord, my older sister and I have always been cared for by you.

195
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,730
I, Yu Huan, will always be grateful.

196
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,280
All these decades,

197
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,900
I've never met Lord Zhi Zhe before.

198
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,180
You were inflicted by the blood pact,

199
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,530
but fortunately, you were able to be treated by Lord Zhi Zhe.

200
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,630
It can be considered a blessing from misfortune.

201
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,720
During these coming days, get some good rest.

202
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,610
Recuperate and recharge.

203
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,370
Yes.

204
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,420
When you were 15 years old,

205
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,840
I brought you to Ruosong Hall.

206
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,660
How could I not know what you're thinking?

207
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,500
Why is Master Peng so suspicious of me?

208
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,560
General.

209
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,170
Come in.

210
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,270
What's the matter?

211
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,510
Losing military authority, I played a part.

212
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,970
Peng is displeased. Be extra careful.

213
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,650
Older Sister.

214
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,810
- Master.
- Emperor of the Sea.

215
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,180
You're finally awake.

216
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,900
You've been unconscious for two days and two nights already.

217
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,020
What happened to me?

218
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,970
Your consciousness was torn.

219
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,020
I temporarily suppressed the backlash from the Splitting Technique.

220
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,130
Thank you, Master, for exerting force to help me.

221
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,320
I'm the one who is grateful for the return of the Emperor of the Sea.

222
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,910
How is everyone?

223
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,470
Yan Xi and the others have rescued all the previously captured people and brought them back.

224
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,160
That's good.

225
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,570
It's just that... Elder Yu and Han Zhou...

226
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,690
have passed away.

227
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,970
Young Master, Kongsang's Princess Bai and Crown Prince Zhen Lan are here to see you.

228
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,240
Young Master is still recuperating and is not available to meet guests.

229
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,680
Tell them to come another day.

230
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,880
Emperor of the Sea, you must recuperate quietly now and you cannot get up.

231
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,190
Emperor of the Sea, you'll hurt yourself by forcibly getting up.

232
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,110
No need to mind me.

233
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,640
Su Mo,

234
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
did you appear after all?

235
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,730
Crown Prince Zhen Lan. Princess Bai.

236
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,800
Our Young Master isn't well today and cannot meet visitors.

237
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,750
What's wrong with him?

238
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,190
Young Master is recuperating from injuries.

239
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,420
Na Sheng was captured. We were attacked by Cangliu. He never appeared.

240
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,760
How did he get injured?

241
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,120
About this...

242
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,370
Wait for him to be well, he'll tell you himself.

243
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,820
I want to see him right now.

244
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,710
- Princess Bai.
- A'Ying.

245
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,350
What are you looking for me for?

246
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,610
Young Master, why have you come out?

247
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,350
I'm fine.

248
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,290
Su Mo, we came...

249
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,580
to pick up Na Shang. Is she all right?

250
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,900
Yan Xi.

251
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,630
Go bring Na Sheng over.

252
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,140
Yes.

253
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,790
Let's sit and talk.

254
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,920
Are you concealing something from me?

255
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,290
I'm not concealing anything from you.

256
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,940
Since Kongsang and Quanxian are allies,

257
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,030
if you have any hidden difficulties, you can tell us.

258
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,800
There's nothing for me to say.

259
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,100
No. No.

260
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,740
A'Ying was just anxious.

261
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,390
She doesn't want this incident to create a misunderstanding between Kongsang and Quanxian.

262
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,820
After all, we're allies.

263
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,630
About Na Sheng,

264
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,000
I indeed have responsibility

265
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,360
and also paid a price for it.

266
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,500
If you want me to apologize,

267
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,380
then I'll say I'm sorry.

268
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,070
What I want to know isn't all that.

269
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,920
Then, what do you want to know?

270
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,020
Don't use the Mirror Technique anymore.

271
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,650
I don't want to always see you

272
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,950
injured every time I see you.

273
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,830
I can't let her know that I used the Splitting Technique,

274
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,360
or she'll be even more worried.

275
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,160
Su Mo, we only want to know

276
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,190
what happened during this incident.

277
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,060
Let me rest for a few days.

278
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,580
I'll complete our agreement as quickly as I can,

279
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,530
go unseal the Six-Direction Seal in the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

280
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,200
I've said all I needed to say.

281
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,270
Both of you, feel free to leave at any time.

282
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,630
A'Ying,

283
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,260
please stay here and wait for me.

284
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,580
Su Mo, wait a moment.

285
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,560
Is there anything else?

286
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,760
We didn't come here to make accusations.

287
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,290
But I wanted to confirm something with you.

288
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,210
Yesterday, I indeed saw

289
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,590
a dragon-shaped shadow going towards the sky above Jing City

290
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,000
With another dragon-shaped shadow coming from the military camp, they met up

291
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,210
and broke through a barrier becoming one and going straight to the Jing Pagoda.

292
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,900
There's nothing to confirm with me.

293
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,890
That day, the fire at Cangliu's Military Camp,

294
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,410
and also the dark clouds that day, you caused them all. Right?

295
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,670
Don't you already have an answer?

296
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,800
Why come and ask me?

297
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,810
I'll explain it to them.

298
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,990
If there's trouble, isn't it good to talk about it?

299
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,330
This incident isn't important anymore.

300
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,030
It was Elder Yu who took Na Sheng there.

301
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,360
We're allies. If there's anything going on, let's talk about it.

302
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,840
We can think of a solution together.

303
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,970
I must go back now. This sun-blocking cape

304
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,870
was made by His Highness using magic powers.

305
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,200
It can only last a short while.

306
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,500
Bai Ying's spiritual consciousness was harmed by sunlight again.

307
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,360
Yes.

308
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,510
I'm incapable. I couldn't protect her well.

309
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,250
Hey, Su Mo.

310
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,020
There's something else. Did you go to the Jing Pagoda?

311
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:55,060
I understand. Don't worry. I'll explain to A'Ying.

312
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,650
There's no need to tell her about this matter.

313
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,160
What does that mean?

314
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,150
Sister Bai Ying!

315
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,840
Na Sheng.

316
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,450
Sister Bai Ying, are you here to pick me up?

317
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,870
Have you seen Brother Ice Cube?

318
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,750
I saw him.

319
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,810
After staying here several days I haven't seen him, but he immediately came out when you arrived.

320
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,880
Young Master has been recuperating in solitude over the past few days.

321
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,100
What kind of serious injury did he suffer?

322
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,320
Is he injured severely?

323
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,670
This... I'm not sure about either.

324
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,950
Your Highness, what did Su Mo say?

325
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,270
A'Ying, Su Mo has his own reasons.

326
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,930
- Don't blame him.
- I know he must have his own reasons.

327
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,230
But whatever it is, can't we face it together?

328
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,570
Let's go back for now.

329
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,890
Na Sheng, let's go.

330
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
I'm leaving then.

331
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,480
Young Master.

332
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,990
Young Master, why do you look so pale?

333
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,790
It's all right.

334
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,600
Young Master, I'm guilty. Elder Yu and I

335
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,830
arbitrarily decided to tie up Na Sheng and negotiate with Cangliu.

336
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,850
We didn't expect Master Peng would renege right away. If Princess Bai didn't bring several Kongsang princes to save us,

337
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,950
I'm afraid...

338
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,320
I was the negligent one not to have guarded the camp well,

339
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,090
to have let all this happen. Please punish us, Young Master.

340
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,160
It's all my fault, and I even caused Han Zhou's death.

341
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,520
Elder Yu also lost his life.

342
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,420
Young Master, I'm willing to bear all the consequences. Please punish me.

343
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,460
Both of you are asking to be punished.

344
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,120
Do you want me to execute you?

345
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,950
Get up.

346
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,190
Yan Xi, recognize Elder Yu and Han Zhou posthumously as Quanxian Warriors,

347
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,750
and bestow them with water funerals.

348
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,540
- Yes.
- Young Master.

349
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,250
When I was away for 100 years, Elder Yu did everything he could to lead the Quanxian.

350
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,370
I respected him very much.

351
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,500
Young Master, after this incident, will the Land-Sea Alliance be affected?

352
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,720
I've already agreed with Zhen Lan. We'll teach Na Sheng to be familiar with water.

353
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,010
Young Master, please order me to protect Miss Na Sheng.

354
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,860
I've been punished and will not act recklessly again.

355
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,790
I only want a chance to redeem my mistake with merit.

356
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,690
Young Master, Ning Liang has already obtained Na Sheng's understanding

357
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,290
by giving her necklace to Na Sheng.

358
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,960
Ning Liang will definitely fight to the death to protect Na Sheng.

359
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,920
All right then.

360
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,420
Ning Liang, remember never to be impulsive again.

361
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,060
You may leave first.

362
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,790
How is Cangliu right now? How are the people who've been rescued?

363
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,370
Cangliu's army suffered severe casualties. Xiang and Xiao rescued all of them.

364
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:12,330
Should we tell the Quanxian troops about Young Master setting fire to Cangliu's Military Camp?

365
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,520
This will raise everyone's morale. Previously, Young Master was concerned about the plan not working

366
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,200
and concealed it on purposed. Now that we are victorious,

367
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,680
shouldn't we let everyone know?

368
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,650
Don't mention it for now.

369
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,910
Young Master.

370
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,290
Speak.

371
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:32,620
Before Princess Bai left, she asked me about the injuries you suffered and where you got injured.

372
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,020
So she cares about me.

373
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,820
You may leave now.

374
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,870
Yes.

375
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,760
Ning Liang.

376
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,430
Should I take some snacks and things to play with to Na Sheng?

377
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,350
I sense that she doesn't particularly want to see me.

378
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:05,780
No. If she didn't forgive you, she wouldn't have accepted your necklace.

379
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,960
Even though Na Sheng is somewhat childish, she isn't immature.

380
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,830
Sometimes she just gets noisy, throws a temper, or plays at being cute.

381
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,620
When it comes to a lot of things, if you reason with her, she'll listen.

382
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,590
She'll understand you.

383
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,560
But... it's still good to take something to eat.

384
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,320
Na Sheng.

385
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,320
I just came back to the hut, and you're already here.

386
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,810
Brother Crown Prince said that Sister Bai Ying is still not fully recovered, so she has to go back to Wuse City.

387
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm so bored.

388
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,320
Why is she here?

389
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,290
Young Master told me to come here to teach you how to walk underwater.

390
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,190
Get ready to go down to the Ghost and Deity Abyss at any moment.

391
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,960
Ning Liang volunteered to come and protect you.

392
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,050
But with you here, that's enough.

393
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,880
Thanks.

394
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,590
A'Ying, how have you been with His Highness over the past few days?

395
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:38,400
His Highness and I? I haven't seen him for the past few days.

396
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,480
That's the crux of the problem.

397
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,030
In the past few days, I get the sense that His Highness has been avoiding you.

398
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,440
No. He's been avoiding all of us.

399
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,090
Is that so? I haven't noticed.

400
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,830
For the past few days, you've been a little absent-minded as well.

401
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,800
That day when you went to Quanxian's main camp, what happened exactly?

402
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,950
After His Highness returned, he only said that the Land-Sea Alliance is intact.

403
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,960
He wanted us to find the Water Dispelling Pearl,

404
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,430
but said nothing about the incident where Quanxian's elder abducted Na Sheng.

405
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,460
His Highness must have his own reasons. We shouldn't get carried away.

406
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,850
- Do you know something?
- No, I don't.

407
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,660
I only know that we must get the Water Dispelling Pearl as soon as possible and unseal the seal.

408
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,140
After the Land-Sea Alliance, so many things have happened even before we've unsealed the seals.

409
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,890
I'm worried about how you'll face Su Mo later on.

410
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,790
Su Mo and I are only allies.

411
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,110
Only allies? Are you lying to me or to yourself?

412
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,860
When it comes to some things, running from them isn't a solution.

413
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:39,530
I'm not lying to you, nor am I lying to myself. Once we've unsealed the seals, we'll...

414
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,900
That's why being allies with him is the best choice.

415
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,320
Maybe he doesn't think that way.

416
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,000
Forget it. It's fine as long as you don't regret it.

417
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,730
No matter what I do, I'll regret it.

418
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,770
Because I want too much.

419
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,270
A'Ying, it's not that you want too much.

420
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,620
It's destiny playing with us.

421
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,560
If all those things hadn't happened 100 years ago,

422
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,120
perhaps it wouldn't be this way now.

423
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,990
If you don't act on some of these matters now,

424
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,790
you probably won't have a chance to in the future.

425
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,390
If Ting were still alive,

426
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,330
she probably would want to swim, too.

427
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,770
You're not combining your power and breathing correctly.

428
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,360
How do you combine it?

429
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,070
You need to learn to push your air into your central core.
(T/N: the area where qi resides, 2 inches below the navel)

430
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,990
Where's the central core?

431
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,630
It's here.

432
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,910
Here?

433
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,230
You must push the air into the central core. Inhale, and then exhale completely.

434
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,950
Try it once.

435
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,720
Inhale.

436
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,100
You are not doing it correctly.

437
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,470
What's the matter?

438
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,730
No-Nothing. Nothing. You can leave.

439
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,030
Why are you blushing?

440
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,760
I need to take a break. Just take a break.

441
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,260
You're far from being able to walk underwater. You must practice more. Understand?

442
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,220
I understand, Big Uncle. Take a look at the terrain of the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

443
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,180
Ning Liang, do you want to go swimming?

444
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,150
- Sure.
- No!

445
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,430
You-You're not allowed to go.

446
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,020
All right. I'll leave then.

447
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,220
Wait. Wait.

448
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,760
I didn't mean that.

449
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,710
I just...

450
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,140
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

451
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,120
Brother Ice Cube.

452
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,690
Brother Ice Cube, have you recovered?

453
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,390
This is great.

454
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,300
Can I discuss some serious business with you?

455
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,470
Can you transfer Ning Liang back?

456
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,600
See? There are so many lush trees around here.

457
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,950
Oh, Yan Xi is here too. Yan Xi and Uncle Xi Jing are here to protect me day and night.

458
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,590
With Ning Liang here, it's actually affecting my studies.

459
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,730
I'll take a look over there.

460
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,320
Why are you here?

461
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,040
I want to chat with Zhen Lan about the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

462
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,350
Just for that?

463
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,670
Zhen Lan hasn't said anything.

464
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,730
There probably isn't any progress yet.

465
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,690
Is there anything else you want to ask?

466
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,230
Can't you just talk directly?

467
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,380
As a person,

468
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,890
you're not unlikable,

469
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,580
but I really don't like this about you.

470
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,470
After A'Ying brought Na Sheng back,

471
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,640
she looked full of worries.

472
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,740
How is she?

473
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,550
He's been injured severely. I should've gone there sooner.

474
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,840
Luckily, that day, it suddenly started to flash lightning and thunder.

475
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,170
Wasn't that Zhen Lan's magic power?

476
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:55,060
Senior Brother, do you also think it was the Crown Prince's magic power?

477
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,370
The other princes also think so.

478
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,630
I really wish it were Crown Prince.

479
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,710
But we only undid one of the Six-Direction Seals.

480
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,480
The Power of Heaven also hasn't been restored.

481
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,550
This power to call forth wind and rain,

482
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,290
I don't think Crown Prince has achieved it yet.

483
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,150
What if it weren't Zhen Lan's power,

484
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,330
was the rain from Heaven?

485
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,470
What do you think?

486
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,010
You went to the Quanxian Camp today.

487
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,270
What did Su Mo say?

488
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,220
He wasn't willing to see us.

489
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,970
He didn't say anything.

490
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,000
Are you two throwing tempers around?

491
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,290
There aren't many people with this power in Yunhuang.

492
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,860
If Su Mo can call forth wind and rain,

493
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,920
then he also burned down the Wind Falcons.

494
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,770
If he really is the one that did that,

495
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,130
what technique did he use?

496
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,040
I don't dare to think about it.

497
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,520
So, everything you've done,

498
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,660
she's already well aware of.

499
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,920
If you want to say anything, just tell her directly.

500
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,710
Isn't that also why you came here?

501
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,420
You're a mighty Emperor of the Sea.

502
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,000
You can rip apart Wind Falcons, barge into Cangliu's Military Camp,

503
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,270
what can't you say directly?

504
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,370
If you don't say it now, you'll regret it later on.

505
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,580
That day, the sunlight burned her spiritual consciousness again.

506
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,440
I wonder if we can find a way to solve this.

507
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,230
I'm afraid there isn't.

508
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,470
Zhen Lan used his magic power to make a sun-blocking cloak,

509
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,740
but Zhen Lan's power is limited,

510
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,080
so the cloak can only last for a short time.

511
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,470
The road to unseal the seals still needs long-term planning.

512
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,660
Jiuyi Mountain and Ghost and Deity Abyss are both far away.

513
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,120
She's also very worried.

514
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,450
But she always pretends to be strong and doesn't talk about it.

515
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,570
I'm leaving now.

516
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,670
That day, the sunlight burned her spiritual consciousness again.

517
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,430
I wonder if we can find a way to solve this.

518
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,260
- Emperor of the Sea.
- Master.

519
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,530
For 10,000 years, you've traveled between Heaven and Earth.

520
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,690
There probably isn't anything that you haven't seen.

521
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,530
Does the Emperor of the Sea want to ask a question?

522
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,260
Bai Ying and the others cannot walk under the sun.

523
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,670
Why can sunlight burn and damage her spiritual consciousness?

524
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,110
The six princes must have exchanged half of their spiritual consciousness

525
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,930
to fulfill their wishes.

526
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,730
Half of their spiritual consciousness?

527
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,580
You mean, as long as the other half of their spirit sense is amended, they won't fear the sunlight anymore?

528
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:15,210
But in this world, who would be willing to give half of their own spiritual consciousness to someone else?

529
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,310
Emperor of the Sea, you aren't thinking...

530
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,460
of wanting to separate your spiritual consciousness?

531
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,980
Don't you still need to go with the Kongsang to unseal the seals?

532
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,170
Of course, the seals must be unsealed. If we can't do it,

533
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,380
Quanxian won't be able to return to the Biluo Sea.

534
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,360
It's just that...

535
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,870
I don't want to see Bei Ying injured because of me again.

536
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,480
Emperor of the Sea, you're a merperson.

537
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,170
Bai Ying is from Kongsang.

538
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,840
Even if you wanted to, you can't directly give your spiritual consciousness to her.

539
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,920
I can't directly...

540
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,140
Young Master.

541
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,570
Why are you back?

542
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,560
Ning Liang is still at the hut protecting Na Sheng.

543
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,890
I received news from Cangliu today, so I came here to report.

544
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,860
What is the news?

545
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,750
Young Master, you burned down Cangliu's Military Camp and destroyed their Wind Falcons,

546
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,330
causing Master Peng to lose his military command authority.

547
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,200
The command of Cangliu's military is temporarily under Master Xian.

548
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,960
Master Peng is getting what he deserves.

549
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,860
But Cangliu won't let it stop there.

550
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,240
We must hurry to unseal the other seals.

551
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,430
On the search for the Water Dispelling Pearl,

552
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,440
there's still no news from Kongsang.

553
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,660
We probably can't go to the Ghost and Deity Abyss anytime soon.

554
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,740
I'll discuss this matter with Zhen Lan.

555
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,970
While the Cangliu army is changing their commanding general,

556
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,690
let's hurry and unseal the other seals.

557
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,570
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

558
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,660
Elders, please rise.

559
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,450
Young Master, have you fully recovered?

560
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,900
Thank you for caring, Elder Quan.

561
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,500
On behalf of Elder Yu, we acknowledge our guilt to the Emperor of the Sea.

562
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,130
Elders, you've made this too serious.

563
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,430
Even though Young Master didn't tell us,

564
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,420
but we know that

565
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,170
burning down Cangliu's Military Camp

566
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,130
and destroying the Wind Falcons relied on Young Master's power.

567
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,580
It's just a pity,

568
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,310
that Elder Yu and Han Zhou still lost their lives.

569
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,110
It's because the Cangliu are vicious and ruthless.

570
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,580
When Young Master first returned to Quanxian's Camp

571
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,190
and proposed to ally with Kongsang,

572
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,970
we really were confused about it.

573
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,080
Elder Yu and the rest of us elders

574
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,290
believed Cangliu's promise

575
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,810
and made a huge mistake.

576
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,070
Young Master, you're right.

577
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,070
The vicious Cangliu are our true enemy.

578
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:11,470
We'll definitely do our best to carry out the Land-Sea Alliance.

579
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,750
Good.

580
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,250
For the past hundred years, Quanxian relied on you, the elders.

581
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,170
I hope you'll continue to give more guidance in the future,

582
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,550
so that we can return to Biluo Sea soon.

583
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,580
Now that Young Master has returned,

584
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,910
- Quanxian finally has hope.
- That's right.

585
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,410
Seven thousand years ago,

586
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,570
it was fortunate that Master used the Jade Pearl to preserve the Emperor of the Sea's bloodline.

587
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,960
The Jade Pearl can preserve the Emperor of the Sea's bloodline?

588
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,810
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫
