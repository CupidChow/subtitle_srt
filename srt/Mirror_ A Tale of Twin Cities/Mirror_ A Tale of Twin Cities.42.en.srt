[Episode 42]

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
Strange. Why hasn't anyone tried to block me this whole way here?

4
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Yu Huan.

5
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing?

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,270
Once the barrier for Wuse City was broken,

7
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,000
the corridor I was in would have immediately disappeared.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,900
You knew about this from the start, didn't you?

9
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,600
I was testing you.

10
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Testing me? This test will kill me!

11
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,300
If you can't even survive that,

12
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,400
how are you going to be the commander of the Five Masters?

13
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,300
How can you hold the position of Commanding General?

14
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,800
What a pity.

15
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,100
The Spirit Mirror Stage...

16
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,300
you failed again!

17
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
You can use me...

18
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
to remove those that you want to get rid of.

19
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
But I also want the position that I deserve.

20
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Having ambition is a good thing,

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
but do you have that capability?

22
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,700
My Lord, I bet you probably have no more soldiers

23
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,100
and no more chess pieces to deploy.

24
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,400
I can capture the person who holds the heavenly power,

25
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,800
but please also remember my condition.

26
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Naturally.

27
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,410
Master Peng, the person has arrived.

28
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,200
Yan Xi. Yan Xi.

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,500
Yan Xi, wake up!

30
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

31
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
You may leave.

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
This isn't what Yan Xi really wants to do!

33
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,100
What exactly did you do to Yan Xi?

34
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,820
So you captured me because of this ring?

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Don't waste time talking.

36
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,300
Give me the ring.

37
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Yan Xi. Yan Xi!

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Wake up! Wake up, Yan Xi!

39
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,500
What's wrong, Yan Xi?

40
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,400
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

41
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,600
Wait!

42
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
The Cangliu cannot use this ring.

43
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,300
Release me and Yan Xi, and I'll tell you how to use the ring.

44
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,100
You are in no position to bargain right now.

45
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,100
Give it here.

46
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,500
Give it here.

47
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,500
Heaven, oh Heaven.

48
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,900
Why aren't you reacting at all at a time like this?

49
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,000
Yan Xi, let's go!

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,700
Stop!

51
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,800
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

52
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,400
Arrest them!

53
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,900
Are you okay, Yan Xi?

54
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,500
Yan Xi, wake up!

55
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,100
Stupid girl, do you think with the Heavenly Ring

56
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,600
you are as important as the Emperor of the Sea and the Crown Prince?

57
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
If you try to play tricks again,

58
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I'll peel his skin off,

59
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,900
fry it, and feed it to you.

60
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
- Yan Xi! Yan Xi!
- Take him away!

61
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,400
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

62
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
- Go!
- Yan Xi!

63
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Yan Xi!

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Let go of me!

65
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
Yan Xi!

66
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,080
What are you thinking about?

67
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Nothing much.

68
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,200
If one day you can live to 1,000 years like we do,

69
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
what would you want to do?

70
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,800
In the first hundred years, taste all the best wines in the world with you.

71
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,900
The Remember Home wine that was brewed by Queen Bai Wei over 7,000 years ago

72
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,000
is supposed to be pretty good. I'd like to try it.

73
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,410
You want to see me exhale bubbles for a hundred years?

74
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,940
What else?

75
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Every year come to the Flower Festival with you and make a wish.

76
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,800
Then in 1,000 years, I can make over 1,000 wishes.

77
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
Why don't you make a wish to me then?

78
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,100
The probability of success would be higher.

79
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,000
Is there anything that you want to do by yourself?

80
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,660
No.

81
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,110
Nothing?

82
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,800
If I'm by myself,

83
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,000
why live that long?

84
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,900
All that I want

85
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,100
is for you to live on and live happily.

86
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,300
Live a long, long time.

87
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,600
Even if I use up all my strength

88
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,500
and exhaust everything I have.

89
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,300
I finally sold everything.

90
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,800
You've come late.

91
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,500
All the wishing plaques are sold out.

92
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,800
Sold out so early?

93
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,100
They're arresting people everywhere now.

94
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Everyone is hurrying to make their wishes before nightfall to get home sooner.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
The more not at peace we are, the better my business is.

96
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,100
I don't really know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

97
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,900
You two are so lucky. This is the last wishing plaque.

98
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,100
It's fated to have met each other.

99
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,600
I'll gift you this last wishing plaque then.

100
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,100
Thank you.

101
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,300
I'm leaving.

102

[Live happily forever]

103
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,130
I'll fulfill Bai Lin's wish.

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,420
Why did you hang a blank wishing plaque?

105
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,600
Many people don't have the chance to come to the Flower Festival. This blank wishing plaque

106
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,800
is to wish for more people to have their wishes fulfilled.

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,200
Why don't you ever make a wish?

108
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,600
I hope that I can fulfill my own wish.

109
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Actually, after experiencing the Six Star Reversal Formation,

110
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,200
I thought through a lot of things.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,400
It's been 100 years. I've experienced struggles

112
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,400
and fears about turning into ash.

113
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,200
But none of that is important now.

114
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,300
With you by my side, I'm very content.

115
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
It's a blessing if you can succeed.

116
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,000
A gift. If it's not possible,

117
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't think I'll be afraid either.

118
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,400
I will definitely succeed.

119
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,080
I still have the rest of my life to spend with you.

120
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,530
Believe in me.

121
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,720
Although...

122
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,460
I didn't regain all my memories,

123
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,570
your voice has always been in my mind.

124

You said,

125
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,840
Everything will be as I wish.

126
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,040

[Master Peng's Residence - Cangliu]

152

What's this?

153
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,780
It was on Yu Zhu.

154
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,530
Why did Lord Zhi Zhe suddenly call all Five Masters

155
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,150
to the tower?

156
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,980
Is he suspicious?

157
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,870
So you're suspicious of her?

158
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,630
Arrest her.

159
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,460

Please go ahead, Master Peng.

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,690

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,400
we can't wait any longer.

170
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,290
Yu Zhu, you're crying again.

171
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,690
When I first brought you

172
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,300
and your brother here,

173
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,590
you were also ashen and crying

174
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,370
from having been bullied.

175
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,810
I'm crying...

176
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,740
because I can't see my brother A'Huan.

177
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,870
Master Peng,

178
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,740
all these years,

179
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,020
it wasn't just my brother who saw you as a father.

180
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,410
I...

181
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,560
also wanted to call you my father.

182
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,410
I also often wondered,

183
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,740
how great it would be...

184
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,270
if you two really were...

185
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,490
my children.

186
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,590
[Cangliu - Imperial Prison]

187
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,420
Yan Xi. Yan Xi.

188
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,270
- Water.
- Water.

189
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,810
- Water.
- Water.

190
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,400
Water.

191
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,430
There's no water!

192
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,830
Is anyone there? Help!

193
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,830
Help! Is anyone there?

194
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,000
Someone help! Help!

195
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,140
Help! Is there any water?

196
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,320
Someone help!

197
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,050
Yan Xi.

198
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,080
Yan Xi. How are you doing?

199
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,460
Yan Xi. Why did you help me?

200
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,490
You don't even recognize me anymore. Why did you help me?

201
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,140
What do I do? He's badly hurt.

202
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,180
We're done for.

203
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,130
You're badly hurt.

204
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,180
You're the same as when I first met you.

205
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,790
Wake up.

206
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,770
No. Wait a minute.

207
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,020
I had snow poppies then,

208
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,930
but I have nothing now. What should I do?

209
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,540
Na Sheng.

210
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,570
What?

211
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,180
- Na Sheng.
- I'm here, I'm here.

212
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,470
Don't leave.

213
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm not leaving. I'm not going anywhere.

214
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,500
Yan Xi.

215
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,000
Sometimes I wonder about how great it would be

216
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,290
if you had never met me.

217
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,080
That way,

218
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,270
you wouldn't be like this now either.

219
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,650
If Heaven hadn't chosen me,

220
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,180
I wouldn't be hunted down either.

221
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,950
I could be living a carefree life.

222
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,030
Yan Xi.

223
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,510
But if I hadn't met you,

224
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,560
then I wouldn't have fallen in love.

225
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,830
And I wouldn't have met Brother Ice Cube,

226
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,580
Sister Bai Ying, Brother Crown Prince, and Uncle Xi Jing.

227
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,710
I've had so many happy days

228
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,410
with all of you.

229
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,790
I've had more happy days than the days I spent on the Central Plains.

230
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,340
Now that I think about it,

231
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,530
it's actually not that bad

232
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,320
to have the power of Heaven.

233
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,740
What do you want? Don't come over here!

234
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,820
- You… What are you doing?!
- Come with me.

235
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,640
- Where are we going?
- I'll kill him if you waste any more time.

236
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,500
Don't! Don't kill him! Don't kill him!

237
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,370
Please, I beg you. Can you bring him with us?

238
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,060
- Please.
- Do you want to die with him?

239
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,210
No, no. Can you give him a drink of water?

240
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,830
He's thirsty. Just a sip.

241
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,470
Let go of me! Yan Xi!

242
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,100
Yan Xi! Wait for me to come back!

243
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,670
When I get back, I'll return to Biluo Sea with you!

244
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,600
Yan Xi!

245
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,450
Let go of me! Yan Xi!

246
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,200
- Your Highness, High Priest.
- Did you find Na Sheng?

247
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,810
The cloak is on the verge of losing its efficiency.

248
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,090
We searched the log cabin at Jing Lake and all the surrounding places they might have gone,

249
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,230
but we still couldn't find them.

250
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,770
Could they have been captured?

251
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,440
Isn't Yan Xi protecting Na Sheng? What on earth is going on?

252
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,190
Since we haven't heard from them in so long,

253
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,870
I'm afraid it's more likely that they're in trouble.

254
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,230
High Priest, can this Water Mirror still find Na Sheng?

255
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,110
Your Highness, it's completely destroyed.

256
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,540
Where's A'Ying?

257
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,410
She should be at the Great Camp of Jing Lake.

258
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,950
Okay. I'll go look for them.

259
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,520
There's so many of you and you still can't beat one Yu Huan!

260
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,610
My Lord, I'll go after the bearer of the heavenly power.

261
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,210
No need.

262
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,790
Set up an inescapable net in the Hall of the Five Masters.

263
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,800
Kill Yu Huan as soon as he gets back.

264
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,580
Yes.

265
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,130
I knew...

266
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,270
you were the most obedient one.

267
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,650
Hong Yan and the others have been out looking, but they still can't find Na Sheng.

268
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,570
Before Na Sheng said that she found something wrong with Yan Xi.

269
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,910
There were many things off about Yan Xi ever since he got back.

270
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,090
What was off?

271
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,070
I think it could be Cangliu's mind control technique.

272
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,420
- Young Master.
- You're back.

273
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,690
Where are Yan Xi and Na Sheng?

274
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,870
At the entrance to Jing City's prison, I saw Yu Huan take Na Sheng away.

275
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,600
He was being very careful so I couldn't follow him.

276
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,620
Na Sheng wasn't with Yan Xi?

277
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,460
No, but I've already asked the people at the post to continue to look for him.

278
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,420
Yu Huan left with Na Sheng in a hurry.

279
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,760
I'm worried that Na Sheng's life is in jeopardy, so I rushed back here first.

280
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,120
When we went to Jing City to look for news,

281
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,760
Yu Huan was already on the wanted list. Where could he go?

282
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,590
He can't go back to Master Peng. Yu Huan probably took Na Sheng to Jing Pagoda.

283
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,430
Continue to look into this.

284
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,910
Yes.

285
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,000
It seems that we need to go to Jing Pagoda.

286
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,090
Su Mo.

287
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,650
Catch.

288
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,150
Use its power to its fullest extent

289
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,930
with your power of the dragon deity.

290
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,360
We've been wishing for freedom for too long.

291
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,460
Our people can't wait any longer.

292
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,200
This battle is unpredictable.

293
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,640
The only thing I can do is give it my all.

294
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,850
Master, wait for me to get back.

295
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,780
Return safely, Emperor of the Sea.

296
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,160
My Lord.

297
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,220
I brought you the bearer of Heaven, Na Sheng.

298
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,060
Come in.

299
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,960
You don't need to come in. I have something important for you to do.

300
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,450
The Five Masters are setting up a rebellion.

301
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,790
After you settle this,

302
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,060
I'll give you what you want.

303
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,460
What about my sister then?

304
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,450
Yu Zhu...

305
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,030
should've already gone down to relay the edict.

306
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,240
Heaven chose you.

307
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,600
You're not the only thing I want.

308
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,030
I also want Heaven, Earth,

309
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:11,020
and Su Mo to die with you.

310
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,990
Just wait patiently.

311
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,710
Let me go!

♪ The fog shrouds the nine towering peaks ♪

316
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,530
He's finally here.

317
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,380
Brother Crown Prince! Brother Crown Prince!

318
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,610
Na Sheng!

319
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,800
It doesn't work.

320
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,920
Na Shang, get up. Are you all right?

321
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,350
I'm fine. Where's Sister Bai Ying and Brother Ice Cube?

322
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,230
You didn't see them?

323
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,070
No.

324
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,790
Could they…

325
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,230
Na Sheng, first we're going to remove the last seal.

326
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,970
We'll meet up with them after I regain my strength.

327
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,920
Okay. That works.

328
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
Let's go.

329
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,730
There are books everywhere. How will we find it?

330
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,920
Na Sheng, use the heavenly power to see if you can find any clues.

331
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,350
Okay.

332
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,920
[Dark Golden Classics]

333
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,600
Dark Golden Classics. So it was here.

334
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,010
The hope that just appeared was fake.

335
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,860
I didn't expect the last seal

336
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,410
to be hidden in the Dark Golden Classics.

337
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,330
Brother Crown Prince.

338
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,020
You're finally here...

339
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,490
This should be the first time we're officially meeting.

340
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,560
Should I be calling you Zhi Zhe...

341
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,390
or Lang Gan?

342
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:33,070
Why ask if you already know the answer?

343
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,620
A'Ying is in danger.

344
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,570
I'm a deity from the clans of Yunfu City.

345
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,160
If you want to defeat me, then wait another 7,000 years!

346
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,580
That light is...

347
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,400
Pojun.
(T/N: Eastern most star of the Big Dipper)

348
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,210
The reappearance of Pojun will cause worldwide turbulence.

349
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,290
Zhi Zhe's energy triggered the reappearance of Pojun.

350
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:04,430
We must find him soon, otherwise it'll harm the people of Yunhuang.

351
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,550
Sister!

352
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,240
Sister!

353
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,620
You want to find your sister?

354
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
Who are you?

355
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,580
- Who are you?
 - I've summoned you before.

356
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,100
If you surrender to me,

357
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,050
not only can you protect your sister, but you can also have all of Yunhuang.

358
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,730
Haven't you always wanted to work your way up and decide your own fate?

359
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,360
What are you waiting for? Hand yourself

360
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,740
over to me.

361
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,190
All right.

362
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,030
Uncle.

363
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,770
What happened?

364
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,210
We thought that beheading him

365
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,030
was the best way to keep Yu Huan under control.

366
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,690
Unexpectedly...

367
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,480
Uncle.

368
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,690
Unexpectedly...

369
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,780
Kill them!

370
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,700
Run...

371
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,270
You must run.

372
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,190
Report!

373
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,500
General Yu Huan, General Fei Lian has already broken his way in.

374
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,460
- We couldn't stop him at all.
- Get out!

375
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,270
- Let him in!
- Yes.

376
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,180
Yu Huan! I didn't expect to be stopped here!

377
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,050
Stop right there!

378
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,610
Did you come to get revenge for Master Lang?

379
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,410
You think I don't want to?

380
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,850
I'm here to talk you into stopping this.

381
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,250
Stopping this?

382
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,850
Why should I?

383
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,860
Where can I go?

384
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,980
I know that you hate Master Peng for killing your sister.

385
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,570
I know you hate the Five Masters for torturing and using you.

386
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,100
- But the people of Yunhuang are innocent.
- So what?

387
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,690
The only family I had is dead.

388
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,660
I want all of Cangliu to be buried with my sister.

389
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,070
Your closest family?

390
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,560
You killed the only relative of mine. What else do you want!

391
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,090
What about mine!

392
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,970
Because she wanted to protect me,

393
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,540
she died a violent death.

394
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,870
Do you know?

395
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,450
A merpersons heart

396
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,890
lies in the middle.

397
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,860
Mine's...

398
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,240
long gone.

399
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,300
Yan Xi? Yan Xi!

400
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,060
Yan Xi, you've woken up.

401
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,950
Na Sheng...

402
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,760
I'm sorry.

403
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,830
I shouldn't have taken you to Jing City.

404
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,790
I don't blame you.

405
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,600
Yan Xi, I don't blame you.

406
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,940
After going through life-and-death situations,

407
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,870
we should cherish each other.

408
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,010
I told you before

409
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,840
that when I got back,

410
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,490
I'd go back to Biluo Sea with you.

411
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,880
Are you willing to take me with you?

412
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,660
That would be the greatest honor in my life.

413
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,980
Greetings, Emperor of the Sea.

414
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,670
Please rise.

415
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,780
I don't know why the Emperor of the Sea asked us to come here?

416
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,490
A few days ago Zhi Zhe ran away.

417
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,150
Currently, his energy is still lurking in Yunhuang, poisoning the people

418
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,080
and controlling everything.

419
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,890
Who in the world is Zhi Zhe then?

420
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,680
Do you all know about Yunfu City?

421
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,020
Yunfu City is inhabited by the nine deity clans.

422
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,830
7,000 years ago, Lang Gan came to Yunhuang and became the Heavenly King.

423
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,700
Later on, he became Zhi Zhe.

424
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,550
So that means, Zhi Zhe was controlling everything

425
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,880
behind the scenes?

426
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,570
That's right.

427
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,660
After the Jing Pagoda battle,

428
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,420
we destroyed Zhi Zhe's body,

429
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,710
but he transferred his power to Yu Huan.

430
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,120
Zhi Zhe is gone!

431
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,110
The Five Masters are dead!

432
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,540
From now on, I am the sole leader of Cangliu!

433
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,430
Yu Huan has already become the new leader of Cangliu.

434
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,650
Right now, he's arresting those who would try to stop him.

435
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,940
I've immediately invited the Crown Prince of Kongsang and Princess Bai over

436
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,470
to discuss together how to deal with Yu Huan.

437
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,530
All of you already know by now, right?

438
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,410
We're going to discuss with the Emperor of the Sea the battle with Yu Huan.

439
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,250
When we beat Yu Huan,

440
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,090
we'll be able to return to Yunhuang.

441
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,340
Yan Xi, hear my order. You must guard the Quanxian Camp

442
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,650
and protect everyone while I'm not here.

443
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,690
I'll obey your command.

444
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,180
- Honor and respect General Yu Huan!
- Honor and respect General Yu Huan!

445
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,720
Elder Quan.

446
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,090
Emperor of the Sea, please give your orders.

447
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,240
I hope all elders will help Yan Xi

448
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,270
protect the Quanxian Camp.

449
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,410
Please rest assured, Emperor of the Sea.

450
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:14,980
We will do our very best.

451
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,080
You must be extra careful as well.

452
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,640
Right now, Yu Huan is killing dissidents everywhere.

453
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,060
Using cruel and merciless methods, it's like he's lost his mind.

454
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,320
That's why we must hurry and stop him before he goes completely crazy.

455
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,660
Zhi Zhe came to find me.

456
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,920
I've agreed.

457
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,860
Yu Huan, right now he's slowly absorbing your will!

458
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,100
Don't be fooled by him!

459
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,760
You've exposed Puojun. If you're bewitched by Zhi Zhe,

460
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,670
then there will be no peace in Yunhuang anymore

461
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,780
and more innocent people will be dragged into this!

462
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,080
Is this what you want?

463
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,710
I want to renounce this entire world!

464
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:08,080
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

465
