Is this the first time you've gotten me in trouble?

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,240
You must listen to me this time.

00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,520
I locked you up after the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

In the end, you were the one that saved me.

Now that I can't stay in Cangliu,

to help a brother?

12
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,990
You'll definitely regret it.

Let's wait until the day I regret it, to worry about it.

It would appear that unless I invite you to inspect my room,

No. Farewell.

Master Peng.

81
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,290
As soon as you arrived,

82
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,300
you accused Fei Lian of hiding a convicted killer.

83
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,530
Now that you can't find anything,

84
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,540
are you really going to leave just like that?

What do you want, then?

- Do you want to destroy all of us?

You were lucky this time. If you are reckless again,

90
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,380
don't blame me for being harsh with you.

91
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,360

92
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,990

- The front hall.

99
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,360
Help me by luring him here.

100
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,100
Lure him here? What about you two...

101
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,110
It's only if he comes this way, that we'll have the chance to leave.

102
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,560
It's time for me to leave anyway.

103
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,760
Master Peng.

104
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,060
How did it go?

105
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,430
What do you think?

106
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,490
You didn't find Yu Huan at Fei Lian's.

107
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,600
I can only say that he isn't there right now.

108
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,250
Too bad that he wasn't caught with the goods.

109
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,820
Master Lang is truly a thorn in the eye.

110
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,320
Master Peng didn't find Yu Huan.

111

He didn't.

113
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,100
where can he run to?

114
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,590

116
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,250
Your Highness, the seal from the Ghost and Deity Abyss has been removed for some time now.

117
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,600
What will Your Highness do next?

118
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,050
Right now, only the seal on the top of Jing Pagoda remains.

119
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,290
Once that seal is removed, I can obtain the power of Heaven. However...

120
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,370
Your Highness, are you still worried about the six princes

121
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,520
turning into ash?

122
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,290
I'm not only worried,

123
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,790
but I also want to find a solution to avoid them turning into ash.

124
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,140
Your Highness, when Wuse City was opened 100 years ago,

125
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,710
the six princes were already prepared to be sacrificed.

126
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,370
Kongsang's 100,000 citizens who are in slumber are my people.

127
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,580
The six princes are also my people.

128
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,280
Your Highness, achievements come with a price.

129
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,990
But they can't be that price.

130
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,320
Master, I've already obtained the power of the dragon deity.

131
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,010
I will definitely bring you back.

132
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,760
Young Master.

133
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,650
Your health has been substaintially restored.

134
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,540
The dragon deity's power can indeed protect you.

135
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,260
The power of the dragon deity can do more than protect my health.

136
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,310
Does Young Master have a plan for returning to Biluo Sea?

137
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,200
Now that I've obtained the power of the dragon deity,

138
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,230
but the seal on Zhen Lan's side has not yet been removed.

139
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,810
Also, the matter about the six princes of Kongsang turning into ash must be resolved as soon as possible.

140
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,310
Since we are allied with Kongsang, we certainly can't ignore anything to do with the Land-Sea Alliance.

141
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,090
What is your next step then, Young Master?

142
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,790
When Su Nuo left, I suddenly recalled something.

143
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,060
If Su Nuo and I can jointly withstand the force of the backlash,

144
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,720
then I can also join with someone else to withstand pain and share life with.

145
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,680
Young Master, you and Su Nuo are two that can be combined into one

146
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,370
to become the complete bloodline of the emperor of the sea.

147
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,510
Because he and you are connected deeply,

148
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,620
that's why you can jointly withstand the Mirror Technique's backlash.

149
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,890
Actually when I was young,

150
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:30,210
I saw a technique for life and death at Kongsang's Princess Zhu Yan's palace.

[Zhu Yan's Notebook]

152
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,020
What do you see?

153
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,140
These are all Kongsang's techniques.

154
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,770
Some look simple, but others are really difficult.

155
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,850
Sister Zhu Yan, do you know all of these techniques?

156
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,040
Of course.

157
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,150
What... about this star something technique?

158
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,210
Why is half of the spell page missing?

159
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,450
This is a technique that can reverse life. It can't be used randomly.

160
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,620
- Then you don't know how to use it.
- You...

161
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,130
It's fine not to know about these kinds of techniques.

162
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,570
Even though the Sea Oath of the Star Soul can reverse life and death,

163
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,250
but it's very dangerous and comes with a heavy price. It's like giving your life to another person.

164
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,620
I hope I'll never have to use this technique.

165
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,940
We must always stay safe and happy

166
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,510
and never use these kinds of scary techniques.

167
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,610
Right. Little Su Mo will always be safe and happy.

168
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,670
This kind of technique that can reverse life and death

169
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,500
will usually cost the user a great portion of his spirit consciousness.

170
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,690
Young Master, please reconsider this.

171
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,460
What exactly is that spell?

172
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,260
He and I already knew each other 100 years ago.

173
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,560
Why would I cry? What did we experience together exactly?

174
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,650
Sister Bai Ying.

175
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,930
Na Sheng.

176
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,430
Sister Bai Ying, are you unhappy?

177
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,490
It's nothing.

178
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,430
Are you still upset about Brother Ice Cube?

179
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,580
Ever since I came to Yuhuang, I've experienced a lot already.

180
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,540
Brother Ice Cube will solve all problems no matter what. Don't worry too much.

181
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,530
Oh right, Na Sheng. How did you meet the Emperor of the Sea?

182
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,310
He saved us in Tianque. No, it's more accurate to say that he was helping you.

183
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,950
You two clearly knew each other at that time, but you ignored him.

184
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,180
No, no, I shouldn't have said so much about it.

185
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,290
If Brother Ice Cube finds out, he'll definitely scold me again.

186
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,820
Why can't you tell me?

187
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,490
He said it's not good to let you know about some things.

188
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,030
Sister Bai Ying, I'm going to go look for Yan Xi.

189
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,070
After all that has happened, I don't know how he is doing.

190
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,140
All right. Go ahead.

191
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,170
I'm going then.

192
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,130
Close the net?

193
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,920
Yan Xi!

194
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,270
What's the matter?

195
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,370
- It's nothing.
- I've heard all about it from Sister Bai Ying.

196
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,510
After something that big happened, are you all right?

197
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,610
Don't worry too much about Brother Ice Cube. He'll recover.

198
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,130
Na Sheng.

199
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,910
Are you really not going to Jing City with me?

200
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,560
I'll go, but not right now.

201
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,290
Are you feeling better?

202
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,480
Why did you come that day?

203
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,940
I hit the Sunlight Blocking Pearl three times, but you didn't appear.

204
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,760
I was worried that you were in trouble.

205
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,920
Thank you.

206
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,700
What's wrong?

207
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,710
Na Sheng is in danger. Hurry, let's go.

208
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,330
Na Sheng. Na Sheng!

209
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,750
Is it Cangliu?

210
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,440
I can't be certain. Let's take them back first.

211
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,940
Young Master.

212
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,260
What happened?

213
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,700
- Your Highness.
- A'Ying.

214
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,960
Why are you here?

215
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,580
The High Priest saw that Na Sheng was in danger through the water mirror, so I rushed over here.

216
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,630
What happened?

217
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,660
We were attacked by a spirit bird.

218
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,520
It was fast and really strong.

219
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,360
We couldn't defend against it, so we were knocked unconscious.

220
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,520
Then, did you see the spirit bird?

221
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,670
I didn't see it clearly.

222
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you worried that the spirit bird is Bai Lin?

223
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:18,430
Xi Jing isn't here. It's too dangerous for you to protect Na Sheng by yourself. I'll stay here with you.

224
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,550
Young Master, I should stay here to protect Na Sheng.

225
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,810
No, no! There's no need.

226
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,460
I-I mean, with Sister Bai Ying here with me,

227
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,050
I don't need to bother you. I'll be fine.

228
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,830
I'll set up a barrier around the hut, then no one will bother you.

229
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,970
Thank you, then.

230
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,200
Na Sheng, what's wrong?

231
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,560
Hungry? Want me to cook something for you?

232
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,010
No need, Sister Bai Ying. I'm not hungry.

233
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,690
Then... are you feeling unwell?

234
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,300
No.

235
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,790
Sister Bai Ying, I feel that Yan Xi...

236
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,950
I'll go outside and take a look.

237
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,130
Lin'er?

238
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,820
Lin'er, it really is you. Why are you here?

239
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,410
Sister.

240
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,440
Let's go in and talk.

241
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,830
I'll tell Su Mo to undo this barrier.

242
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,310
This barrier was created by Su Mo?

243
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,180
He created it to protect Na Sheng and me.

244
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,170
He really is still by your side.

245
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,780
Lin'er, there's something I want to tell you.

246
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,310
Lin'er...

247
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,210
Previously at Jiuyi,

248
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,500
I was always flustered.

249
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,980
I wanted to come and look for you again.

250
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,190
After saying those words,

251
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,760
it's a given that you wouldn't come and look for me.

252
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,500
I didn't know if you wanted to see me. So...

253
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,990
I wanted to see you. Of course, I want to see you.

254
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,350
After what I've done...

255
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,980
You didn't have a choice either.

256
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,140
Besides, you've gone through so much in the last century.

257
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,450
Sister, when can you stop being so kind

258
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,780
and be a bit more selfish?

259
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,480
Lin'er.

260
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,550
I'm just thinking about the price you paid to open Wuse City,

261
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,820
and that after unlocking the seals you'll turn into ash.

262
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,360
You don't need to do that!

263
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,710
This is my responsibility.

264
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,140
Don't you think that the price is too high?

265
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,090
Aren't you afraid?

266
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,720
Sister,

267
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,770
if there's a way that can prevent you from becoming ash,

268
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,240
promise me that you'll do it. Don't ever give up!

269
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,370
Why do you say this?

270
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,590
Su Mo.

271
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,380
At the wooden hut, there were certain things I didn't tell you.

272
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,100
Congratulations... on obtaining the power of the dragon deity.

273
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,650
I really didn't expect that

274
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,580
the price to obtain it would be so high.

275
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,900
Anyone would agree.

276
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,150
How's your injury?

277
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,160
I'll recover in a few days.

278
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,510
We don't have much time left.

279
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,120
If we wait for Cangliu to recover,

280
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,330
it'll be too late for us.

281
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,730
Once we go up Jing Pagoda,

282
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,400
we will be facing Zhi Zhe.

283
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,810
The Heavenly King is your ancestor.

284
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,630
Have you thought this through?

285
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,130
He's not the Heavenly King who guards Yunhuang.

286
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,820
He's the vicious and cruel Zhi Zhe.

287
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,950
All right.

288
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,680
When Bai Ying has fully recovered,

289
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,840
we'll set out immediately.

290
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,120
All right.

291
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,700
What's wrong?

292
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,350
Su Mo, you came.

293
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,360
Why are you here?

294
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,270
I called you to have you undo the barrier.

295
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,680
Emperor of the Sea, I'm merely here to visit my older sister

296
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,470
and keep her company for a few days.

297
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,170
Lin'er won't just be accompanying me for a few days.

298
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,110
She'll always be with me from now on.

299
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,820
So, can you help us to undo this barrier?

300
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,770
This is a sedative.

301
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,520
I'm here to give it to you.

302
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,550
Sister, are you sick?

303
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,280
No. I was injured before, but I'm already better now.

304
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,790
I'll be going.

305
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,680
Lin'er, go in and rest.

306
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,710
I'll see him off.

307
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,220
Do you still remember what happened to Bai Lin?

308
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,810
What are you referring to?

309
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,300
What happened at Jiuyi Mountain.

310
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,850
She said she hurt you at Jiuyi Mountain.

311
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,640
There was a slight misunderstanding between us.

312
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,610
Reuniting with a loved one is a good thing.

313
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,420
About Su Nuo, don't be too sad about it.

314
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,220
There's no need to worry.

315
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Su Nuo is just using another method to accompany me.

316
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,850
You already have obtained the power of the dragon deity.

317
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,390
Now there's only the last seal to unlock.

318
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,340
Shouldn't we discuss what to do next?

319
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,960
There's no need for you to worry about this.

320
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,800
For the next few days, you and Bai Lin should just rest in the wooden hut.

321
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,340
Although I've forgotten some things,

322
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,740
that doesn't stop us from going to unlock the seal.

323
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,030
Zhi Zhe took the initiative to attack.

324
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,140
If we go and unlock the seal now,

325
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,350
the odds are against us.

326
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,410
I need to think of a foolproof plan.

327
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,360
Bai Ying, no need to see me off.

328
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,150
I'll be going now.

329
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,410
Come on out.

330
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,730
Emperor of the Sea.

331
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,500
Why did you follow me?

332
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,220
I wanted to know to what extent you'd go to for my sister.

333
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,870
I don't need to prove anything to anyone.

334
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,090
What if I say that I found the solution to prevent her from becoming ash?

335
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,980
What's the solution?

336
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,600
Make me happy and I'll tell you.

337
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,130
Knowing that my older sister was going to turn into ash,

338
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,860
I tried my best to find a solution to the spell.

339
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,540
The person who casts this spell can reverse life and death,

340
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,470
bring someone back to life.

341
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,260
What is this spell?

342
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,020
Want to know?

343
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,660
I have a condition.

344
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,340
I can tell you,

345
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,320
but I want you to die.

346
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,820
Do you think I'm lying?

347
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,500
This is a Kongsang spell.

348
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,300
Only one of our clan's princesses has ever used it before,

349
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,520
in order to save her beloved one.

350
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,190
It's fine not to know about these kinds of techniques.

351
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,490
Although the Sea Oath of the Star Soul can reverse life and death and change fate,

352
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,660
but it's very dangerous and comes with a heavy price.

353
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,550
It's like giving your life to another person.

354
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,210
Are you referring to Zhu Yan?

355
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,570
How did you know?

356
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,050
Are you holding Zhu Yan's notebook?

357
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,820
I don't know what you are talking about.

358
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,740
Take it out if you have it.

359
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,380
If you don't have it,

360
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,560
then don't waste my time.

361
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,030
Don't you want to know how Zhu Yan's notebook can save my sister?

362
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,280
Look at how confident you are, it makes people hate you!

363
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,660
At the time, you were walking up ahead so you may not know,

364
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,880
there was a bird spirit behind you who wanted to attack you.

365
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,060
I wanted to stop her,

366
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,920
but I haven't yet recovered from my injury.

367
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,140
I was attacked by her, too.

368
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,460
You were attacked by her, too?

369
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,090
How are you? Is your injury serious?

370
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,620
I'm fine.

371
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,310
You're finally willing to trust me.

372
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,800
I...

373
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:33,350
Sorry, Yan Xi.

374
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,110
It's all my fault.

375
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,620
Fortunately, I didn't tell Sister Bai Ying.

376
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,180
Otherwise, they would blame you.

377
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,350
It's good as long as you trust me.

378
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,410
Lin'er.

379
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,050
Sister.

380
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,330
What are you doing?

381
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,590
I was applying rouge. Does it look nice?

382
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,700
Yes, it looks nice.

383
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,490
My younger sister looks pretty no matter what.

384
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,030
Yan Xi! Yan Xi! Yan Xi.

385
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,070
Yan Xi, we haven't gone outside to play for a long time.

386
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,000
Na Sheng,

387
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,770
you aren't a child anymore.

388
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,370
You shouldn't always need someone's company.

389
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,120
Yan Xi, you...

390
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,540
Why are you so mean?

391
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,050
You've changed.

392
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,330
You've become really strange.

393
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,810
Have your feelings changed, too?

394
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,970
The Quanxian haven't returned to the Biluo Sea yet.

395
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,010
I made a pledge with Han Zhou and Ning Liang.

396
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,160
Until Quanxian returns to Biluo Sea, I will never transform as long as it takes.

397
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,280
But now... not only did I transform for your sake,

398
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,260
Han Zhou and Ning Liang have died as well.

399
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,870
How am I supposed to happily continue to live?

400
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,460
Then, what do you want me to do about it?

401
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,980
I want to live happily with you!

402
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,620
Yan Xi, those people have already sacrificed themselves.

403
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,320
You should live on for their sake.

404
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,670
They aren't your friends!

405
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,070
Of course, you can say something like that!

406
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,370
For every day the Quanxian isn't back at Biluo Sea,

407
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,810
are you going to continue tormenting yourself like this?

408
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,290
Or do you want to leave me?

409
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,850
Continue practicing with your bow then. I'm leaving.

410
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,160
Sister Bai Ying.

411
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,870
Sister Bai Ying?

412
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,990
Where is Sister Bai Lin?

413
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,690
I also don't know where she went either.

414
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,830
Didn't you go looking for Yan Xi?

415
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,320
Why are you back so soon?

416
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,840
How is it possible that a merperson only loves one person their entire life?

417
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,140
They meet so many people in their lifetime.

418
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,030
Perhaps it's because they've been alive for too long,

419
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,100
that lots of things have been forgotten and can't be recalled.

420
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,720
Then do you think...

421
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,440
If someone totally forgets someone else,

422
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,410
will they still love them?

423
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,000
If it's true love, they should be able to remember.

424
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,750
Are you talking about you and Brother Ice Cube?

425
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,040
No, I was talking about you and Yan Xi.

426
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,800
Why are you upset with him again?

427
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,710
Yan Xi has acted like a different person ever since he got back.

428
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,710
Sometimes he's really good to me,

429
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,630
but other times, he ignores me.

430
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,370
Is that Ning Liang's necklace?

431
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,330
- It's not only Ning Liang's necklace, but I've also kept Han Zhou's and Ting's.
- Why?

432
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,540
They were lively people who used to banter with me.

433
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,070
But they all died for their ideals.

434
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,280
I want to keep these necklaces to remember them by.

435
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,520
I want to become a member of the Quanxian

436
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,830
and help them finish their journey back to Biluo Sea.

437
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,380
Na Sheng, don't let your imagination run wild.

438
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,590
So many things have happened lately.

439
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,030
Yan Xi is probably just tired.

440
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,050
Plus, his two best friends are gone.

441
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,060
At a time like this, you should care more about him

442
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,240
and be more tolerant of him.

443
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,880
I was probably being too unreasonable then.

444
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,290
A'Ying.

445
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,860
- Your Higness.
- What is it? You look startled.

446
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,710
It's fine. I thought Lin'er had come back.

447
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,680
What is that in your hand?

448
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,570
When I was making the bed,

449
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,990
I found this medicine in the blankets.

450
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,100
I suspect that Lin'er is hiding something from me.

451
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,430
I'm a little worried.

452
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,650
Let me see the medicine.

453
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,410
I'll take this bottle of medicine back and have the High Priest take a look.

454
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,990
Oh, right. Su Mo said that he's already talked to you about removing the seal.

455
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,960
When will we be leaving?

456
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,550
It's not urgent yet. We still have some other things to take care of first.

457
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,190
Su Mo also said the same thing.

458
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,930
What are you two hiding from me?

459
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,640
It's nothing much.

460
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,250
A'Ying, this is a secret between men.

461
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,480
Your Highness. Your Highness.

462
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,680
Your Highness, you've really made it difficult for me this time.

463
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,580
What would I know about medicine? I really know nothing about it.

464
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,930
High Priest, I really thought you knew everything and anything.

465
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,810
Your Highness, you've really overestimated me.

466
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,490
Is there really no one in all of Wuse City that is proficient in medicine?

467
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,930
Tell me. Back then, why didn't at least one of the six princes know anything about medicine?

468
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:28,390
Your Highness, what is the point of saying this now?

469
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,340
No one in Wuse city can...

470
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,590
but there's someone in Quanxian!

471
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,120
A'Yuan.

472
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,410
- Were you looking for me?
- Yes.

473
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,150
Not really.

474
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,010
Then are you or are you not?

475
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,660
I am.

476
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,880
However, I have something to ask you about.

477
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,010
Go ahead.

478
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,140
Can you help me take a look and see what kind of medicine this is?

479
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,750
Who gave you this medicine?

480
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,800
A'Ying found it in the wooden hut. It should belong to Bai Lin.

481
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,840
I'll take a closer look. Please wait a moment.

482
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,830
Young Master, there is a very vicious ingredient in this medicine.

483
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,210
- What do you mean?
- If this medicine is taken alone,

484
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,690
it is a vicious poison that can instantly kill.

485
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,960
However, if the person who takes it is already poisoned,

486
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,140
this medicine can suppress the other toxin.

487
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,140
It is both an antidote and a poison.

488
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,440
However, using this medicine to suppress the toxin is only effective temporarily.

489
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,810
It's like a brief revival before death, it can let someone

490
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,930
look like they've recovered for a brief moment,

491
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,580
but the person who takes it has already lost and been drained internally.

492
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,960
Emperor of the Sea, I'm merely here to visit my older sister

493
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,120
and keep her company for a few days.

494
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,700
Don't tell Hong Yuan about this matter just yet.

495
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,240
Let me investigate it more first.

496
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,670
You came looking for me because you've thought it through?

497
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,190
Have you really seen Zhu Yan's notebook?

498
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,220
I saw it by chance at my uncle's.

499
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,080
All these years, we've been trying to use the techniques written on it to get away from Zhi Zhe's control.

500
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,910
Unfortunately, we've never succeeded.

501
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,660
The only way to get rid of his tormenting blood pact is with the Sea Oath of the Star Soul's ability to reverse life and death.

502
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,130
It's a pity we can't find anyone to share his fate.

503
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,320
You know that spell?

504
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,440
The last page of Zhu Yan's notebook is torn. The spell is missing.

505
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,550
The Sea Oath of the Star Soul cannot be completed.

506
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,830
That's why I came looking for you.

507
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,810
Thinking about it, how laughable.

508
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:29,550
Yunhuang is so big, but I can't find anyone to help my sister.

509
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,780
I can tell you how to use the Sea Oath of the Star Soul,

510
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,920
but you have to find the spell yourself.

511
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,600
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

512
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,030
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

513
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,680
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

514
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,440
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

515
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,950
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

516
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,450
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

517
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:39,400
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

518
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,880
♫ We've met several times ♫

519
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,340
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

520
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:53,380
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

521
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,810
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

522
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,380
♫ You live in there ♫

523
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:06,460
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

524
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,330
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

525
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,400
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

526
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,200
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

527
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,820
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

528
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,190
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

529
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,680
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

530
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,180
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

531
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,160
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

532
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,240
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

533
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,140
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

534
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,650
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

535
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,000
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

536
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,150
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

537
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:07,530
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
