[Episode 31]

3
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,900
For Brother Crown Prince and also, Sister Bai Ying,

4
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,700
I, Na Sheng, will do my best.

5
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,050
On behalf of Kongsang, thank you, Commissioner of the Left, for your help.

6
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,680
However, I fear that Su Mo will blame you in the future.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,500
I don't believe he will. I believe in the Land-Sea Alliance, too.

8
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,300
If Brother Ice Cube blames you, I'll plead for mercy on your behalf.

9
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,100
He'll understand you.

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
You must take good care of Na Sheng.

11
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
You both must come back safe and sound.

12
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,030
Are you afraid?

13
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,250
I'm not.

14
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
Ancestors, bless and protect us.

15
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,600
What's wrong?

16
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
Could Na Sheng be in danger?

17
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I wonder why the Emperor of the Sea summoned me here.

18
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Master, do you know where Na Sheng is?

19
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
The Ghost and Deity Abyss.

20
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
Na Sheng went to the Ghost and Deity Abyss?

21
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
The Ghost and Deity Abyss is full of dangers.

22
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,160
Why did she go there alone?

23
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,200
Simply asking for trouble.

24
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,700
Yan Xi.

25
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,300
The seal is in there.

26
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
[Six Directions Seal]

27
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
I didn't expect that another seal

28
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,300
would be unlocked that quickly.

29
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,400
My descendant, when you open the coffin,

30
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,710
life and death will overlap.

31
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,900
The start and end will overlap.

32
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,100
Everything will end in reincarnation. Just like the reflection in a mirror.

33
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,740
His Highness' spiritual awareness has been disturbed by a power of darkness.

34
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,100
Hurry. Protect him with spells immediately.

35
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,600
I wonder how Na Sheng is.

36
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,200
If we are late, His Highness will be swallowed by the nightmare.

37
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,300
- Four princes, you must support His Highness until his power has returned.
- Yes, Sir.

38
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,800
My descendant, let's see how capable you are.

39
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,200
Want to take back the power of the emperor? It's not that easy.

40
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,400
So what if you unlocked the seal?

41
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Bring it on.

42
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
Bai Ying.

43
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,200
That girl, Na Sheng, really didn't disappoint us.

44
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,120

- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

50
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,590
Your Highness, you could only be rescued by retrieving the seal.

51
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,190
Na Sheng, she... volunteered to go.

52
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,660
Where's Xi Jing?

53
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,950
He went with her.

54
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,110
It's just... they're currently underwater and drowning.

55
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,420
I'm afraid General Xi Jing won't know what to do either.

56
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,790
I want to go to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

57
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,720
Your Highness, you've only just gotten better.

58
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,250
Enough!

59
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,190
I don't want to see...

60
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,150
anyone else die because of me.

61
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,880
Na Sheng, you are awake?

62
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,660
Yan Xi... Yan Xi...

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,160
Sister Bai Ying!

64
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,190
Sister Bai Ying, you're alive!

65
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,350
Brother Crown Prince suffered a serious injury trying to rescue you.

66
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,780
Yan Xi and I had to quickly come to the Ghost and Deity Abyss

67
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,250
to save Brother Crown Prince.

68
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,960
Okay, Na Sheng.

69
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,480
Yan Xi.

70
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,900
Yan Xi?

71
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,850
Yan Xi... Yan Xi!

72
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,220
Yan Xi!

73
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,830
Why is he burning up?

74
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,860
Can someone save him? Save him!

75
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,710
He may have been poisoned.

76
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,600
This is the antidote master gave me. Do you want to try it?

77
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,710
He's not poisoned.

78
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,490
I have to hurry and take him back.

79
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
- Then... Then I'll go with you!
- Na Sheng, stay here.

80
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
Otherwise, Su Mo will have to take care of you too.

81
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,780
Brother Ice Cube, you have to save Yan Xi!

82
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,420
Sister Bai Ying... I...

83
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,160
I... I lost the Water Dispelling Pearl.

84
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,390
Yan Xi... Will Yan Xi die?

85
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,660
A'Ying!

86
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,160
- Your Highness!
- Xi Jing.

87
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,270
- Brother Crown Prince!
- Your Highness.

88
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,990
Na Sheng, are you okay?

89
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,790
I'm so glad you're alive! Yan Xi...

90
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,950
Don't panic. What happened to Yan Xi?

91
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,070
Su Mo already brought Yan Xi back to the main camp.

92
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,460
Su Mo... was here at the Ghost and Deity Abyss, too?

93
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,150
A'Ying and Su Mo came after feeling the earthquake here.

94
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,760
Na Sheng and Yan Xi were drowning so Su Mo and I rescued them.

95
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,770
Yan Xi... Yan Xi...

96
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,560
- Na Sheng!
- Na Sheng!

97
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,740
I said faint and you actually fainted.

98
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,340
- How is she?
- She should be okay.

99
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,460
She was injured by the sea clam.

100
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,050
If she wasn't so worried about Yan Xi, she probably would have fainted earlier.

101
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,360
Your Highness, your strength hasn't been fully restored. Don't use it yet.

102
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,830
Let's pick her up first.

103
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,700
I'll take her back to the hut first.

104
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,440
Take good care of her.

105
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,800
A'Ying, you're back safely.

106
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,950
Thank you for caring, Your Highness.

107
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,650
Master, what's wrong with Yan Xi?

108
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,790
Yan Xi is going to be reborn.

109
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,500
Reborn?

110
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,470
I've added a lot of ice. Why is his face still so red?

111
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,170
Being reborn is painful, the bones and essence will crack and break.

112
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,350
How is Yanxi suddenly being reborn?

113
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,820
This is his heart's desire. There's no reasoning with him on it.

114
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,180
Why?

115
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,410
After he's reborn,

116
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,000
he can be with one person for a lifetime.

117
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,210
Na Sheng... Na Sheng...

118
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,900
- Na Sheng...
- Ning Liang, I wish we could

119
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,280
return to Biluo Sea together.

120
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,790
Why are you here?

121
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,980
I'm worried about you. Live well.

122
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,790
I'll be blessing you in heaven.

123
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,480
Is this what it means to give your whole life to one person?

124
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,250
Your Highness.

125
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,320
Your Highness, congratulations on breaking another seal.

126
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,560
Are your wounds better?

127
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,510
It's nothing. See, I'm fine.

128
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,210
That day at the top of Jing Pagoda, the barrier was suddenly broken.

129
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,720
I was able to escape Jing Pagoda. Did you have something to do with it?

130
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,760
You being able to escape was all because of you.

131
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,870
Also... Su Mo.

132
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Did that person in Jing Pagoda hurt you?

133
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,690
No.

134
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,260
That's good.

135
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,730
What's this?

136
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,430
This is was given to me by Jing Pagoda's Zhi Zhe, but I can't find anything on it.

137
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,200
I was thinking this is similar to the Dark Golden Classics.

138
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,760
Only the emperor's power can reveal it.

139
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,640
Let me try.

140
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,090
This portrait is of Queen Bai Wei.

141
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,440
What's on there?

142
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,750
This is the history of Queen Bai Wei and King Xing Zun.

143
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,320
The history of King Xing Zun and Queen Bai Wei...

144
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,730
Then what the priest told me at the Jing Pagoda was also about them.

145
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,540
But how would someone from Cangliu know about their history?

146
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,910
Who is he exactly?

147
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,380
You're nothing more than an evil tyrant.

148
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,330
The most powerful people in this land since ancient times

149
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,050
was King Xing Zun and Queen Bai Wei.

150
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:06,330
My descendant...

151
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,650
What is it?

152
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,510
Perhaps it's recorded in the history books.

153
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
Based on his expression,

154
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,600
it seemed like he experienced all this himself.

155
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,660
You mean...

156
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,200
He's King Xing Zun.

157
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,790
You just came down from Jing Pagoda. Rest is important.

158
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,880
I'll head to Wuse City and see if there are more clues.

159
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,090
A'Ying.

160
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,350
Once Wuse city is opened,

161
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,600
you and the five princes will turn into ash.

162
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
Your Highness...

163
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,750
I know I have no right to blame you.

164
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,600
Everything you've done was to protect me.

165
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,900
But I wish, one day, I can protect you all, too.

166
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,960
I... will definitely...

167
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,300
will definitely find a solution.

168
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,360
Your Highness!

169
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,650
Young Master, Yan Xi is awake.

170
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,620
Yan Xi.

171
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,540
Young Master... Young Master...

172
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,590
Don't move.

173
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,080
Where's Na Sheng?

174
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,550
Don't worry. Xi Jing and Bai Ying are taking care of her.

175
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,550
Young Master, I...

176
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,750
Relax, your life is no longer in danger.

177
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,170
It's just that you've just been reborn into a newborn.

178
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,780
In addition, you were also injured at the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

179
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,610
You need to rest for a few days before you can return back to normal.

180
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,820
Young... Young Master,

181
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,330
I... the task that you entrusted to me,

182
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,080
I failed to keep my promise.

183
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:15,190
There's nothing more to say. It wasn't up to you to decide on this matter.

184
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,500
By the way, since Na Sheng had the Water Dispelling Pearl,

185
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,570
why did she drown?

186
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,700
When the sea clam attacked us, the Water Dispelling Pearl was lost.

187
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,490
Where was it lost?

188
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,650
It's probably... near the exit to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

189
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,120
The Water Dispelling Pearl is a relic of Yan Ran's.

190
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,090
It must not fall into the dark Ghost and Deity Abyss.

191
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,570
Young Master, let me go with you.

192
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,200
Yan Xi hasn't recovered.

193
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,620
You should remain here to guard the main camp.

194
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,810
Yes.

195
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,460
Ning Liang,

196
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,460
I'm sorry.

197
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,690
You, Han Zhou, and I made an oath.

198
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,260
In the end, I'm the only one who kept the promise.

199
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,330
You both said we shouldn't be swayed by this.

200
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,890
I don't even know what it means,

201
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,810
but I don't blame either of you.

202
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:44,520
As one who has personally experienced it, I hope that one day, you can be reborn again.

203
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,290
Then it wouldn't be considered a life lived in vain.

204
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,630
I also hope you can live your life like this.

205
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,020
We can live for a thousand years

206
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,000
and it is much longer to be apart from someone you love than to be together.

207
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,890
That feeling...

208
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,170
isn't easy to accept.

209
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,670
I disappointed Han Zhou.

210
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:14,070
In this life, I likely won't be reborn because of another.

211
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,050
What is this?

212
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,300
The Water Dispelling Pearl. Help me give this to her.

213
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,170
So, Ya Ran and the Water Dispelling Pearl had a past, too.

214
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,840
Ya Ran, Chun Huang, and Bai Wei.

215
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,580
What kind of connection did they have?

216
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,210
Young Master,

217
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,430
the Water Dispelling Pearl has been found.

218
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,140
I wonder why you are looking for me.

219
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,690
What are your plans with Na Sheng?

220
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,740
About this...

221
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,000
If Na Sheng is willing,

222
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,600
naturally, I want to take care of her forever.

223
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,040
Na Sheng is definitely willing.

224
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,490
To have a mutual love for each other is best.

225
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,450
Come with me to the wooden hut to look for Na Sheng.

226
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,580
W-Why are we going there?

227
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
To help you deliver the betrothal gift.

228
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,670
Young Master even manages these types of things?

229
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,000
Na Sheng, since you are awake,

230
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,690
why don't you get up and eat something?

231
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,110
No. I'm going to lie here and not move.

232
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,570
I'm not eating. I'm not hungry at all.

233
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,270
Doesn't matter if you are hungry or not, in any case, I am.

234
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,850
I want to eat chicken drumsticks. Do you all want any?

235
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,700
Na Sheng, are you eating?

236
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,690
No, I'm not eating! I don't want to eat anything.

237
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,020
You can't just keep laying here either.

238
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,210
Why not? I'm not getting up.

239
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,880
I'm going to dream my beautiful dream. I want to wait for Yan Xi.

240
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,450
If Yan Xi doesn't come, I'm never going to wake up.

241
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,280
If you refuse to get up, this is known as deceiving yourself. Understand?

242
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,240
Why can't I deceive myself?

243
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,920
I'm going to have a beautiful dream and wait for Yan Xi to come.

244
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,110
Forget it. Forget it.

245
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,120
What's in your dream then?

246
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,410
We light a bonfire in the Central Plains at every festival.

247
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,250
And kill pigs and sheep to celebrate, too.

248
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,500
I want to eat the glutinous dumplings from the Central Plains.

249
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,480
Once I'm awake, I'll go with Yan Xi to eat them.

250
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,610
There are still many nice foods in Yunhuang that I haven't eaten with Yan Xi yet.

251
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,050
Hurry, tell me. What nice foods are there in Yunhuang?

252
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:42,290
You want to eat them?

253
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,310
Get up and I'll take you there to eat.

254
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,690
No. No. Just hurry and tell me.

255
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,640
Yunhuang... previously, there was Kongsang followed by Cangliu.

256
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,450
In addition, different clans have different customs. There really are a lot of nice foods.

257
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,260
I remember, whenever it was the New Year, my wife would make meat jerky.

258
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,080
Telling me to distribute them to my subordinates and brothers.

259
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,150
That meat jerky was so crispy and chewy.

260
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,900
No matter what, I can never forget it.

261
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,860
Senior Brother.

262
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,670
Over this century, I've already gotten used to eating wild chickens and rabbits.

263
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,320
Let's do this. I'll go hunt down two wild chickens.

264
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,830
Na Sheng, get up if you want to eat.

265
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,590
No.

266
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,060
Su Mo?

267
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,140
Yan Xi.

268
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,920
Brother Ice Cube, where's Yan Xi?

269
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,450
I have something for you.

270
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,280
What is it?

271
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,860
It's not with me. Go to the lake yourself to find it.

272
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,120
I'm getting up. I'm getting up!

273
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,980
Yan Xi!

274
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,940
Na Sheng.

275
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,430
Are you really Yan Xi?

276
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,840
You scared me to death!

277
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,610
I lost the Water Dispelling Pearl.

278
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,620
Sister Yan Ran traded her life for it. I...

279
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,520
Don't be anxious. Take your time to talk.

280
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,660
I have been waiting for news about you.

281
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,520
I was afraid I wouldn't see you if I opened my eyes.

282
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,960
I was so scared.

283
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,280
I'm right here, aren't I?

284
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,620
Yan Xi...

285
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,640
Why do I feel like you're different?

286
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,410
Where's the mark on your forehead?

287
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,820
It's disappeared. I'm a grown man now,

288
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,800
so I'll look a little different.

289
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:27,260
Why? Were you reborn like Han Zhou?

290
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,410
Then... Then because of whom?

291
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,360
It was because of you.

292
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,900
Me?

293
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,400
I didn't do anything to you.

294
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:44,060
In the water you almost drowned and passed out,

295
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,720
then I gave you mouth to mouth,

296
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,890
then... then later...

297
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,000
Mouth to mouth will make you reborn?

298
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,190
Not completely...

299
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,640
- It's mostly because...
- Because what? Because what?

300
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,920
Young Master wanted me to give this to you.

301
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,660
Water Dispelling Pearl?

302
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,710
Why is this with you?

303
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,000
Young Master went personally to retrieve it. He said you did a lot for Kongsang and Quanxian.

304
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,290
This is considered Quanxian's...

305
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,810
betrothal gift.

306
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,690
Betrothal gift?

307
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,000
What's that?

308
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,080
A betrothal gift is...

309
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,900
It's.. It's a gift.

310
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,500
This is great! Su Mo really is a good person.

311
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,550
Then... now that I have this gift,

312
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,560
can I go to the main camp to find you every day?

313
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,320
But... didn't you say

314
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,490
before going back to Bilou Sea, you wouldn't fall in love with anyone?

315
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,100
Are you...

316
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,070
♫ Listen ♫

317
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:35,580
♫ Listen ♫

318
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,730
♫ Using up all my fortune just to touch you ♫

319
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,580
♫ Even crying sounds so beautiful ♫

320
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,730
Yes, I transformed for you.

321
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,180
That's great!

322
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,000
You finally said it outloud.

323
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,550
♫ Because when it becomes sunny ♫

324
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,720
Yan Xi, today is my happiest day.

325
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,260
Mine, too.

326
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,540
Fortunately, Yan Xi is all right.

327
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,770
But he excels in being in the water. How could he have drowned?

328
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,020
Yan Xi transformed.

329
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,600
For Na Sheng?

330
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,200
This should be the best outcome.

331
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,450
If Na Sheng knows, she'll be very happy.

332
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:57,290
Su Mo, you must be here about something important. Right?

333
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,860
When I went to retrieve the Water Dispelling Pearl,

334
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,320
I saw segments of sealed memories in it.

335
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,430
Segments of sealed memories?

336
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,390
These segments of sealed memories should belong to Ya Ran and Chun Huang.

337
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,920
Chun Huang likely wanted Ya Ran to give the Water Dispelling Pearl to Queen Bai Wei.

338
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,420
Ya Ran mentioned this before she died.

339
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,250
When His Highness and I were at the tomb of Queen Bai Wei,

340
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,870
we found many of Quanxian's items.

341
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:31,280
Seems like Queen Bai Wei really was on good terms with the Quanxian.

342
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,320
But since Kongsang and Quanxian were on good terms before,

343
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,940
what exactly happened for them to meet on the battlefield?

344
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,120
Did this pearl cause great chaos in the kingdom?

345
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,780
That doesn't seem possible.

346
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,720
What other clues did you find in Jiuyi Mountain?

347
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,310
The pearl is just a lifeless form.

348
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,730
Only a person could create this disturbance.

349
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,580
Emperor of the Sea, are you investigating what happened 7,000 years ago?

350
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,800
I don't have the right to investigate what happened 7,000 years ago.

351
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,720
However, the events and people from 7,000 years ago

352
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,550
are affecting everything that's happening now.

353
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,780
I can't help but ask.

354
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,790
- By the way, when I was on top of the Jing Pagoda...
- Bai Ying.

355
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,770
I will investigate this on my own

356
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,050
and won't trouble the Emperor of the Sea with it.

357
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,780
I'm going to go hunt for chickens.

358
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,990
Bai Ying, come with me.

359
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,470
I'm not trying to pursue what happened 7,000 years ago.

360
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,160
I know.

361
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,820
I was impulsive, too.

362
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,930
There are so many urgent matters right now.

363
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,340
I don't want to waste too much time.

364
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,040
Just now, I realized you seemed to be hiding something.

365
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,230
Since we are allies,

366
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,830
is there something that you haven't said?

367
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,960
A'Ying brought a piece of parchment

368
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,370
from Jing Pagoda.

369
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,810
She said it was from Zhi Zhe.

370
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,540
Do you still remember that

371
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,770
I suspected that person is from Kongsang?

372
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,990
There may be information on Zhi Zhe in that paper.

373
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,880
Actually, the paper only has a record of something that happened with Queen Bai Wei and Chun Huang.

374
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,840
However, this parchment is similar to my Dark Golden Classics.

375
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,730
Only the monarch of Kongsang has the power to read it.

376
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,910
Before I suspected he was my royal father,

377
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:12,880
until I saw the coffin of the Heavenly King

378
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,970
was empty.

379
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,390
He's indeed the Heavenly King.

380
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,400
How did you know?

381
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,470
When I was in the Sunlight Blocking Pearl, I saw his real face.

382
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,640
He looked a lot like you.

383
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,680
What?

384
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,690
Bai Ying had the opportunity to escape from Jing Pagoda,

385
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,710
because Zhi Zhe saw Bai Ying as Bai Wei.

386
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,640
If Zhi Zhe is the Heavenly King,

387
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,660
how did he live for 7,000 years?

388
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,670
I sent someone to investigate before,

389
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,610
the five masters, Qing Chen,

390
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,870
none of them have aged in a century.

391
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,990
Also, they've all taken medicine supplied by Zhi Zhe.

392
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,240
I think if he wants to live thousands of years,

393
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,460
he should have his methods.

394
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,290
It's just that I can't figure out

395
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:19,410
why he's helping Cangliu to destroy Kongsang.

396
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,040
Also, why did the Splitting Sword and Water Dispelling Pearl

397
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,070
appear in the hands of Queen Bai Wei?

398
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,280
Seems like these 7,000 years have revolved around the Heavenly King,

399
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,670
Bai Wei, and Chun Huang.

400
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,330
There are many unknown secrets.

401
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,660
Perhaps, only the Dragon Deity in the Stranded Dragon Abyss

402
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,880
knows the truth.

403
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,630
What do you mean by that?

404
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,630
I want to first go and release the Dragon Deity

405
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,310
and then go to unlock the Six Directions Seal.

406
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,490
Isn't it too risky to release the Dragon Deity right now?

407
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,830
What I am saying is that, regarding the six princes becoming ash,

408
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,780
I have yet to think of a proper solution.

409
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,180
So, it won't be that easy to unlock my last seal.

410
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,140
Then I can't help you with anything.

411
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,760
This...

412
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,840
The method you've thought of is...

413
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,510
The method I'm thinking of is I'll go back

414
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,210
and re-read the Dark Golden Classics again and see what exactly is recorded on this parchment.

415
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,980
After all, only the Dark Golden Classics has records from 7,000 years ago

416
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,890
about what happened in Yunhuang.

417
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,590
All right.

418
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,140
Then we'll work on this separately.

419
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,710
I'll go to the Stranded Dragon Abyss. You and Bai Ying go to Wuse City

420
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,910
- and look for clues.
- You are going alone?

421
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,670
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

422
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,110
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

423
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:28,660
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

424
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:35,440
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

425
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,930
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

426
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,340
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

427
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:49,260
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

428
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,880
♫ We've met several times ♫

429
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,280
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

430
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,390
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

431
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,780
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

432
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,300
♫ You live in there ♫

433
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:16,400
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

434
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,390
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

435
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,340
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

436
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,210
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

437
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:30,790
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

438
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,250
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

439
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,660
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

440
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:44,170
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

441
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,100
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

442
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,130
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

443
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,150
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

444
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,690
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

445
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,100
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

446
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,070
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

447
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:17,370
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
