3
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,040
Precious pearl?

4
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,890
They're giving me a pearl!

5
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,750
When she hears about treasure, she gets hungrier than hearing about food.

6
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,020
Can't I have just a little something that I enjoy?

7
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,670
Fine.

8
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,530
I hope everything will go well in the future.

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,110
It has to be. It has to be!

10
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,980
Sister Bai Ying, can you come with Brother Crown Prince next time?

11
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,940
I haven't seen him for a while, I miss him a little.

12
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,460
Every day I only have Uncle Xi Jing to keep me company. How boring!

13
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,310
All right. Next time when I see His Highness the Crown Prince, I'll tell him.

14
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,180
Do you still want to eat chicken?

15
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,110
Young Master.

16
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,520
Have you prepared what I asked for?

17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,290
Here is the obsidian you asked for.

18
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,030
Are you taking it to the Cangliu Military Camp?

19
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,000
While we're in the Cangliu Military Camp, give this obsidian to Xiang.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,270
Did you get in touch with Xiang?

21
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,840
Yes, I did.

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,550
But Xiang said she hasn't discovered Master Peng's true motives yet.

23
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,690
It is said that the plan was created by Yu Huan,

24
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,020
but carried out by Nan Zhao. Also...

25
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,600
Speak.

26
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,990
Today at the Grand Hall, Xiao will serve at the side.

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,230
Xiao?

28
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,010
Xiang said Xiao has recovered her memory.

29
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,260
She deeply regrets her past behavior.

30
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,970
The only reason she stays in the Cangliu Military Camp

31
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,750
is to help the Quanxian return to the Biluo Sea.

32
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,880
Young Master, can we still trust her?

33
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,320
Tell Xiang about my plan first.

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,580
What is Young Master's goal for this trip?

35
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,610
Save our tribesmen, destroy the Wind Falcons.

36
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,550
Cangliu invited us to their army camp, they must be afraid of Young Master.

37
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,070
I worry that it's not safe for you to go there alone.

38
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,760
That's why I need your help.

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,770
I won't hesitate to help.

40
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,880
This is very simple.

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,640
You only need to learn one thing well.

42
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,420
What's that?

43
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,150
The scout at Jing City sent a message.

44
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,500
A large number of the Cangliu army has mobilized, it looks like they're preparing to make a big move.

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,920
At this time,

46
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,730
Young Master should be in Jing City.

47
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,690
Elder Yu, for Cangliu to mobilize a large army at this time,

48
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,620
what intention would they have?

49
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,830
Elder Yu, I'll go help Young Master.

50
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,650
Han Zhou, go assemble the army and quickly come to assist.

51
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,070
You both must ensure the safety of Young Master.

52
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,410
Young Master, before he left, made it clear to us that we shouldn't behave rashly.

53
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,410
If we go hastily,

54
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,100
it may put Young Master in danger and ruin his plan.

55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,660
But I can't just sit and do nothing. One more person will be one more helping hand.

56
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,560
Ning Liang, calm down.

57
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,090
Stop acting impulsively. It's dangerous this way.

58
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,420
Let's wait a little longer.

59
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,910
Young Master has already said he's using a delaying tactic.

60
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,500
If Young Master and Yang Xi really do encounter danger and you go there now,

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,570
how are you going to help?

62
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,710
Young Master is the Emperor of the Sea, we should obey him.

63
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,830
Lord Emperor of the Sea is truly courageous.

64
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,990
Keeping the appointed time.

65
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,120
All right, you even brought someone with you.

66
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,200
But this here is the Cangliu Military Camp,

67
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,570
I wouldn't mind even if you brought dozens of people.

68
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,300
Lead the way.

69
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,660
Master Peng respectfully awaits inside the hall for the Emperor of the Sea.

70
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,040
Please stay here.

71
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,050
Master Peng wants to have the discussion with the Emperor of the Sea alone.

72
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,370
Rest assured. Today, we invited the Emperor of the Sea here to discuss a collaboration.

73
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,440
We won't hurt the Emperor of the Sea.

74
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,750
Lord Emperor of the Sea, please.

75
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,930
Emperor of the Sea, please take your seat.

76
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Let them dance to entertain you.

77
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,780
Start the music and dance.

78
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,490
It's not necessary.

79
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,310
Master Peng invited me here today, there must be some important matters to discuss.

80
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,810
In the past, Cangliu lived faraway in the wilderness,

81
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,700
there was no way for us to eat shrimp or crabs.

82
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,340
To pair good Cangliu wine with delicious seafood,

83
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,670
that's truly the best in the world.

84
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,890
Xiao, pour the wine.

85
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,380
Merpeople don't drink wine.

86
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,820
Then offer tea to the Emperor of the Sea.

87
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,660
This Xiao, she voluntarily sought shelter here.

88
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,180
She looked shrewd and clever when she came,

89
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,620
so we didn't apply the mind control technique to her.

90
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,790
- She's really good at flying the Wind Falcon.
- Oh.

91
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,280
During the Taoyuan Province battle, she's the one who piloted Yu Huan's wind falcon.

92
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,050
It seems she earned lots of merit for outstanding military service.

93
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,870
Nan Zhao.

94
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,670
I shouldn't have brought this up. I'll punish myself with a drink.

95
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,910
Why mention the Taoyuan Province?

96
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,640
Today, we invited the Emperor of the Sea here to discuss an alliance.

97
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,840
We shouldn't have fought the battle in Taoyuan Province.

98
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,800
If we had formed an alliance with the Emperor of the Sea earlier,

99
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,550
how could we have fought against the Emperor of the Sea?

100
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,670
Master Peng is absolutely correct.

101
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,910
If that were the case, Xiao wouldn't have killed her sister with her own hands.

102
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,910
If it's like what you've said, Ting's death was due to my late arrival.

103
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,830
Emperor of the Sea, you must be joking.

104
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,020
Ting is already dead.

105
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,970
I don't want to dispute what happened in the past.

106
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,370
Ting didn't want to dispute it either.

107
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,850
Xiao, what are you doing?

108
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,360
She just spilled some water. No big deal.

109
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,950
Xiao, what are you doing?

110
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,760
You can't even do a good job pouring water?

111
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,990
Find another person to serve the Emperor of the Sea.

112
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,060
How about we get straight to the point.

113
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,070
Cangliu wants to form an alliance with me.

114
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,090
What is Master Peng's intention?

115
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,070
The Emperor of the Sea is a straightforward person.

116
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,320
I heard earlier that the Emperor of the Sea and Kongsang created a land-sea alliance.

117
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,260
It really is useless.

118
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,750
I'd ask the Emperor of the Sea to reconsider it.

119
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,440
If the alliance with Kongsang is successful,

120
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,410
us Quanxian can return to Biluo Sea.

121
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,450
How can you say it's useless?

122
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,420
Why do you want to mix in with that muddy water

123
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,720
and become an enemy of our great Cangliu?

124
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,910
We can dispatch the Wind Falcons and destroy them in one move.

125
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,600
Instead of forming an alliance with them, why not ally with us?

126
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,410
All you have to do is hand over the person who holds the Heavenly Ring to us.

127
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,810
Come help Cangliu,

128
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,020
then I'll release those captured merpeople.

129
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,530
Go! Go!

130
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,790
Kneel down! Quickly!

131
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,270
If you don't agree, I can only trouble the Emperor of the Sea

132
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,440
to personally gather their corpses.

133
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,850
We've fought several times. You should know my strength.

134
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,290
These few soldiers...

135
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,770
are nothing to me.

136
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,160
Of course, other people might not know,

137
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,090
but I know very well what Master Peng really wants.

138
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,930
What I want is an alliance with the Emperor of the Sea

139
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,710
and to completely wipe out the Kongsang.

140
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,450
Master Peng has fought everywhere for Cangliu.

141
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,280
Why is such a small matter as wiping out the Kongsang

142
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,310
your deepest wish?

143
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,120
This tea is good.

144
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,510
I didn't think so at first,

145
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,700
but the more I drank,

146
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,960
the more I've noticed its aroma and sweet taste.

147
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,100
If the Emperor of the Sea likes it, you can come often.

148
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,210
Whether Yunhuang is ruled by Kongsang or Cangliu,

149
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,190
it doesn't make any difference to the Quanxian.

150
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
It only depends on who gives us better terms.

151
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,420
What Master Peng promises, Cangliu may not agree to.

152
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,180
But what Kongsang Crown Prince promises,

153
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,020
no one will oppose.

154
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,640
What do you mean?

155
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:47,400
In Cangliu, if you can dominate the other four masters,

156
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,370
wouldn't it be much easier to do things in the future?

157
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,750
Master Peng wants the Heavenly Ring, but I have more than just the Heavenly Ring.

158
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,650
I can give you both the Heavenly Ring and the Earth Ring tomorrow,

159
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,910
as my gift to Master Peng.

160
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,080
Very bold.

161
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,830
All right. I'll agree.

162
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,050
Let's use tea in place of wine

163
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,520
to hope in advance that we'll reach an agreement.

164
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,040
- Young Master.
- Emperor of the Sea.

165
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,720
Cangliu Military Camp is quite large. I'm concerned that you'll get lost.

166
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
This way, please.

167
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,420
Let's head back first.

168
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,980
You're the one who drank a lot of tea. Why hasn't your subordinate come out yet?

169
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,730
I'll have to bother you to wait here then.

170
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,290
I can't let Master Peng wait too long for me.

171
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,410
Master Peng.

172
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,860
Emperor of the Sea.

173
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,320
We really were friends at first sight.

174
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,880
I feel the same.

175
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,190
The main hall is up there.

176
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,890
I know.

177
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,460
If you know, then why are you here?

178
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,250
General.

179
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,160
Weren't you serving in the main hall? Why are you here?

180
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,790
I was kicked out by General Nan Zhao.

181
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,180
Nan Zhao?

182
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,580
Where are you going?

183
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm going back to the main hall to see Master Peng.

184
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,260
The Emperor of the Sea and Master Peng are discussing important business today.

185
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,240
Oh yes. General Nan Zhao is also in the main hall.

186
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,730
Why aren't you among the guests today?

187
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,700
A merperson dares talk rudely to me?

188
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,580
We can't let good food go to waste.

189
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,050
Reporting.

190
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,930
- Go on.
- Yes.

191
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,180
Master Peng, the Emperor of the Sea's subordinate appears to be in a conflict with Yu Huan.

192
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,620
Con-

193
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,290
Conflict?

194
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,220
Emperor of the Sea, you need not worry. We won't slight your subordinate.

195
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,130
Don't think just because Master Peng invited you—

196
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,760
General.

197
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,650
I wonder how rude I was to the General?

198
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,260
Yu Huan!

199
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,960
General Nan Zhao.

200
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,390
What are you doing?

201
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,780
He's the Emperor of the Sea's subordinate. The Emperor of the Sea is our guest today.

202
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,760
Why do I feel that he has another motive in coming to the military camp?

203
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,560
I merely got lost and went the wrong way.

204
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,660
The Emperor of the Sea and Master Peng are discussing important business today.

205
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,860
I definitely won't dare ruin it.

206
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,050
Is it because you didn't attend the main hall today

207
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,800
that you are using this pretext to ruin our cooperation with the Emperor of the Sea?

208
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,330
Idiot.

209
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,790
- Who are you referring to?
- Why would I?

210
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,830
Generals.

211
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,850
This incident today started because of me. If General Yu Huan doubts me,

212
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,230
I can leave the camp right away.

213
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,200
- All right.
- No.

214
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,030
Follow me back to the main hall.

215
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,050
Please.

216
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,860
General, I'll take my leave first.

217
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,560
Come with me.

218
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,550
General Yu Huan.

219
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,950
Xiang?

220
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,420
As ordered by General Fei Lian, I'm delivering

221
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,020
a jar of good wine to General Yu Huan.

222
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,690
Fei Lian?

223
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,090
General Fei Lian received some good wine today.

224
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,460
He said he wanted to share it with General Yu Huan for you to taste.

225
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,860
He especially asked me to deliver it.

226
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,460
Thank him for me.

227
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,850
Is there something else?

228
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,600
I forgot to mention. General Fei Lian said

229
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,130
this wine will taste better if it's warmed.

230
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,190
I forgot just now.

231
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,460
Take care, General.

232
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,690
You can take these merpeople with you first.

233
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,640
The rest will depend on how sincere the Emperor of the Sea will be tomorrow.

234
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,970
Please wait and see.

235
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,220
Emperor of the Sea.

236
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,030
I offended you just now. Please forgive me.

237
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,600
I bid my farewell now.

238
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,830
If he can bring back the Heavenly Ring and the Earth Ring,

239
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,620
that will make everything else easy to do.

240
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,160
The situation looks a bit fishy.

241
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,010
- What is it?
- When we entered, there were two teams of guards.

242
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,450
They are all gone now. Be careful.

243
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,100
Yes.

244
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,550
- We should hurry and leave.
- All right.

245
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,290
[Golden Formation]

246
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,080
Young Master!

247
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,090
What's going on?!

248
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,150
Is he crazy? Without your order,

249
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,500
he actually unleashed an unauthorized attack!

250
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,860
Take everyone and leave now!

251
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,940
Go! Go!

252
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,590
- Master Peng has ordered everyone to stop!
- Yes!

253
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,500
Yu Huan, we've already agreed with the Emperor of the Sea to cooperate. Why did you suddenly make a move?

254
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,380
You don't need to know. Su Mo, even if the Dragon Deity is here,

255
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,200
this formation cannot be easily broken, especially if it's you.

256
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,300
After your power is dispersed, let's see if you can boast then!

257
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,390
This is the Golden Formation.

258
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,220
Senior Sister?

259
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,160
Capture the Earth Ring!

260
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,660
Bai Ying!

261
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,110
Such strong power.

262
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,930
It actually broke the Golden Formation.

263
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,790
I just need to rest for a little while.

264
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,340
Why were you and Yan Xi in Cangliu's Military Camp?

265
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,710
The Cangliu people wanted to see me.

266
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,060
They threatened me with captured hostages

267
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,490
to make me go into Cangliu's Military Camp.

268
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,840
They were already prepared.

269
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
No matter what happens,

270
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,020
you shouldn't act rashly.

271
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,850
There must be an expert advising the Five Masters of Cangliu.

272
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,640
Otherwise, they wouldn't have known about the Golden Formation.

273
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,980
Golden Formation?

274
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,870
It's an ancient formation from Kongsang.

275
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,130
Only the imperial family knows of it.

276
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,360
Then, I'll ask His Highness to look into it.

277
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,240
Oh yes, about Na Sheng going down to the Ghost and Deity Abyss.

278
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,600
The High Priest has found out about a Water Dispelling Pearl.

279
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,210
When wearing this object, one can walk underwater.

280
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,030
Yu Huan, why did you suddenly attack them?

281
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,520
Master Peng already made an agreement with the Emperor of the Sea.

282
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,710
Quanxuan was willing to ally with us.

283
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,980
He was going to give us the Heavenly Ring and the Earth Ring tomorrow!

284
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,540
It's not possible for Su Mo to hand over the Heavenly Ring.

285
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,490
You're the one who said to ally with Quanxian.

286
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,490
- Now you're also the one who rashly attacked them.
- I did it all for Cangliu.

287
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,660
For Cangliu?

288
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,050
Learning the Golden Formation

289
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,280
was that also for Cangliu?

290
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,840
Golden Formation? This...

291
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,190
You may leave.

292
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,930
Yes.

293
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,490
Right now...

294
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,080
you really know quite a lot.

295
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,870
I wouldn't dare. Everything I know

296
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,830
has always been under the advice of Master Peng.

297
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm not the one advising you now.

298
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,380
Young Master is still in the Cangliu's Military Camp.

299
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,320
If he didn't resist for us,

300
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,700
we couldn't have retreated.

301
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,110
I'll go to Cangliu's Military Camp right away to help Young Master.

302
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,160
I'll go with you.

303
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,280
Be careful. The Cangliu people are full of tricks.

304
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,690
You must bring Young Master back safely.

305
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,320
Don't worry. We will definitely bring Young Master back.

306
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,250
Our strength is still too weak.

307
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,780
Instead of allying with Kongsang

308
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,650
and fighting against the powerful Cangliu,

309
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,510
I think we should seek shelter with Cangliu first

310
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,670
to safeguard ourselves.

311
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,860
No one wants to see

312
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,470
their loved ones die.

313
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,170
If we want to save everyone, we should discuss plans together.

314
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,220
For the past hundred years, this is how we've done things.

315
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,600
- You should recuperate first. We elders—
- Reporting!

316
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,150
Young Master is back. He is summoning the Left Commissioner.

317
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,790
Young Master.

318
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,750
Young Master, how's your injury?

319
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,180
I'm fine. How's your injury?

320
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,630
I'm fine.

321
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,480
Young Master, Cangliu suddenly attacked us today.

322
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Did Master Peng see through our scheme?

323
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,400
Their formation was already prepared.

324
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,760
The alliance was fake.

325
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,010
The real goal was to capture me.

326
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,260
Xiang has already obtained the obsidian.

327
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,100
I'll contact her using the sound pearl later.

328
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,240
After Xiang puts the obsidian in the Wind Falcons storage area,

329
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,470
we can make our move.

330
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,740
I was not capable

331
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,480
and dragged you down, Young Master.

332
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,420
It has nothing to do with you.

333
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,170
Cangliu is far more powerful than I thought.

334
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:05,310
Behind Master Peng and Yu Huan, there must be someone else.

335
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,410
Young Master.

336
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,210
Where's Princess Bai?

337
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,240
She's probably returned to Wuse City.

338
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,740
Today, it was all thanks to Princess Bai.

339
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,120
Otherwise, we couldn't have escaped.

340
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,990
Young Master.

341
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,780
The elders still think we should ally with Cangliu.

342
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,560
I understand. Go on out. I'll be out in a moment.

343
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,810
Yes.

344
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,980
Therefore, their target is Na Sheng?

345
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,310
Yes.

346
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,650
Then, what does Su Mo think?

347
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,060
He won't hand over Na Sheng.

348
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,940
Should we protect Na Sheng?

349
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,900
There's no need. That hut is quite hidden.

350
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,050
The more people that go, the more attention it'll attract.

351
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,970
I'll remind Xi Jing to be more cautious.

352
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,040
That's fine. Su Mo said the Cangliu people

353
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,110
know Kongsang's ancient formation.

354
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,560
It's called... the Golden Formation.

355
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,490
- What?
- What?

356
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,580
I found it!

357
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,660
I found it!

358
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,490
Golden Formation. It's a formation that only Kongsang's imperial family uses.

359
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,550
It's used to trap the merpeople.

360
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,830
It's Kongsang's techniques again.

361
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,230
It appeared last time when we went from Taoyuan Village to Jing Lake.

362
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,520
This definitely isn't a coincidence.

363
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,750
Su Mo asked me to pass a message to Your Highness.

364
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,250
He said there's an expert behind Cangliu's people, advising them.

365
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,600
Could that expert be someone from Kongsang?

366
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,090
Could it be someone from the Qing Clan?

367
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,580
Ever since the Battle of Liejing,

368
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,530
the Qing Clan haven't been able to leave Jiuyi Mountain because of the barrier.

369
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,370
Among the Kongsang people, aside from us, there's only Xi Jing.

370
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,350
- Who else is there?
- Yu Huan!

371
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,720
It can't be him. He's only a disciple of the Holy Sword Sect.

372
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,610
Only Kongsang's kings can study this kind of formation.

373
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,720
Even my master doesn't know this.

374
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,350
- Who could it be then?
- Let's not worry too much about it now.

375
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,880
Su Mo said that the Cangliu people did this to make Quanxian betray the alliance

376
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,790
and hand over Na Sheng.

377
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,230
We must quickly think of a solution to resolve this matter.

378
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,160
Otherwise, the longer it drags on, the more complicated it'll get.

379
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,070
Also, even though we won't hand over Na Sheng,

380
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,910
as long as Kongsang and Quanxian develop a discord,

381
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,440
a seed of betrayal in our alliance will have been sown.

382
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,650
Then we'll have fallen into Cangliu's trap.

383
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,140
Everyone, let's leave tomorrow for the Quanxian Camp.

384
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,830
I'll read through the Dark Golden Classics first

385
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,160
and see if there are any clues.

386
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,760
A'Ying,

387
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,660
from now on, don't just rashly leave.

388
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,050
When you're worried about others, there are also

389
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,220
people who are worried about you.

390
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,850
The Golden Formation is a technique of the Kongsang imperial family.

391
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,630
It'll cling to a person's body and cut it endlessly with a blade.

392
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,520
Only the imperial family can break it.

393
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,820
Five hundred years ago, it was lost in the land of Yunhuang.

394
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,640
Again, it's another one of Kongsang's techniques.

395
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,750
There isn't any solution written here to break it either.

396
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,330
Could it be in the next volume?

397
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,380
But the next volume is probably still in the Jing Pagoda.

398
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,280
[Dark Golden Classics - Volume 1]

399
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,980
Now starts...

400
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,700
the real sumptuous feast.

401
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,790
Young Master, Ning Liang has an important matter to report.

402
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,700
Wait for me in the main hall.

403
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,340
Yes.

404
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,530
Everyone, look.

405
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,390
These people are really pitiful.

406
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,980
Young Master will be here soon.

407
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,440
- I'm going to kill that bunch of Cangliu people.
- No.

408
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,720
How can I stand by and watch when our tribe's people are tortured and killed?

409
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,450
3,000 Quanxian troops against the Wind Falcons,

410
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,160
it's like using eggs to hit rocks.

411
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,230
If we go, it'll only increase our wounded and dead.

412
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,390
Over the past few decades, the Cangliu people

413
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,120
have never slaughtered us at such a great scale.

414
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,680
We allied with Kongsang

415
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,350
and attracted this calamity.

416
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,080
We shouldn't have fought directly against

417
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,960
Cangliu's army.

418
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,310
Right now, there's only one person

419
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,720
who can prevent our slaughter.

420
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,500
Who?

421
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,120
Only if we hand over the holder of the Heavenly Ring

422
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,140
will the Cangliu people let us go.

423
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,350
Young Master should make this decision. We shouldn't act recklessly.

424
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,550
The situation is already urgent.

425
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,340
Young Master hasn't recovered from his severe injury.

426
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,870
I think us, your elders, can make the decision.

427
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,200
That's right.

428
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,860
Everyone.

429
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
Young Master.

430
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,990
You may rise.

431
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,520
Young Master, can we

432
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,950
negotiate with the Cangliu people now?

433
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,990
Yesterday, the Cangliu people trapped me with the Golden Formation.

434
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,840
They must've prepared this early on.

435
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,450
They used the alliance as pretext, when actually they wanted to capture me.

436
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,550
At this time, how can we talk peace with them?

437
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,500
In that case, we can only

438
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,160
hand over the holder of the Heavenly Ring.

439
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,460
Young Master, please be wise.

440
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,170
Elders, do you really think handing over the holder of the Heavenly Ring

441
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,200
will prevent the Cangliu people from slaughtering us?

442
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,700
Canglliu's original target isn't the Quanxian,

443
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,720
but Kongsang.

444
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,060
Only when we hand over the holder of the Heavenly Ring,

445
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,370
will they let us have peace and stability again.

446
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,120
Cangliu people will agree.

447
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,320
Besides, are the lives of the entire Quanxian tribe

448
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,120
not as important as the one person who holds the Heavenly Ring?

449
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,510
Elders, we were threatened by Cangliu today,

450
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,220
to betray our allies.

451
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,740
The Cangliu people will know our bottom line.

452
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,910
Later, they'll be even more assured without fear.

453
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,230
We mustn't make any rash moves when it comes to this.

454
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,210
If everyone trusts me,

455
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,060
let me get adjusted, I will definitely save everyone.

456
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm going back to the ice chamber.

457
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,640
Before I come out, do not make any rash moves.

458
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,940
Young...

459
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,190
Prepare for execution.

460
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,000
Stop!

461
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,560
Who ordered this?

462
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,290
Fei Lian, what are you doing?

463
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,290
There are many methods to force Quanxian to surrender!

464
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,130
Why choose the cruelest one?

465
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,040
This is Master Peng's orders.

466
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,530
Master Peng?

467
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,280
Is Master Peng right about everything?

468
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,760
A military order cannot be changed.

469
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,920
Then why not make it a quick death?

470
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,880
How can anyone who wants to achieve big things

471
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,470
- be softhearted like a woman?
- Big things?

472
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,830
Aren't human lives big things?

473
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,340
General Fei Lian, considering your relationship with Master Lang,

474
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,630
I won't dispute this matter with you.

475
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,510
But don't be mistaken.

476
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,430
I am also a general now,

477
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,600
not your subordinate.

478
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,570
Our Master Peng isn't like your Master Lang,

479
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,160
who will pamper your moods.

480
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,440
Nan Zhao.

481
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,880
You're getting bolder and bolder.

482
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,530
You would dare attack our own?

483
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,810
Every one of you,

484
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,830
just you wait.

485
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,220
Master, can you prepare more obsidian for me,

486
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,310
the blood of the wensha beast and youtong flower sap?

487
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,630
These are all objects of extreme coldness.

488
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,240
Emperor of the Sea, needing these, are you going to cultivate the Splitting Technique?

489
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,320
The backlash of the Splitting Technique is even greater than the Mirror Technique's.

490
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,440
In the best case, it'll turn the practitioner insane. In the worst case,

491
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,240
you could lose your life.

492
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,720
Master, there's no need to worry.

493
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,960
Why are you cultivating the Splitting Technique?

494
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,910
I have already ordered Xiang

495
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,690
to place the obsidian in the Wind Falcon's storage area.

496
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,310
Therefore, I want to use the Splitting Technique to ignite the obsidian to burn down the Wind Falcons.

497
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,370
- But—
- We can't make a single mistake this time.

498
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,330
We also must quickly save those captured people.

499
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,760
If I don't use the Splitting Technique, I'm afraid it'll be difficult to counter them.

500
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,360
Master, please rest assured.

501
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,420
One more thing.

502
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,780
Previously, when I scouted the roads of Jing City,

503
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,710
I discovered many barriers surrounding Jing City.

504
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,150
There were also many ancient Kongsang techniques like the Golden Formation.

505
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,700
I think there must be a highly skilled expert protecting Cangliu.

506
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,680
I am most worried about this person.

507
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,850
I must use my magic powers to find out.

508
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,520
What have you found out?

509
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,360
Our tribe's people are being hung over the city walls.

510
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,240
They're being whipped and dehydrated by the scorching sun.

511
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,450
But, even so,

512
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,400
they're still hoping to be rescued by the Emperor of the Sea and the tribe.

513
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,180
That bunch of bastards! I'm going to kill them!

514
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,940
Young Master already said not to make rash moves.

515
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,020
Young Master also said not to make any rash moves last time.

516
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,630
Young Master and Yan Xi went to discuss a peace agreement.

517
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,090
- They were both—
- Young Master returned with injuries. What's the use in you going?

518
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:35,440
I don't fear death, nor do I fear getting injured.

519
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,010
If this one life of mine can be exchanged for two lives, it's worth it!

520
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,820
It's not worth it!

521
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,980
What's the matter?

522
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,680
You're a Quanxian warrior.

523
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,180
Only if you live can we rescue more of our people,

524
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,930
and then lead our people back to Biluo Sea.

525
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,730
I'm just saying it, it's not certain that I'd die.

526
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,320
Ning Liang, I hope we can return to the Biluo Sea together.

527
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,720
Of course.

528
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,680
Han Zhou, what's the matter with you?

529
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,040
- It's nothing.
- About Cangliu capturing our tribe's people,

530
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,280
is there any word from Kongsang?

531
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,530
They haven't contacted us.

532
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,660
Maybe they don't know about it.

533
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,200
They don't know? They probably don't want to know.

534
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,550
What an ally! They didn't even appear when we suffered such a severe loss.

535
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,390
Where is that girl from the Central Plains, Na Sheng?

536
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,080
Na Sheng?

537
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,810
I heard that Kongsang's Crown Prince arranged for her

538
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,910
to settle in a hut next to a river to the east of Jing Lake.

539
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,090
Why are you suddenly asking about her?

540
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,200
Nothing.

541
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,400
I'm just asking randomly.

542
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,680
Ning Liang.

543
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,150
Don't do anything stupid.

544
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,510
Cangliu people sent another message to the sound pearl.

545
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,050
They announced that they'll make another vicious strike tonight.

546
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,810
Previously, whenever our tribe's people were endangered,

547
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,650
we would dispatch troops to give aid.

548
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,650
Now, we're told to do nothing.

549
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,490
- I don't have any patience to sit here and just wait.
- Elders!

550
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,310
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

551
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,760
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

552
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,280
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

553
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,120
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

554
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,540
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

555
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,110
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

556
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:35,120
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

557
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,630
♫ We've met several times ♫

558
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,030
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

559
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:49,080
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

560
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,510
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

561
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:56,090
♫ You live in there ♫

562
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:02,160
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

563
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,010
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

564
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,050
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

565
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:12,910
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

566
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,510
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

567
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,910
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

568
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,390
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

569
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:29,850
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

570
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,850
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

571
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,860
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

572
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,760
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

573
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,280
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

574
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,810
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

575
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:52,770
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

576
00:44:52,770 --> 00:45:03,700
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
