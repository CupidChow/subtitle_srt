[Episode 41]

3
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,390
Your Highness, what is this?

4
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,740
It's Yu Huan's Sword of Light.

5
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,070
Watch mine!

6
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,700
Rest for a bit first.

7
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,560
Why is the Water Mirror open again?

8
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,650
High Priest.

9
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,450
Your Highness, what's happened?

10
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,800
I was next to Jing Lake and could feel the shaking from Wuse City.

11
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,710
What's wrong?

12
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,640
I'm fine. It's just this Water Mirror—

13
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
What's wrong with the Water Mirror?

14
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,640
It's Yu Huan. He appeared in the Water Mirror.

15
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,640
He attacked just now.

16
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,220
I'm afraid we can't use the Water Mirror anymore.

17
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,930
Your Highness.

18
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,780
Yu Huan broke through the Spirit Mirror Stage's enchantment under the Monument of Fallen Tears.

19
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,150
Hong Yuan, hurry and take the High Priest to get some rest.

20
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,900
Also, summon Prince Xuan and Prince Zi back. We will fight to our death to defend Wuse City.

21
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,510
Yes.

22
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,500
Yu Huan might take this information back to Jing City.

23
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,450
If the entrance to Wuse City is discovered, we'll be in a weakened position.

24
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,290
I understand.

25
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,560
Your Highness, I'd like to request

26
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,990
to remove the last seal.

27
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,790
But... you'll turn into ash.

28
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,940
A hundred years ago we already made our decision.

29
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,240
Now, it's Your Highness' turn to decide.

30
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,390
I can't decide.

31
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,110
We are in danger right now!

32
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,470
If Cangliu's army is upon us, we really won't have a chance.

33
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,350
A'Ying...

34
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,150
You're my family, not a tool for me to use.

35
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,160
Give me more time. I will find a solution!

36
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,720
- Your Highness!
- Don't say anymore.

37
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,400
Don't say anymore.

38
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,130
Your Highness, I have something to report.

39
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,250
Is it related to the Water Mirror?

40
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,490
It definitely is.

41
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,590
After Yu Huan was forced out of the passage way,

42
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,120
I found that the Water Mirror can't be opened anymore.

43
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,520
Actually, I saw Zhi Zhe in the Water Mirror again.

44
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,230
What!

45
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,010
What's wrong?

46
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,090
When?

47
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,440
When you pushed back Yu Huan.

48
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,030
Oh no! That's bad. Bad.

49
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,970
Previously, I only had suspicions.

50
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,380
Your Highness, when all of you were at the Stranded Dragon Abyss

51
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,600
I realized that I couldn't open the Water Mirror then either.

52
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,270
But then soon after it returned to normal.

53
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,600
I originally thought it was because I was old and losing my mind,

54
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
that my magic wasn't enough.

55
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,330
Could it be...

56
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,170
related to the Water Mirror in the Heavenly Temple?

57
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,420
I-I-I've checked the ancient books before.

58
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,650
I discovered that the Water Mirror in Wuse City and that of Heavenly Temple

59
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,380
are internally connected.

60
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,200
If ours can't be opened,

61
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,720
then the Heavenly Temple one can open.

62
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,530
But, Your Highness, without my skills

63
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,620
they can't open theirs at will.

64
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,890
Maybe they opened it and then immediately closed it.

65
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,400
But we can't determine

66
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,240
exactly when they opened it or what they saw, right?

67
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,640
Right.

68
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,780
Your Highness, Kongsang is in danger.

69
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,970
How did my royal father... make the choice back then?

70
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,040
His Majesty hesitated at that time.

71
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,300
In the evening, before he issued the command to Lord Xi Jing,

72
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,620
His Majesty... didn't sleep at all.

73
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,120
He personally told me that he wanted you to be happy and carefree,

74
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,980
to grow up in the prairies and away from conflicts.

75
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,570
He told me... the way to become king

76
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,660
was a lonely path.

77
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,990
He was willing to face the consequences,

78
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,820
he didn't want you to have to bear it.

79
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
But then...

80
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,480
he still brought me back.

81
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,520
That's right. Between being a father and a king,

82
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,390
His Majesty chose the way of the king.

83
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,480
The way of the king has always been a lonely path.

84
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,250
This guilty subject, Yu Huan, greets Lord Zhi Zhe.

85
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,790
There is a reason for me to cross the line this time.

86
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,870
I've discovered something; consider it a gift.

87
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,020
You went to Wuse City.

88
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,620
How did you know?

89
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,610
Because the Water Mirror has been opened.

90
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,720
Now, I want you to enter one more time.

91
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,240
I have an important mission for you.

92
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,300
Turning into ash,

93
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,360
Wuse City is broken, the Water Mirror is open.

94
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,480
What should I do

95
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,410
so I can solve this dilemma?

96

[Six Star Reversal Formation]

99
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,230
"Six Star Reversal Formation"?

100
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,660
I've never seen this before.

101
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,170
Could this Six Star Reversal Formation

102
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,820
be the solution to the six princes turning into ash?

103
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,840
Great!

104
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,060
Did Yan Xi come back last night?

105
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,020
No. Before he left, some soldiers heard him say

106
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,660
he was going to take Na Sheng to the capital for a few days.

107
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,800
Okay. If he comes back, tell him to come and see me.

108
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,260
- You may go.
- Yes

109
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,140
Su Mo, I found a solution!

110
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,810
I found the solution to avoid turning into ash.

111
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,450
- What's the solution?
- The Six Star Reversal Formation.

112
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,830
- Six Star Reversal Formation?
- That's right.

113
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,810
Tell me. How is it done?

114
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,170
You can change the course of life by offering up power on the Spirit Mirror Stage.

115
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,320
It's another method to reverse life and death.

116
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,090
But I know that you didn't discover this method in the Dark Golden Classics previously.

117
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,890
Perhaps... I saw it wrong?

118
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,260
Su Mo, I found the solution.

119
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,850
A'Ying can be saved! How come you're unhappy?

120
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,960
This came too suddenly. I also think this Dark Golden Classics...

121
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm just wondering whether we can find a safer method.

122
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,190
We don't have the time anymore.

123
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,180
The Wuse City has been invaded and the Water Mirror has been opened.

124
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,440
More than anyone else, I know I have to undo the last seal.

125
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,660
I know better than anyone that the last barrier must be broken.

126
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm the last person who wants to see A'Ying and the others die.

127
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,170
We don't have time for a better solution.

128
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,360
So you came to find me for...

129
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
Obsidian.

130
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,230
Okay. Come with me.

131
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,830
What are you doing?

132
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,320
Give me the Dark Golden Classics.

133
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,580
What is this?

134
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,010
Just as I thought. Awhile ago, I saw this

135
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,930
black smoke on Su Nuo's body.

136
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,700
I think it's Zhi Zhe's spell. It's a good thing we discovered it early.

137
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,250
At the Stranded Dragon Abyss,

138
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,590
the real history was also different from what was recorded in the Dark Golden Classics.

139
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,400
The Six Star Reversal Formation was also a trap, wasn't it?

140
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,790
I'm afraid Zhi Zhe wants to take in your power

141
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,610
with the Six Star Reversal Formation. As for the Dark Golden Classics,

142
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,850
you can't believe all of it since you can't discern its authenticity.

143
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,060
The hope that just appeared... turned out to be fake.

144
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,930
Do Bai Ying and the others know about this?

145
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,290
I think... they should know by now.

146
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,470
I'll go explain to them.

147
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,430
Let me deal with the problem of turning into ash.

148
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,150
You have a solution?

149
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,910
When I'm certain, I will tell everyone.

150
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,930
All right.

151
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,760
I heard that Wuse City was invaded.

152
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,650
And the Water Mirror had been opened.

153
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,660
Yes. Yu Huan broke into the passage way

154
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,940
between the Spirit Mirror Stage and Wuse City.

155
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,470
He was forced out by High Priest.

156
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,880
The Six Star Reversal Formation was sent over shortly after.

157
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,680
Looks like their goal is Wuse City.

158
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,540
It really is killing two birds with one stone.

159
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,920
What's going on with the Water Mirror?

160
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,360
We think the Heavenly Temple Water Mirror has been opened.

161
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,970
- How many times has it been opened?
- Twice

162
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,590
Once at the Stranded Dragon Abyss, and then this time.

163
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,460
The important thing is we don't know when it'll be opened again.

164
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,270
This is problematic.

165
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,380
These past few days, His Highness has gone through all Wuse City's books.

166
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,310
For us, His Highness has bags under his eyes.

167
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,060
Sister Hong Yuan, if we don't turn into ash,

168
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,590
I want to ask if you'll have candied annatto fruit and roast pork with me in Ye City in a few days.

169
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,120
Where did you learn about these?

170
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,430
His Highness' private scrolls!

171
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,120
Just looking at these words makes me drool!

172
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,640
Your Highness.

173
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,030
Your Highness, we heard from the High Priest that you found a solution?

174
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,830
Yes, I did.

175
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,580
Everyone get ready. We'll head for the Spirit Mirror Stage tomorrow.

176
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,040
- Spirit Mirror Stage?
- I found a formation method in the Dark Golden Classics.

177
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,330
The formation can only be opened at a certain hour in each period.

178
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,590
I observed the astronomical events and found that the time is tomorrow at noon.

179
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,290
Tomorrow at noon?

180
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,360
There is little time then. What should we prepare, Your Highness?

181
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,230
Prepare some snow crystals.

182
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,560
Yes.

183
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,430
Your Highness, did the Dark Golden Classics mention the cost in this formation?

184
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,510
There's definitely a risk.

185
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,630
But no matter what happens, I will protect you all

186
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,680
regardless... of the cost.

187
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,050
Then, what did Su Mo say?

188
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,510
Su Mo gave me the obsidian needed for the formation.

189
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,000
Will he go with us?

190
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,490
A'Ying, this is Kongsang's affair.

191
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,930
I hope you can trust me in the same way that you trust Su Mo.

192
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,620
By taking this chance,

193
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,920
I hope we'll succeed.

194
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,260
Yan Xi, we've been through a lot lately.

195
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,920
I feel that I've matured a lot, too.

196
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,240
You are right. We should cherish each other even more in the future.

197
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,590
I won't be willful anymore.

198
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,670
Why aren't you saying anything?

199
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,820
Immediately bring the Heavenly Ring to Jing City.

200
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,770
Yan Xi? What's wrong?

201
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,510
Yan Xi.

202
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,610
What's wrong with you?

203
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,220
Has the Nine-headed Bird been released?

204
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Yes, Your Lordship has thought through everything.

205
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,730
They'll never imagine that

206
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,150
the Yan Xi they painstakingly rescued is already under our mind control technique.

207
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,150
He's ours to use now.

208
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,400
When I get the Heavenly Ring,

209
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,210
what can Lord Zhi Zhe do?

210
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,810
The Spirit Mirror Stage is just ahead. Everyone, be careful.

211
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,710
Each time the Water Mirror opens,

212
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,540
it consumes more of my power than I expected.

213
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,760
Your Highness, you've looked worried the whole way here.

214
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,780
Are you looking for someone?

215
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm checking to see if Yu Huan has been following us.

216
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,070
The Qing Clan's army has already checked Jiuyi Mountain. They didn't find Yu Huan.

217
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,250
- What about Su Mo?
- Bai Ying.

218
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,750
When we go inside, follow me closely.

219
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,310
All right.

220
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,820
Then, will Su Mo come to help us?

221
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,390
He won't be coming.

222
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,340
The Spirit Mirror Stage will open

223
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,930
and I'll kill the six princes.

224
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,820
At that time, the Wuse City barrier will lose its support.

225
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,900
Seize the opportunity to destroy Wuse City.

226
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,860
Once we win this battle, I'll give you the position as the commander-in-chief,

227
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,100
as commander of the Five Masters.

228
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,840
Everyone, stand in your own positions.

229
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,570
We'll begin.

230
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,680
Bai Ying, don't worry. I'm here.

231
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,110
Spirit Mirror Stage. Open up.

232
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,060
Your Highness, what's going on?

233
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,070
Sister Bai Ying, what's the matter with His Highness?

234
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,250
There's something wrong with the formation. We should all leave!

235
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,520
- Yes.
- Yes!

236
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,150
Don't waste your effort.

237
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:56,790
I finally have you, A'Wei.

238
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,350
Lord Zhi Zhe, so it was you!

239
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,890
Everything has its cracks.

240
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,040
Who can escape?

241
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,230
If he didn't want to try and save you all,

242
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,650
when would I have gotten the opportunity?

243
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,400
The Six Star Reversal Formation is a trap!

244
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,300
Your Highness!

245
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,580
Your Highness, what's the matter with you?

246
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,350
He is already under my control.

247
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,130
Also, it's just that old man left

248
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,040
in Wuse City, right?

249
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,150
Su Mo...

250
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,260
Su Mo?

251
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,190
Su Mo!

252
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,680
Su Mo...

253
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,280
won't be coming.

254
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,390
The obsidian is finally done releasing.

255
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,100
What?

256
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,930
Su Mo! You!

257
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,420
I'd like to see how you can withstand so much force.

258
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,120
You can break Wuse City's Water Mirror

259
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,580
if you fill the Sword of Light with the obsidian.

260
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,260
This is bad! Someone is attacking Wuse City's barrier!

261
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,280
If Su Mo is here,

262
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,670
is His Highness in Wuse City?

263
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,800
The Splitting Sword.

264
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,120
Did you really think your plan was flawless?

265
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,240
Su Mo saw through it a long time ago!

266
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,930
A'Ying!

267
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,960
Your Lord Zhi Zhe is going to use your life to open Wuse City!

268
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,490
What are you saying?

269
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,680
Once Wuse City's barrier is broken,

270
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,730
the passageway that you are in, will disappear immediately.

271
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,280
Stop with your scare tactics!

272
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,760
A'Ying!

273
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,450
Take care of her.

274
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:26,000
Su Mo, you want to push me to my limits

275
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,050
and kill me.

276
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,580
A'Ying.

277
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,100
You should go back to Wuse City. I'll take her to treat her injuries.

278
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,550
What happened on the top of Jing Pagoda?

279
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,590
Could it be... that Lord Zhi Zhe is in trouble?

280
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:45,010
If that's true, then Heaven is helping me.

281
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,520
My body…

282
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,780
has already decayed to such an extent.

283
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,970
Why is Bai Ying's spiritual consciousness so unstable?

284
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,210
Zhi Zhe didn't attack us.

285
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,800
Why have we all been injured?

286
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,550
This is bad! Someone is attacking Wuse City's barrier!

287
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,890
It turns out that the lives of the six princes

288
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,500
are tied together with the Wuse City's barrier.

289
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,620
Lin'er. Lin'er.

290
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,590
You have me. I'm right here.

291
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,980
What happened to me?

292
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,680
You just had a dream.

293
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,540
I dreamed of Lin'er and Royal Father.

294
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,790
Lin'er's greatest wish was to be buried in the Valley of the Ancestral Kings.

295
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,780
When you're better,

296
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,820
I'll go with you to see them.

297
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,210
Is the Sea Oath of the Star Soul spell the phrase on the tomb?

298
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,530
What's the matter with you?

299
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,170
Are you hiding something from me again?

300
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,050
I'm not keeping anything from you.

301
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,200
Whatever you want to know, I'll tell you.

302
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,450
Then, what was the deal with the Six Star Reversal Formation?

303
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,260
I didn't expect that Zhi Zhe would design so many obstacles for us.

304
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,090
I'm thinking...

305
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,530
could we use the Six Star Reversal Formation to severely injure Zhi Zhe?

306
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,190
What you mean is for us to continue with the Six Star Reversal Formation?

307
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,290
But my seal hasn't been removed completely yet.

308
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,100
That's why I need you to keep guard at Wuse City while I go to the Spirit Mirror Stage.

309
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,740
I've already obtained the power of the dragon deity. I'll leave the Splitting Sword with you.

310
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,270
We all saw the tragedy from 7,000 years ago at the Stranded Dragon Abyss.

311
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,150
Also, you were almost injured by it.

312
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,390
So now, why are you...

313
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,350
I don't believe in fate.

314
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,230
I trust you.

315
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,170
I've always wanted to tell you,

316
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,060
but never found a good time.

317
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,370
Actually, from the very beginning, I had already guessed.

318
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,910
Along the way to Jiuyi, even though you took the appearance of Zhen Lan,

319
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,740
but you didn't talk or behave like him.

320
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,200
I knew that you were always by my side.

321
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,100
Also, you made a big mistake.

322
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,290
You call me Bai Ying.

323
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,950
However, His Highness always calls me A'Ying.

324
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,200
Didn't you say, you would listen to everything I say?

325
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,320
Then call me A'Ying.

326
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,100
Forget it. I know you two had your reasons.

327
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,400
I have at least this tacit understanding.

328
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,350
So from that moment I knew,

329
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,790
this had to be a trap.

330
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,150
The so-called Six Star Reversal Formation

331
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,810
really couldn't reverse anything.

332
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,940
Should I tell her that I've found a solution?

333
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,210
But if she knew, she'd definitely not let me do it.

334
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,110
Don't worry.

335
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,420
A... A'Ying

336
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,970
[Master Peng's Residence - Cangliu]

337
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,520
[Master Peng's Residence]

338
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,090
My Lord.

339
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,100
You all may step out.

340
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,260
Today... I invited all of you to my residence

341
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,240
because I'm sure you've heard.

342
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,480
A lot has happened at the top of Jing Pagoda.

343
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,610
Yet Lord Zhi Zhe still hasn't given us

344
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,130
any instructions.

345
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,630
Master Peng, what do you mean?

346
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,000
Do you still not understand?

347
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,980
Back then, Lord Zhi Zhe promoted the five of us

348
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,290
and bestowed us with immortality.

349
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,290
He even brought magic and weapons to Cangliu.

350
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,270
Now...

351
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,360
Are you planning to betray Lord Zhi Zhe?

352
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,980
Haven't you also wanted to?

353
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,350
First, it was Yu Huan.

354
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,000
Then, it was Quanxian's Su Nuo.

355
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:47,290
Has Zhi Zhe given us any further orders?

356
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,350
Lord Zhi Zhe already abandoned us a while ago.

357
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,390
Still, you don't understand that yet?

358
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,680
Before we become abandoned pawns in a chess game,

359
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,310
let's get rid of the chess player first.

360
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,300
It is Master Xian who can see it most clearly.

361
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,030
Then, Master Peng, do you have a plan?

362
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,230
Yu Huan is nothing to fear.

363
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,190
As soon as he appears,

364
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,810
we'll send him to jail.

365
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,350
Everyone, my chess piece has already arrived.

366
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,930
What I want from everyone

367
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,880
is to cooperate with my plan.

368
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,740
[Arrest Order]

369
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,230
[Arrest Order]

370
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,950
Has Lord Zhi Zhe really abandoned me?

371
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,080
Was Zhen Lan telling the truth?

372
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,720
Who am I even working for?

373
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,090
There are disloyal people...

374
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:18,030
in Cangliu.

375
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:38,220
Yu Huan is still alive.

376
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:46,940
He's now wanted all over the city.

377
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,800
If he falls into the hands of the Five Masters,

378
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,170
only I...

379
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,470
can protect him.

380
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,200
Lord Zhi Zhe,

381
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,790
I, Saintess Yu Zhu,

382
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,690
am pleading with you,

383
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,100
once this matter concludes,

384
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,260
set Yu Huan free.

385
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,520
Are you sure you don't need to rest more before you go back?

386
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,730
I'm still worried about His Highness, Sister Hong Yuan, and the others.

387
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,940
I want to go back and check on them.

388
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,650
Tell Zhen Lan for me.

389
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,910
Based on my understanding of the splitting technique,

390
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,810
Lord Zhi Zhe is now probably suffering severe backlash.

391
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,710
This is the best time to counterattack. Tell him to be prepared.

392
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,010
The Flower God Festival is the day after next.

393
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:47,270
I want to hang Lin'er a wishing plaque on the Flower Deity Tree.

394
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,190
Pray for peace for our uncertain future.

395
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,710
All right. I'll go with you.

396
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,770
♫ Suddenly far, suddenly near, swaying in the wind unsteadily ♫

397
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:18,010
♫ Your silhouette is like those clouds ♫

398
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,870
♫ I want to be your rain ♫

399
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:25,440
♫ Tapping on your heart ♫

400
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,860
♫ It's too uncertain whether the world will be cloudy or sunny ♫

401
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:37,120
♫ Taking advantage of this light drizzle to caress you softly ♫

402
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,630
♫ I train repeatedly ♫

403
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:46,730
♫ Afraid that the strong winds
will suddenly blow you away, losing you ♫

404
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,430
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

405
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,960
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

406
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,390
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

407
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:32,270
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

408
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,750
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

409
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,270
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

410
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:46,060
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

411
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,730
♫ We've met several times ♫

412
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,170
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

413
00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:00,240
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

414
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,690
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

415
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,140
♫ You live in there ♫

416
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,320
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

417
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,180
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

418
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,120
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

419
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,030
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

420
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,590
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

421
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,970
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

422
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,500
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

423
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,020
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

424
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,920
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

425
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,010
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

426
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,920
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

427
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,460
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

428
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,820
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

429
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:03,890
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

430
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:13,450
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
