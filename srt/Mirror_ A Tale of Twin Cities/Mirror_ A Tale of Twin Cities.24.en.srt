00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,090
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,820
Later, the other people in the Qing Clan wouldn't acknowledge me.

4
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,960
They said I was an evil spirit.

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,740
They also wouldn't let me return to Jiuyi Palace.

6
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,570
So I've always been wandering around the mountain.

7
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,000
You mean, for the past 100 years,

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,870
you've been surviving as a bird spirit?

9
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,780
Do you doubt me?

10
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,720
Lin'er, he's not.

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,390
Su Mo doesn't mean that.

12
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,940
He's merely curious, that's all.

13
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,740
In this past century...

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,340
In this past century,

15
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,830
I've been living neither as a ghost nor a human. Are you happy now?

16
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,680
Lin'er. Lin'er.

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,050
We won't ask you anymore.

18
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,380
It's my fault.

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,770
I didn't come looking for you.

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,450
Older Sister, I'm not afraid.

21
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,790
Although at the beginning,

22
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,180
there were always strange noises from this mountain,

23
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,730
but after I got used to them, I wasn't afraid anymore.

24
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,260
I'd always fantasize

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,520
that I was like you, traveling to the ends of the world with a sword in my hand.

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,300
It's just that, it has been a century.

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,110
Why didn't you ever come to look for me?

28
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,300
You didn't come here to worship Royal Father either.

29
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,370
Because...

30
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,410
I was too ashamed to face our ancestors,

31
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,480
too ashamed to face Royal Father, too.

32
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,460
So, I didn't dare come here.

33
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,780
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,980
Blame it all on Su Mo!

35
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,750
A century ago, you caused my older sister to jump down from Jing Pagoda.

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,420
You are still harassing her now! What exactly do you want?

37
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,320
Lin'er.

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,060
Bai Ying,

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,780
I'll wait up ahead for you.

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,060
Lin'er, Su Mo isn't harassing me.

41
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,870
We formed an alliance with Quanxian to complete an important task.

42
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,770
What does he want that he insists on following you?

43
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,030
We are going to the Monument of Fallen Tears to obtain the Splitting Sword.

44
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,940
The Splitting Sword?

45
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,170
To oppose Cangliu

46
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,570
and let everyone live under the sun again.

47
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,450
If you want to go to the Monument of Fallen Tears, you must go through the Valley of the Ancestral Kings first.

48
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,410
You're going the wrong way.

49
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,340
That's right. We kept getting lost in the forest.

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,120
We can't get out.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,550
Sister, I'll take you there.

52
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,240
I have been living here for a long time. I know the way.

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Really?

54
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,990
Jiuyi Mountain is very dangerous. You can't simply wander about.

55
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,340
There are many Tu Luos who will try to harm you. It's very dangerous.

56
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,750
Sister, it wasn't easy to find and reunite with you.

57
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,580
I really can't lose you again.

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,820
Kongsang really is poor.

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,120
The Royal Palace is so simple.

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,510
It used to be very wealthy.

61
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,140
The Qing Clan was retained by Cangliu.

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,490
However, as the offspring of previous nobility, it's hard to escape living in poverty.

63
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,710
He deserved it. Who told Prince Qing to betray—

64
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,910
Please wait here. I will notify the King of Jiuyi.

65
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,190
Thank you for your trouble.

66
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,500
Be careful.

67
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,490
- Lin'er, wait here for me for a moment.
- Okay.

68
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,240
Be careful.

69
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,570
Su Mo,

70
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,010
Lin'er said she's very familiar with this place.

71
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,700
She can lead us out of the forest

72
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,340
to the Valley of the Ancestral Kings. Can we take her along with us?

73
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,940
Of course. It has been a century since you two have seen each other.

74
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,150
I believe you'd want to spend more time with her, too.

75
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,170
It's just that... she seems to be hiding something from us.

76
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,570
When Qing Chen was mentioned just now,

77
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,590
her eyes flickered.

78
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,890
Be careful.

79
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,440
Perhaps, seeing that you were by our side, she couldn't speak directly.

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,330
Although Lin'er is rather stubborn,

81
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,860
she's a kind and adorable girl.

82
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,120
If it weren't due to what happened a century ago,

83
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,900
perhaps Lin'er would still be the carefree princess of Kongsang.

84
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,200
I'm apologizing on her behalf for her rudeness.

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,500
Please don't blame her.

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,300
Of course, I won't. She's your younger sister.

87
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,080
That she survived is a great comfort to you.

88
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,870
Perhaps I overthought it.

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Thank you for your understanding.

90
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,860
Sister, what did you say to him? Standing so close.

91
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,580
Everyone, this is His Majesty, the King of Jiuyi.

92
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,590
King of Jiuyi.

93
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,430
Although my title is King of Jiuyi,

94
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,640
in truth, I'm just a person who guards the tomb.

95
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,930
I wonder

96
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,160
why you three are here.

97
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,540
We came here to worship the ancestors

98
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,260
and to also understand the situation of Jiuyi at the same time.

99
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,120
What's wrong?

100
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,780
I didn't imagine that,

101
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,870
in my lifetime,

102
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,440
I could still see people of Kongsang from outside of Jiuyi.

103
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,380
What a great honor.

104
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,550
What a great honor.

105
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,020
Please take a seat everyone.

106
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,830
Why is the Great Hall so dark?

107
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,940
A century ago, the barrier of Jiuyi changed.

108
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,840
The Qing Clan wasn't able to leave the mountain.

109
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,530
Trading with the surrounding towns was reduced,

110
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,910
some supplies were insufficient.

111
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,050
Jiuyi Palace could only save wherever it could.

112
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,080
Miss Li Zhu,

113
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
why have I never heard of any changes to the barrier around Jiuyi?

114
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,140
I wonder when the barrier changed.

115
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,130
A century ago, a mysterious man from Cangliu

116
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,580
changed the barrier of Jiuyi.

117
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,830
He was well-spoken and emphasized that it was to protect us.

118
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,940
However, actually, it was no different from imprisonment.

119
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,440
Also, the Qing Clan of Jiuyi Mountain

120
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,470
also suffered the punishments of our ancestors, too.

121
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,280
From what I know, other than the Qing Clan of Jiuyi Mountain,

122
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,370
and after Cangliu dominated Yunhuang,

123
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,490
the people of Kongsang outside Jing City

124
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,770
either fled to other places or had to live with concealed identities.

125
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,900
Are you both from the Central Plains?

126
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,910
Yes. We're all from there.

127
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,880
We came here to worship the ancestors

128
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,310
and seek blessings.

129
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,610
You're here to worship the ancestors?

130
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,500
I fear you've taken the wrong path.

131
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,420
The Valley of the Ancestral Kings of Kongsang is on the Right Peak.

132
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,920
Rightly so.

133
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,160
We are here to seek blessings from the Heavenly King.

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,620
How absurd.

135
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,930
The tomb of the Heavenly King is only for Kongsang royalty

136
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,270
to enter and leave as they please.

137
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,840
Seeing the state of Kongsang today,

138
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,980
I believe in the entire world,

139
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,170
I'm also the only one who has the right to do so.

140
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,360
What do you mean by this?

141
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,350
I'm Zhen Lan, the Crown Prince of Kongsang.

142
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,150
A century ago, Crown Prince Zhen Lan

143
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,740
died under the hands of the Cangliu.

144
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,590
If he's alive,

145
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,350
this is currently the kingdom of Cangliu.

146
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,970
I'm ashamed to say

147
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,500
I was really incompetent

148
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,770
to have my heavenly power sealed by the Cangliu.

149
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,110
However, now that the seal has been removed,

150
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,760
I have awakened,

151
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,960
in order to help my people of Kongsang see the sun again.

152
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,800
Here.

153
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,120
The decree of the crown prince is here.

154
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,010
Take a look.

155
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,830
This old minister has eyes but failed to recognize you.

156
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,150
Greetings, Crown Prince.

157
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,230
This thing still really works.

158
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,810
Greetings, Crown Prince.

159
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,550
King Qing, please rise. Please rise.

160
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,950
Crown Prince is back.

161
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,520
There's hope for the glory of Jiuyi again.

162
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,580
Whatever instructions you have,

163
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,180
I won't give up until death.

164
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,550
There's no need to give up until death.

165
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,010
I know very well the

166
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,890
circumstances of the Qing Clan under the Cangliu.

167
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,730
I won't give you a hard time.

168
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,410
You only need to take me to the tomb of the Heavenly King.

169
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,170
Naturally, I will take you there,

170
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,230
but I have another request.

171
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,170
Please ask.

172
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,650
When the Kongsang can see the sun again,

173
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,850
Your Highness, please

174
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,970
let everyone in the Qing Clan

175
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,230
leave Jiuyi.

176
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,710
Qing Chen betrayed Kongsang.

177
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,810
For a century, my Qing Clan

178
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,240
has been cursed and punished by the Kongsang.

179
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,750
So many of our offspring

180
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,550
died prematurely

181
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,650
in violent, unnatural deaths.

182
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,970
I'm willing to be punished,

183
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,810
but those children were innocent.

184
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,590
That's true.

185
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,710
If there comes a day when Kongsang can see the sun again,

186
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,000
the Qing Clan must have made their contributions, too.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,340
I believe we will all be free again.

188
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,600
Thank you, Crown Prince.

189
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,850
Be careful.

190
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,370
Be careful.

191
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,220
What is he walking so fast for?

192
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,890
Su Mo.

193
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,600
He heard you the moment you called him.

194
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,330
Sister, Su Mo must have either an ulterior motive or a plot against you.

195
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,470
He doesn't.

196
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,840
I don't believe that.

197
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,930
Sister, why do you still trust Su Mo so much?

198
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,370
Because of him, you broke the seal and were humiliated by hundreds of officials.

199
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,900
That had nothing to do with him. It was my fault.

200
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,560
Sister, you're kind-hearted. He comes from a humble background and doesn't deserve you.

201
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,080
All right. Lin'er, stop saying such things.

202
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,270
I didn't say anything wrong. Fine, I'll stop talking about it.

203
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,160
My leg's injured. I can't walk and need to take a break.

204
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,250
Let's take a break then. Is there anything to drink here?

205
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,670
You're thirsty? I'm not telling you.

206
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,940
Your sister hasn't drunk water for a while now.

207
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,330
Really?

208
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,720
You... You go dig that out.

209
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,300
That thing.

210
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,660
You asked me but don't believe me. When my sister's thirsty, you won't dig it out.

211
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,500
How's your wound?

212
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm fine.

213
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,970
You're just as reckless as you always were. You're covered in sweat.

214
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,490
Lin'er, you've suffered a lot.

215
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,770
- Sister.
- Silly girl.

216
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,220
I thought about you all the time and even dreamed of you looking for me.

217
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,520
But it's great now. A dream come true.

218
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,400
- Let's–
- Here.

219

Try it.

220
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,300
You haven't drunk water for a while either. Go ahead.

221

Thank you.

223
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,890
If he wants to eat, he can dig again. There's plenty over there.

224
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,890
Sister, go ahead and eat.

225
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,410
Hurry, eat one. Here.

Just a moment.

229
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,260
How do you feel? Is it the backlash?

230

No.

You don't need to hide it from me.

232
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,390
It's just that we're getting closer and closer to the Valley of the Ancestral Kings and the barrier here is getting stronger.

I'm fine.

Come on, Sister! Let's go.

236
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,090
General, you'll reach the Valley of the Ancestral Kings after entering the stone gate in the cave.

237
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,980
You can head back now.

Yes.

Go ahead.

242
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,350
Will the formation be more powerful if we use spiritual consciousness?

243
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,010
If we use spiritual consciousness for the formation,

244
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,210
it'll be a fatal one for sure.

245
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,340
But...

246
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,810
using spiritual consciousness for the formation will consume more energy and be more dangerous

247
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,680
for the person creating it.

248

He's brought Master Lang's token with him, which allows him to mobilize the troops of Banbu City.

He has a command token from Master Lang,

which allows him to mobilize all the troops in Banbu City.

If he doesn't have the token,

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,810
It was Su Mo who made the mistake! He's the bad guy!

326
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:49,690
Lin'er, it was all my fault.

327
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,760
I want to make it up to you. I'm the one who let you down.

328
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,290
I didn't keep looking for you.

329
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,850
Back then, I thought you were dead,

330
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,290
so we missed out on a hundred years.

331
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,500
I promise you that I'll be with you forever.

332
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,830
Then which of us is more important, Su Mo or me?

333
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,790
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

334
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,450
Sister!

335
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,020
I already know the answer.

336
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,150
Su Mo.

337
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,270
I don't know if anything will go wrong.

338
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,260
I put a spell on this thing.

339
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,380
Try tapping it three times.

340
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,160
That's what you meant by tapping it three times.

341
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,260
Are you using the mirror technique again?

342
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,160
You promised me you wouldn't use the mirror technique again?

343
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,560
Why won't you take care of your body?

344
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,140
I... I didn't mean to use the mirror technique.

345
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,560
You could've let me help you.

346
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,530
It consumes your power to use the violet-lipped orchid. Jiuyi Mountain is full of danger.

347
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,150
I don't want you to use more power on me.

348
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,410
In your heart,

349
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,560
do you feel that I'm unable to help you at all?

350
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,410
Of course not.

351
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,200
I promise to definitely listen to you in the future.

352
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,910
I don't want you to be hurt.

353
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,490
I know.

354
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,340
We're both always trying to be brave and never say anything,

355
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,280
but you're still the one who doesn't keep his promises.

356
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:14,810
By the way, you'll appear in front of me when I tap three times?

357
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,440
If there's a long distance, it may take more time.

358
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,980
What about knocking four times?

359
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,670
- Knocking four times?
- If it's the number of taps is different,

360
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,430
the conveyance is different.

361
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,930
If this is the case, would it make it more convenient for us to communicate?

362
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,840
How do you want to do it?

363
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,860
I haven't figured it out yet.

364
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,130
Then tell me after you've thought it through.

365
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,780
Let's go back. Lin'er should be anxiously waiting for us.

366
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,230
All right.

367
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,990
Lin'er.

368
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,690
Sister.

369
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,240
- What's wrong?
- I thought you didn't want me again.

370
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,040
It wasn't easy for us to be reunited.

371
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,390
Impossible. How could I not want you?

372
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,490
Sister, I've thought it through.

373
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,880
I'm willing to leave with you. I don't want to be a bird spirit anymore.

374
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,950
I still want to be a princess of Kongsang. I still want to be your younger sister.

375
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,190
But...

376
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,330
where is our Kongsang?

377
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,420
Sorry, Lin'er. I shouldn't have left you alone here.

378
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,170
Sister, the Valley of the Ancestral Kings is up ahead.

379
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,330
After the Valley of the Ancestral Kings is the Monument of Fallen Tears.

380
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,520
Can you go on my behalf to worship Royal Father? I miss him so much.

381
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,590
Why can't we all go together?

382
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,950
Perhaps, it's because I breathed in the evil spirits of Jiuyi Mountain

383
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:15,120
and became the bird spirit, since then I hear lots of loud wailing if I go in there.

384
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,480
It's really painful.

385
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,490
Sister, it seems like I've been punished by the ancestors.

386
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,720
They don't recognize me anymore.

387
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,750
I can't enter the Valley of the Ancestral Kings again.

388
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,090
Why didn't you tell me about this previously? What should we do now?

389
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm used to it.

390
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,140
Bai Ying,

391
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,140
let's go.

392
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,090
Let's go, Older Sister.

393
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,530
We'll go back to the Quanxian camp after getting the Splitting Sword.

394
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,660
I'll ask Ming Huo if there's any way to remove the curse of the bird spirit.

395
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,490
All right.

396
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,470
The Valley of the Ancestral Kings is the most powerful place in Jiuyi

397
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,530
and also the place where your magic power is the weakest.

398
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,370
You must be careful.

399
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,970
Let's go.

400
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,190
Hurry up, Sister.

401
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,760
- Let me take a look—
- Na Sheng!

402
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,220
What's wrong? I'm just taking a look.

403
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,640
With one look, this lamp seems to be worth a fortune!

404
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,760
Your Highness, this Star Perch lamp can illuminate the tomb of the Heavenly King.

405
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,500
Let Li Zhu

406
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,310
- take you there to pay homage.
- Yes.

407
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,980
Hold on.

408
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,170
Aren't you coming with us?

409
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,610
I'm old and my legs are weak.

410
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,340
I don't want to create problems for you.

411
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,710
All right then.

412
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,830
We'll have to trouble Miss Li Zhu then.

413
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,170
Return it to her.

414
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,330
This is really pretty. Here.

415
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,150
Why did the lamp light up?

416
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,020
It's even prettier. Come, let me look at it again.

417
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,720
[Star Perch Lamp]

418
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,770
Why did it go out again?

419
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,980
I'm the only one who can light the Star Perch Lamp.

420
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,360
This lamp was originally in the royal bedchamber of the Heavenly King

421
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,640
as an ordinary copper lamp on his writing desk.

422
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
It accompanied the King of Kongsang

423
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,730
when he reviewed countless memorials.

424
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,740
It has witnessed many trials and tribulations.

425
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,180
Please follow me.

426
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,620
When will Qing Yuan arrive?

427
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,070
Qing Yuan must avoid sunlight during the day. There's no hurry.

428
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,900
Let's go there first.

429
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
Miss Li Zhu,

430
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,030
did you grow up in Jiuyi Mountain since you were a child?

431
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,320
Yes.

432
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,500
Have you ever thought of leaving this place one day?

433
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,590
For a beautiful woman like you

434
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,480
to waste the prime of your life in the tombs and tunnels,

435
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,900
isn't that a pity?

436
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,550
I... have never seen the world outside Jiuyi Mountain.

437
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,520
Older Sister Li Zhu, leave with us after we've obtained the item.

438
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,880
The world outside

439
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,110
should be beautiful, right?

440
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:41,010
It's a pity I have a mission and

441
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,760
don't have the decision-making power on whether I stay or leave.

442
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,880
What's your mission?

443
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,650
Your Highness,

444
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,720
I... I don't have freedom.

445
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,190
My ancestors have been guarding the tombs of the royal family of Kongsang for generations.

446
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,760
We drafted a spell contract with the Kongsang clan.

447
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,520
I can only be liberated with their consent and then leave Jiuyi Mountain.

448
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,670
I've been wanting to ask you.

449
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,950
You are a merperson, aren't you?

450
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,320
It's true, I am a descendant of Quanxian.

451
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,440
Who can give you the consent to leave then?

452
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,780
This way, please.

453
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,010
Please be careful, everyone.

454
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,860
Be careful.

455
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,410
Na Sheng, hold on tight to me.

456
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,700
There's a narrow road in there. Be careful.

457
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,910
Be careful.

458
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,820
Uncle Xi Jing, hold onto me.

459
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,550
Are you all right?

460
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,620
I'm fine.

461
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,390
I'm fine.

462
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,220
This is the Valley of the Ancestral Kings.

463
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,100
Royal Father is buried here.

464
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,440
Enter from here and go through a stone door, keep walking in

465
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,710
and it'll be the tombstone of Royal Father.

466
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,370
- Let's go.
- Sister,

467
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,470
tell Royal Father on my behalf,

468
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,400
that I miss him very much.

469
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,050
Resting place of Prince of Chi Clan, Zhu Yan.

470
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,840
Crown Prince and Priest Shiying's tomb.

471
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,240
I never thought

472
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,470
I would see you here.

473
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,690
Su Mo, did you know Zhu Yan?

474
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,290
She was one of my older sisters.

475
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,440
When Su Nuo and I first met her two centuries ago,

476
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,230
she was a princess of the Kongsang Chi Clan.

477
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,940
Help me!

478
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,390
Starting from today, you two can follow me.

479
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,400
Older Sister Zhu Yan! A'Nuo, A'Nuo...

480
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,080
What's wrong? Don't panic. Take your time to speak.

481
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,660
- A'Nuo's been injured. Hurry and save him.
- Where is he? Take me there.

482
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,070
It's all my fault.

483
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,460
When that big red bird was biting,

484
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,210
if A'Nuo hadn't pushed me aside,

485
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,370
he wouldn't have been bitten.

486
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,810
It's my fault.

487
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,010
The big red bird that you mentioned, did it have nine heads

488
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,740
and wings on each head? Right?

489
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,960
Yes. When it flew towards me, it seemed like it wanted to eat me.

490
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,730
Older Sister Zhu Yan, why is A'Nuo still unconscious?

491
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,360
A child that's injured by an ancient spirit beast

492
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,770
can't be saved.

493
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,170
How can this be!

494
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,650
A'Nuo won't die.

495
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,610
Older Sister Zhu Yan, please hurry and save him!

496
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,850
The magic power of the ancient beast is too strong.

497
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,650
My magic power can't bring him back to life.

498
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,330
- I don't believe it.
- Su Mo...

499
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,890
A'Nuo won't die.

500
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,090
By the time we had returned,

501
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,150
Su Nuo had already stopped breathing.

502
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,490
Then Su Nuo...

503
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,270
He has already been gone for a hundred years.

504
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,940
I'm the one who gave him his name.

505
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,420
When we first met Zhu Yan,

506
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,550
we didn't have any names.

507
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,770
Seeing that A'Nuo was very tan,

508
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,820
she named him Little Black.

509
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,330
But I wanted to call him A'Nuo

510
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,640
because he was my lifelong promise of commitment to my mother.

511
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,080
Unfortunately, I still broke that promise.

512
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,840
You were too young then.

513
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,300
Many things were beyond your control.

514
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,230
There are too many things that are beyond my control.

515
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,610
I hate that feeling the most.

516
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,880
Don't blame yourself.

517
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,750
By the way, did Zhu Yan

518
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,890
teach you the spells of Kongsang?

519
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,870
Although it was a game to humor a child,

520
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:02,980
it was also considered a skill to make a living.

521
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,570
From then on, I also relied on it

522
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,760
to make a living.

523
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,050
[Tombstone of Prince Bai]

524
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,820
Bai Ying is not a filial daughter

525
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,120
and ashamed of Royal Father's trust in me. I'm here to plead guilty.

526
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:23,450
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

527
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,880
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

528
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,420
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

529
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:37,230
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

530
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,700
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

531
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,310
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

532
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:51,250
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

533
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,770
♫ We've met several times ♫

534
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,110
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

535
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:05,140
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

536
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,680
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

537
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,120
♫ You live in there ♫

538
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:18,260
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

539
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,160
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

540
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,110
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

541
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,040
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

542
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,650
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

543
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,010
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

544
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,490
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

545
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:45,990
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

546
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,030
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

547
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,050
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

548
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,010
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

549
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,530
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

550
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,830
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

551
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,890
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

552
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:20,000
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
