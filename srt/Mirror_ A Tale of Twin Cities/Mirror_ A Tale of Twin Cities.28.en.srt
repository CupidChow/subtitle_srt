00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,050
[Episode 28]

3
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,220
We meet again.

4
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,680
Don't get in my way.

5
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,570
Su Mo, I really underestimated you.

6
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,110
A hundred years ago, you were surrounded yet still managed to escape.

7
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,420
This little room was even easier for you.

8
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,130
We haven't seen each other for a hundred years, but you're still the same.

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,180
Do I disappoint you?

10
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm glad because now I can kill you myself.

11
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,910
Give it a try then.

12
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,970
Su Mo.

13
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,800
Another one who's come to die as well.

14
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,770
We're surrounded.

15
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,480
I didn't bring you here on purpose!

16
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,010
No, it's not your fault.

17
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,450
Qing Chen is the bait.

18
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,400
Capture them all and inform the general!

19
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,090
Yes!

20
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,180
Xi Jing, if we really do start fighting,

21
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,210
protect Na Sheng and get her out of here. Kongsang people won't hurt each other.

22
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,810
We don't have to fight.

23
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,900
Yes, Your Highness.

24
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,450
Na Sheng.

25
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,120
Fighters of the Qing Clan,

26
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,750
I am Qing Jun's maid, Li Zhu. Over the past hundred years,

27
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,560
although our Qing Clan has survived,

28
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,540
Cangliu has continually oppressed us.

29
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,050
Now they've come to our territory to make a scene. King Jiuyi's known for a long time,

30
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,400
but he still allows them to oppress us!

31
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,650
Whatever His Highness does, he's still the king of our Qing Clan.

32
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,890
How dare you make offensive remarks about him!

33
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,180
The King of Qing Clan?

34
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
I think none of you have realized

35
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,930
that he...

36
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,150
he's the real king of our Qing Clan.

37
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,270
That's right.

38
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,790
He's the real king of your Qing Clan.

39
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,030
Who is he?

40
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,670
He's the new Prince Qing Yuan, who stood up for Kongsang

41
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,300
and offered up himself a hundred years ago.

42
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,980
Didn't he offer up himself? Why is he still alive and standing here?

43
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,880
Exactly. Do you think if you just randomly point someone out

44
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,850
and call him His Highness Qing Yuan, I'll believe it?

45
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,010
Who exactly are you?

46
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,970
He's Crown Prince of Kongsang, Zhen Lan.

47
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,530
Impossible.

48
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,020
His Highness Zhen Lan died a hundred years ago.

49
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,700
He really is the Crown Prince, Zhen Lan.

50
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,450
Li Zhu! Don't be fooled by these people who came out of nowhere.

51
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,270
How can you prove it?

52
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,530
Su Mo, if you let me go today, I can give you the Six Directions Seal.

53
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,990
Do you know what I want?

54
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,020
I want you dead.

55
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,990
Yu Huan!

56
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,670
A'Ying, are you going to watch your uncle get killed by Su Mo?

57
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,340
You and I are from Kongsang after all. We're related by blood!

58
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,380
Do you even care about your blood family?

59
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,350
Now I get it, Bai Ying!

60
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,650
You asked him to look for the Six Directions Seal for you. You're taking advantage of his power.

61
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,230
How are you different from me back then?

62
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,510
This is a sacred relic.

63
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,300
Since ancient times only the Crown Prince of Kongsang can wear it.

64
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,890
Why is it in the hands of this woman then?

65
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,720
This is truly the Heavenly Ring. Why don't you believe us?

66
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,270
Legend has it that a barrier can only be broken by royal power.

67
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,090
If you can break it, then we'll believe you.

68
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,490
Fine! We'll do it then!

69
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,420
- Brother Crown Prince.
- Na Sheng!

70
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,910
I heard from King Jiuyi that this barrier is maintained by the power of the Six Directions Seal.

71
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,860
If we don't break the seal, we can't break the barrier.

72
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,170
The seal is still in Qing Chen's hands. This...

73
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,440
Li Zhu, don't help them trick us!

74
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,420
That's right. You're all a bunch of liars.

75
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,110
Who said that? I...

76
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,110
I just forgot the spell, that's all.

77
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,520
Brother Crown Prince, hurry and prove it to them.

78
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,100
Maybe you'll feel the power of Kongsang's ancestors.

79
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,270
General, I don't believe that you can't beat Su Mo who has only half of his power.

80
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,620
Kongsang ancestors,

81
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,240
give me power and save my people.

82
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,170
Please, Ancestors.

83
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,980
Six-Direction Seal!

84
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,930
Now that the Jiuyi barrier has been broken,

85
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:23,190
the land of Yunhuang is going to be turned upside down.

86
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,660
Breaking the barrier seems to have had something to do with the seal.

87
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,180
Now that you've regained your power,

88
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,460
His Highness should have his royal power as well.

89
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,340
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

90
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,130
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

91
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,100
I, Zhen Lan, will live up to the trust you've put in me.

92
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,390
Yu Huan, you need to save me.

93
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,570
If I die, how can you report back to Lord Zhi Zhe?

94
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm already trying my best to protect you.

95
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,930
But from the beginning, it seems Lord Zhi Zhe

96
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,460
was never expecting you to live through this.

97
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:47,670
When necessary, you can get rid of King Jiuyi.

98
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,730
Impossible. Without me, how could Lord Zhi Zhe have defeated Kongsang?

99
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,560
Cangliu has what they have today thanks to me, Prince Qing Chen!

100
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,400
Zhi Zhe... Zhi Zhe won't let me die. He won't.

101
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,750
Who exactly is Zhi Zhe? Why did you betray Kongsang?

102
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,360
If it wasn't for you, my father and Kongsang wouldn't have died.

103
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,630
Zhi Zhe... is the master of Cangliu.

104
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,730
The person in the black robe at the top of Jing Pagoda.

105
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,720
Even if you know who he is, what can you do about it?

106
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,490
You can't defeat him!

107
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,910
The demise of Kongsang was already fated 7,000 years ago.

108
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,930
You're all so short-sighted!

109
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,620
You can't see the past or the future.

110
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,060
You're the one who can't see the future.

111
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,200
I, Su Mo, never ask about the past.

112
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,390
Wherever I am...

113
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,690
is the future.

114
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,840
Just now, there was a flash of blue light over there.

115
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,510
Bai Ying and Su Mo should be there.

116
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,650
Xi Jing, take them down the mountain first.

117
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,850
- You're going to go by yourself?
- Yes.

118
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,620
The barrier is broken. Cangliu's people will come up soon to attack.

119
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,300
Protect Na Sheng, and lead them away.

120
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,480
How about this?

121
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,180
I'll have Qing Yuan escort Na Sheng down the mountain, and I'll go with you.

122
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,690
No need. The seal on my right leg has been lifted now.

123
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,580
I've recovered half of my strength.

124
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,320
Qing Yu's sun-blocking cloak is only effective for a short time.

125
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,710
Don't worry about me.

126
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,640
All right. Be careful.

127
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,970
You should have died 100 years ago.

128
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,210
You're so stupid.

129
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,960
You try so hard to help them.

130
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,920
Do you know...

131
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,980
what the price... of re-opening Wuse City is?

132
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,670
Qing Chen!

133
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,480
She'll turn into ash!

134
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,920
We cannot live under the sun.

135
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,490
When Wuse City is reopened,

136
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,420
we will...

137
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,950
Bai Ying, what does "turning into ash" mean?

138
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,530
Of course, she won't tell you.

139
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,610
Otherwise, you wouldn't fight so hard for her.

140
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,590
She's just like me, using you.

141
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,240
Here comes another one, Your Highness, the Crown Prince of Kongsang.

142
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,780
Su Mo, take a good look.

143
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,310
They are the ones partnering to lie to you,

144
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,530
to use you! In their hearts,

145
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,640
there are only the 100,000 people of Kongsang.

146
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,200
You are nothing.

147
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,870
What nonsense is this?

148
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,520
When Wuse City was opened the last time,

149
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,350
the six princes couldn't survive under the sun.

150
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,590
Then, when Wuse City is opened again,

151
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:50,400
the six princes will turn into ash. Would they not?

152
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,790
It's all recorded

153
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,360
on the Monument of Fallen Tears.

154
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,930
Bai Ying, is he telling the truth?

155
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,440
This is the price of re-opening Wuse City?

156
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,430
Fool.

157
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,710
This is the destiny of Kongsang and Quanxian.

158
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,290
You can't escape from it even if you try.

159
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,660
On the other hand, Your Highness,

160
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,780
you can sit back and become the beneficiary.

161
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,410
It was this way 100 years ago, and it will still be 100 years later.

162
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,420
Shut up!

163
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,420
Su Mo! Su Mo!

164
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,020
I was originally planning...

165
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,650
to tell you once all of this was finished.

166
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,090
After you were dead?

167
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,520
I originally... wanted to tell you sooner.

168
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,520
But you didn't say anything! Not even one word!

169
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,440
We've been through so much together.

170
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,260
Isn't this matter important enough to tell me?

171
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,420
In your heart, what am I really?

172
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,730
Why did you say those words to me when you were drunk?

173
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,250
Why did you give me hope?

174
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,340
You don't love me.

175
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,910
You're just using me!

176
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,390
Su Mo! You should know very well the kind of person A'Ying is.

177
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,930
Even if someone wants to use you, that person wouldn't be her!

178
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,820
Then it's you! You're using me!

179
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,540
No.

180
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,210
Su Mo, it's not true.

181
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,140
Crown Prince didn't know about this.

182
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,960
A'Ying.

183
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,420
When Wuse City opens again,

184
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,320
I can't change the fact that I'll turn to ash.

185
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,930
This is my fate.

186
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm sorry.

187
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,710
I want to be alone for awhile.

188
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,520
General Xi Jing, I'm still worried about His Highness.

189
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,230
We should go back to take a look.

190
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,720
No. His Highness wanted me to take you down the mountain.

191
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Na Sheng!

192
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,570
Yan Xi!

193
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,500
Yan Xi! Yan Xi. Yan Xi.

194
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,680
I missed you so much. I really—

195
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,730
This is still Jiuyi Mountain territory. You could attract the enemy.

196
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,410
Yan Xi, I really missed you.

197
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,850
I missed you all the time. I kept thinking every day that I wanted to see you sooner.

198
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,100
You've seen me now, right?

199
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,900
I promised you that I'd go down the mountain to meet you. Didn't I do it?

200
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,680
You still don't get it. She's touched. Understand?

201
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Is that so?

202
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,840
Don't you agree?

203
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,430
That's good.

204
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,760
Are we going back or going down the mountain?

205
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,840
I saw Fei Lian at the bottom of the mountain. He was probably deploying troops for reinforcements.

206
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,550
Oh, right! The Water Dispelling Pearl, Splitting Sword, Six Directions Seal.

207
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,230
Did you get all of them?

208
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,790
If you have them, it's best you hurry and leave now.

209
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,990
I want to go see Sister Bai Ying.

210
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,430
Brother Ice Cube also doesn't seem right today.

211
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,310
What's the matter with Young Master?

212
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,050
Crown Prince!

213
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,050
Your Highness, why are you by yourself?

214
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,570
Your Highness.

215
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,490
Your Highness, what's happened?

216
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,850
Qing Chen is dead.

217
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,520
Brother Crown Prince, where are Sister Bai Ying and Brother Ice Cube?

218
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,190
When Wuse City is reopened,

219
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,840
the six princes will turn into ash.

220
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,300
Is this true?

221
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,070
Tell me.

222
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Is this true?

223
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,300
What does that mean? What does that mean?

224
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,100
Uncle, what does Brother Crown Prince mean by turning into ash?

225
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
Say something, Uncle.

226
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
It means...

227
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,150
In order to save 100,000 people,

228
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,400
A'Ying, Hong Yuan, and the others have to re-open Wuse City,

229
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,200
and the price to re-open Wuse City

230
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,770
is that they will turn into ash;

231
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,800
never to be resurrected.

232
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,540
Why didn't you tell me?

233
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,160
All of you knew. I'm the only one who didn't know.

234
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,150
Why?

235
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
Princess Bai didn't want us to say.

236
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,300
Then-Then, let's not get rid of the seals.

237
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,800
If everyone has to die to get rid of the seals,

238
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,500
what's the point of getting rid of the seals?

239
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,350
We sacrificed half of our lives,

240
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,700
living in the damp and cold Wuse City. The meaning...

241
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,400
is to free Kongsang from the seals.

242
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We've already been through the Life and Death Pavilion.

243
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This time, it won't just be Sister Bai Ying.

244
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
All of you will die!

245
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
In order to not let the sacrifice become meaningless,

246
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,000
we have to keep going forward.

247
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,800
Perhaps...

248
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600
this is what the worth of the sacrifice is.

249
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,000
Your Highness, we didn't conceal it from you on purpose.

250
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
- But...
- Everything that's happening now...

251
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,060
started because of me.

252
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,100
A hundred years ago,

253
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,200
if I could have used the Power of Heaven sooner,

254
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
this wouldn't be the result now.

255
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
And right now...

256
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
Your Highness.

257
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,100
Your Highness, Cangliu's Fei Lian is about to enter the mountain.

258
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,700
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

259
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,800
You've been waiting for me here.

260
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,600
Our leader told us to wait here.

261
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,800
She said, when the barrier was opened, Young Master would take us home.

262
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
That's right. I'll take you home.

263
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,500
This is great! We can finally go home after waiting for 7,000 years.

264
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,200
But I heard the leader say that, to take us back

265
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
would cost a lot of Young Master's strength.

266
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,220
It doesn't cost much.

267
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,980
To have all of you go back

268
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,200
is your leader's dearest wish. It's also my wish as the Emperor of the Sea.

269
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
Thank you, Young Master.

270
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,300
Oh, right! Where is the leader? Where did she go?

271
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,400
Did she already go back?

272
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
She left first.

273
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,200
She said that you'll be going back by yourself this time.

274
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,200
But I'm not familiar with the route. I need to hold her hand.

275
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,400
She's waiting for you up ahead.

276
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Take the children away.

277
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Let them turn into clouds and rain and rise into the sky

278
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,000
and then fall into the Biluo Sea.

279
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,200
I don't want to disappear. I want to live longer.

280
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,400
Because...

281
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,300
I want to be with you forever.

282
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,000
If I disappear someday

283
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,100
and you can't find me anymore,

284
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,200
don't be sad. I...

285
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,870
So you did want to tell me.

286
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,200
I just didn't understand your implied meaning.

287
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Bai Ying.

288
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,900
I was too greedy.

289
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,800
I had been craving the care and warmth you gave me.

290
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
Bit by bit,

291
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,900
it slowly wore off my courage to tell you the truth.

292
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,100
When the Land-Sea Alliance was created,

293
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,000
I actually complained that you didn't tell me anything and concealed everything from me.

294
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,390
But now,

295
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,570
I'm the one who's done wrong.

296
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,440
Yu Huan! Yu Huan!

297
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Yu Huan.

298
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Su Mo!

299
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,400
You're awake? Get up.

300
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,200
Anyone who didn't know probably thought you were calling your dream lover.

301
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,400
Here, drink the medicine.

302
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,800
Your fever is finally gone.

303
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
You didn't even realize you were feverish, and even collapsed.

304
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,400
Thanks. I owe you a pot of aged wine.

305
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,000
You owe me countless pots now.

306
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,500
Where is Su Mo? Any news on them?

307
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,600
I took your command token and deployed Banbu City's troops to search the mountain.

308
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,000
If they have any news, they'll notify us immediately.

309
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Su Mo and Zhen Lan pulled up the Splitting Sword.

310
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
They also broke the barrier on Jiuyi Mountain.

311
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Originally, we had Prince Qing and the Qing Clan's soldiers to help.

312
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,300
But now, they've either died or defected.

313
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,800
How about this? You rest here, and I'll go to Jiuyi Mountain.

314
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,600
They should still be at Jiuyi Mountain. Maybe I can block them in time.

315
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
- You are no match for Su Mo.
- Hey!

316
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,000
You don't believe me?

317
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm still a Cangliu General!

318
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,200
Just listen to me and rest well here. Wait for my good news.

319
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,400
It's not a bad idea to let Fei Lian go first and engage them for a bit.

320
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,600
It won't work to fight them face to face. I need to have a scheme.

321
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,770
Xiang, Fei Lian and Yu Huan have not been seen at the military camp recently. Where did they go?

322
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Jiuyi's barrier has been broken. Fei Lian wants you to go to Banbu City as reinforcement.

323
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,800
Then not having seen Yu Huan today,

324
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,400
is he also in Banbu City?

325
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
I heard that it was a secret mission.

326
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll go with you then.

327
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Why are you going?

328
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,640
Fei Lian sent you a message. He must have run into trouble.

329
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,740
Xiao, what are you saying?

330
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,100
It's good if they die there.

331
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,600
If Cangliu loses two generals, would that be better for Quanxian?

332
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,700
It means Yu Huan and Fei Lian won't bother Young Master later.

333
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,960
You want to go as reinforcement, but for whom?

334
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Is it him...

335
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
How is that possible?

336
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,900
I naturally worry about Young Master's safety.

337
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,600
I consider you a younger sister, that's why I'm reminding you.

338
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,200
How many of our compatriots have been tortured by Cangliu, with mind-control techniques?

339
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,000
How many of our compatriots have become Cangliu people's playthings?

340
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,200
Of course, I know.

341
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,400
Every Cangliu sword is aimed at us.

342
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Then, why do you...

343
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,400
Xiao.

344
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,600
Yu Huan and Fei Lian may be patriotic and loyal.

345
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,300
Perhaps they would even save us.

346
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
But ultimately what they do is for Cangliu.

347
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,100
They're just using us and our skills.

348
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,820
I will suppress this matter, and I won't go to reinforce them.

349
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Yu Huan and Fei Lian, two generals without troops,

350
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,600
are just abandoned chess pieces in the royal court's conflict.

351
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,100
You should consider going carefully.

352
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
I understand.

353
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
Don't disappoint me.

354
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,900
Crown Prince Zhen Lan, are you certain the Young Master and the others went this way yesterday?

355
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,630
Crown Prince.

356
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,120
My apologies.

357
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,690
They...

358
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,050
really went this way.

359
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,770
Crown Prince.

360
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,370
You didn't close your eyes the whole of last night?

361
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,910
I really couldn't sleep.

362
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:19,470
Miss Li Zhu, do you know where they could be headed?

363
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,470
We're at the back of the mountain. They could go to any peak.

364
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,510
Or even climb down the mountain. That's really...

365
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,500
Your hair...

366
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,390
Do not panic everyone.

367
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,950
It should be our Qing Clan guards.

368
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,110
Miss Li Zhu, something's happened!

369
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,980
- We found the King of Qing dead in the main hall.
- What?

370
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,000
Cangliu's troops have already gone up the mountain, there is no one to command Qing Clan's army.

371
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,860
Your Highness, please give your orders.

372
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,530
Your Highness.

373
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,210
Your Highness!

374
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,680
Qing Chen and Qing Jun are both dead.

375
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,590
The soldiers of the Qing Clan have already pledged allegiance to Kongsang.

376
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,300
- Qing Yuan.
- Your Highness.

377
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,720
The King of Jiuyi has died, do you want to claim back your territory?

378
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,650
- My territory?
- Yes.

379
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,570
This Jiuyi Mountain belonged to the Qing Clan, to begin with.

380
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,620
And you are Prince Qing.

381
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,490
Even though you were born in Jing City

382
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,420
and have never been here before,

383
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,970
but 100 years ago, to open Wuse City,

384
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,450
you recklessly became Prince Qing.

385
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,140
Today, if you want,

386
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,520
you can take over Jiuyi as Prince Qing.

387
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,040
Of course, it's easy to recover Jiuyi,

388
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,300
but it won't be easy to lead this place.

389
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,990
If you don't want to...

390
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,110
Since I decided to follow Your Highness

391
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:00,660
and to sacrifice everything for Kongsang, I haven't cared about the throne and feud since long ago.

392
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,490
Since Your Highness has said so, I, Qing Yuan, will lay my life down for you.

393
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,430
I am willing to remain in Jiuyi for the rest of my life,

394
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,910
to worship our ancestors and pray for Kongsang.

395
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,350
It's only that right now, you still can't go about freely under the sun.

396
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,910
Or you could stay in the tomb of the Heavenly King.

397
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,630
That completely dark place.

398
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,760
It's a solution.

399
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,910
Qing Yuan, come here.

400
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,120
I'm using my imperial power to fortify your cape

401
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,180
and extended its period of effectiveness.

402
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,720
Thank you Your Highness for your concern.

403
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,590
While I stay here in Jiuyi, I will ensure everything is done well and been taken care of.

404
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,480
No matter what future orders Your Highness has,

405
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,860
the forces here will be at your command.

406
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,490
All right.

407
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,120
There's one more thing still.

408
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,070
Starting tomorrow, all the rules that oppress the Quanxian will be abolished in Jiuyi Province.

409
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,110
From now on, selling

410
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,830
or forcing merpeople to do hard labor is prohibited.

411
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,580
All the merpeople will regain their complete freedom in Jiuyi Province.

412
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,630
Miss Li Zhu.

413
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,350
You are free.

414
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,890
Leave Jiuyi and go wherever you want to go.

415
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

416
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,780
I am...

417
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,410
willing to stay here to assist the new King of Jiuyi.

418
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,120
Li Zhui, you...

419
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,220
I already don't have much time left.

420
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,320
Now that I have the freedom to choose,

421
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,580
I am... willing to follow Prince Qing.

422
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,030
Good. Come.

423
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,490
Let this place...

424
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,370
become the first safe place

425
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,750
after the Land-Sea Alliance.

426
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,150
- Qing Yuan.
- Your Highness.

427
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,370
I bid you farewell.

428
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,140
Take care.

429
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,720
I, Qian Yuan, bid farewell to Your Highness.

430
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,360
I, Li Zhu, bid farewell to Your Highness.

431
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,650
Let's go.

432
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,670
Your Highness, you must have planned this early on, that's why you had Qing Yuan come here. Right?

433
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,920
He should...

434
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,850
be taking back what originally belonged to his Qing Clan.

435
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,530
Look at how young he is.

436
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:44,680
He's never owned anything, but he will have to turn into ash.

437
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,740
Letting him stay, is to also fulfill him.

438
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,140
In this one lifetime, to have at least loved once.

446

Thank you.

447
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,040
It's what I should do.

448
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,010
I don't use maidservants.

449
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,400
You don't need to serve me.

450
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,310
Come.

451
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,620

453
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,610
For half of your life, you've been trying to regain your freedom

454
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,440
to leave Jiuyi.

455
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,620
I'm afraid it's unfair for you to stay.

456
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,020
I'm already half dead.

457
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,330
I cannot be in the sun.

458
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,010
Perhaps... I can't even take a stroll in the forest with you.

459
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,200
Nor can I travel the mountains and rivers with you.

Your Highness.

462
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,770
The freedom that I seek

463
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,720
is not about where I am,

464
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,180
but rather where my heart is.

465
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,630
In my whole lifetime,

466
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,280
this is the first time I can choose for myself.

467
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,490
I only have the lifetime of half a lamp.

468
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,330
But I'm willing to be with one person.

469
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,070
My mother gave this to me.

470
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,150
I want to give it to you.

471
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,930

♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

483
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,620
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

484
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,120
♫ You live in there ♫

485
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:31,230
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

486
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,150
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

487
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,090
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

488
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,050
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

489
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,630
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

490
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,980
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

491
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,450
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

492
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:59,020
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

493
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,990
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

494
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,950
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

495
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,930
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

496
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,380
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

497
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,780
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

498
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,920
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

499
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:31,450
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
