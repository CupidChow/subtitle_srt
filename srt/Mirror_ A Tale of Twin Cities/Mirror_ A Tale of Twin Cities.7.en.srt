[Episode 7]

3
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,040
Can you now tell me, why is the Heavenly Ring on your finger?

4
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,610
I didn't expect to see a Heavenly Temple in this wilderness.

5
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,880
Let's go in and take a break.

6
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,670
Trying to escape?

7
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,080
You just mentioned Heavenly Ring. What Heavenly Ring?

8
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,850
I found this thing on Snow Mountain.

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,600
Also, I don't know what happened. It just ended up on my finger.

10
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,150
Also, no matter what I do, I can't take it off. How would I know what it was.

11
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,950
Since you don't know, why did you use it to make me help you?

12
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,900
Su Mo?

13
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,430
Who's there?

14
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,200
General!

15
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,120
General, news came that two people crossed over into Tianque.

16
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
They've escaped.

17
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,560
One was a merperson dressed in blue clothes. The other was a girl who seemed to be from the Central Plains.

18
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,480
Bai Ying?

19
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,930
Bai Ying? You're Bai Ying?

20
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,270
- One night, when Brother Ice Cube was dreaming, he—
- Na Sheng.

21
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,220
Quickly tell me why the Heavenly Ring is on your finger.

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,680
Why is the Heavenly Ring on your finger?

23
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,940
Has the seal been broken?

24
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,260
I have no idea. I picked this up in a cave on Tianque Snow Mountain.

25
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,430
Why was the ring on Snow Mountain?

26
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,020
A hundred years ago, Kongsang fell to the enemy.

27
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,360
Zhen Lan's spiritual consciousness was sealed.

28
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,550
He's been in a deep sleep for a hundred years already.

29
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,850
General, they should be inside there.

30
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,260
I'm General Yu Huan from Cangliu,

31
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,130
with orders to arrest the suspects.

32
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,110
Those in the temple, open the door immediately.

33
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
Otherwise, I'll burn this temple down!

34
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,260
What's going on? Are they looking for you?

35
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,420
Is this related to the ring?

36
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,060
It's a long story.

37
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,750
I didn't want to wear this ring either.

38
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,530
Anyway, after I crossed into Tianque,

39
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,420
there have been so many people after me, trying to kill me.

40
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,850
I'm innocent.

41
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,240
You crossed into Tianque with this ring on your finger?

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,410
You're the one I'm looking for!

43
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,190
Take her and leave first.

44
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,120
I can go against them.

45
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,400
You must listen to her.

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,020
If you cause her harm, I'll take your life.

47
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,690
You crossed into Tianque.

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
Are there others in there?

49
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,120
Immortal Brother, quickly come out.

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,030
Hurry and help me.

51
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,680
A'Ying.

52
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,790
Immortal Brother, you're finally here.

53
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,140
You know her, too?

54
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,120
What's your relationship with her?

55
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,430
Her Earth Ring and my Heavenly Ring are a pair.

56
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,500
You two are together?

57
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,720
I...

58
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,740
Na Sheng.

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,720
How is it out there?

60
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,950
Kill him.

61
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,590
Yes!

62
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,740
He's using the techniques of the Holy Sword Sect.

63
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,730
This man is quite formidable.

64
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,240
Let me get you somewhere safe first. Hide the ring.

65
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,240
No. She can't see the daylight.

66
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,660
Follow me.

67
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,860
Older Sister Bai Ying.

68
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,160
Hurry, go!

69
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,670
Older Sister Bai Ying.

70
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,340
Na Sheng, take A'Ying into the forest!

71
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,970
Quickly.

72
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,460
- I can't, I can't.
- Hang in there.

73
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,710
Older sister, let's take a break. Take a break.

74
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,490
My goodness, I'm so tired.

75
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,610
Immortal Brother.

76
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,080
The power in the ring is depleting. I'm going to disappear.

77
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,530
- Hurry, tell...
- Who are you talking to?

78
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,630
A'Ying that I...

79
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,640
Hurry up! Hurry up!

80
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,370
There's an Immortal Brother in this ring.

81
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,290
He's been with me for the past two days.

82
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,810
He taught me how to take the hidden paths and dodge those who were pursuing me.

83
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,690
But he's just a shadow. No one can see or hear him.

84
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm the only one who can see him.

85
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,010
It's His Highness, right? Where is he?

86
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,720
Over there.

87
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,110
Na Sheng, give me your hand.

88
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,720
What are you going to do?

89
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,180
Don't be afraid.

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
Do it with me.

91
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,750
Keep going.

92
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,500
Ancestors of Kongsang, please use the power of Heaven and Earth

93
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,040
to awaken His Highness who's been in a deep sleep for a hundred years. May heaven bless Kongsang.

94
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,510
What... What is this radiant light?

95
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,090
Could it be the Heavenly and Earth Rings?

96
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,800
Did Princess Bai find the Heavenly Ring?

97
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,710
The Heavenly Ring has reappeared.

98
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,960
The brightest star has manifested itself.

99
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,500
The Heavenly Ring which has been missing for a hundred years has reappeared.

100
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,660
The brightest star which had been dimmed for a hundred years has started to shine again.

101
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,820
Relay this order.

102
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,270
We must get the Heavenly Ring back no matter what.

103
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,740
Yes.

104
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,690
I've finally awakened.

105
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,110
Are you really Immortal Brother?

106
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,640
You look exactly like your shadow!

107
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,680
Of course, it's the same!

108
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,570
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

109
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,930
Your Highness, you've finally awakened.

110
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,980
We didn't wait in vain these one hundred years.

111
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,820
A'Ying, it's been tough on you these hundred years.

112
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,470
Rest here with Na Sheng.

113
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,960
The five princes should soon be on their way here.

114
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,690
I'm going to check on Su Mo.

115
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,290
He has saved me many times before.

116
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,280
All right. Go on.

117
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,970
A'Ying,

118
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,540
be... careful of the sunlight.

119
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,090
It's okay. It's getting dark soon.

120
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,450
No. W-What I meant is that, you should resolve it as quickly as possible.

121
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,510
After all, this Crown Prince who has just awakened is waiting for you.

122
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,530
You're a crown prince?

123
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,490
Yes.

124
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,410
I didn't expect him to have become so powerful.

125
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,110
Is this really the Holy Sword Sect's Sword of Light?

126
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,410
Is she senior sister?

127
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,340
Retreat.

128
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,260
Crown Prince Brother, did you really sleep for a hundred years?

129
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,100
Just about.

130
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,320
The Sister Bai Ying that we just saw, is she the one

131
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,720
who traveled all over Yunhuang and told you all sorts of stories?

132
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,920
Yes. That's her.

133
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,970
What relationship do you two have exactly?

134
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,890
We...

135
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,790
A hundred years ago,

136
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,580
I was the crown prince and she was the crown princess.

137
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,100
However, we didn't get married, so...

138
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,340
Oh, so she isn't your wife yet.

139
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,640
No, wait! I remember Su Mo and Sister Bai Ying also seemed to know each other.

140
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,730
Are they a couple?

141
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,030
Are they?

142
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,700
I won't ask anymore. Won't ask anymore.

143
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,180
Brother Crown Prince, where have you been sleeping for these past hundred years?

144
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,020
Wuse City.

145
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,120
Where's Wuse City?

146
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,910
Wuse City is an underwater city.

147
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,750
It's a mystical place.

148
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,250
Inside, sleeps a hundred thousand people.

149
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,740
A hundred thousand people?

150
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,410
A hundred years ago, Cangliu invaded Kongsang.

151
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,930
In order to avoid the massacre,

152
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,290
the six princes opened Wuse City.

153
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,270
Attack!

154
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
Cangliu has smashed into our city. We have no power to resist them.

155
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,250
Our people are being massacred.

156
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,930
Crown Prince hasn't regained the power of the emperor.

157
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,670
What should we do?

158
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,860
Open Wuse City.

159
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:45,220
This is the only way to preserve the lives of the Kongsang people in Jing City.

160
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,030
Wuse City, open!

161
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,950
When Wuse City was opened,

162
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,560
the Kongsang people being massacred in Jing City vanished instantly.

163
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,860
All of Yunhuang shook.

164
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,270
Countless ice spheres protecting the people fell into Jing Lake.

165
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,690
Since then, 100,000 Kongsang people fell into a deep sleep

166
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,560
and became the residents of Wuse City.

167
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,990
That's why the six princes can never see the sun again.

168
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,730
So that's why Sister Bai Ying's skin will smoke when she's in the sunlight.

169
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,560
Cangliu people are too horrible!

170
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,450
That's right. In order for the Kongsang people to see the sun again,

171
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,730
we can only rely on the powers of Heaven and Earth now.

172
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,770
Now we've already found the Heavenly Ring.

173
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,490
That's right.

174
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,650
All thanks to you.

175
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,020
However,

176
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,850
in the battle a hundred years ago,

177
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,310
my powers have been sealed throughout Yunhuang.

178
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,290
I may have been awakened,

179
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,490
but only this right hand's gained some power back.

180
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,750
I have very little ability to do anything right now.

181
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,750
So, we still need you

182
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,300
to rely on the Heavenly Ring to guide us to find the other seals.

183
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,460
Are you willing to help us?

184
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,230
Brother Crown Prince, I'm sorry.

185
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,820
Although the old grandpa in the village told me I must repay kindness

186
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,310
and you did save me on Snow Mountain,

187
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,890
you also led the way for me.

188
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,710
I should repay the favor.

189
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,410
However, breaking seals is too heavy of a burden for me.

190
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,890
I don't know if I have the ability to do it...

191
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,540
Na Sheng,

192
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,030
I know that this matter really is difficult for you.

193
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,970
Actually...

194
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,760
my greatest wish was to come to Yunhuang to find the legendary peaceful home.

195
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,140
When I was in the Central Plains, I had no family.

196
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,750
I didn't want to lead a life of hiding and wandering,

197
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,180
one of homelessness and being miserable.

198
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,870
H-However, once I go with you to break seals,

199
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,120
a-after all, I'm just a normal person who doesn't understand anything at all...

200
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,030
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- There's no need to apologize.

201
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,060
How about this? Think about it some more.

202
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,340
During this time,

203
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,330
let's maintain contact so that we can at least protect you

204
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,530
and take you to the place you want to go.

205
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,050
Let's see if it's over there.

206
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,390
Be careful.

207
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,140
There!

208
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,550
Greetings, Your Highness.

209
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,040
Hurry. Hurry and get up.

210
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,370
Your Highness, I've waited for a hundred years
 [Xuan Yu - Prince Xuan of Kongsang ]

211
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,610
and finally you're awake.
 [Xuan Yu - Prince Xuan of Kongsang ]

212
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,090
That's right. Also, our search for the Heavenly Ring hasn't been in vain.
[Zi Mang - Kongsang Prince Zi]

213
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,630
Prince Zi and Prince Xuan, I've made you worry.

214
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,900
- Your Highness the Crown Prince.
- Your Highness the Crown Prince.

215
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,620
Qing Yuan, you've matured a lot.

216
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,030
Lan Xia, you've grown taller, too.

217
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,690
Your Highness,

218
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,710
you must be joking. How have they changed that much?

219
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,970
Princess Chi, you're still the same. You always tell the truth to expose me.

220
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,020
By the way,

221
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,750
where's A'Ying, Your Highness?

222
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,760
Everyone, let me introduce a young lady to you all.

223
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,990
This young lady is from the Central Plains and is named Na Sheng.

224
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,810
The Heavenly Ring is with her now so everyone needs to protect her.

225
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,870
I'm going to go look for A'Ying, okay?

226
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,630
Why did His Highness leave?

227
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,140
Since you've decided to come back,

228
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,980
why would you leave again?

229
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,340
If it was anyone else, I would've still come back.

230
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,340
Am I just anybody to you?

231
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,770
Yes.

232
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,450
I know you're concerned about me.

233
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,560
The Heavenly Ring has been on Tianque Snow Mountain this whole time.

234
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,060
Zhen Lan has been asleep for a hundred years.

235
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,940
You can't possibly be Kongsang's crown princess.

236
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,760
If you were the crown princess,

237
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,630
you wouldn't have dared answered yes.

238
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,820
A hundred years' time has changed too many things.

239
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,200
Whether it is or not, is no longer important.

240
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,430
That's right.

241
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,740
A hundred years ago, that moment you jumped off Jing Pagoda,

242
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,600
many things changed.

243
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,060
However, on this day on Tianque Snow Mountain, we've gone around and run into each other several times.

244
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,770
Isn't that important when it comes to us?

245
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,820
Just forget all of that.

246
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,920
Everything that happened a hundred years ago, to me, was only a mistake.

247
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,610
The current me just wants to make up for that mistake.

248
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,480
Make up?

249
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,120
How are you going to make it up?

250
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,910
Make it up by forgetting me?

251
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,540
What I've been waiting for a hundred years,

252
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,170
is to be able to awaken the 100,000 Kongsang people in Wuse City.

253
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,610
Have you thought about me during these past hundred years?

254
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,810
I thought that if I had never met you,

255
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,720
this entire tragedy wouldn't have happened.

256
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,250
For these hundred years, I've never missed you.

257
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,300
I've never hoped you'd appear before me.

258
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,360
I've never thought...

259
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,770
that I would see you again.

260
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,910
I don't believe you.

261
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,910
You're lying.

262
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,640
♫ Cool my cheeks ♫

263
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,450
♫ Yet I cannot bear to wipe them away ♫

264
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:31,230
♫ Somehow, this intoxicated me is silently worried ♫

265
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,560
♫ I once walked over waves to borrow a bit of starlight ♫

266
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,420
♫ Yet, no matter what I do, I cannot see you clearly ♫

267
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,230
♫ I thought that closing my eyes would make my heart clear ♫

268
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,970
♫ Yet I'm just lost in a reverie ♫

269
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,820
♫ All beginnings comes at the expense of having endings ♫

270
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,690
♫ However, love makes even breathing so difficult to do ♫

271
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,990
♫ So let love be silent ♫

272
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,910
♫ Help each other expand our horizons ♫

273
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,450
A'Ying.

274
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,330
Let's go.

275
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,940
Aren't you tired?

276
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,590
We always do things at night.

277
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,850
Why aren't they back yet?

278
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,180
They should be fine, right?

279
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,310
They're here. They're here.

280
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,610
Older Sister Bai Ying!

281
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,150
A'Ying, since you're back,

282
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,230
let's return to Wuse City together.

283
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,350
Do I need to go to Wuse City, too?

284
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,170
Let's see if I can remove this ring.

285
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,260
W-Why can't I remove it?

286
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,770
Isn't this ring yours?

287
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,130
You're awake. Why doesn't it come off?

288
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,750
Na Sheng, I can't do anything either.

289
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,900
This Heavenly Ring has its own will.

290
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,070
Crown Prince Brother, you must be joking. Right?

291
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,900
Ever since I came to Yunhuang, I've been so unlucky.

292
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,860
I even almost lost my life!

293
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,840
Hurry and take the ring back.

294
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,530
Lord Ring, I-I, Na Sheng,

295
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,560
I-I can't carry things in my hands, nor on my shoulders.

296
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,460
I-I even covet money and sensual desires.

297
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,860
I beg you, please hurry and leave.

298
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,060
Let me tell you! You're really mistaken about me.

299
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,960
Your owner is over there. Hurry and go back. Hurry and go back.

300
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,970
Na Sheng.

301
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,550
It's useless.

302
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,720
Then... what will work then?

303
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,370
In your Wuse City, is there anyone stronger than he is?

304
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,220
I can go back to Wuse City with you and take off the ring.

305
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,360
You can't go to Wuse City. You're not a person of Kongsang.

306
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,810
No, wait! This won't work and that won't work?

307
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,430
Na Sheng.

308
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,860
Don't panic. We will definitely keep you completely safe.

309
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,720
It's fine. It's fine. Forget about it.

310
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,400
Every time you say you'll protect me,

311
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,520
in the end, Su Mo is the one that fights them off.

312
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,180
Su Mo? Which Su Mo?

313
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,690
Can there be another Su Mo?

314
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,540
Isn't he the one who doesn't ever say anything

315
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,940
and exudes an aura from his whole body that causes people chills? That Su Mo.

316
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,370
But he really seems to have magical powers!

317
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,990
If he weren't at the Heavenly Temple just now,

318
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,670
Sister Bai Ying and I might not have been able to escape.

319
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,870
A'Ying, you've seen Su Mo?

320
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,140
A'Ying, did you go to see Su Mo just now?

321
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,580
Ridiculous!

322
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,140
- Prince Xuan, what are you doing?
- I'll kill him!

323
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,140
It's been a hundred years; he's actually not dead and continues to bother A'Ying!

324
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,630
That's right. We should've killed him a long time ago.

325
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,940
You all don't seem to be strong enough to beat him.

326
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,140
Prince Xuan. Prince Zi.

327
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,500
I've already seen Su Mo.

328
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,540
At the Tianque Heavenly Temple, he was the one who saved A'Ying and Na Sheng.

329
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,440
Your Highness, you're actually speaking up for Su Mo?

330
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,740
Prince Xuan, since His Highness already knows about this matter,

331
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,580
he must have thought about it already.

332
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,120
Let's follow His Highness's plan.

333
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,900
Your Highness, this old subject was impulsive.

334
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,060
A'Ying, don't get confused again.

335
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,080
Sister Bai Ying, they don't seem to like Su Mo.

336
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,760
Can you ask Su Mo to protect me?

337
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,020
It's useless if I ask him. He'll do it if you ask him though.

338
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,830
He's already left.

339
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,880
Then... what about me then?

340
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,890
I... Will I die here?

341
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,790
Na Sheng, come. Come here.

342
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,870
What do I do? Will people be chasing and trying to kill me the whole way?

343
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,210
Na Sheng, listen to me.

344
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,810
Follow this road and keep going straight ahead. That place is called Taoyuan Province.

345
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,860
It's a rich and prosperous place where visitors and merchants frequently come to do business.

346
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,970
See? The sun is about to rise.

347
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,890
Why don't you go there today and find a safe place to hide first?

348
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,300
I promise that I'll come and pick you up as soon as the sun sets.

349
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,610
I'm scared. I'm scared.

350
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,260
What are you scared about?

351
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,930
The Heavenly Ring has already acknowledged its master. It'll protect you.

352
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,830
Have you forgotten? When you were in danger on Tianque Snow Mountain,

353
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,680
it protected you. Right?

354
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,000
Will it still listen to me?

355
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,470
Will it listen to you?

356
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,020
Let me tell you a mantra to say when you need to use the ring.

357
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,640
Want to hear it?

358
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,240
This mantra is,

359
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,250
"Zhen Lan is the most, very most, handsome person in the world."

360
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,960
You-You-You're lying to me!

361
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,900
Enough then. I was kidding you.

362
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,330
I was teasing you to make you happy.

363
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,960
Either way, this ring is a divine object.

364
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,390
As long as you're careful, it'll be your protection charm.

365
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,870
All right then.

366
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,300
I'll be leaving then. You must remember to come and find me. I'm going. I'm going.

367
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,970
- Hurry and go then.
- I'm leaving now.

368
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,290
Has the Heavenly Ring really acknowledged a master?

369
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,050
But she's not from Kongsang.

370
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,080
The Heavenly Ring allowed her to put it on.

371
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,350
It will definitely protect her. All right, we should go too.

372
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,770
Let's hurry back and get some rest.

373
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,430
Then come back quickly to pick her up.

374
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,290
Yes.

375
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,380
A'Ying.

376
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,990
Let's go.

377
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,010
A hundred years ago, the moment I jumped from Jing Pagoda,

378
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,070
my heart already died and I never hoped that you'd reappear.

379
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,360
Whether it is or not, is no longer important.

380
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,590
Everything that happened a hundred years ago, to me, was only a mistake.

381
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,180
Just treat it as if you've never met me before.

382
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,030
Forget everything.

383
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,440
You're alive. That's already the best blessing from Heaven.

384
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,760
What more can I ask for?

385
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,190
Aunt Ru, I'm back.

386
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,530
I'll come meet up with everyone.

387
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,310
It's time for the Quanxian Tribe's suffering to end.

388
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,680
A'Ying, something seems wrong with you.

389
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,190
It's probably because my body is a bit weak from the sunburn.

390
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,030
Sit.

391
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,130
You ran into Su Mo? Did he save you and Na Sheng?

392
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,820
Yes.

393
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,480
But, Sister Hong Yuan, don't worry.

394
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,520
He and I... won't see each other again.

395
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,430
Since he saved you, why wouldn't he want to see you again?

396
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,920
I'm the one who doesn't want to see him.

397
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,660
I told him,

398
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,250
I've forgotten everything from 100 years ago.

399
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,530
That I never thought about him.

400
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,140
That I never missed him.

401
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,400
That I never... longed for him to reappear.

402
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,060
This old minister respectfully welcomes Your Highness the Crown Prince.

403
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,270
Your Highness.

404
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,210
High Priest, we haven't seen each other in a hundred years. Are you well?

405
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,180
I'm well. I'm well, Your Highness.

406
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,840
I prayed day and night, hoping you would return to us soon.

407
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,270
Today, it's really become a reality.

408
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,140
Your Highness, allow me to introduce the changes that have occurred in the last 100 years.

409
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,770
No need.

410
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,650
I know about everything here in Wuse City already.

411
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,700
Although I've been asleep this whole time,

412
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,400
but this ear of mine never took any time off.

413
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:39,870
Your Highness, w-where's your Heavenly Ring?

414
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,770
I gifted it to someone.

415
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,980
Gifted it to someone?

416
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm the crown prince. When someone took the effort to bring me back, I should show some appreciation. Right?

417
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,760
Your Highness, how could you gift such an important item to someone?

418
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,410
High Priest.

419
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,080
A hundred years have passed.

420
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,450
You're still so easily tricked!

421
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,860
The Heavenly Ring is in the hands of a Central Plains girl named Na Sheng.

422
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,840
She's not a Kongsang person so she can't enter Wuse City.

423
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,000
I've arranged to have her stay in Taoyuan Province.

424
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,010
Once we've rested and organized, we'll bring her back.

425
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,330
Then... why is the ring in her hands?

426
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,210
The Heavenly Ring recognized her as its master.

427
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,080
This Heavenly Ring is connected with my imperial energy and strength.

428
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,890
Since she can wear the Heavenly Ring,

429
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,950
it means, through the Heavenly Ring,

430
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,330
she can sense the power of the other seals.

431
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:39,400
Does that girl have the power to break the seals for us?

432
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,480
She's very weak and has no strength at all.

433
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,740
Therefore, we have to clear the path for her.

434
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:54,050
By the way, I saw Su Mo on Tianque.

435
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,690
That Su Mo?

436
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,980
Yes.

437
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,620
He seems different from who he was a hundred years ago.

438
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,210
I have a feeling we'll meet again in the future.

439
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,590
I've awakened!

440
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:21,000
It'll take time to figure out how to break the seals.

441
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,420
I also want to regain all that

442
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,290
was lost from 100 years ago.

443
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,010
[Nan Zhao - Cangliu Vice General]

444
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,870
I respectfully greet General Fei Lian.

445
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,660
You're Yu Huan's Vice General, Nan Zhao?

446
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,810
Exactly.

447
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:13,230
By the order of Master Peng, I'm transferring this prisoner to Jing City's prison.

448
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,560
How did Master Peng know about this prisoner?

449
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,610
Whatever Master Peng wants to know about, he'll know.

450
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:26,520
Thank you, General, for escorting the prisoner from Banbu City. Goodbye.

451
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,250
Wait!

452
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,530
It's best to wait for General Yu Huan to come and personally do the interrogation.

453
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,200
I've promised him that.

454
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,980
What happens later on, Master Peng has already made arrangements for.

455
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,620
I won't bother the General with them.

456
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,860
Take her away!

457
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,040
Were those who passed through Tianque killed?

458
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,330
It was my incompetence.

459
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,490
Go ahead and rise.

460
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,780
It wasted my efforts to find a special opportunity for you to return with military honors.

461
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,060
Who would have known that you would return having failed?

462
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:33,040
When we searched the mountain today, we ran into two highly skilled fighters.

463
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,180
There are people that you can't defeat?

464
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,000
One is a male merperson who was manipulating silk threads with his hands.

465
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,270
That thread was weird like a spirit snake.

466
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,430
My entire Cangliu small squadron wasn't a match for him.

467
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,210
There was also a woman.

468
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,330
It was my martial arts skills that were lacking.

469
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,540
It's a great mistake to miss anyone trying to enter over Tianque.

470
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,870
You must hurry and amend the mistake quickly.

471
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,070
The prisoner you caught in Banbu City is of high status.

472
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,510
Yes.

473
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:17,400
That person was ordered to assassinate me, highly skilled in martial arts.

474
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,040
She must have had some power in the Quanxian army.

475
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,310
I have a plan.

476
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,310
I'll certainly do my best and not disappoint you, My Lord.

477
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,340
You don't need to go on this mission.

478
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,710
Quickly tell me. Who's your accomplice?

479
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,790
I don't have any accomplices.

480
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,680
Still won't admit it?

481
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,410
Even if you don't admit it, it's useless.

482
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,250
Come in.

483
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,680
What are you doing?

484
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,890
Since you won't confess honestly,

485
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,810
we can only use the mind control technique then.

486
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,960
Right now, she's resisting really hard.

487
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,970
If we force the mind control technique, she'll lose her memory.

488
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,850
At worst, she'll lose her senses and go mad.

489
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,100
She's just a captured prisoner. So what?

490
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,650
Continue.

491
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,230
Lord Nan Zhao, here's an order from Master Peng.

492
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,530
Go back and report to Master Peng, I'll definitely carry it out.

493
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,950
Yes.

494
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,820
You can stop.

495
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,090
She keeps resisting. The mind-control technique didn't work.

496
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,810
It's not important anymore.

497
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,460
We can put her to good use in another way now.

498
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,970
Why does Xiao want to meet me in Jing City?

499
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,310
Xiao!

500
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,270
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

501
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,810
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

502
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,390
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

503
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:28,190
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

504
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,690
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

505
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,150
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

506
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:43,240
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

507
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,700
♫ We've met several times ♫

508
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,090
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

509
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:55,930
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

510
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,620
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

511
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,120
♫ You live in there ♫

512
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,220
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

513
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,120
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

514
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,060
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

515
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,990
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

516
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:24,570
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

517
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,990
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

518
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,450
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

519
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,890
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

520
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,930
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

521
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,870
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

522
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:48,900
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

523
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,390
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

524
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,860
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

525
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,840
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

526
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:09,370
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
