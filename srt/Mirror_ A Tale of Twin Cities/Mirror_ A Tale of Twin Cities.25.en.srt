00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,190
Later, Ru Yi found me.

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,690
At that time, Zhu Yan went to find her master, Master Shi Ying.

5
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,790
She couldn't take care of me. So, I left with Ru Yi.

6
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,740
I didn't expect...

7
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,060
to see it again here.

8
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,280
Su Mo, do you know

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,720
Zu Yan is a senior on my mother's side.

10
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,330
I didn't expect we would have connections to each other so early on.

11
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,480
I should thank her for helping you survive.

12
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,960
That means I should also thank her...

13
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,850
for having been able to meet you.

14
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,610
Looks like in the end, Zhu Yan and her true love, Shi Ying, were buried together.

15
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,810
Zhu Yan and Shi Ying?

16
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,820
That's a different story.

17
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,680
I really envy them, that they can be together,

18
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,890
death cannot part them.

[Tombstone of Prince Bai]

20
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,380
Bai Ying is not a filial daughter

21
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,370
and ashamed of Royal Father's trust in me.

22
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,730
I'm here to plead guilty.

23
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,190
I traveled all over Yunhuang in the past century,

24
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,110
this was the only place that I dared not to come.

25
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,250
I was ashamed to face Royal Father and our ancestors.

26
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,820
If it wasn't for my shame,

27
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,490
a hundred years ago, jumping off the Jing Pagoda,

28
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,290
and triggering a trap of falling into a deep sleep,

29
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,460
this tragedy wouldn't have happened.

30
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,990
Now that Crown Prince is awake, I must let Wuse City's

[Tombstone of Prince Bai]

33
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,260
A century ago, Cangliu was aggressively watching from outside

34
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
and Prince Qing Chen became a traitor.

35
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,930
There were many reasons for Cangliu to invade.

36
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,120
Don't alone blame yourself for what happened.

37
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,830
Now that the Land-Sea Alliance has formed, we'll work hard together

38
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,380
and definitely fulfill your wishes.

39
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,980
Senior Sister. Su Mo. We meet again.

40
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,070
You're still alive. Looks like that man dressed in black indeed helped you.

41
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,730
Su Mo, don't be reckless. He can see that

42
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,100
your magic power is at its weakest here. That's why he's come to attack us.

43
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,790
Yu Huan, Kongsang's Holy Sword Sect would never use such a wicked formation.

44
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,060
You are not worthy of Kongsang's Holy Sword Sect. You've disgraced Master.

45
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,780
Don't talk about me and Master. Block me and you will die.

46
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,560
Su Mo!

47
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,330
Don't waste your power. Fire and water are not compatible. This is the Fire Formation.

48
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,820
The more you resist, the more the fire will burn aggressively.

49
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,360
Sister, wake up.

50
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,800
Lin'er, save Su Mo.

51
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,700
I won't save him.

52
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,870
I want him to die.

53
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,960
What are you saying?

54
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
He's the main culprit for the disaster, Sister.

55
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,110
He caused the ruin and death of the Bai Clan,

56
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,580
and made it so that the Kongsang can't see the sun.

57
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,160
He caused me to become a bird spirit. Isn't all of this because of him?

58
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,560
Did you already know that Yu Huan was waiting here for us?

59
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,730
Yes, but he promised me that he definitely wouldn't hurt you.

60
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,670
When did you start to collaborate with Yu Huan?

61
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,700
Or so to say, you've already taken refuge with Cangliu. Right?

62
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,660
Yes, I took refuge with Cangliu a long time ago.

63
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,130
After becoming a bird spirit, I can't fly out from Jiuyi Mountain

64
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,760
and can't live a normal life either.

65
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,690
A few days ago, Cangliu sent me a message.

66
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,820
They promised me that as long as I kill Su Mo

67
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,550
they'll help me become human again.

68
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,360
You're negotiating with the enemy, they can't be trusted!

69
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,310
As long as I can become human again, so what if they kill Su Mo.

70
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,530
I've always hated him anyway!

71
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,000
Wait here for me. I'll think of a solution to turn you into a human again,

72
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,380
but stop helping Cangliu. Don't confuse yourself.

73
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,660
Don't go, Sister!

74
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,560
Su Mo!

75
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,360
Su Mo. Su Mo!

76
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,610
Su Mo, wake up! Wake up!

77
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,250
Su Mo!

78
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,780
Can you walk faster, Su Mo?

79
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,960
I'll hold you up if you lead me out.

80
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,520
We won't escape from this forest.

81
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,460
I won't give you up. Just hold on.

82
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,520
It's so hot. I feel like my entire body was burned.

83
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,300
Clear your mind.

84
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,700
Su Mo.

85
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,810
Hang on longer, I'll figure out how to save you.

86
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,980
Are you Tu Lou?

87
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,430
If you are discontented

88
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,540
or want to seek demands from me, you can.

89
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,080
However, Su Mo is severely hurt.

90
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,150
He's the Emperor of the Sea. You must save him!

91
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,210
What's the use of having an Emperor of the Sea if he doesn't care about us?

92
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,290
He didn't stop caring or abandon you despite everything.

93
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,180
When he's better, he can give you an explanation.

94
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,590
Do you care for him?

95
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,320
Yes. Can you save him?

96
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,380
If I can save him, but in exchange for your life?

97
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,220
If you can save him, all right then.

98
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,030
Follow me.

99
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,420
You really are useless.

100
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,940
I didn't expect that due to the deep affection between you and your older sister, I would become a victim.

101
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,470
If you didn't defy military orders to save her,

102
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,880
how could Su Mo have escaped?

103
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,730
You're the one who's useless and then blaming me for not being able to kill Su Mo.

104
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,000
Lord Zhi Zhe gave me an order

105
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,620
to assist you in killing Su Mo, not my older sister.

106
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,600
I already helped lure him here to make it convenient for you to capture him.

107
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,710
You're the useless one who can't even skill Su Mo.

108
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,710
Don't forget Zhi Zhe said that

109
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,420
you can become human only after Su Mo is eliminated.

110
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,430
Now that the mission has failed,

111
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,710
go back to Jiuyi Mountain and be that unwanted bird spirit.

112
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,570
In these 100 years, you've had your sister's best interest at heart.

113
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,880
But what about her? How many times has she visited you?

114
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,020
Between you and Su Mo, she chose him.

115
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,720
Shut up!

116
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,900
Am I wrong?

117
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,320
Su Mo, I want him dead!

118
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,610
Stop yelling! Stop yelling!

119
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,750
Who's yelling? Why don't I hear anything?

120
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,420
It's my punishment

121
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,050
for my Uncle Qing Chen's betrayal of Kongsong,

122
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,340
I rely on him to survive.

123
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,590
I absorbed the evil aura to become a bird spirit

124
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,750
and don't have the right to enter the Valley of the Ancestral Kings. They're chasing me out.

125
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,880
I'm leaving. You can live or die here.

126
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,050
I can't go back like this.

127
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,830
The Cold Water Pool in Jiuyi Mountain is the only place with clean water.

128
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,200
It can definitely subdue the fire injuries.

129
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,920
Really?

130
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,210
There's a barrier here. When Bai Wei first designed this,

131
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,350
it was to prevent the clean waters in Jiuyi Mountain from being infected.

132
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,480
But we drank the water of Jiuyi Mountain and can't enter.

133
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,380
Then I'll give it a try.

134
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,140
Perhaps, she's different from Bai Wei.

135
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
You'll be all right.

136
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,290
Hold on.

137
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,120
Prince Qing, it's me.

138
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,420
Left Commisioner, Yan Xi? What are you doing here?

139
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,330
I'm here as reinforcement. His Highness, Zhen Lan and the rest have entered the mountain already.

140
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,680
Yu Huan and Fei Lian of Cangliu have also rushed to Jiuyi Mountain.

141
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,240
Two of Cangliu's generals are here?

142
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,320
Yu Huan has gone into the mountain already. Fei Lian deployed the army to Jiuyi Mountain. He probably wants to surround it.

143
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,380
I believe they've obtained information and want to capture us.

144
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,160
I stole Fei Lian's command token. He can't deploy the military for the time being.

145
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,100
What will you do once I've gone in?

146
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,760
I'll keep watch here.

147
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,340
Even if the defending troops come, I can delay them too.

148
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,420
Thank you, Left Commissioner.

149
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,620
Bai Ying.

150
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,740
Bai Ying. Bai Ying!

151
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,210
It should be warmer over here.

152
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,350
You're awake.

153
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,620
As long as you're all right, then it's good.

154
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,590
Why are you so foolish? You could have just put me into the Cold Water Pool.

155
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,310
You could have slipped in there. I was worried about you.

156
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,310
Bai Ying, I'm a merman.

157
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,830
Sorry. I panicked and forgot all about that.

158
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,770
By the way, I talked about the various ways of knocking on the Sunlight Blocking Pearl

159
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,370
and the different meanings.

160
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,180
I thought of one now.

161
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,550
What is it?

162
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,730
Knocking four times mean "Don't push me away."

163
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,690
Don't come here.

164
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,910
It was a critical moment then. It was the only thing I could do.

165
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,820
Promise me.

166
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,670
All right.

167
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,360
After obtaining the Splitting Sword, I still want to find Lin'er.

168
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,630
No matter what, I don't want her to continue to live like this.

169
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,100
Moreover, I want to give Royal Father an explanation.

170
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,760
All right.

171
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,330
Where is she?

172
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,400
General, you've already searched my Fragrance Tavern

173
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,090
from top to bottom and didn't find her either.

174
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,050
How would I know the whereabouts of the person you're looking for?

175
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,720
I'm asking you one more time. Where is she?

176
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,350
General, aren't you just looking for someone?

177
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,490
Is there a need to flash your weapon?

178
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,510
If you want me to help with the search, I can do it immediately,

179
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,890
but I really don't know the person you mentioned.

180
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,800
So you're saying you don't know who comes to your tavern?

181
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Jiuyi Mountain is a place that isn't managed by anyone.

182
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,290
So, there's a mixture of good and bad people.

183
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,620
Outlaws who kill and rob come and go.

184
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,230
This... is a place of transit.

185
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,910
How could I know everyone?

186
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,470
General,

187
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,580
I really don't know who she is.

188
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,640
General,

189
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,030
if you still have the time, why not go out and find her?

190
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,360
I think she has probably already left.

191
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,190
If she comes back, I'll notify you immediately.

192
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,200
Pierce a hole in the leaf.

193
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,110
Resembles her, but it's not her.

194
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,650
The Emperor of the Sea is back. Ming Huo was right.

195
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,060
Emperor of the Sea, I've waited for you for 7,000 years.

196
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,760
You kept quiet when you were in the forest.

197
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,230
Was Bai Ying the reason?

198
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,090
That's right. I was afraid you'd be like my foolish older brother

199
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,500
and be hoodwinked by a woman from the Bai Clan again.

200
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,400
Foolish older brother?

201
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Since you're also merpeople,

202
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,000
why stay in Jiuyi Mountain in this form?

203
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This happened 7,000 years ago.

204
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,600
After Bai Wei died, Lang Gan sealed the Biluo Sea and brought us to Yunhuang.

205
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,300
In order to dissipate his anger, he imprisoned us here

206
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,400
to guard Bai Wei's cenotaph.

207
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,000
For 7,000 years, he sealed off the rain and sunshine.

208
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
How can we survive away from water?

209
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,000
In order to survive, we can only drink the weak water in Jiuyi Mountain,

210
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,400
and then turned into this form.

211
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Previously, we could only live underground.

212
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,200
But the barrier changed a hundred years ago.

213
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,000
That's how we have been able to live in the forest.

214
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,100
I heard that you eat living people.

215
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,400
We've never harmed innocent people!

216
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,900
Even if they were treasure robbers, we only threatened them and expelled them.

217
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,400
Then these must be rumors.

218
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,000
Why did you attack Bai Ying in the forest?

219
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,500
You also seemed dissatisfied with me. So why did you save me now?

220
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,000
She's different from Bai Wei.

221
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
She is true to you.

222
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,400
While you are also unlike my silly brother.

223
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
He was kind but too softhearted.

224
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You have the same gaze as my brother.

225
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,800
What do you mean by that?

226
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,700
You transformed for her sake, right?

227
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,200
Yes.

228
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,400
No wonder. We merpeople only love one person in our lifetime.

229
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,300
For 7,000 years, how many foolish lovers have there been

230
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,300
who pay the price because of a person from Kongsang.

231
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Lovers becoming a couple must be the most difficult thing to achieve in this world.

232
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,800
For both to know each other's hearts,

233
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,300
it's even more difficult.

234
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,200
My older brother used to tell me.

235
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,300
If you can be with the person you love,

236
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,800
even if it's just for a day, it's joyous.

237
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,200
But we don't have a future anymore.

238
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,800
No matter when our eyes are open or closed,

239
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,000
we cannot see the new day's sunshine.

240
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,700
But they're still young.

241
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,600
These Quanxian children

242
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,900
still have hope to see the new day's sun.

243
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,100
I'll definitely lead them to see the sun again

244
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,900
and return to the Biluo Sea.

245
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,300
Emperor of the Sea, remember your words.

246
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
I can only send you off to this point.

247
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,100
Go straight on this path and you'll reach the Monument of Fallen Tears.

248
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,700
Emperor of the Sea, you must get the Splitting Sword and save the dragon deity.

249
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,600
Let the dead souls ultimately find their peace.

250
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,800
Let those tearless eyes be able to close.

251
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
I swear to you as the Emperor of the Sea

252
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,100
and the spirit of the dragon deity.

253
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,800
Emperor of the Sea, we shall always follow you and be loyal.

254
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:08,100
Always follow and be loyal! Always follow and be loyal!

255
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,000
What's wrong?

256
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,950
Why are you suddenly not talking?

257
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,500
I was thinking of the Tu Luo and got emotional, that's all.

258
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,750
Bai Ying.

259
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,800
I can never guess what you are thinking.

260
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Sometimes you are happy, other times sad.

261
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,000
Sometimes...

262
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,700
Sadness and happiness, separation and reunion, these are normal human feelings.

263
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,500
You don't need to take painstaking effort to guess what I'm thinking.

264
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,000
But I want to know what will make you happy

265
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,600
and what will make you sad?

266
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
I hope that, between us,

267
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,400
there will only be reunion and never separation.

268
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,200
In this world, how can there only be reunion without separation?

269
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,400
If there were only reunions, Royal Father and Lin'er

270
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,500
wouldn't have left me, and there wouldn't have been...

271
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,000
I've already asked the Tu Luo to find Bai Lin.

272
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,600
I'm sure they'll find her.

273
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,400
Lin'er... she...

274
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,000
She's still your younger sister.

275
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,700
Thank you.

276
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
Bai Ying.

277
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,500
If I leave someday,

278
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,600
will you miss me?

279
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,680
You can live thousands of years.

280
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,400
If someone has to leave,

281
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,800
in the end, that person would be me.

282
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,400
If you leave,

283
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,000
I will always wait for you.

284
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,800
I'll wait for your return, just like right now.

285
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,200
Su Mo, I'm always willing to wait for you.

286
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
But... I can't.

287
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,300
Don't overthink it.

288
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
At least in Jiuyi Mountain,

289
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,800
you have to stay by my side and can't leave randomly.

290
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,700
Because there's only one Purple-lipped Dendrobium left.

291
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,600
Then don't use the mirror technique anymore.

292
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,800
I'll protect you.

293
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,580
Then I'll trouble Princess Bai to protect me then.

294
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,680
Let's go.

295
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,200
[Spirit Mirror Stage]

296
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,700
You can feel the barrier's breath here.

297
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,700
A hundred years ago,

298
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,000
us six princes opened Wuse City here.

299
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,200
When a formation is activated here, its effect will greatly increase.

300
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,400
This Spirit Mirror Stage can connect directly to Wuse City.

301
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,100
That year, when we used this to cast a spell to open Wuse City,

302
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,700
in order to assure safety, he ordered the entrance to be sealed.

303
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,000
It's so that the intruders can never come back alive.

304
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,800
This Monument of Fallen Tears is also known as the Nameless Monument.
[Monument of Fallen Tears]

305
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,300
All the names of the deceased Kongsang people are on it.

306
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,800
Some people who didn't fear hardship used to come here

307
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,200
just to send off their family on the last journey.

308
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,900
Why is only the Monument of Fallen Tears here? Where's the Splitting Sword?

309
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,400
There must be a mechanism nearby.

310
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,600
There's no more time to consider us.

311
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
Only by opening Wuse City

312
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,600
can we protect the lives of the Kongsang people in Jing City.

313
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,400
Six Princes, do you know the price

314
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,800
for opening Wuse City?

315
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,200
We understand.

316
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Are you willing?

317
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,200
We're willing.

318
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,800
Then, I'll start setting up the formation.

319
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Heaven and Earth, six seals of princes,

320
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,400
six stars gather together,

321
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,600
Wuse City opens!

322
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,600
From then on, the six princes' destinies are covered on the same destiny wheel.

323
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,500
When Wuse City is opened,

324
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,600
we will...

325
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,200
I didn't realize just how many things had happened later on.

326
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,600
Luckily, we protected the 100,000 people of Kongsang.

327
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,200
I had planned to keep it from you,

328
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,000
but didn't consider that you'd still end up seeing it.

329
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Do you regret it?

330
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,780
The Earth Ring saved me.

331
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,080
It chose me.

332
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,600
I've put this ring on and accepted this identity.

333
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,500
So I should protect this city.

334
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
I should fight for the 100,000 Kongsang people in Wuse City

335
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,600
to have a chance to wake up.

336
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I really wish you could be a carefree

337
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,000
Kongsang Holy Swordmaster who freely roams the land.

338
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,200
I, too, also wish that you can be an Emperor of the Sea who can fly between the sea and the sky.

339
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,400
It's unfortunate, our choice is to protect the people we want to protect.

340
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Once Kongsang wakes up and Quanxian returns,

341
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,900
I'll take you away from Yunhuang. All right?

342
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
I don't know what the future holds.

343
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,100
But I know I want to cherish the beautiful present.

344
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,600
If you knew

345
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,000
that I probably didn't have a future,

346
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm afraid my beautiful present

347
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,000
will also disappear.

348
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,960
Look around you. See if there is a mechanism for the Splitting Sword?

349
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,500
Let's keep searching.

350
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,840
Let's go.

351
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,940
[Splitting Sword]

352
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,910
Splitting Sword.

353
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,450
They say Queen Bai Wei brought the Splitting Sword

354
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,130
when she was exiled from Quanxian.

355
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,270
Will this fire burn you?

356
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,750
Either way I have to try.

357
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,250
Be careful then.

358
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,990
The Splitting Sword has appeared!

359
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,230
The sword that can split the sky and suppress the universe.

360
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,820
Eternal Star, I'm the only one.

361
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,850
What's the matter?

362
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,700
It's fine.

363
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,800
Kill her. Kill her.

364
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,580
Kill her. Kill her.

365
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,890
This sword...

366
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,130
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

367
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,750
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

368
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,930
Their strength is strong. They probably attacked me because they sensed that I'm a Kongsang royal.

369
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,720
There are too many memories and too much killing aura in this sword.

370
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,840
I kept it in the mark of the dragon deity

371
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,530
and suppressed it.

372
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,330
By the way, in Kongsang's history,

373
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,480
did they talk about how Queen Bai Wei died?

374
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,340
Queen Bai Wei was in the Stranded Dragon Abyss

375
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,170
with Heavenly King Lang Gan trying to seal the dragon deity together,

376
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,190
she died from spiritual exhaustion.

377
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,300
Why are you asking about that?

378
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,720
It's nothing.

379
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,190
There are some things that I want to understand better

380
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,090
once I know all the facts.

381
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,440
It's fine.

382
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,530
The Splitting Sword.

383
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,820
Report! The Splitting Sword has been pulled out.

384
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,510
Go to the Monument of Fallen Tears immediately and find General Yu Huan.

385
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,150
Tell him that I want to discuss urgent matters with him.

386
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,720
Yes!

387
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,940
Where are Su Mo and Bai Ying?

388
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,080
How did they get away so fast?

389
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,320
Or... is there another mechanism here?

390
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,420
What barrier is this?

391
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,000
General Yu Huan, the King of Jiuyu would like to see you.

392
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,230
He says there's an urgent matter to discuss.

393
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,390
Why haven't we arrived there yet?

394
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,430
- Sister Li Zhu, how much longer must we walk?
- Be careful.

395
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,920
We have been walking in this dark tunnel for a long time already.

396
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,470
After another tunnel,

397
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,730
we'll reach the place where there's water.

398
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,390
The Heavenly Emperor's tomb

399
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,520
is under the weak water there.

400
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,200
Back then, the Heavenly King and Queen Bai Wei,

401
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,370
at their point of death,

402
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:21,850
stepped on the reverse flowing water of Horizon waterfall.

403
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,590
Flowing in reverse?

404
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,610
Watch me. Watch me. Is flowing in reverse like this?

405
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,230
Na Sheng! This place is dangerous. Be quiet.

406
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,870
Uncle, you really shouldn't eat barbecue all the time.

407
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,650
Eating more vegetables is good for the eyes.

408
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,350
Don't move.

409
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,870
Be careful.

410
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,800
Na Sheng, where are you?

411
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,570
Come closer to me.

412
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,260
I'm here. I'm here.

413
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,680
Who's that?

414
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,730
Qing Yuan?

415
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,650
Your Highness.

416
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,460
How are things outside?

417
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,880
Cangliu's General Yu Huan

418
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,530
and Fei Lian have both arrived in Jiuyi.

419
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,970
Fortunately, Yan Xi is out there as reinforcement to protect us.

420
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,450
Yan Xi? How is Yan Xi?

421
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,610
Does he miss me? Has he lost weight?

422
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,820
Na Sheng! Na Sheng! Let Qing Yuan finish talking.

423
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,570
Yan Xi stole Fei Lian's command token.

424
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,140
He should be able to delay them for a while.

425
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,920
Also, he said Yu Huan has entered Jiuyi Mountain already.

426
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,760
Miss Li Zhu, have you heard

427
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,430
that Yu Huan was on Jiuyi Mountain?

428
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,250
I've only been ordered by the King of Jiuyi

429
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,450
to take Your Highness to the mausoleum of the Heavenly King.

430
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,030
I really don't know about anything else.

431
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,100
How can I trust you?

432
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,580
If Your Highness doesn't trust me,

433
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,670
why have you followed me for this long?

434
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,110
Besides,

435
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,080
didn't Your Highness also bring

436
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,440
this person, who is probably Prince Qing of the six princes. Right?

437
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,430
Back then, you didn't surrender along with your uncle's whole family.

438
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,320
You chose to succeed as Prince Qing.

439
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,860
Becoming one of the six princes who sacrificed themselves to save Kongsang.

440
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,070
As a member of the Qing Clan, I greatly admire you.

441
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,290
Miss Li Zhu, how do you know Qing Yuan?

442
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,260
Your Highness, please rest assured.

443
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,740
We... are on the same side.

444
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,590
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

445
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:51,100
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

446
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,580
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

447
00:43:54,580 --> 00:44:01,310
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

♫ We've met several times ♫

452
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,350
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

453
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:29,310
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

454
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:32,780
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

455
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,260
♫ You live in there ♫

456
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:42,440
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

457

♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

461
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:00,100
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

462

♫ play the ancient chords ♫

♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫
