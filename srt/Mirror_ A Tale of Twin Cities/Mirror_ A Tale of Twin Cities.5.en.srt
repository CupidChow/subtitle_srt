[Episode 5]

3
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,440
Why did you leave the pagoda? Did anyone notice?

4
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,270
Why didn't you say goodbye? Why did you keep my sachet?

5
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,330
No one saw me leave the pagoda.

6
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,640
What about you? Are you leaving?

7
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,300
That's good.

8
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,090
I wish you happiness. May all our wishes come true.

9
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,880
Can you...

10
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,650
not return to the Jing Pagoda?

11
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,450
I...

12
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,860
If...

13
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,520
If you don't become the crown princess

14
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,490
and just be A'Lin, what would happen?

15
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,350
There!

16
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,620
- There! After them!
- Let's go.

17
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,160
Don't run! Stop right there!

18
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,860
Stop right there!

19
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,110
They disappeared.

20
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,390
- Search carefully!
- Yes!

21
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,990
Let's look up ahead.

♫ Listen ♫

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,820
♫ Listen ♫

24

♫ Using up all my fortune just to touch you ♫

Let's go.

27
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,990
♫ Listening to the soft whisper of the rain from that day ♫

28
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,120
♫ That is the sound of my heart, so please listen ♫

29
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,700
♫ Because when it becomes sunny ♫

30
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:15,990
♫ I will leave quietly ♫

31
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,410
I can't go back.

32
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,780
That's right.

33
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,250
You can't go back.

34
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,950
I'm giving this to you, as a keepsake.

35

♫ We've met several times ♫

36

♫ Sighing over the past that's as frivolous as smoke ♫

♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

♫ You live in there ♫

41

♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

42

♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

48

♫ play the ancient chords ♫

♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

♫ When I want to return,

57
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,730
All right.

58
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,180
We must forget.

59
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,420
Your seal...

60
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,090
The crown princess' seal

61
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,670
has been broken!

62
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,850
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

63
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,230

64
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,730
Come with me.

65
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,070
I can't.

66
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,460
I have to go back.

67
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,120
Over there! Capture them!

68
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
Hurry and leave.

69
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,710
Hurry and leave!

70
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,250
Go! Hurry and leave.

71
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,800
No.

72
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,910
If I'm to leave, we must leave together. You must leave with me.

73
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,620
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

74
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,660
Princess!

75
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,650
Let them go. I'll return with you.

76
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,190
Why isn't Su Mo back yet? Do you know where he went?

77
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,700
It seems that he went back to the Jing Pagoda.

78
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,620
Why did he return to the Jing Pagoda again?

79
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,180
Perhaps he's worried about that Princess Bai.

80
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,600
Aunt Ru, take the other clan people back with you to the Great Camp of Jing Lake,

81
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll go and make inquiries to find him.

82
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,750
- Then you must be extra careful.
- All right.

83
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,610
What exactly do you want to do to Bai Ying?

84
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,010
What else would happen to an impure crown princess?

85
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,170
Stop!

86
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,820
If you don't want to die, then help her.

87
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Threatening me? Going to kill me?

88
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,450
You can try.

89
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,250
I only wish that she will live.

90
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,640
However, I only want her to die.

91
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,480
If she dies, you won't be able to stay alive either.

92
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,600
Will you help or not?

93
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,440
Unexpected, right? You're very surprised, right?

94
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,920
How is that possible?

95
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,410
Su Mo, in this world

96
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,500
there are people who can break your blood pact.

97
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,750
I didn't do anything outside of the ordinary.

98
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,830
Why would this happen?

99
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,350
I wonder

100
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,700
how Su Mo is doing right now.

101
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,900
Is he okay?

102
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,210
Your Majesty, the crown princess' seal

103
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,990
has been broken.

104
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,160
The crown princess is no longer pure.

105
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,070
Prince Bai, why don't you ask your precious daughter

106
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,960
who broke her seal?

107
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,040
Like mother, like daughter.

108
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,950
Have you forgotten that her mother abandoned you both

109
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,470
to elope with a Cangliu person?

110
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,940
What kind of person was my mother?

111
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,860
She was the bravest and kindest person I've ever met.
- Shut your mouth.

112
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,040
- She's the most responsible woman. 
- Don't pay attention to him.

113
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,540
- Tell the truth.
- She was also the best mother in the world.

114
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm afraid the crown princess doesn't dare tell the truth.

115
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,710
Not only was her seal broken, she even went down the pagoda without permission.

116
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,790
When she was caught, she was in the midst of planning to elope with a man!

117
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,140
Her crime deserves the death penalty, Your Majesty.

118
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,820
Who dares?

119
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,880
Prince Bai!

120
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,970
If there's no one to inherit the power of Earth,

121
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,230
you're also guilty of not disciplining her strictly.

122
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,890
- Men! Arrest Prince Bai!
- You!

123
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,720
Stop!

124
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,490
The defensive line has fallen and you haven't supplied any army provisions.

125
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,920
Ye City's soldiers are invincible!

126
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,130
What are all of you doing!

127
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,420
You cut off the army provisions for Ye City's garrisons.

128
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,030
You even burned all the remaining army provisions. I'll settle that with you later.

129
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,190
The priority is to defend Ye City.

130
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,680
High Priest, I don't need to tell you what to do, right?

131
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,710
His Majesty hopes that the powers of Heaven and Earth come together soon to protect Kongsang.

132
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,470
However, the crown princess's seal has already been broken.

133
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,590
This is the future queen of Kongsang. What are you trying to do?

134
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,060
The crown princess undertook the heavy responsibility of inheriting the power of Earth.

135
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,470
If the crown prince insists on marrying her

136
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,990
and she's unable to inherit the power of Earth, bringing bad luck to Kongsang,

137
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,970
- will you be able to bear the consequences?
- You!

138
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,000
The fate of Kongsang is critical.

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,880
Your Royal Highness.

140
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,240
The fate of Kongsang is absolutely not a trifling matter.

141
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,530
If Princess Bai Ying can't inherit the power of Earth,

142
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,110
how will you explain it to the people of Kongsang?

143
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,860
If she can't inherit the power of Earth,

144
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,020
my Bai Clan shall bear that consequences!

145
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,020
Your Majesty, please make the final decision.

146
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,020
During the grand wedding,

147
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,160
if Princess Bai Ying is unable to inherit the power of Earth,

148
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,100
then the whole Bai Clan shall be executed.

149
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,560
This has been decided.

150
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,690
Prince Bai and Prince Qing, immediately mobilize troops to support Ye City.

151
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,150
Royal Father.

152
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,560
Royal Father, there must be a hidden scheme behind this.

153
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,640
Bring Su Mo here.

154
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,660
This is the innocence you claim?

155
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,270
Outside the Jing Pagoda, the crown princess was about to elope with this person.

156
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,900
They were caught in the act!

157
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,730
Elope?

158
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,970
In the pagoda, your precious daughter couldn't stand the loneliness

159
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,690
- and had relations with this man so the seal broke.
- Shut your mouth!

160
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,660
I haven't transformed so how could I have seduced the crown princess?

161
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,320
This was all planned by you!

162
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,060
You forced me to enter the Jing Pagoda

163
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,400

This person tainted the crown princess' purity.

182
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,230
Yet the crown prince wants to help him?

183

Can I still inherit the power of Earth even though the seal has been broken?

There's no precedent for this.

Everyone thinks that the seal seals the physical body.

In actuality, it seals the crown princess' heart.

199

If the crown princess sincerely falls in love with someone,

200

the seal will break.

201

Otherwise, you won't have any energy.

322
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Here. The winds are so intense, you'll catch a cold.

323
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,390
Eat it while it is still hot, hurry.

324
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,900
Hurry, eat it. Here.

325
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,700
Why are your hands so cold?

326
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,200
Hurry, eat some food; otherwise, you really will catch a cold.

327
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,230
You aren't eating?

328
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,500
You...

329
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,600
Strange.

330
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,800
Does he only need heat and not to eat food?

331
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,000
After crossing over this snow mountain, it will be Yunhuang. We should be really close.

332
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
Don't get excited too soon.

333
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,400
Do you know how many corpses are buried on that mountain?

334
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,300
But a lot of people survived as well.

335
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,000
I want to be one of them.

336
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,600
In the future, I will tell my children and grandchildren about how I went through such dangers.

337
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
- What's wrong?
- Elder.

338
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Elder, are you okay?

339
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
- I'm okay.
- Just hold on a bit longer. Over that mountain should be Yunhuang.

340
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Thank you.

341
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,400
[Snow Poppy]

342
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,600
What flower is that?

343
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,200
- Snow poppy!
- It's quite pretty.

344
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
- Snow poppy!
- Get out of my way!

345
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
- It's mine.
- You...

346
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
- Mine.
- Mine!

347
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
I found it first. Don't you know first come, first serve?

348
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
Why did they push me?

349
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
This isn't good. Avalanche!

350
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,500
- It's mine!
- Out of my way!

351
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
- Quickly, go.
- Go!

352
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,660
Avalanche! Stop fighting over it!

353
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,600
You'll die, hurry and run!

354
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,330
Stop fighting!

355
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,300
Stop fighting! Quick—

[Jing Pagoda - Heavenly Temple]

357
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,780
There's a strange change in the Greedy Wolf Star.

358
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,560
[Zhi Zhe - Cangliu Hierarch]

359
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,830
It's that person.

360
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,140
He's returned.

361
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,790
This avalanche really comes fast and goes fast.

362
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,600
Where are the other people? What happened to everyone?

363
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,090
A greedy heart will cause them to leave their bones here.

364
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,970
That's the legendary Jing Pagoda of Yunhuang, isn't it?

365
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:33,410
I heard elders in my village say that it's about 64,000 feet tall.
(T/N: Chinese feet, one Chinese foot = 1/3 meter)

366
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,480
It was built by Kongsang's Heavenly King.

367
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,070
But... it's so tall.

368
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,750
How hard would it be to climb it?

369
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,070
The legends say that the taller Jing Pagoda is,

370
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,820
the more likely the prayers of the High Priest and ministers will be heard.

371
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,980
- I also heard that...
- Laughable.

372
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,720
Who can hear whose prayers?

373
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,880
It's a legend.

374
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,370
Hey, Brother Ice Cube!

375
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,950
Brother Ice Cube, where are you going?

376
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,580
You must be really powerful, right?

377
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,840
I heard the village elders say that some people have divine powers and are very powerful.

378
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,120
You have divine powers, right? Take me there.

379
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,370
Then, can I give you some of my fairy grass?

380
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,200
Take me there. I promise that I won't talk to you and I won't annoy you.

381
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,570
Yunhuang is a mythical place. There are never any battles there, I must go.

382
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,440
There's no such place like that in the world.

383
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,340
I don't believe it. I'll only know once I see it for myself.

384
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,490
Aren't you going as well? We can go together.

385
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,280
I... I'll just follow you from afar.

386
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,720
There. In between the mountains. Once you get past Tianque.

387
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,170
If you can get down the mountain alive

388
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,660
and go west along the stream,

389
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,830
when you see a place where people are living, that's Taoyuan province.

390
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,390
That's Yunhuang.

391
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,490
Taoyuan Province.

392
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,970
It sounds like a great place, just by the name!

393
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,440
You must get down the mountain before it gets dark.

394
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,030
Hey, Brother Ice Cube! Brother Ice Cube, what is your name?

395
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,670
Su Mo.

396
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,500
Su Mo？

397
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,590
There's no precedent for this.

398
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,080
I dare not make any assertions.

399
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,710
Everyone thinks that the seal seals the physical body.

400
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,020
In actuality, it seals the crown princess' heart.

401
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,540
If the crown princess sincerely falls in love with someone,

402
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,080
the seal will break.

403
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
[Bai Ying - Reigning Princess Bai of Kongsang]

404
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,180
One hundred years ago, when I fell off the pagoda,

405
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,570
I was rescued by the Earth Ring.

406
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,200
Prince Zhen Lan fought to the death against Cangliu alone.

407
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,740
By the time I woke from the Still Meditation and rushed to the battlefield,

408
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,210
Prince Zhen Lan's power of Heaven

409
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,740
had been sealed by a mysterious Cangliu person.

410
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,110
There was no trace of it anywhere.

411
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,820
Maybe... this is my fate.

412
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,510
[Earth Ring]

413
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,980
After Zhen Lan fell into a deep sleep, in order to protect the Kongsang people,

414
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,940
the six princes sacrificed half of their spiritual powers to open up Wuse City.
 [Kongsang - Wuse City]

415
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,120
Never again can we walk in daylight.

416
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,890
[Zhen Lan - Crown Prince of Kongsang]

417
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,610
Your Highness, you've already slept for a hundred years.

418
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,690
In this hundred years, I've gone across the whole of Yunhuang.

419
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,410
But I still haven't found the Heavenly Ring.

420
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,820
Or the sealed power of Heaven.

421
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,070
But I've told you all about Yunhuang's land and culture.

422
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:44,840
This time, I went to Banbu City in Kangping Province.

423
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,510
Banbu City is a desert city. The houses there are made of rocks.

424
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,520
Although I went at night,

425
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,880
the sand there was warm at night.

426
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,240
That's the feeling of sunlight.

427
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,010
Are you done with today's news?

428
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,960
I told him about Banbu City.

429
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,230
The High Priest told us to talk to His Highness more,

430
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,720
saying that he might be able to hear our calls.

431
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,620
But it's already been a hundred years. There hasn't been any movement whatsoever.

432
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,870
His Highness will wake up one day.

433
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,220
A'Ying, it's been a hundred years already.
[Hong Yuan - Reiging Princess Chi of Kongsang]

434
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,600
can you still not forget that person?

435
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,740
It's been a hundred years. What I needed to forget, is long forgotten.

436
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,570
What you should've forgotten? All these years, you've gone all over Yunhuang.

437
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,750
Is it really to find the Heavenly Ring

438
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,360
and the sealed power of Heaven?

439
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,530
A hundred years ago, he left Tianque Mountain.

440
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,980
In these hundred years, how many times have you gone there?

441
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,280
What are you waiting for?

442
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,700
Right now, I only want to find the Heavenly Ring,

443
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,990
undo the seal on His Highness, and find the power of Heaven.

444
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:25,070
And let the hundred thousand citizens of Kongsang see the daylight once more.

445
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,420
We'll definitely accomplish this.

446
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,690
High Priest, why have you called me here so urgently?

447
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,140
A'Ying, there's a change in the Greedy Wolf Star.

448
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,660
A huge misfortune will fall upon the world soon.

449
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,410
The invader will enter through Tianque into Yunhuang.

450
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,600
I fear it will bring turmoil to all of Yunhuang.

451
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,050
Turmoil to all of Yunhuang?

452
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,290
I wonder if it's good or bad.

453
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,940
But this person will definitely break the situation we're in now.

454
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,990
Maybe we'll have an opportunity to see the sun again.

455
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,290
That's right. But we need to stay ahead of Cangliu

456
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,410
and find this person who can change Yunhuang.

457
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,400
Cangliu won't easily let them go.

458
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,720
In that case, after dark

459
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,490
I'll go to Tianque and find this invader.

460
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,160
Maybe I can help them avoid the crisis.

461
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,650
Reigning Princess, please be safe.

462
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,250
No matter who it is, I hope this person

463
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:00,270
can bring hope to Kongsang and Yunhuang.

464
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,220

00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,580
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

479
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,610
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

480
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,450
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

481
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,030
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

482
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,480
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

483
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,970
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

484
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:16,350
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

485
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,370
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

486
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,400
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

487
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,400
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

488
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,910
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

489
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:34,300
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

490
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,300
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

491
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:48,340
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
