What is it?

General, we've already caught the suspects.

They're in prison right now.

What suspects?

11
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,330
Some Central Plains people.

12
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,770
- Central Plains people?
- Yes.

13
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,610
There are also some merpeople with them.

14
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,050
They seem to have some sort of conspiracy going on.

What about Nan Zhao?

Vice General Nan Zhou is already on his way to the prison.

When fighting for merit, he runs faster than anyone else.

The merit naturally belongs to General.

General, please.

When you're asleep,

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,210
it's just like back then.

29
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,270
I really wish time would stop at this moment.

30
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,600
I wouldn't have to be concerned about anything else.

But it's suppressed now.

Aunt Ru, I want to ask you a few questions.

37
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,410
Aunt Ru, do you know what kind of magic power Su Mo is practicing?

38
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,940
I don't know.

39
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,580
I only know that the power he's practicing

40
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,770
can heal wounds quickly.

41
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,960
If he continues to use this power, he'll suffer from backlash.

42
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,410
It'll be such enormous pain, one that most people cannot withstand.

43
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,310
No wonder Young Master said before even though his Emperor of the Sea power hadn't awakened,

44
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,950
but he still had a great power to take our Quanxian tribe back to the Biluo Sea.

45

He's never forgiven himself this entire time.

it's been 100 years since that happened.

Between you and Young Master, no matter what, the threads of fate cannot be cut.

Moreover, he drank too much and is resting.

Why?

124

Is he still mad at me for banishing him? Or...

125
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,820
He's likely tired of the endless fighting over the last hundred years.

Moreover, I couldn't persuade him.

How about I find a way to send them away.

148
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,630
Since he's already here,

149
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,920
it'll only attract attention if we try to send them away.

Take care of something? When did she leave?

- Because I'm the only one who can give commands here.

But it's not necessarily safe to stay here either.

321
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,990
She saved my life.

322
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,600
I can't put her in danger.

323
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,980
It's not good to leave or stay right now.

324
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,870
If we leave, we'll likely encounter Cangliu's soldiers.

325
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,790
If we stay, Cangliu's people will probably barge in.

326
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,080
They won't believe us.

327
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,390
Otherwise, they wouldn't have left guards at the entrance.

328
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,030
Young Master, you decide then.

329
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,450
No matter what, I owe Na Sheng for her benevolence. She saved my life.

330
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,810
Whether we go or stay, I won't abandon her.

331
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,680
Yan Xi, you're strangers that met by chance,

332
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,940
you can't take such a great risk for her.

333
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,230
She's the one who risked great danger in order to save me first.

334
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,040
We, Quanxian people, have always repaid kindness.

335
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,370
Find a unit to escort them out of here first.

336
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,570
No need to find anyone. Let me do it.

337
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,410
No.

338
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,420
You haven't fully recovered from a severe injury. Don't force it.

339
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,800
Na Sheng is right outside.

340
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,820
Why don't you go see her?

341
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,550
Both of you can take your leave first.

342
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,880
Yes.

343
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,230
What are you looking at?

344
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,020
We haven't seen each other for 100 years.

345
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,820
General Xi Jing, you've changed a lot.

346
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,410
I'd originally thought

347
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,730
I'd meet you again soon.

348
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,730
Who would've expected it would take such a long time.

349
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,960
I thought you didn't want to see me again,

350
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,990
and that's why you exiled me.

351
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,230
You were the one who took me to Kongsang 100 years ago.

352
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,280
You were my only friend in Kongsang.

353
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,560
When I exiled you that day, I was hoping

354
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,170
that I could reunite with you again someday.

355
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,110
A lot of time has passed.

356
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,930
But, luckily, we've run into each other again.

357
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,830
Do you know? If we hadn't run into each other,

358
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,340
I was planning to go everywhere in Yunhuang to find you.

359
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,440
Why are you looking for me?

360
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,060
I'm not General Xi Jing anymore.

361
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,330
In my eyes, you're my General Xi Jing.

362
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,240
You can't run away from it.

363
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,750
Back then, how you took me to Kongsang,

364
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,080
today I will repay you twice over.

365
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,050
Yan Xi! Yan Xi,

366
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,190
how are you? Is your injury better now?

367
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,680
It's much better. Thank you for your concern.

368
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,050
How about you?

369
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:50,460
Me? I'm fine. I'm doing well.

370
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,130
It's good that you're all right. Oh yes, do you live here?

371
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,250
Is this the only place where I can find you? Are you going anywhere else?

372
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,290
Na Sheng, listen to me.

373
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,660
I don't live here. You must leave right away.

374
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,360
Are you kicking me out?

375
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,670
Right now? Why?

376
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,140
In order to capture you, the Cangliu people are turning Taoyuan Province upside down.

377
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,550
It's not safe for you to stay here.

378
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,150
You already said that the Cangliu people are turning Taoyuan Province upside down,

379
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,610
wouldn't it be even more dangerous for me to go outside right now?

380
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,740
The Cangliu people are heading towards Taoyuan Province with a new kind of weapon.

381
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,460
Before they arrive, perhaps you will have a chance to escape safely.

382
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,030
Aren't Princess Bai Ying and Crown Prince Zhen Lan also here?

383
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,700
They can protect you.

384
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,990
I'll take you to them.

385
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,610
Can you at least accompany me to see Sister Bai Ying?

386
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,730
General, here.

387
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,710
Where's Na Sheng?

388
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,160
Na Sheng.

389
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,430
What's wrong?

390
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,400
They're kicking us out.

391
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,180
Please don't misunderstand.

392
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,090
The Cangliu's soldiers are rushing this way with a new weapon.

393
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,780
There's talk that this weapon is very powerful.

394
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,150
Everyone, you should hurry and leave before they arrive.

395
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,020
What kind of weapon is it?

396
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,730
We're not sure yet.

397
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,290
But no matter what,

398
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,330
with our current strength, we cannot fight against the Cangliu people.

399
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,290
Everyone, it's best that you leave now.

400
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,990
What about you all?

401
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,830
Princess Bai Ying, please rest assured.

402
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,430
We'll also quickly leave with our people.

403
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,790
Okay. We'll leave first then.

404
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,920
Thank you for taking the trouble these past few days.

405
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,260
Are we really leaving?

406
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,270
Young Master said to send some warriors to protect you.

407
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,860
Thank you for your kindness.

408
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,180
We have a great general to protect us.

409
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,190
Great General, thank you.

410
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,240
Aunt Ru, I...

411
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,840
Be careful on the road.

412
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,250
- I'll walk everyone out then.
- Okay.

413
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,990
Please.

414
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,630
[Ruyi Gambling House]

415
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,700
Wait.

416
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,050
Why isn't there a single person on the streets?

417
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,950
It is a bit strange. Let's go back.

418
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,130
Go.

419
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,640
Run!

420
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,010
Quickly.

421
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,980
- Yan Xi, you protect Na Sheng and go.
- All right.

422
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,760
Let's go.

423
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,520
After them.

424
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,580
You hide in here. I'll go out to help them.

425
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,230
Yan Xi! Yan Xi!

426
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,120
A'Ying.

427
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,250
Na Sheng's disappeared.

428
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,360
My drawing of the evacuation route is in the secret chamber.

429
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,500
Notify our people in Taoyuan Province to quickly leave in separate groups.

430
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,860
Yes.

431
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,800
A'Ying, hang in there.

432
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,880
- What's the matter with Bai Ying?
- Her spiritual consciousness has been injured.

433
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,430
Su Mo!

434
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,030
Step aside, I'll save her.

435
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,670
How?

436
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,330
We, Kongsang, have our own magical powers.

437
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,800
You said her spiritual consciousness was injured.

438
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,670
What happened?

439
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,710
Bai Ying can't be directly exposed to sunlight.

440
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,140
Otherwise, her spiritual consciousness will be sunburned and her life is then at risk.

441
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,130
She's lived a life like this for a hundred years already.

442
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,520
A hundred years ago, in order to safeguard all the people in the city,

443
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,000
the High Priest decided to do whatever it took to open Wuse City.

444
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,430
Afterwards, the residents of Wuse City fell into a deep sleep.

445
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,160
And because people like Bai Ying sacrificed half of their spiritual consciousness,

446
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,840
they can never see the daylight.

447
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,640
At least not before Wuse City opens again.

448
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,460
They can only live there.

449
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,510
So that's the price of

450
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,690
opening Wuse City.

451
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,750
Something's wrong.

452
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,020
- How long can she endure like this?
- I don't know.

453
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,760
I can only slow down the spread of her injuries.

454
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,720
After sunset, I'll take her back to Wuse City for a cure.

455
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,490
It's not even noon yet. How can she last until sunset?

456
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,510
What are you doing?

457
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,660
Su Mo, you bastard! Release me!

458
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,220
I won't let anything happen to you.

459
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,260
Sister Bai Ying. Yan Xi.

460
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,600
Where are you?

461
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,980
Search here. Stop there!

462
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,500
Everyone, listen to my orders.

463
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,140
The target is Taoyuan Province. Prepare the Wind Falcons.

464
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,300
Yes!

465
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,400
Don't disappoint me.

466
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,550
General, don't worry.

467
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,320
Prepare to set off!

468
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,890
Master Peng, General Yu Huan has left for the Taoyuan Province

469
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,440
to capture those who crossed over Tianque.

470
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,520
He's deployed the Wind Falcons.

471
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,030
It would appear that

472
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:18,160
capturing those who crossed Tianque is very tricky.

473
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,360
Or maybe General Yu Huan is too kind

474
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,920
and unwilling to harm the innocent.

475
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,830
He's bound himself up on his own.

476
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,240
You have hidden words in what you just said.

477
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,450
I don't dare deceive you.

478
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:33,120
When General Yu Huan went to capture those who crossed over Tianque,

479
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,910
they missed the best chance to capture them because of pity.

480
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,250
The benevolence of a woman.

481
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,210
You must pay attention and remind him at the crucial moment,

482
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,580
those who achieve great success must not be constrained by trivial matters.

483
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,800
Yes, Master Peng.

484
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,180
I just received an order.

485
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,490
The Heavenly Ring has appeared.

486
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,080
Kongsang's Heavenly Ring?

487
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,680
It's also in Taoyuan Province.

488
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,400
Tell Yu Huan that he must capture the Heavenly Ring and bring it back.

489
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,920
This is the command token.

490
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:13,080
Assist him. The mission must be successful.

491
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,440
Rest assured, My Lord.

492
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,460
I'll be the one to bring back the Heavenly Ring for you.

493
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,820
You all, go over there!

494
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,970
- The rest, come with me!
- Yes.

495
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,640
- You, come here.
- Turn around.

496
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
Stop there!

497
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,810
Where exactly did Na Sheng go?

498
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,410
All of you, come here!

499
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,280
Have Yan Xi and the others been discovered?

500
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,530
Could those be... Cangliu's new weapons?

501
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,460
Wanting to Return by Zhou Shen

502
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,920
♫ Among the frosty clouds is the cold moon ♫

503
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,450
♫ A strange light in the night ♫

504
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:45,280
♫ In the dream, there is longing and fear ♫

505
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,730
♫ The layers of waves build up ♫

506
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,170
♫ Repeating the promise ♫

507
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:59,270
♫ Yet they disappear in the end ♫

508
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:02,690
♫ We've met several times ♫

509
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,120
♫ Yet it is hard to mention our fated relationship from the past ♫

510
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:13,180
♫ Sighing over the past is as frivolous as smoke ♫

511
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,620
♫ Split open the cocoon in my heart ♫

512
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,060
♫ You live in there ♫

513
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:26,220
♫ and have never been discovered by anyone ♫

514
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,160
♫ Ask time to borrow a chapter ♫

515
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,080
♫ The unforgettable memories ♫

516
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,000
♫ have disappeared, disappeared ♫

517
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,600
♫ I once thought there was a deep bond ♫

518
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,030
♫ Using ten fingers to painstakingly ♫

519
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,440
♫ play the ancient chords ♫

520
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,920
♫ In exchange for only a moment of your smile ♫

521
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,960
♫ Use a lifetime to love only one person ♫

522
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,970
♫ How do you calculate the debt between each other? ♫

523
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:04,870
♫ Yet unwilling, unwilling ♫

524
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,360
♫ to make an exchange for a promise and apology ♫

525
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,760
♫ Our next lives are too far away ♫

526
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,820
♫ I would rather turn into ash and be lost in a reverie ♫

527
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:26,190
♫ When I want to return,
it will be time for my dream to come true ♫
