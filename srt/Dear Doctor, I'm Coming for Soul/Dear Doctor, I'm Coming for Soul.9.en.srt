Why do I have to stop a loser doctor like him?

I saw Dr. Metha kept the resign letter to himself.

The heart in your chest, in your body,

but it didn't work.

124
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,790
So I change to

encouraging instead.

126
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,150
I think I shouldn't go in.

If I go in now, he might be
more upset and go out of his mind again.

And I changed my mind,

134
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,370
not because stopping you didn't work.

135
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,750
It's because I don't want to see you suffer,

136
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,750
but because what you've
been waiting for turns out to be...

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,630
nothing.

138
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,250
Don't make that happen yourself.

Why do you look so shocked?

You mean B88?

I don't know when he will come.

147
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,230
But there's one thing I know,

148
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,830
and you should know too.

149

Soul reapers don't know everything.

Our responsibility is to lead dead souls the way.

Yes.

And if you are still mad at him
about your mother's ticket,

154
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,610
you should be mad at me.

155
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,770
I was the one who stopped him from telling you.

156
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,580
Why?

157
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,110
Humans have their law.

158
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,280
Soul reapers also have their own as well.

159

Disclosing secrets of the underworld,

160
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,410
has a severe punishment.

161
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,790
You have to be a soul reaper for another 100 years.

162
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,860
Or worst case, you won't be reincarnate.

163
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,350
And you're telling me this,

164

won't you get punished later?

165
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,170
I don't have a problem being a soul reaper.

166
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,140
I don't care about reincarnation.

336
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,710
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,010
What are you guys doing?

338
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,440
Got nothing to do?

339
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
No. Not at all. So busy.

340
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,460
I have to go.

341
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,090
But I've got not thing to do.

342
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,210
I wanna have some snack to celebrate.

343
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,390
Celebrate for what?

344
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,180
I'm not telling you!

345
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,210
But you have to come with me!

346
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:37,860
Let's go!

347
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,010
No. She's not in the garden.

348
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,010
Ugh! I'm going crazy.
I already looked all over the place.

349
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,200
Mom is so troublesome. Everything is so hectic.

350
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,680
I don't know where she's gone. Ugh! Mother!

351
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,020
Excuse me.

352
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,010
What!?

353
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,050
Just in case that's your mother.

354
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,820
Mom!

355
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,210
Why did you do this!?

356
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,720
How many times have you lied to me?

357
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,310
You never actually go see the doctor!
Also don't take any medicines.

358
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,240
Who are you?

359
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,430
Mom please don't get started!

360
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,240
I was trying to find you since morning.
I  cannot go to work.

361
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,950
Haven't eaten anything.

362
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,240
I'm so tired.

363
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,690
Jeab!

364
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,660
Yeah, right!

365
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,300
Let's go home.
You don't have to go see doctor anymore.

366
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,070
- Excuse me!
- Let's go.

367
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,110
How long has she had memory loss and confusion?

368
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,420
Not really.

369
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,280
She had it when she had
brain tumor surgery but it's gone.

370
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,480
It comes back just now.

371
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,990
Why do you ask? Are you a doctor?

372
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,020
Please calm down.

373
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,150
Yes. I am a doctor.

374
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,780
I think,

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,960
[CT Brain]

376
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,940
you should send your mother to do a CT scan.

377
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,760
It's GBM.
(Glioblastoma: an aggressive type of tumor that can occur in the brain or spinal cord)

378
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,160
[Glioblastoma Multiforme]

379
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,450
She needs a surgery to remove it.

380
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,560
But it also has high risks.

381
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,910
What should we do then doctor?

382
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,290
Our specialist is an expert in this area.

383
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,680
Don't have to worry.

384
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,570
I'm such a bad daughter.

385
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,530
I always blame her and think she's troublesome.

386
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,780
I'd never realized that she is so sick.

387
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,920
If we didn't find you, we would...

388
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,260
probably take her to the nursing home already.

389
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,240
Take a deep breath.

390
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,890
I totally understand that
taking care of patients is not easy.

391
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,100
But now we know what's wrong with her,

392
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,650
everything will be ok.

393
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,660
What if I don't want her to do the surgery?

394
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,250
I don't wanna make another mistake.

395
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,720
I know now that she is sick.

396
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,010
I wanna take good care of her

397
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,010
even though she will forget me.

398
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,590
I don't want her to have anymore risks.

399
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,530
But I wanna risk it.

400
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,010
I don't wanna forget my daughter.

401
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,910
Mom!

402
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,210
Why...

403
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,210
does it seem like I forget something?

404
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,250
What's up?

405
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,160
Walked around 'til you found a case?

406
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,010
Ready to be back as a doctor yet?

407
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,520
Let me heal first, would you?

408
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,350
And how are you?

409
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,949
It's good that you asked,
I wanna give you some updates.

410
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,620
Parfhun is so much better now.

411
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,250
I'm so happy!

412
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,489
I know.

413
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,810
It's doctors' happiness.

414
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,409
That's iris flower!

415
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,199
Hey Hey! I remember that!

416
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,179
Iris flower means

417
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,130
bravery,

418
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,130
and faith!

419
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,850
No!

420
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,409
Keeta gave me that.

421
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,520
He said,

422
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,870
he wants another chance.

423
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,989
Oh.

424
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,400
I thought it was someone else's.

425
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,710
Hey! But I was not making it up.

426
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,710
Each flower type has so many meanings.

427
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,530
Meaning?

428
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,830
Um.

429
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,210
So,

430
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,860
what about those gladiolus?

431
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,450
Umm.

432
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,210
Your iris flowers are wilted.

433
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,800
But gladiolus,

434
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,750
are all new everyday.

435
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,090
It's like immortal.

436
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,210
- You.
- Huh?

437
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,510
Can you help me find the meaning,

438
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,510
of gladiolus flower, will you?

439
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,810
If I don't help you out, who will!?

440
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,610
Here!

441
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,830
Besides supportive meaning,

442
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,910
gladiolus flower also conveys as,

443
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,430
loyal,

444
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,050
faithful,

445
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,390
and also passionate.

446
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,800
So can you think of anyone?

447
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,430
No.

448
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,230
Umm.

449
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,630
Or...

450
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,530
Or that person might,

451
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,810
wanna translate meaning
of the flower's name itself?

452
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,250
Have you ever promised anything to anyone?

453
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,320
No.

454
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,040
Oh.

455
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,610
Gladiolus flower

456
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,300
translates to promise.

(means promise in Thai)

458
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,070
Gotcha!

459
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,500
It's really you.

460
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,790
You knew me,

461
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,550
before we even met for the first time?

462
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,750
You,

463
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,950
remember?

464
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,720
Yes, I do.

465
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,620
I remember,

466
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,250
that I used to received gladiolus flowers.

467
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,410
What does it mean?

468
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,630
The meaning of it?

469
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,200
So what happened to you?

470
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,630
How long have you been here?

471
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,930
And how long do you have to stay further?

472
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,350
I have a brain tumor.

473
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,770
I've been here for quite sometimes already.

474
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,910
Well,

475
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,050
I hope to get out of here soon.

476
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,350
Then,

477
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,350
I will come play with you more often,

478
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,760
so you won't be lonely.

479
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,310
What's your name, brother?

480
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,660
My name is Prakan.

481
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,800
I'm Sanya.

482
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,800
I...

483
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,110
I will always support and wish the best for you.

484
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,450
That's all?

485
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,370
Um.

486
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,370
Like I told you,

487
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,370
that I wanna be by your side.

488
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,160
Then don't go.

489
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,910
I'm sorry,

490
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,430
for keep pushing you away back and forth.

491
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,990
Now I know.

492
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,540
I want you here.

493
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,290
I'm a soul reaper.

494
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,390
I will only make you regret and sad.

495
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,390
No!

496
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,390
I won't think that way again or anymore.

497
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,410
Please.

498
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,530
I promise.

499
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,820
Um.

500
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
So,

501
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,120
do you have any day-offs left

502
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,490
for a short vacation?

503
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,170
This is my old house
that I used to live when I was younger.

504
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,540
My mother and I wanted to live here,

505
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,950
when she is all better.

506
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,070
We will move back here together.

507
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,750
But at the end,

508
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,740
it's just me left.

509
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,150
My mom asked me to forgive my father.

510
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,150
She also asked me,

511
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,110
to bring her ashes,

512
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,830
and place next to him.

513
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,750
Have you forgiven your father?

514
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,250
Why are you mad at him?

515
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,430
Forget it.

516
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,700
It might not be true.

517
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,910
By now,

518
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,650
I just realized that

519
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,650
no matter what reasons,

520
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,780
I shouldn't be mad at him.

521
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,430
Because a part of me that comes from him,

522
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,670
it makes me who I am today.

523
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,240
You are a good doctor.

524
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,280
Yes.

525
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,750
I also think,

526
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,470
he was a good doctor as well.

527
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,990
You dad was.

528
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,750
You talked like you knew him.

529
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,150
Let's go!

530
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,760
Let's be on vacation for real!

531
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,930
I don't know since when,

532
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,920
that I can draw him without having to look.

533
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,510
I draw him from my memories.

534
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,070
It's the nature of the world
that has two sides of the story,

535
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,070
One remembers.

536
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,870
The other forgets.

537
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,790
I'm glad to be the one who remembers.

538
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,070
I remember,

539
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,370
so I'm aware

540
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,670
that the memories I have are so precious.

541
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,770
Because who he is today,

542
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,770
is no longer the same person from my memories.

543
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,920
But sometimes I also wonder,

544
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,270
what if he remembers me one day,

545
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,370
will our relationship change?

546
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,580
Sanya!

547
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,990
There's something you should know,

548
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,330
about your dad.

549
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,640
I would like to donate my organ.

550
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,520
Sanya's heart,

551
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:53,520
has to be for someone else.

552
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,980
Why did you give it to me?

553
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,690
Mr. Taed's profile is excellent!

554
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,230
He's a cypto king.

555
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,690
If someone got him as a husband,
they could say good bye to tough shifts.

556
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,990
Be careful! You might got tricked by a widow.

557
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,940
Please come trick me.

558
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,590
I've been single for so long, I want someone in my life.

559
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:08,910
So,

560
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:10,410
Keeta is going to resign.

561
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,650
If not Dr. Prakan,

562
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,910
there's nothing else that can hold you back, right?

563
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,030
♫I'll love you to the fullest♫

564
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,240
♫I'll love you to the utmost♫

565
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:33,300
♫As greatest as my heart allows♫

566
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,840
♫I'll give you every word of mine♫

567
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,880
♫I'll be with you till the end of my day♫

568
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,710
♫I'll keep my love for only you♫
