Yeah. If you met him just ask.

Thank you so much.

Really. You don't have to thank me.

138

It's me who have to thank you
for taking such a good care.

Oh! It's actually fine.

It's my job to do so.

In fact, I'm not giving you this flower
because of your job or anything.

I give it to you because I like you.

It's unethical for doctors to date with patients,
you know that right?

I know!

147
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,730
Then why did you let him flirt?

148
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,090
Mr. Taed is not a patient.

149
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,390
He is the father of my patient.

150
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,590
His son just got discharged out of the hospital.

151
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,790
Already has a family
but flirting with doctors still.

152
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,270
He's already divorced.

153
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,270
He's a single dad.

154
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,760
Trying to say all these,

155
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,740
Why? You have feelings for him?

156
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,170
Be careful!

157
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,170
You might got tricked by a widow.

158
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,170
I'm not afraid.

159
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,470
Come trick me please.

160
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,970
I've been single for so long.

161
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,170
Put it away of it for me too.

162
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,470
Ruined my mood.

163
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,530
You.

164
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,210
Sorry. I used your tent without asking.

165
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,330
I don't know whether
you want me to be with you or not.

166
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,890
So I just come stay outside.

167
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,050
I'm not that mean

168
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,690
You can stay wherever you feel

169
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,690
comfortable.

170
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,440
Then,

171
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
let's have some breakfast!

172
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,770
I bought some for you too.

173
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,870
You go ahead and eat.

174
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,870
I have something to do.

175
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,770
You're avoiding me because
I'm the same person with Sanya right?

176
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,970
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,970
Everything is just so sudden.

178
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,530
Give me some time.

179
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,450
You can go back first.

180
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,450
I don't know how long it will take.

181
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,650
This is so unbearable to see!

182
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,650
Huh?

183
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,650
That hot guy over there.

184
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,650
Instead of flirting with a young doctor like me,

185
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,010
he chose to flirt with Dr. Nuch.

186
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,650
Ugh! Life sucks.

187
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,370
It's not that big of a deal.

188
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,670
You're over reacting.

189
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,670
No, I'm not. The whole ward is talking about this.

190
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,650
Mr. Taed's profile is excellent!

191
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,610
He's a cypto king.

192
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,670
If someone got him as a husband,
then say good bye to tough shifts.

193
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,450
Spoil you all day all night.

194
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,450
You'll be provided for your whole life.

195
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,210
Nuch is also rich.

196
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,210
She probably doesn't care about the money

197
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,990
Money is just the topping.

198
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,990
Look at how he takes care of her.

199
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,410
Whose heart doesn't melt
by a great guy like that?

200
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,850
I might have to find
bridesmaid gown already.

201
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,330
It's so pretty.

202
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,570
Flowers in the morning,
then cake for the evening.

203
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,870
Does that widow have to take you home too?

204
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,030
So what?

205
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,870
You're so acting out,
when Prakan is not around.

206
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,870
Don't you think he'll be jealous?

207
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,170
Why would he be?

208
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,170
You cheated on him.

209
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,470
You should behave yourself more Nuch.

210
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,470
The whole ward is gossiping about you.

211
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,970
Yeah. You're always like this.

212
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,970
Always believe other people.

213
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,810
I'm telling you what I saw.

214
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,810
Then listen to me!

215
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,810
A.

216
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,569
Prakan and I are just friends.

217
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:22,569
B. You need to stop accusing me that I'm slutty.

218
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,569
And C. Hey!

219
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,550
It doesn't matter who gossips me,

220
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,850
you need to support me.

221
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,850
You are my friend!

222
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,850
I didn't wanna be your friend in the first place.

223
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,990
You don't allow me to even be your friend?

224
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,390
Sure! Then we don't have to be friends.

225
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,490
Wait, Nuch!

226
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,790
It's not like that.

227
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,750
Give me some time.

228
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,750
You can go back first.

229
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,250
I don't know how long it will take.

230
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,850
Doctor.

231
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,110
I told you.

232
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,910
I need time.

233
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,560
Can you just not

234
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,090
I have to.

235
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,770
Then I will go myself.

236
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,050
Stop avoiding me.

237
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,850
There's something you should know.

238
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,050
About your father.

239
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,870
Can I have one more of this?

240
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,870
Hey! Easy!

241
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,410
Easy!

242
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,860
Hey you! For real?

243
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,150
You quit because you got
your heart broken by Dr. Prakan?

244
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,050
It's not like that.

245
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,670
So if Dr.Prakan agreed to date you,

246
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,670
would you still quit then?

247
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,110
Maybe not.

248
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,810
Now you admit it already

249
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,810
that you quit because you got rejected.

250
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,110
It's not the main reason.

251
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,970
But it makes it easier for me
to make the decision.

252
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,970
Where are you goin' then?

253
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,970
I'm going to be a nurse offshore.

254
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,850
In the middle of the ocean?

255
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,150
Yeah.

256
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,650
More money than here.

257
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,450
Apart from Dr.Prakan,

258
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,450
there's nothing else
that can hold you back right?

259
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,850
Hey!

260
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,850
Are you drunk?

261
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,030
Are you really quitting?

262
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,970
Yes.

263
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,370
Then I will quit too.

264
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,750
Why?

265
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,710
Because I am going to be
an offshore doctor with you.

266
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,030
Doctor!

267
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,830
I'm done.

268
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,830
I'm going offshore.

269
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,130
Sit straight.

270
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,330
Sir!

271
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,880
Can I have one more bottle?

272
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Go home, please. Where do you live!?

273
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
We are going to drill. No! We are going to drill.

274
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,870
Hey! You will be burned by the grill.

275
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,330
It's all burned.

276
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,330
Can I have one more of this?

277
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,330
There are still some left.

278
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,130
Sir!

279
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,430
Check, please.

280
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,590
Why do you have to drink this much?

281
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,590
One more bottle.

282
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,590
How can you be a doctor?

283
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,930
Stand up, Doctor.

284
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,930
Do you have a shift tomorrow?

285
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,670
Stay still.

286
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,830
Let's go.

287
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,830
Go to bed.

288
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,830
I'm not goin'.

289
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,130
You are so drunk, Doctor.

290
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,130
Can you just not go?

291
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,130
Not go where? You should go to bed.

292
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,130
Can you don't leave me?

293
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,910
Go get some sleep.

294
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,910
Doctor!

295
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,910
Doctor!

296
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,210
Go get some rest.

297
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,710
I'm asking for only tonight.

298
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:10,810
Ugh! Go home and sleep.

299
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,810
Stay with me.

300
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,710
I think...

301
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,710
I'm about to kiss you.

302
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,830
I'm goin' in.

303
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,770
That felt good!

304
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,310
But I'm all conscious.

305
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,670
I know what am I doing.

306
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,110
And I also know what I want.

307
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,210
I

308
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,210
want you.

309
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,510
You're so beautiful, Doctor.

310
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,110
Whose heart doesn't melt
by a great guy like that?

311
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,610
I might have to find
bridesmaid gown already.

312
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,590
How great can he be?

313
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,930
Medical record department?

314
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,230
I'm Dr. Metha.

315
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,530
I need a medical record of Mr. Taed Siriwatid.

316
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,070
Could you please email me?

317
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,670
Can you tell me now?

318
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,670
What did my dad do?

319
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,510
You dad didn't do anything.

320
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,510
But he left you a message.

321
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,510
A message?

322
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,990
Can you tell me though?

323
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,110
According to soul reaper's rule, I can't tell you.

324
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,310
But I will.

325
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,310
Don't!

326
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,030
Your dad...

327
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,030
Stop!

328
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,670
I don't want you

329
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,130
to be punished because of me.

330
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,590
But I'm willing to be punished,

331
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,230
so you can understand everything.

332
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,830
I've never told you before
because you didn't remember anything.

333
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,510
But now you remember all of it.

334
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,510
I have to tell you.

335
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,600
The day your dad died,

336
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,390
I was the one who took his soul.

337
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,210
Your time here has ended, sir.

338
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,210
Mr...

339
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,670
Chanapai Pitakjiti.

340
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,010
Doctor.

341
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,710
Do you know me?

342
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,590
I normally remember people really well.

343
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,990
But why I do not recognize you at all.

344
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,030
Were you my patient?

345
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,050
Actually,

346
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,050
I'm a soul reaper. I'm here to take your soul.

347
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,110
I know I'm dead.

348
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,510
But I have something important
I need to tell my son.

349
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,850
If not then I cannot leave this world peacefully.

350
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,010
Can you please take me to my son?

351
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,710
I'm afraid I cannot do that.

352
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,050
Then,

353
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,510
I'm asking you to tell my son for me.

354
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,990
I'm begging you.

355
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,990
Please tell him for me.

356
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,230
Please go tell my son.

357
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,390
His name is Prakan.

358
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,350
Prakan Pitakjiti.

359
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,390
Prakan deserves to know

360
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,670
that his father didn't do anything wrong.

361
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,990
You father

362
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,990
didn't steal my heart for you.

363
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,050
After I died,

364
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,570
I donated my body.

365
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:54,310
My organs were distributed to whom were waiting.

366
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,910
The first person who supposed to get my heart

367
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,170
already died.

368
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,170
Then the second guy,

369
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,170
our hearts did not match.

370
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,890
So my heart went to you at the end.

371
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,990
Everything was all fate.

372
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,410
It was not because of Dr. Chanapai.

373
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,290
And why didn't he tell me the truth?

374
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,970
Why did he let people spread the rumor
that he cheated?

375
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,870
I'm so ashamed.

376
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,590
You know what?

377
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,490
The heart that saved my son's life

378
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,190
was the heart of a young guy named Sanya.

379
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,530
He was my patient.

380
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,130
He was a friend of my son.

381
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,770
The moment I knew that
Sanya's heart matches with Prakan.

382
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,170
I was so happy

383
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,230
that the previous cases didn't get Sanya's heart.

384
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,490
A doctor shouldn't think that way.

385
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,930
I was so glad

386
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,640
that the heart turned out
to be for my son.

387
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,280
I was glad that other people die,

388
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,290
and Prakan gets to survive.

389
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,450
No matter what people call me bad or a cheater,

390
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,690
I was not in the place to argue with them.

391
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,490
I was a really selfish doctor.

392
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,610
You weren't selfish.

393
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,170
You were just being a father.

394
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,290
You father wanted you to survive

395
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,370
and ended up feeling guilty
with his profession.

396
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,630
When he wanted to tell you the truth,
it was already too late.

397
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,210
That's it.

398
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,290
A message he wanted to let you know.

Too many 'Too lates' with too many things.

400
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,450
I went to see my mother too late.

401
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,410
My father came to me too late.

402
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,270
If I'd understood everything sooner,

403
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,370
it would have been better.

404
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,290
There's one thing that is not too late

405
