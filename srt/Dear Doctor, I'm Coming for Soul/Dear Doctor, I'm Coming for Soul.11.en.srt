If you wanna see more, become a soul reaper then.

83

If you are a soul reaper,
you can watch over him for a really long time.

84

But just only watching, they cannot see us.

Who's that?

171
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,210
Dr. Natee!

172
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,890
This room.

173
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,190
This position.

174
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,190
Seems familiar, right?

175
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,590
Hey, get off!

176
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,670
I swapped shift with Dr. Ta.

177
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,350
You didn't see the name list at all?

178
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,670
Oh!

You're back, Dr. Prakan?

181

Yes. It's me alive.

182
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,710
Not some angels.

183
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,710
I bought you some Mung Bean Custard.

Hey!

186
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,770
Are you telling be that
your dad was being framed?

187
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,710
Yeah. But can you lower your voice down a bit?

188
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,270
The whole hospital might hear it already.

189
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,270
No, but like how did you find out?

190
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,270
Wait, where did you hear it from?

191
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,990
What are you gonna do now?

192
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,990
It doesn't matter where did I hear it,

193
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,990
but what matter is that
you need to help me find the evidence

194
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,470
that I received my heart rightfully.

195
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,470
Not because my dad cheated for me.

196
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,830
Where do we supposed to look for?

197
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,710
I remember

198
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,710
that after my surgery,

199
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,150
the recipient before me was dead
and nobody knew.

200
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,350
That's why everyone thought
my father cheated on that guy for me.

201
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,450
If we can find this case,

202
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,060
it should be the answer

203
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,450
why he didn't receive his heart.

204
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,450
Wait!

205
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,270
You.

I have the right to know, don't I?

00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,500
Prakan! Why did you bring Tuaphee
to such a dusty place like this?

215
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,750
He can do it.

216
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,630
He's not gonna die.

217

If there's nothing then it's over.

that the documents were already destroyed?

It could be.

[Pitakjiti Hospital]

233
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,810
Why are you showing me
a heart recipient paper from 20 years ago?

234
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,230
So you can see

235
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,800
that the document

236
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,960
is a different story that you told everyone.

237
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,930
I think both of you are misunderstanding.

238
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,790
No.

239
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,270
I remember exactly what you said.

240
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,470
Uncle Chanapai skipped the queue for Prakan.

241
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,530
That reduced credibility of the board.

242
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,800
Shareholders started withdrawing
from Pitakjiti's stock.

243
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,730
You told me

244
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,730
that my father did it because he loved me.

245
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,730
Love

246
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,730
that made him disregard doctor's ethics.

247
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,450
However, these documents say otherwise.
My father didn't do it.

248
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,730
My heart I received was rightfully mine.

was just a rumor.

If you don't have the evidence that
it was me who started the rumor,

254
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,630
then don't frame me.

Uncle Raam who is so kind,

269
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,930
could serve VVIP.

270

324

Are you worried about that doctor?

325
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,950
Are you afraid that he will miss you?

No.

327
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,310
I'm afraid that he will blame himself

I'll be punished in the underworld.

I'm reading a research paper.

I'm thinking whether which course should I train,

346

and do it on my own.

I'm having brown rice. Better for your health.

358
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,170
I'm so glad that Dr. Prakan is back to work.

00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,170
I thought I would have to be here without a resident.

I thought you wanted
to be in Dr. Metha team in the beginning?

Previously, Dr. Prakan looks a bit overwhelming.

but after working with him
now I know he's really good at his job.

Not only Dr. Prakan who is back to work,

364
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,830
but Keeta also withdrew
his resignation request as well.

365

Luckily, Mueangram got fired
before signing the resignation for Keeta.

366

Hey! So they both are back at the same time like this,

367
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,370
does it have any significant meaning behind it?

00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,020
How?

674
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,890
Well.

675
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,890
It's just that I can go see you wherever or whenever.

676
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,990
Stop! Do you wanna watch together?

677
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,790
Yes, sir.
