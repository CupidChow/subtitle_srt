00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,710
The Ursa Major.

170
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,710
And that,

171
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,110
is the Cassiopeia.
(Bat star in Thai)

172
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,430
If you draw a line from this star to this star,

173
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,860
you will find the North star!

174
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,490
So?

175
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,970
You are lost at the moment!

176
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,170
That's why I told you to find the North Star!

177
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,810
Actually, I have my own North Star as well.

178
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,910
You've got  problem with me drinking? Huh!?

179
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,220
How dare you stare at me like that!

180
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,580
Don't you dare!

181
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,850
Do not hurt my son!

182
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,840
He is also my son.

183
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,920
Why can't I hit him?

184
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,310
You hurt me, I can handle it.

185
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,900
But if you hurt him, I cannot stand that!

186
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,579
You're challenging me Dao!?

187
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,829
Dad!!

188
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,310
Yeah!

189
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,310
Do it! Slap me!

190
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,160
But this is gonna be the last time
that you will hurt me and my son.

191
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,510
We won't come back here again.

192
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,320
Mom!

193
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,470
Let's go. Don't live with him.

194
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,470
He's crazy. He's a crazy person!

195
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,770
Go!

196
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,070
You guys go to hell!!

197
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,570
Here.

198
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,830
We just have to use the candle for now.

199
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,700
I will get paid tomorrow,

200
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,250
and I will pay the utility bill right away.

201
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,510
Mom!

202
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,810
Are you working way too hard?

203
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,510
Not at all. I'm fine.

204
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,960
I don't wanna take medical exam anymore.

205
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,110
I wanna quit and work to help you.

206
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,290
No you cannot!

207
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,380
Tee has to be a doctor!

208
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,390
I don't understand, mom.

209
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,710
Tee!

210
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,810
I want you to have a better life.

211
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,010
There's not many jobs, son,

212
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,050
that will change our lives.

213
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,170
If you can do it,

214
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,190
why would you lose this opportunity?

215
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,310
Please.

216
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,270
Be a doctor for me, Tee.

217
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,340
Please.

218
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,600
Since then,

219
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,870
I try to do everything to become a doctor.

220
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,720
I want to see my mom happy.

221
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,140
And today,

222
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,250
that guy is back to my life.

223
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,080
A nightmare for me and my mom.

224
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,390
Is your mother still your North Star?

225
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,510
If your happiness is your mom,

226
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,040
then do what makes your mom happy.

227
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,420
But you have to ask yourself to be sure,

228
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,510
that what you choose really does make her happy.

229
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,190
I don't know.

230
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,580
No need to hurry.

231
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,170
North Star is not going anywhere.

232
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm scared.

233
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm scared that I'm not going to find it.

234
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,110
Why would you be?

235
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,410
Here!

236
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,410
Here's your Ursa Major.

237
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,750
You're the Ursa Major!?

238
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,620
Mmm!

239
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,140
Only Bat star is good enough for you.

240
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,020
I don't care what you want me to be.

241
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,410
I'm fine with anything.

242
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,310
When I was young,

243
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,230
I had a heart disease.

244
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,340
My parents didn't want me to be a doctor.

245
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,690
They were afraid that I would be stressed,

246
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,510
and wouldn't be able to handle it.

247
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,730
But I insisted that I will become a doctor.

248
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,170
So my parents,

249
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,630
did everything in their power,

250
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,640
to support me.

251
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,810
My mom had been taking me to the temple every Sunday,

252
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,810
and praying in the hope that
I would get a donated heart someday.

253
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,110
Now I am doctor.

254
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,950
But is there any good in it,

255
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,410
when I have no one left there for me?

256
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,610
When you said you have no one left,

257
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,010
you might actually hurt
someone by your side's feeling.

258
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,340
You know what?

259
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,660
The phrase "someone by your side"

260
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,560
is not only who is close to you,

261
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,880
but it's also someone you can trust as well.

262
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,570
A person who didn't tell me
that my mother was about to die,

263
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,640
shouldn't have the right to say that.

264
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,710
Be honest with me,

265
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,390
when you went to take my mother's soul,

266
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,750
did you ever think of me?

267
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,880
Who is it?

268
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,010
I told you I wanna go home.

269
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,410
If you won't let me go home, then just go away!

270
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,620
You cannot go home yet.

271
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,750
You just came out of the surgery.

272
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,310
We have to monitor you for a bit longer.

273
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,060
Natee.

274
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,710
Your case owner told me that

275
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,500
you had high level of alcohol in your blood.

276
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,390
You probably drank a lot, huh?

277
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,550
That's why this accident happened.

278
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,390
Yeah, right!

279
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,950
I'm an alcoholic!

280
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,430
I'm not as great as you and your darn mother!

281
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,510
Yes.

282
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,970
You can be this rude,

283
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,850
that means you're fine.

284
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,190
I'm not as worried anymore.

285
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,380
Natee.

286
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,090
I...

287
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,710
I'm sorry, son.

288
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,360
Good luck, sir.

289
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,810
Is there anything I can help, Dr. Nuch?

290
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,220
Oh!

291
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,020
Nothing. It's just

292
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,410
Metha's mom told me to check on him.

293
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,610
She said he hasn't gone home at all.

294
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,510
He took care of Dr. Prakan's case.

295
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,510
That's why he couldn't go home.

296
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,990
Take care of Prakan's case?

297
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,260
Well...

298
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,640
Why don't they find a part-time
or new doctors instead?

299
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,930
I saw Dr. Metha keeps
the resignation letter to himself.

300
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,270
The board still hasn't heard
about Dr. Prakan's resignation actually.

301
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,550
[I'm sorry]

302
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,310
I just checked his temperature a few hours ago.

303
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,840
What should we do?

304
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,560
You go inform the staffs first.

305
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,390
Yes!

306
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,510
What happened?

307
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,690
Mr. Nonsri is gone.

308
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,110
Mom!

309
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,670
Tee!

310
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,200
How's everything?

311
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,180
Still missing.

312
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,830
Do you have any idea where Mr. Nonsri might go?

313
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,330
Dad!

314
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,410
Non!

315
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,350
Dr. Natee, he doesn't look good!

316
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,810
The incision is open. There's a lot of blood.

317
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,410
Seems like he's in shock.

318
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,620
Call the ambulance now!

319
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,810
Yes!

320
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,530
Non!

321
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,570
Non!

322
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,710
You have to survive, Non!

323
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,510
Dad!

324
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,310
Dad! Don't fall asleep! Can you hear me!?

325
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,700
Dad!

326
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,310
You're gonna be okay!

327
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,310
Tee, help your father please.

328
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,310
Help him!

329
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,350
Non!

330
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,340
Dad! Stay awake!

331
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,020
Can you hear me!?

332
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,390
Non!

333
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,440
Don't fall asleep.

334
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,220
Can you hear me, dad!?

335
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,600
Non!

336
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,770
- Dad!
- Non!

337
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,150
I want to be alone.

338
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,350
It's me.

339
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,940
What do you need?

340
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,400
What do I need?

341
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,260
You didn't answer my calls!

342
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,890
I just want to be alone.

343
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,820
Hey!

344
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,990
You've been alone your whole life
is not enough already?

345
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,400
You!

346
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,930
The idea that you think Metha hates you
because he wants the hospital,

347
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,230
That I'm on his side because I like him.

348
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,130
That your dad whom you used to adore,
turned out to be selfish.

349
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,880
And that you only had your mother?

350
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Or it's actually because of you

351
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,760
- who never opens up to anyone?
- What's the point!?

352
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,430
Did you know

353
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,880
that Metha is taking care of your case right now?

354
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,170
He also didn't pass on
your resign letter to the board as well.

355
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,040
Did you know that?

356
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
You still can change your mind!

357
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,940
I won't!

358
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,330
Sure. You don't have to change your mind.

359
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,060
But mark my word!

360
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,630
One day, if you find yourself alone,

361
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,850
please be aware that it's because of yourself.

362
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,160
So what?

363
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,790
If I changed my mind, would the past also change?

364
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,560
That patient ended up dead anyway!

365
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,100
I cannot win the death. Can you hear me!?

366
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,520
Prakan is still out of his mind.

367
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,120
I will leave him to you then, Tua.

368
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,850
It might take some time,

369
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,730
but I think he'll be better eventually.

370
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,670
Sure.

371
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,890
Oh! Look at that!

372
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,310
He still hasn't checked on his mother's belongings.

373
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,130
This box belonged to his mother.

374
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,510
I never understand.

375
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,110
He never accepts the truth like this,

376
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,110
and when will he move on?

377
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,650
Please take care of him for me.

378
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,120
Excuse me. I'll leave him to you then.

379
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,770
[Metha]

380
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,290
Finally answered!

381
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,630
Doctor!

382
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,950
I just wanna let you know

383
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,400
Your patient,

384
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,890
who was in the factory collapse,

385
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,990
Mr. Satja,

386
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,910
actually survived!

387
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,850
Even though you couldn't save Aunt Pranee,

388
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,170
but you saved another life.

389
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,000
That's all.

390
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,420
Humans are confusing and strange.

391
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,050
Please stay with us!

392
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,270
They try so hard and put so much effort,

393
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,720
to win over the death.

394
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,200
But they don't actually
give their lives meaningful purposes,

395
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,220
when they were alive.

396
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,990
Humans often face with the word,

397
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,890
"Too late"

398
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,950
because they will never know their death

399
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,940
in advance.

400
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,900
When you were a kid,

401
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,390
your father worked so hard, remember?

402
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,550
He had to work so hard,

403
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:47,220
because it was the very beginning of our hospital.

404
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,450
It was also completely strange,

405
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:55,080
that my son was never feel neglected by him.

406
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,200
But you were glad,

407
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,560
you ran to me and said,

408
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,360
that you want to be a doctor when you grow up.

409
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,580
Do you remember?

410
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,660
You told me that

411
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,740
if you become a doctor,

412
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,800
you will help your dad,

413
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,090
so he doesn't have to work too hard.

414
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,980
You told him that he had some sort of super power.

415
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,050
He could use the two of his hands,

416
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,350
his super power to save dying people,

417
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,350
and bring their lives back.

418
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,490
I know it's difficult

419
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,350
to believe that he didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,020
You know that right?

421
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,050
The heart in your chest, in your body,

422
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,920
is the heart that he didn't steal it from anyone.

423
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,190
That heart belongs to you.

424
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,410
I hope you will be stronger more,

425
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,840
by the time you read this letter.

426
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
I hope my letter,

427
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,750
will help you get through everything.

428
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,730
And your father's love

429
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,450
will bring you special power.

430
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,220
Love you with all my heart,

431
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,480
