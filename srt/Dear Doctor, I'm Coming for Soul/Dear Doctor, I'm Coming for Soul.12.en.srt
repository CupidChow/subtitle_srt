Are you telling me that your dad was being framed?

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,330
It was 20 years ago.

Hey!

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,230
I think both of you are misunderstanding.

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,030
If you don't have the evidence, then don't frame me.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,810
What about these documents?

10
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,430
Are they enough to press charges?

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,630
It's time for you to say good bye to your position,

You have to be okay.

00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,830
How is she?

20
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,750

Are you home?

23
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,140
He's gone.

24
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,910
Gone where?

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,490
To the underworld.

26
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,490
How long is he gonna be gone?

27
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,190
The time over there runs faster than here.

28
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,190

You've reported yourself too late.

31
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,270
I just finished my mission.

32
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,570
A mission?

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,570
Human mission is not soul reapers' concern.

34
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,030
You're guilty

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,729
of exposing dead soul's last word to a human.

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,750
Do you plead guilty?

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,050
I plead guilty.

38
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,229
You will be suspended from working.

39
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,530
You're forbidden from contacting
other soul reapers and human world.

40
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,170
Sir.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,170
If I served all my time,

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,750
would I still be able to go back to human world?

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,750
Yes.

44
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,750
Do you have someone you care for in human world?

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,970
Sir.

46
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,390
My crime right now,

47
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,090
is exposing dead soul's last word to human.

48
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,870
But if I serve all my time here,

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,870
and go back to live a couple life

50
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,710
with a human,

51
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,710
is this against the underworld rule?

52
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,690
Soul reaper loving human,

53
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,490
is not forbidden according to the underworld rule.

54
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,170
This is because

55
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,750
soul reaper who loves human

56
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,870

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,700
Hey.

60
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,210
How long are you gonna stare at me like that?

61
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,170
How long will you let me?

62
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,970
You're crazy!

63
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,970
What's got into you?

64
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,630
If you have something to do, just go.

65
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,550
Go check on your patients.

66
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,850
Don't sitting around watching me. I'm okay.

67
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,550
I'm not here to see if you're okay or not.

68
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,550
I want to be here, that's why I'm here.

69
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,350
You are scaring me.

70
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,710
Nuch.

71
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,730
To be honest,

72
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,340
when you were about to die,

73
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,990
I was almost gone crazy.

74
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,980
There're millions of things
I wanna tell you but I couldn't.

75
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,990
So many things popped up in my head.

76
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,190
I only asked myself

77
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,950
if something happened to you,

78
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,110
what would I do?

79
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,530
You don't have to say those million words.

80
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,230
I only want one word.

81
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,990
If I really was dying,

82
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,990
what would you say to me?

83
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,090
Can I say two words?

84
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,090
What?

85
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,750
Actually two sentences.

86
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750
Just say it!

87
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,720
I love you

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,570

89
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,490
Um, that's it.

90
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,350
That's it?

91
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,630
Um.

92
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,630
What do you mean by that's it?

93
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,510
Nothing.

94
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,810
Nuch!

95
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,810
- What about you?
- Mmh.

96
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,410
What do you think?

97
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,610
Nuch!

98
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,550
There's something going on
between you two that I need to know?

99
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,260
Such as relationship.

100
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,350
Nothing.

101
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,430
Just two people working together.

102
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
Nothing more than that.

103
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,270
Doctor!

104
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,270
Dr. Natee!

105
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,270
Why would you say that to Dr. Prakan?

106
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,270
It's the truth.

107
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,910
We're more than just two working people.

108
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,070
Is that really?

109
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,620
If you are gonna use me to get Dr. Prakan's attention,

110
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,669
I think you should stop.

111
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,669
What are you talkin' about?

112
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,870
Even though I like you

113
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,270
but I'm not stupid!

114
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,470
Stop bothering me.

115
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,570
Can you stop running away from me?

116
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,070
It's you who should stop bothering me.

117
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,070
How can I stop bothering
a person that I wanna be with?

118
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,470
You wanna be with me?

119
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,770
You continue working here because of Dr. Prakan.

120
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,070
You're so good at imagination, huh?

121
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,070
Have I ever said that I stay because of Dr. Prakan?

122
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,890
I stay because of you.

123
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,550
You see me as a rebound

124
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,040
to save you from loneliness.

125
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,050
To help you to move on faster, isn't it?

126
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,070
Stop thinking in that way, will you?

127
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,070
I've moved on from Dr. Prakan long ago.

128
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,890
And please stop

129
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,030
believing that you like me first, or like me more.

130
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,390
Because for me,

131
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,390
humans' hearts are equal.

132
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,590
No, it's not.

133
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,590
Rough size of a human's heart is the size of a fist.

134
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,250
And each person fist is different in size.

135
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,590
Well, it's...

136
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,590
it's not that different, perhaps?

137
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,830
Liking sooner or later, at the end,
you'll like each other with your whole heart.

138
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,210
So...

139
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,590
Do you wanna to try dating each other?

140
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,830
Here.

141
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,260
This

142
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,670
is my heart.

143
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,270
And this is yours.

144
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,190
Can you see that my heart is bigger than yours?

145
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,770
So that means one day
I might like you more than you like me.

146
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,030
No way.

147
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,830
What can I do to make you believe me?

148
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,820
No.

149
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,830
It's not that I don't believe you.

150
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,440
I just know

151
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,750
that I can like you more, everyday.

152
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,310
Even today,

153
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,220
I even like you more than yesterday.

154
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,410
So...

155
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,410
does this mean...

156
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,790
that we're together?

157
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,420
Huh?

158
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,130
Mmm.

159
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,270
We can try.

160
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,570
Yay!

161
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,710
Playing hard to get for so long!

162
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,710
Tell me, what have I done
to make you think I'm not serious?

163
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,590
- Hey! you...
- I'm so obvious.

164
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,590
I'm a doctor.

165
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,590
You even must know! Why you're so clueless?

166
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,490
Your hair is all messy.

167
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,390
It's you.

168
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,690
Why? What's up? Why?

169
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,990
Kiss me again?

170
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,990
It was you who start our first kiss.

171
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,400
Then do it.

172
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,610
Oh, my god!

173
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,430
Why didn't you knock?

174
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,070
If I did,

175
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,070
I probably wouldn't see my cousin kissing my friend,

176
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,070
tangled up like that.

177
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,790
So what's the deal with you guys?

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,010
I'm not single.

179
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,310
Yeah, it's like I'm already taken.

180
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,130
I'm happy for both of you.

181
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,710
But you need to stop kissing,
the board is calling us to be in a meeting.

182
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,380
Been competing for so long,

183
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,190
today we will finally know

184
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,190
who's gonna be the new chief of surgery.

185
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,390
I will be back.

186
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,390
Um.

187
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,730
Come on.

188
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,730
Hey, confused much? What's so confusing?

[Meeting Room]

190
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,710
The new chief of surgery for Pitakjiti hospital,

191
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,640
is Dr. Prakan Pitakjiti.

192
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,550
Congratulations!

193
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,550
Cousin.

194
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,530
Yay!

195
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,690
Congrats.

196
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,370
You deserve it, boss!

197
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,080
Finally, our team won!

198
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,690
Either winning or losing,

199
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,690
we all have to work together anyway.

200
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,990
But in the beginning, we competed like crazy.

201
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,990
There was no friendship at all.

202
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,990
But

203
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,990
we do have it now.

204
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,190
So we need to celebrate then, shall we?

205
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,190
I have a shift tonight.

206
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,040
What about this Saturday?

207
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,890
Nuch also will be out of the hospital by then,

208
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,640
so we can celebrate together.

209
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,690
Oh!

210
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,290
Invite Tua too.

211
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,290
I haven't seen him for so long.

212
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,830
No need to.

213
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,830
He's not around.

214
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,710
Is he?

215
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,710
Not like he dumped you already?

216
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,710
No! He has not.

217
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,030
He'll be back.

218
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,650
Hello.

219
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,830
Hello?

220
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm A001.

221
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,160
Why did you call me?

222
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,490
How come you are here?

223
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,490
I didn't break any rules like you,

224
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,390
so I'm not forbidden from going to places.

225
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,190
So why did you call me?

226
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,590
You miss your doctor, right?

227
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,950
Well,

228
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,560
I just don't understand bro.

229
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,710
The God of Death just told me that

230
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,710
love that we share with human

231
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,710
will punish ourselves.

232
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,370
I don't understand how can love punish us?

233
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,170
The time you stuck here, only feels like a few days,

234
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,170
but the time in human world
that your doctor experiences,

235
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,170
feels like forever.

236
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,510
The day you'll finally get to live with him,

237
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,000
his time will gone by everyday.

238
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,390
He will be older already.

239
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,190
His body will be less healthy.

240
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,210
Or else,

241
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,210
he could die before the appropriate age and time.

242
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,010
Have you ever thought of that day?

243
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,210
That day that you look the same

244
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,210
but the doctor will be so old.

245
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,329
The day you walk besides him

246
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,190
and people think

247
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,329
that you are his son.

248
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,190
Have you ever thought of that day?

249
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:17,540
The day you will receive your doctor's ticket.

When you weren't around,

272

I'm not used to it at all.

No milk tea after a tough shift.

can we live together like this

Why?

285
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,790
You are a human.

We are too different.

290
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,150
I still have to do my job,

291

while you still have to save people's lives.

292
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,110
Stay together like this
would be problematic, don't you think?

293
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,610
You won't be happy for the rest of your life,

294
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,810
if you have to be with a soul reaper like me.

295
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,790
I really want you to be happy.

296
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,030
Have a normal life

297
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,030
in the way that it should be.

298
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,730
Don't think for me.

299
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,730
A person who waited 7 months for a soul reaper,

300
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,910
probably doesn't need a normal life
like other human already.

301
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,710
My happiness

302

is when I always have you with me.

303
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,750
I tried to live my life normally

304
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,250
when you weren't here.

305
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,250
But you know what?

306
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,250
Not a single day that I was happy.

307
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,350
Until today,

308

309
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,310

to be with you.

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,730
Go.

314
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,510
Okay.

315
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,040
Not too tired, right?

316
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,970
- Not at all.
- Mmm.

317
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,590
Okay.

318
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,680
Your result looks normal.

319
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,190
You heart condition is very good.

320
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,900
It's probably because I got a heart
from a really good person, Doctor.

321
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,110
Then you don't have to worry.

322
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:34,110
I saw you bought the full option
check-up program as well.

323
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,110
You act like you're a 50 years old.

324
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,510
Better check up before it's too late.

325
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,910
I don't want to die anytime soon.

326
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,210
I wanna live to see the world for a long time.

327
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,250
For about...

328
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,250
80-90 years old.

329
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,310
Let me ask you,

330
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,990
this world have something interesting
for you to stay that long?

331

Stop reading.

332
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,040
So,

333
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,740
how many more years do you have to work?

334
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,580
Well,

335
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,210
until the punishment is over.

336
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,230
Oh!

337
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,430
If that's the answer,
I would probably grow old and die first.

338
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,820
If you reach your time,

339
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,430
I will take you myself.

340
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,770
No.

Go together.

342
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,330
I'm gonna be an old guy
with the biggest biceps alive.

We will see.

344
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,550
If I grow old,

00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,650

My hair would also turn gray.

Would you still have the same feeling for me?

349
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,390
And if I do not grow old along with you,

would you still have the same feeling for me?

354
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,470
I would.

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,550
What?

356
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,550
You kissed me, so I kissed you back.

Are you a healthy guy now?

358
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,290
You should take care of your health too.

359

If you die first,

360

Nuch could have a new boyfriend.

361

Nuch cannot have a new boyfriend anymore.

Where has he gone?

He didn't go anywhere.

I'm so happy for you.

You burned all the Hawaiian shirts?

I only see you wearing working suit.

376
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,989
It's actually convenient.

377
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,870
I don't have to explain people

378
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,170
why do I look the same?

379

Why don't I age?

Aren't you uncomfortable?

381
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,600
You have to hide and not to be seen.

382
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,770
I only want to be seen by Dr. Prakan anyway.

When will you reborn again?

387
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,640
Well,

388
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,520
until there's no lost soul
like you left probably.

389

found my real home.

393
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,870
I often thought

394
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,950
why do we have to be born?

395
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,910
To find the meaning of life?

396
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,830
To do your passionate job?

397
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,990
To look for love?

398
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,150
Or to seek for happiness?

399
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,390
Nobody knows the correct answer.

But for me,

my answer,

00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,070
is to be born and meet you.
