1
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:47,041
Leave it here.

2
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,780
Nizi, Nizi

3
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,380
Just leave it to them to handle

4
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:54,820
Sit down

5
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,420
You haven't recovered from your injury yet

6
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,861
I'm almost recovered

7
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:00,021
Does it still hurt?

8
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,180
No, I feel much better

9
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,700
You should stretch it a little

10
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,980
How are your injuries?

11
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,021
Are you feeling better?

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,221
I'm much better now. I'm fine

13
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,100
This girl always thought she was fast

14
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:14,740
and fought with her life on the line

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,900
Can you be faster than bullets?

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,941
Nizi got injured

17
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,581
just to protect me

18
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,581
Your family saved my life

19
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,941
It's my duty to protect you, Mr. Sheng

20
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,061
You're a girl

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,540
Leave these dangerous things to me

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,781
What's wrong with me being a girl?

23
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:30,820
Can you run faster than me?

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,421
I...

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,581
Nizi

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,581
Zhuantou is just worried about you

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,301
But you should be careful next time

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,980
We've lost so many men

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,740
I can't afford to lose you

30
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,180
Mr. Sheng is such a good persuader

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,301
Nizi

32
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:04,501
What are you planning to do

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,221
after the war is over?

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,861
I want to go back to my hometown

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,581
after the war is over

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,421
I want to

37
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:26,101
repair my house

38
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,421
Tear down all the wood structure

39
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,541
and rebuild it with bricks and cement

40
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
This way, it would be more stable

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,861
It can shield me from wind and rain

42
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:38,381
By the way,

43
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,020
I will build an attic

44
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,460
on top of that

45
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:44,620
It will be warm in winter and cool in summer

46
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,421
Nizi

47
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:52,380
Don't you think we will be happy living together?

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,861
Nizi

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,541
Come, let's drink

50
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,381
Shaoli

51
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,381
You just got married

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,421
Why are you still frowning?

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
You know it, Commander

54
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,861
This marriage is just a stopgap for me

55
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,581
What's there to be happy about?

56
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,780
Stopgap?

57
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:27,340
When Zhong Wanruo was kidnapped,

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,500
you saved her like a hero

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,220
She probably will be grateful

60
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,940
to you for the rest of her life

61
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:37,981
What?

62
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,981
Do you think I was being too sentimental in this matter?

63
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,581
Shaoli

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,861
It's nothing wrong to be sentimental

65
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,821
What matters is

66
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:01,660
whether it will lead to a success or a failure

67
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,981
You are overthinking it, Commander

68
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,101
I thought these kidnappers yesterday

69
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,301
were coming for the Zhong family's weapons

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,741
With these imported weapon, one can conquer the world

71
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:18,741
I must be careful

72
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,100
I believe you will understand, Commander

73
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,779
You are right

74
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,980
Let's drink

75
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,780
Mrs. Mu

76
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,581
It's forbidden to open this box

77
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,220
Why?

78
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,501
I don't know

79
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,860
This is an order from Marshal Mu

80
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:04,980
Got it

81
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:07,581
It's almost done

82
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,261
You can leave now

83
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,141
Yes

84
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,741
Has my wife woken up?

85
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,021
Yes

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,419
Got it. You can leave now

87
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,261
Yes

88
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,501
This green hairband

89
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,419
Wanruo

90
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,701
Marshal

91
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:19,741
Oh, by the way,

92
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,419
since we're married,

93
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,140
I think I should

94
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,701
meet your family sooner or later

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,340
I wonder what family you have

96
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,261
Where is your hometown?

97
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,539
No need to ask

98
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,460
I have no parents

99
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,140
I was an orphan

100
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,539
Did you join the army at young age?

101
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:46,979
What?

102
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,381
I'm just curious

103
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:52,700
Have a good rest

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
I have military matters to attend to

105
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,660
What's going on?

106
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:14,700
Why does Mu Shaoli have

107
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,621
the hairband I gave to Zirun?

108
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:18,859
What did he have to do with Zirun?

109
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,061
Who on earth is he?

110
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,061
The box was opened

111
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,859
Wanruo must have seen the green hairband

112
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,021
No wonder she inquired about my background

113
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,299
I have to pay more attention to her actions

114
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:55,900
Otherwise,

115
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,021
I'll never find the truth

116
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,621
Send someone to

117
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,941
keep a close eye on Zhong Wanruo

118
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,181
Marshal

119
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,621
The two of you are married, after all

120
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,220
If Mrs. Mu

121
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,299
finds out about it, she will...

122
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:23,501
Then don't let her find out

123
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:24,700
Yes

124
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,340
Wanruo

125
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,341
How I wish to hear you say that

126
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,221
you didn't sell Liu Zirun out

127
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:40,981
Shaoli

128
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:43,981
Commander

129
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,501
You just got married

130
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,059
Why don't you spend more time with your wife?

131
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,981
Ms. Xin was frightened on the way to the wedding

132
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,221
So Wanruo wanted to visit her

133
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,381
She's fine

134
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,300
Thank you for your concern, Wanruo

135
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:00,940
The whole Mu City

136
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,180
is under your rule, Commander

137
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,381
Yet someone dared to cause trouble

138
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,101
at the wedding of Marshal and me

139
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,381
I wonder if you got any clues about it

140
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,940
You owe Marshal and I an explanation

141
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:14,261
Explanation?

142
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,020
Explanation to whom?

143
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,341
It takes two palms to make clap

144
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,261
Why did they kidnap you but not someone else?

145
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:22,819
Don't forget what you did back then

146
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:24,939
Bitch is a bitch!

147
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:26,419
Even if the situation is getting worse,

148
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,861
you won't become noble

149
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,861
How dare you hit me!

150
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,261
Zhong Wanruo!

151
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:41,981
Wanruo

152
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:44,461
I showed you respect because

153
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:45,741
your are Muli's wife

154
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,180
But

155
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,420
not just anybody can hit

156
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:53,221
the member of the Xia family

157
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:54,621
Commander

158
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,180
You got me wrong

159
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,460
I just want to prove it to Miss Xia

160
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:01,501
that a single palm can clap as well

161
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:02,300
You!
