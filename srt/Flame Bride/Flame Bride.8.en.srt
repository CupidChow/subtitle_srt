1
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:43,876
It takes two palms to make clap

2
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,738
Why did they kidnap you but not someone else?

3
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,915
Don't forget what you did back then

4
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:50,337
Bitch is a bitch!

5
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:52,208
Even if the situation is getting worse,

6
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,528
you won't become noble

7
00:00:58,008 --> 00:00:59,486
How dare you hit me!

8
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,767
Zhong Wanruo!

9
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:07,408
Wanruo

10
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,927
I showed you respect because

11
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,327
your are Muli's wife

12
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:12,967
But

13
00:01:13,568 --> 00:01:15,048
not just anybody can hit

14
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:19,087
the member of the Xia family

15
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:20,447
Commander

16
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,927
You got me wrong

17
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,407
I just want to prove it to Miss Xia

18
00:01:24,408 --> 00:01:27,087
that a single palm can clap as well

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:27,887
You!

20
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:33,688
Wanruo

21
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:37,688
You were almost kidnapped in Mu City

22
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,288
I indeed owe you an explanation

23
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:40,247
Brother

24
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,128
Look what you said!

25
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:44,488
Hurry up and apologize

26
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:55,768
Don't you want to visit Ms. Xin?

27
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:56,807
Go to find her then

28
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:58,688
I have something important to discuss with Commander

29
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:05,288
Commander

30
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:06,288
Sorry for the awkwardness

31
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:12,927
Zhong Wanruo has a glib tongue

32
00:02:13,327 --> 00:02:15,528
Can you handle her?

33
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,688
Can you get the information about those weapons out of her?

34
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,128
Rest assured, Commander

35
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:21,486
I'll send someone to keep an eye on her

36
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:32,207
This batch of weapons can help us conquer the world

37
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,128
So

38
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:37,486
Where exactly did Zhong Wanruo hide them?

39
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:43,008
Have you searched her trading firm

40
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:44,647
and family property?

41
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,088
Marshal

42
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:53,528
The tea is still warm

43
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:54,887
They definitely haven't gone far

44
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,887
The Zhong family has been destroyed

45
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,487
But this room is clean and tidy

46
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:02,207
and someone is living here

47
00:03:03,368 --> 00:03:04,647
Who could this person be?

48
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:16,848
Zhong Xin

49
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,767
Miss Zhong

50
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:18,568
Why are you here?

51
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,568
I'm worried about you

52
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,886
I'm fine

53
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:22,568
By the way,

54
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,487
did you find out who sent these men to attack you?

55
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:26,767
I don't even have to think

56
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,487
It had to be Xia Rubing

57
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:33,726
It's not easy for women to survive in this era

58
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,767
She is a woman as well

59
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,368
Why did she try to hurt you?

60
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,568
She loves Mu Shaoli

61
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:42,128
Xia Rubing is cruel and merciless

62
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,368
You must be careful

63
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:45,848
Don't worry

64
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:48,088
They don't dare to hurt me for the time being

65
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:50,166
You're Marshal Mu's wife now

66
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,368
He will definitely protect you

67
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,167
What's wrong?

68
00:03:58,727 --> 00:03:59,808
Zhong Xin

69
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,088
You've been with Xia Jun for so long

70
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:05,047
Have you ever heard him talk about

71
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,927
Mu Shaoli's family background?

72
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,808
For example, his hometown,

73
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,207
and his parents

74
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:12,008
I only know that

75
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:13,688
he has no parents now

76
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,168
He's joined the army since he was a child

77
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,128
Later, he saved Xia Jun in a war and got promoted

78
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,887
After that, he achieved many meritorious deeds

79
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,887
He defeated the Shengs' Army time and again

80
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:32,008
Miss Zhong, I mean no offense,

81
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:33,167
but on your wedding day,

82
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,527
when Marshal Mu heard you were kidnapped,

83
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:35,607
he rushed to save you at once

84
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,767
It means that he has feelings for you

85
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,488
Miss Zhong

86
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:46,928
You're a woman

87
00:04:46,928 --> 00:04:48,488
You should make good use of your advantages

88
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,327
What's more, in Mu City

89
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,488
only Marshal Mu can

90
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:53,728
fight against Xia Jun

91
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,287
If

92
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:59,488
you can win Marshal Mu over to our side...

93
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:07,327
Zhong Wanruo

94
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,488
Don't think that your position is secure now

95
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,168
just because you married Shaoli

96
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,767
Whether my position is secure or not

97
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,407
is none of your business, Miss Xia

98
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:15,928
Just you wait!

99
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:17,728
I won't let you off!

100
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,207
Do as you please

101
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,488
Miss Xia

102
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:34,527
What are you doing?

103
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:36,008
Tell me

104
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,928
What did Zhong Wanruo tell you?

105
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:39,128
Nothing

106
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,087
She just thanked me for my help that day

107
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:43,128
Help?

108
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,447
You traitor!

109
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:46,808
Who allowed you to help her?

110
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:48,808
I just thought

111
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:52,168
Marshal and Commander are sworn brothers

112
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,087
I'm warning you

113
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,608
You are a member of Commander's Mansion

114
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,287
If you dare meddle in affairs of Marshal's Mansion,

115
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,847
you will be in big trouble

116
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:14,887
Shaoli

117
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:15,887
Don't forget

118
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,447
to drop by with Wanruo

119
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,808
when you are free

120
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:21,207
And Wanruo,

121
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,168
take this place as your home

122
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,447
So please do come often

123
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,447
We'll go back first, Commander

124
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,248
Alright

125
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,207
Take care

126
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,568
Get someone to keep an eye on them

127
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,368
Don't neglect even the slightest actions

128
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:46,168
Yes, Commander

129
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:03,407
What?

130
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,087
Wanna cast me aside as soon as you're done using me?

131
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:07,048
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:09,407
Didn't you hold my arm on purpose just now?

133
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,767
Since you were afraid of Xia Jun getting back at you,

134
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,808
why did you slap Xia Rubing?

135
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,048
What?

136
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:19,368
You didn't blame her for hiring men to kidnap me,

137
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:21,447
but blamed me for taking revenge on her

138
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,407
You have to be strong enough to seek revenge

139
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:24,847
You're taking advantage of my power now

140
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,048
You are like an ass in a lion's skin

141
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:29,808
To dig into it,

142
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,527
she was so hostile to me

143
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:32,688
just because of you

144
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:36,008
Judging by your words,

145
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,407
are you jealous?

146
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:40,568
Marshal

147
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,488
Don't flatter yourself

148
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,728
You can make do with it however you like

149
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:46,887
It has nothing to do with me

150
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:48,287
Just don't get me involved

151
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,128
You kept bothering me, Mr. Sheng

152
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,967
Don't you think you've gone too far?

153
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:15,048
This matter is very important to me

154
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:17,048
I have to know where my father is

155
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:18,688
No matter

156
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:19,928
how many times you're gonna ask me,

157
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:22,608
I can only tell you that I don't know

158
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,488
Besides, I'm looking for him as well

159
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,048
You are looking for him?

160
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:28,287
What?

161
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:29,847
Do you want to pay off your father's debts?

162
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:32,047
What do you mean by that?

163
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,128
What does my father owe you?

164
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:39,088
He owes me the lives of dozens of my family members

165
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:40,368
Impossible!

166
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:41,887
My father is not that kind of person

167
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,368
What kind of person do you think he is?

168
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,567
In your eyes, he might be a good father

169
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:49,047
He spent all his effort to nurture you

170
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,847
But have you ever thought

171
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,727
what kind of lives the commoners were living

172
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,848
in Mu City under his rule?

173
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:02,248
You saw Ms. Liu with me last time

174
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:05,527
But today, you didn't point your gun at me

175
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,407
Instead, you asked me about it peacefully

176
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,608
You has found something, hasn't you?

177
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,887
I misunderstood you before

178
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:16,128
Since you were in love with Liu Zirun,

179
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,448
why did you marry me?

180
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:19,687
Do you really have no idea?

181
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,287
If your father

182
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:26,047
hadn't threatened me

183
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,287
with my family's lives

184
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:29,328
I wouldn't have agreed to marry you

185
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,248
I came to you not for those weapons

186
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,608
I just want to know where my father is

187
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,767
Leave. This isn't a place for you

188
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:47,848
Are you sure it's Sheng Shihua?

189
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:49,167
Yes

190
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:51,328
I have no reason to lie to

191
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,647
accuse your wife of cheating

192
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,088
I have no reason to lie

193
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,328
to make you wear the horns

194
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:58,567
I'm the sister of a Commander

195
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,926
Why would I lie about that?

196
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:16,728
What are you thinking about?

197
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:21,848
Nothing

198
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:23,926
Nothing?

199
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,208
You are thinking about Sheng Shihua, right?

200
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,807
Sure enough, you are

201
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,208
What on earth do you want?
