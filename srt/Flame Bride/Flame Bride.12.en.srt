1
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,289
Is everything ready for the wedding tomorrow?

2
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,706
We've got everything for the wedding

3
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,314
Remember to make all routes clear

4
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:51,259
Don't worry, Marshal

5
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,457
Nothing will go wrong this time

6
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,979
This is the guest list for tomorrow

7
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,378
Invite 30% more guests

8
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:03,738
I want to have a grand wedding

9
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:04,579
Yes

10
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,659
When shall I pick up my bride tomorrow morning?

11
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:08,219
8 a.m.

12
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:10,059
Wait for me at my door at 7 a.m.

13
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,178
Are you...?

14
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,659
I will pick her up personally

15
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,779
But last time

16
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,377
you didn't pick up Mrs. Mu in person

17
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:22,978
If she finds out,

18
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:24,378
I'm afraid she...

19
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:26,859
Xia Jun wanted me to marry his sister

20
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,898
just because he was suspicious of me

21
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,818
He was afraid that Wanruo was in deep love

22
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:34,059
with me and would give me these weapons

23
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,698
If that happens, he will be

24
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:36,978
taken down from his position

25
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,579
So the more I'm unconcerned about Wanruo,

26
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:42,098
the safer she will be

27
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:43,618
Got it

28
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,499
How are things going in the camp?

29
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:47,618
Don't worry, Marshal

30
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,139
We have split up the surrendered soldiers of

31
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:50,579
the Shengs' Army into Xias' Army

32
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,698
Besides, we have placed some of

33
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,178
our own men in them

34
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:55,378
They will secretly draw over those who support us

35
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:57,019
I'm sure they will obey

36
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,738
no one's order but yours

37
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:00,939
Speed things up

38
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:02,299
I don't want to act all the time

39
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:03,699
Yes

40
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,099
Is it done?

41
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,738
You are so pretty

42
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:19,658
Rubing

43
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:21,699
Remember to

44
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:23,658
pay more attention to

45
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,298
the tunnels and the secret chambers of

46
00:02:25,618 --> 00:02:28,658
Marshal's Mansion after you marry Mu Shaoli

47
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,979
As long as our family stands strong,

48
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:35,019
Mu Shaoli will never neglect you

49
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:35,819
Do you understand?

50
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,419
Yes

51
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,859
It's just like he will pick me up personally,

52
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,778
but he didn't do so on his wedding with Zhong Wanruo

53
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:49,778
My dear sister,

54
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,338
you finally became sensible

55
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:53,938
Bear in mind that

56
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,658
as long as you love Mu Shaoli,

57
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,618
I will make him stay with you

58
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,019
even if I have to break his legs

59
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,178
Mrs. Mu

60
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:15,658
Marshal Mu said today is his and Ms. Xia's wedding day

61
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:18,099
So we need to put away these wedding bed sheets

62
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,778
so as not to upset Ms. Xia

63
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,259
Okay, go ahead and change them

64
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:25,259
Yes

65
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,379
Commander

66
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,379
Brother

67
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,819
Have some tea

68
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:17,538
Zhong Wanruo!

69
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:18,939
Why did you pour the tea on me?

70
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:21,538
Zhong Wanruo

71
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,858
Today is my and Rubing's wedding day

72
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,338
No matter how angry you are,

73
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:27,739
you shouldn't have thrown a tantrum

74
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:30,658
in from of Commander and so many guests

75
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,098
But it's clearly...

76
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:32,819
Shut up

77
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,098
Xiang'er

78
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:36,978
Get me another cup of tea

79
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,457
Sorry, Commander

80
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,619
No worries

81
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:55,778
Rubing

82
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,418
Let's enjoy our wedding wine

83
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:40,338
Shaoli

84
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,978
After tonight,

85
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:43,978
we're legally husband and wife

86
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,139
Yeah

87
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,019
Shaoli

88
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,418
Do you love me?

89
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,139
You have such fair skin

90
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,458
Of course I like it

91
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,778
I've taken in a concubine

92
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,619
But she wasn't jealous at all

93
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,019
She is not here

94
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,418
Zhong Wanruo?
