1
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:49,060
Boss

2
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:50,943
Are you still thinking about Zhong Wanruo?

3
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,627
I never thought she would risk her life to protect us

4
00:00:57,706 --> 00:00:59,347
She seems to be a selfless

5
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:00,627
and merciful woman

6
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:01,506
Boss

7
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,746
I heard from others that

8
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:04,986
she was vain and

9
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,346
betrayed her beloved man

10
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:11,386
Oh, I got it

11
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:12,466
Boss

12
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:13,946
You are in love

13
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:15,466
You fell for her, right?

14
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:18,307
Don't talk nonsense!

15
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,346
She's already married to Mu Shaoli

16
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:22,707
It doesn't matter

17
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,706
She married you first

18
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,106
So Mu Shaoli is just like a "concubine"

19
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:29,826
Stop joking

20
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,706
You should learn more from Nizi

21
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:39,986
Yeah, Nizi is the best

22
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,427
Cut the crap

23
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:05,946
What's wrong?

24
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,307
Why are you sitting here in a daze?

25
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:08,946
Just leave me alone

26
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:15,267
Actually, I know that

27
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:17,106
you love Mr. Sheng

28
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:18,666
What nonsense are you spouting?

29
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:21,547
You can deceive others

30
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,786
But you can't hide it from me

31
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:25,226
The three of us grew up together

32
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,427
I know what you're thinking

33
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,626
But I'm just a plain woman

34
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,147
I don't deserve him

35
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:38,066
Besides, Zhong Wanruo is

36
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:40,466
much prettier than me

37
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,387
She is like a fairy

38
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,666
Mr. Sheng will never fall in love with me

39
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:48,666
In my heart, you are the prettiest,

40
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:51,306
much prettier than Zhong Wanruo

41
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:53,466
I'm warning you

42
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:54,707
Don't compare her with me again

43
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:11,185
Wanruo

44
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:12,147
Take the medicine

45
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,066
I can do it myself

46
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:17,867
Let me do it

47
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:36,506
Is it bitter?

48
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,387
I brought some sweet fruits for you

49
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:44,387
Eat

50
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:08,027
Why does he

51
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,226
feel so familiar?

52
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:14,346
Zhong Wanruo

53
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:22,346
You are pregnant

54
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:25,626
But so what?

55
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,587
Let's see if you will be

56
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:32,947
lucky enough to be a mother

57
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:48,546
Mrs. Mu

58
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:50,027
Marshal said you can't go out

59
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,465
Why did you insist on coming here?

60
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,027
The Shengs' Army couldn't wait any longer

61
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,747
I have to issue the order and get things done

62
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,267
If Marshal finds out,

63
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:59,466
he will definitely blame us

64
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,305
Well, he doesn't care about me

65
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,186
Why would you say this, Mrs. Mu?

66
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:07,707
Everyone can tell that

67
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,707
he cares about you very much

68
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:13,627
Really?

69
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:22,546
Mrs. Mu

70
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:23,747
Are you alright?

71
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,226
Does your belly hurt?

72
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:04,827
Marshal

73
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,187
The doctor said that Mrs. Mu was fine

74
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:08,507
But she can't wear herself out again

75
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:10,627
Got it

76
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:11,267
Off you go

77
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,187
Yes

78
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:40,627
Wanruo

79
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,666
The doctor said that you can't wear yourself out

80
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:44,986
Got it?

81
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:33,947
Do you know that

82
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:35,507
your son, Sheng Shihua,

83
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:37,666
broke into Marshal's Mansion a few days ago?

84
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,147
Do you think he was here to save you?

85
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:50,187
What?

86
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,306
Wasn't he?

87
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:58,906
Poor you, trapped in

88
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:03,067
this dark dungeon, tortured,

89
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:06,827
and going through living hell

90
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,906
And your only son

91
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,666
was enjoying his wonderful life

92
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,866
with a beauty,

93
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,387
indulging himself in love affairs

94
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,147
Bullshit!

95
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:21,587
Shihua isn't such a person

96
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:22,546
Isn't he?

97
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,466
What a funny man you are

98
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,106
What on earth do you mean?

99
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,707
Make it clear!

100
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,267
He...

101
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,066
He was here to look for Zhong Wanruo

102
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:36,306
The two of them stayed alone

103
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:37,946
in her room for two hours

104
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,867
Marshal Mu was furious when he came back

105
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:42,546
He even fired at your son

106
00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:44,507
That bullet,

107
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:45,507
whoosh,

108
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:49,027
almost blew his head off

109
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,507
It was a near miss

110
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:57,347
If Sheng Shihua's men hadn't been smart enough,

111
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,426
you would have already lost your son

112
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,347
Impossible!

113
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:08,627
How could Shihua fall in love with that bitch, Zhong Wanruo?

114
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:12,186
That's why I said that you,

115
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,267
even as his father,

116
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,147
didn't understand him at all

117
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:18,107
Impossible! Impossible! Impossible!

118
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,347
You probably don't know that

119
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:26,066
Zhong Wanruo married Mu Shaoli long ago

120
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,066
and is pregnant with his child

121
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,026
She is the Marshal's wife now

122
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:34,185
But your son is thinking about

123
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,425
her all day long

124
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,546
How could the Marshal not be angry?

125
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:00,786
Zhong Wanruo!

126
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,185
I won't let you hurt Shihua
