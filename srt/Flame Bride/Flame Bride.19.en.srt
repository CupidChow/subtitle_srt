1
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:43,887
Liu Zirun

2
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,246
You're really Liu Zirun

3
00:01:24,455 --> 00:01:25,175
Zirun

4
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,095
If your soul is in heaven,

5
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:29,255
please open your eyes and take a look

6
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:32,296
Please protect Wanruo from all harm

7
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:34,535
Sheng Fang forced Wanruo to do these things

8
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:35,895
Sheng Fang

9
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,496
feared Zirun's military talents

10
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:40,175
So

11
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:42,455
he fabricated Wanruo's testimony,

12
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:44,455
accusing Zirun of treason

13
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,375
He killed Zirun's whole family

14
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:50,056
Wanruo wanted to save Zirun's mother

15
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,936
So she had no choice but to agree to marry Sheng Shihua

16
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,696
Wanruo

17
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:57,776
faced all the infamy alone

18
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:01,056
To protect your mother, Wanruo faced

19
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:04,296
so many slanders and infamy

20
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:09,696
Wanruo

21
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,735
I'm sorry

22
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:16,775
I was possessed

23
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:20,376
I was so selfish and stupid

24
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:25,615
I shouldn't have believed

25
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:28,696
such a ridiculous lie

26
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,215
I obviously trusted you so much

27
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,376
from the bottom of my heart

28
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,256
Sorry

29
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,696
Where's the wine?

30
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,016
Where's the wine?

31
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:11,536
Where's the wine?

32
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,334
Give me wine

33
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,136
Guards

34
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,615
Where's the wine?

35
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,096
Shaoli

36
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:22,096
What happened?

37
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:23,655
Give me wine

38
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:32,055
Shaoli

39
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:57,816
Wanruo

40
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,696
Wanruo

41
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:01,536
Wanruo

42
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,095
Wanruo

43
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,016
Wanruo

44
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:22,576
Wanruo

45
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,136
Wanruo

46
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:09,376
Shaoli

47
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,696
Did you sleep well last night?

48
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,295
Why are you lying on my bed?

49
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:19,895
What do you think?

50
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:21,735
Last night, you said you wanted to drink

51
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:23,415
So I brought you some wine

52
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:25,415
I never thought...

53
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:47,455
Sheng Fang's body is stolen,

54
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:50,295
and Commander can't find it

55
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,535
Commander

56
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:53,056
Shall I arrest these reporters

57
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:53,855
who spread false news?

58
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:58,535
What's the use of arresting some reporters?

59
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,256
Don't be so irritable

60
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,136
Commander, what's your plan?

61
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:06,576
Sheng Shihua

62
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,455
is digging his own grave

63
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,176
Does he think these few soldiers of his

64
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:13,616
at Nanwazi can resist

65
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:16,215
the tens of thousands of soldiers of mine?

66
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,816
Send Sheng Shihua

67
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,616
a letter of challenge

68
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:22,736
I will burn his camp to the ground

69
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:23,816
Yes

70
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:25,335
Marshal

71
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:26,975
Are you not feeling well?

72
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:29,576
I'm good. Continue your report

73
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,095
Now, the Xias' Army

74
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:32,936
is all under our control

75
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,176
Those stubborn ones

76
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,655
have been wiped out secretly

77
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,576
Our soldiers stationed at Mount Fenghuang

78
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,056
have been trained well

79
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:43,415
Marshal

80
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,576
Since you still love Mrs. Mu,

81
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,016
why don't you go to find her?

82
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,256
I hurt her so much

83
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:51,975
I'm too ashamed to see her

84
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:54,335
What if Mrs. Mu is missing you, too?

85
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,616
She loved you so deeply

86
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:01,535
She couldn't have got over you in just a few days

87
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:04,696
You're right

88
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,256
Wait a minute, Marshal

89
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,775
Xia Jun challenged Sheng Shihua

90
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,215
for a battle on Mount Wuli outside the city

91
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,295
How arrogant

92
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,215
Xia Jun underestimated Sheng Shihua

93
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:18,616
What are you going to do?

94
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,016
I'll stand by and watch them fight

95
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:23,176
It's a good idea

96
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:25,895
Let's make Xia Jun feel our power

97
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:27,376
Okay, I'm on it

98
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,655
Someone is waiting inside for you

99
00:07:37,535 --> 00:07:38,256
Who is it?

100
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,016
No idea

101
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,056
He said that you would know when you saw him

102
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:57,616
Brother

103
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,295
Wanruo

104
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:12,215
Brother

105
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,655
Where have you been in these years?

106
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,775
I thought I would never see you again

107
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:18,455
All right, all right

108
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,295
Stop crying, stop crying

109
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:20,855
I'm back now

110
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,616
From now on, let's be of one heart and one mind

111
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,215
We will never separate again, okay?

112
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,376
I'm warning you, Sheng Shihua

113
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,336
The grudge between our families is irreconcilable

114
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,055
Brother

115
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,856
Don't try to hit on my sister

116
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:48,295
As long as I'm here,

117
00:08:48,856 --> 00:08:50,256
I won't allow anyone to hurt her

118
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,456
Brother, you've misunderstood it

119
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,976
General Sheng and I are business partners

120
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:55,295
What?

121
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,376
Business partners?

122
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:57,894
Brother

123
00:08:58,376 --> 00:08:59,775
Can you tell me

124
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:01,976
what happened that night?

125
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,295
Before Sheng Fang died,

126
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:05,775
he told me that

127
00:09:06,496 --> 00:09:07,815
he had nothing to do

128
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,175
with the death of our family

129
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:23,376
Mr. Fu, Mr. Fu

130
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:37,976
What's going on?

131
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,016
Why are they all dead?

132
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,655
Commander told us to catch them alive

133
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:43,295
How should we explain it to Commander?

134
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,535
Let's hurry back and report it to him

135
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:48,376
Let's go

136
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:51,895
That night, Xia Jun was drunk

137
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:53,055
I heard him say,

138
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:54,535
"I want all the Zhongs

139
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:56,775
to die, and none of them can escape"

140
00:09:58,815 --> 00:09:59,856
It was Xia Jun

141
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,815
It was Xia Jun who schemed all of this
