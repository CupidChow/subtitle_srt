1
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:43,422
Zhong Wanruo

2
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:45,613
Make your last contribution then

3
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:48,141
My soldiers...

4
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:49,747
in the camp

5
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,089
They want women badly

6
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,650
Piss off

7
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:22,490
Wanruo

8
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,609
Why didn't you hit me?

9
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:33,729
Sorry

10
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:34,889
Wanruo

11
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:39,809
Sorry

12
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:44,770
Sorry

13
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,050
Wanruo

14
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,049
Mu Shaoli, this doomed relationship is over

15
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,010
We're even now

16
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,729
Wanruo

17
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,410
After this farewell,

18
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,810
I'm afraid we won't see each other again

19
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,049
If I had known I couldn't bear to hurt you,

20
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,290
I wouldn't have trapped you by my side

21
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:41,169
This time, let me set you free

22
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,130
Take care

23
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,010
Is it true?

24
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,729
Marshal Mu kicked Zhong Wanruo out of his mansion?

25
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,370
Yes

26
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,130
Yes, it's true, Ms. Xia

27
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,169
Marshal Mu had a big fight with Mrs. Mu last night

28
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:54,569
After that, he threw her out

29
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,250
Many servants heard it

30
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,169
What did you just call me?

31
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,849
Mrs...

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,130
Mrs. Mu

33
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,410
Mrs. Mu

34
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,929
Now, think about it carefully

35
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,728
What should you call her?

36
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,209
Bitch!

37
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,489
Bitch!

38
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,010
Last night, Marshal Mu

39
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,850
had a big fight with that bitch,

40
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,410
and threw her out of the mansion

41
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,370
He cursed her for being worse than an animal

42
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,168
That's right!

43
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,169
Now that she has been thrown out,

44
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,090
I'm the only Mrs. Mu here

45
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,889
Yes

46
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:31,090
Yes, Mrs. Mu

47
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,769
Boss

48
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,090
Your father wouldn't want to see you so depressed

49
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,209
Pull yourself together

50
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,729
Pull yourself together

51
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,649
How should I pull myself together?

52
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,810
My father was absolutely fine when I left

53
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,209
It doesn't matter if you don't love Zhong Wanruo

54
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:00,290
But I promise you,

55
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,209
as long as you marry her,

56
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,250
you can take in whoever you love

57
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,810
as your concubine

58
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,209
Zhong Wanruo is engaged to Liu Zirun

59
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,209
And Liu Zirun is your right-hand man

60
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,690
How can I marry her?

61
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,530
But she and Liu Zirun aren't married

62
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,930
No more word of it

63
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,690
I won't marry her

64
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,130
Shihua

65
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:22,849
Zhong Wanruo controlled

66
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,169
most of her family's business

67
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,170
So

68
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,849
you want to sacrifice my happiness

69
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,690
for the Zhong family's wealth

70
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,409
and your ambition

71
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,570
But since ancient times, it has been natural

72
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,328
for parents to decide on their children's marriage

73
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,010
After I become the King of the Central Region,

74
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,969
you can have any woman you want

75
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,250
You should be more far-sighted

76
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,889
Just marry her

77
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,010
If you really don't like her,

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,089
let her be a trophy wife then

79
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:55,849
Enough

80
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,050
I want to hear no more of it

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,690
Since I was a child,

82
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,649
you have placed your ambitions

83
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,730
before my mother and me

84
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:07,329
Look,

85
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,050
I'm a grown-up now

86
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,409
I'm no longer the boy who would

87
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,250
do whatever you want me to

88
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:15,089
I want to live my own life

89
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,690
I want to take the path I choose

90
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,170
Boss

91
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:51,169
Please do take my advice

92
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,370
Don't go there

93
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,130
As a son,

94
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,170
how can I not do anything when my father's body is humiliated?

95
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,570
But you don't have enough soldiers

96
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,370
to take back your father's body

97
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:03,570
Besides,

98
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,010
you know this is a trap

99
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,010
You hate my father

100
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,810
You don't want to help him at all!

101
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,010
Why did he die in the Marshal's Mansion for no reason?

102
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,250
You claimed you knew nothing about it before

103
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,089
Were you behind it?

104
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,810
Sorry

105
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,130
The anger got the better of me

106
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,289
It's fine

107
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:47,930
You're right

108
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,409
We should show the dead respect

109
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,370
Although I hate your father,

110
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,529
I won't vent my anger

111
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,690
on a dead person

112
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,289
Why did you

113
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,089
help me last time?

114
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,769
Xia Jun is a sinister and vicious man

115
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,089
who is very selfish as well

116
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,769
The people in Mu City are living with despair

117
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,089
under his rule

118
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,370
Then...

119
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,930
What about Mu Shaoli?

120
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,409
Mu Shaoli is a brave and good fighter,

121
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,490
and a talented general

122
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:29,769
But he is far from being a good leader

123
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:30,649
for the Mu City

124
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,250
What about me?

125
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,329
You have great military talents

126
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,130
You are kind and merciful

127
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:39,010
I think you're great

128
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,690
If you were to manage the Mu City,

129
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:44,089
I believe

130
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,010
the people will live a good life

131
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,170
General Sheng

132
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,610
Didn't you always want to make a deal with me?

133
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,930
Let's talk about it honestly

134
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,930
What do you think?

135
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,690
What do you want to do?

136
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,889
Mu Shaoli shot your father dead because

137
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,769
your father tried to kill me

138
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,010
Are you suggesting that

139
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,089
my father deserved it?

140
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,050
That's not what I meant

141
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,050
Your father tried to strangle me

142
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,409
I felt like fainting

143
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,130
But in a daze,

144
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:21,889
I heard he say something

145
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,889
But you know what,

146
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,050
when my men arrived,

147
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,810
your family members were long dead

148
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,370
You idiot!

149
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,649
Wanna take revenge on me all the time

150
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,529
You got the wrong person from the beginning

151
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,090
Are you telling the truth?

152
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:37,409
At that time, he thought I would definitely die

153
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,450
So he wouldn't lie to me

154
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:43,649
Then who is it?

155
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,969
Do you have any other clues?

156
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:49,049
So

157
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,289
I hope you can

158
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:52,849
help me investigate this matter

159
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,409
I'll definitely find out the truth

160
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,529
and clean my father's name

161
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,010
To show my sincerity,

162
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,769
I'm willing to use all my family's property

163
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,529
to help you

164
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:02,969
become the King of the Central Region

165
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,450
But General, you have to promise me that

166
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,169
you will never forget your aspiration

167
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,490
to bring peace to the people

168
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,529
Okay

169
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,490
But I have to warn you first

170
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:16,210
Mu Shaoli is my enemy

171
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,970
He and I will have to fight sooner or later

172
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:22,369
Since you chose to join hands with me,

173
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,649
it will make you an enemy of him

174
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,250
Are you sure you can bear to do that?

175
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:31,648
General Sheng, do you think

176
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:34,370
I still have feelings for that kind of man?

177
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,809
It's great you're clear-headed

178
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:43,049
Did you get any clues about these weapons?

179
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:44,408
No

180
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,730
Then why did you let Zhong Wanruo go?

181
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,889
Brother

182
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,370
What's the big deal?

183
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,730
I don't believe that she really has these powerful weapons

184
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,370
We can

185
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,210
seize the Central Region

186
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,850
even without her help, can't we?

187
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,130
Rubing is right

188
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,250
Since Zhong Wanruo had not handed over the weapons for such a long time,

189
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,929
it means she doesn't have them

190
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,010
Besides,

191
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,370
she is no longer fertile now

192
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,730
