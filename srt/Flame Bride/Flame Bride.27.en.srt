1
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,689
So you must die today

2
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:44,493
Shaoli

3
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,435
Can't you let my brother go

4
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,122
for the sake of our marriage?

5
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,416
Don't beg him

6
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:50,667
Can't you tell that

7
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:52,667
he doesn't love you at all?

8
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,907
He isn't Mu Shaoli

9
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,347
He is Liu Zirun

10
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,947
He got close to our family just

11
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:04,386
to use us as a pawn

12
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:06,787
The whole thing was just a trap

13
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:09,027
Liu Zirun?

14
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:11,147
You are Liu Zirun?

15
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:13,346
So,

16
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:16,346
from beginning to end, you only love Zhong Wanruo

17
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:17,587
Yes

18
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:21,026
From beginning to end, I only love Wanruo

19
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:29,227
Ridiculous!

20
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,906
How ridiculous!

21
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:00,266
Brother

22
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:01,867
Brother

23
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:04,027
Brother

24
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,067
Brother

25
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,147
Your leader is dead now

26
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,867
Do you still want to resist?

27
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,387
Zhong Wanruo

28
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,267
Go to hell!

29
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:00,427
Wanruo

30
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:01,946
Wanruo

31
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,147
I didn't mean it

32
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:26,387
I didn't mean it

33
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:28,587
I didn't mean to kill you

34
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,547
I didn't mean to fire at you

35
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:33,107
I didn't

36
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:34,786
I didn't

37
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:36,427
Zirun

38
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:38,307
Zirun

39
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:40,226
Wanruo

40
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:42,987
I'm so happy

41
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,987
to hear you call me Zirun

42
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,387
Wanruo

43
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,867
Hold on!

44
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:54,065
I have nothing to keep me holding on

45
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:58,786
Wanruo

46
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:00,027
I...

47
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:01,267
I'm so sorry

48
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,427
I'm so sorry

49
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:05,987
You will be fine

50
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,307
I'm sorry

51
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:08,905
I know

52
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:12,666
I hurt you so much

53
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,147
and I can never make it up for you

54
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,747
How I wish...

55
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,627
How I wish

56
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:26,187
you will live a happy life from now on

57
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:29,906
How I wish

58
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,387
Mu Shaoli

59
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,226
hadn't

60
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:36,866
appeared in your life

61
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:38,786
Wanruo

62
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:43,426
Wanruo

63
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:45,106
I...

64
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:46,827
I have forgiven you

65
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,267
Hold on!

66
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:51,827
Wanruo

67
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:06,306
Hairband

68
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:20,827
So when I'm not by your side,

69
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:23,267
let this hairband accompany you

70
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:27,306
During the war,

71
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:29,466
when you see this hairband,

72
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:31,545
you should remember that

73
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,587
I will be waiting for you at home

74
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,706
The hairband is a promise

75
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,187
As long as you put it on,

76
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,146
it means that you agree to go with me

77
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:46,507
Wanruo

78
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:48,747
Marshal Mu

79
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,507
All promises will expire

80
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,387
It is valid only when I still love you

81
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,226
Wanruo

82
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:00,947
No

83
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:01,947
No!

84
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,106
You still love me, don't you?

85
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:04,786
Wanruo

86
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:05,985
It's dirty

87
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:28,747
Hairband

88
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,266
I washed it clean

89
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,387
Wanruo

90
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:51,985
Zirun

91
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:53,786
Zirun

92
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:54,947
Zirun

93
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:57,466
Zirun

94
00:06:57,906 --> 00:06:59,627
Wake up, Zirun

95
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,187
Zirun

96
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,947
You said you would protect me

97
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:09,027
I have forgiven you

98
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,146
Wake up!

99
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:22,425
If I die in the war one day,

100
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,987
will you change

101
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:28,305
your surname to mine

102
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:31,545
and follow me resolutely?

103
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:33,825
Of course you won't

104
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,826
You won't, even if I were Liu Zirun

105
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:37,906
Who are you?

106
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:40,747
Why would you say that?

107
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:42,227
No

108
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:44,347
You are in no place to mention his name

109
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,387
You can't compare with him at all
