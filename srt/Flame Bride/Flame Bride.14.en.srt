1
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,260
Sheng Fang?

2
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,780
Why is he imprisoned here by Shaoli?

3
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,379
Are you sure it's Sheng Fang?

4
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,259
Brother

5
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,459
Why did Shaoli imprison Sheng Fang?

6
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,660
Sheng Shihua, who is stationed outside the city,

7
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,259
has been targeting us all the time

8
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,220
Now, Shaoli captured his father

9
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,220
It's equal to capture his Achilles' heel

10
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,099
That is to say,

11
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,339
we can get rid of Sheng Shihua soon

12
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,539
But I'm afraid it's not Sheng Shihua

13
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,259
that Mu Shaoli wants to get rid of

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,379
Brother

15
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,140
What do you mean?

16
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,220
My silly sister,

17
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,739
we have been trying to wipe out Sheng Shihua

18
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:56,420
Now that Mu Shaoli captured his father,

19
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,099
why did he keep it a secret from us?

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
You mean

21
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,300
he wants to deal with our family?

22
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,058
You and he has been married for a few days

23
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,540
Can't you tell

24
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,860
he doesn't love you?

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,140
Why did you come to me at this time?

26
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,380
You're so unfortunate

27
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,420
Why do you want to be born into this family?

28
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,779
Why didn't you find someone else?

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,779
It's my fault

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,260
It's all my fault

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,379
I'm sorry

32
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,260
What are you doing here again?

33
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,939
I've already asked Ms. Liu

34
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,580
about your family's tragedy

35
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,420
I apologize to you

36
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,700
You didn't kill them

37
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:01,899
Why should you apologize?

38
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,540
But it's my father's fault

39
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,059
Since he is your father, and you know

40
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,339
about the grudge between him and me,

41
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:10,100
please don't come here ever again

42
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,059
I just want to talk to you about cooperation

43
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,860
Cooperation?

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,939
Aren't you afraid that I'll shout

45
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:21,219
and you will have no way out?

46
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,779
You're not that kind of person

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,580
You know nothing about me

48
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,499
How do you know I'm not that kind of person?

49
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:29,899
I believe in you

50
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,860
Say it

51
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,739
How do you want to cooperate with me?

52
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:36,380
My army is in urgent need of

53
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,260
food, medicine, and weapons

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,739
I know you can get them for me

55
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,140
Yes, I can

56
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:44,260
But what makes you think that I'll help you?

57
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:46,179
You, a woman,

58
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,499
risked your own life

59
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:50,140
to save Liu Zirun's mother

60
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,700
despite that your life was in danger as well

61
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,820
You are a kind and loyal woman

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,580
Not many men can compare with you

63
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:55,739
I'm not a bad guy

64
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,980
And Mu Shaoli is no good man

65
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,100
The people of Mu City are innocent

66
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,580
You've seen what the Xias' Army have done

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,659
Are you really willing to be with such a man

68
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,100
and disregard people's lives in Mu City?

69
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,540
Sheng Shihua is right

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,020
For the people of Mu City,

71
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,260
Neither Xia Jun nor Mu Shaoli is a good leader

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,580
Who are you to judge

73
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,099
whom she should be with?

74
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,859
How dare you come here again!

75
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,179
Why wouldn't I dare?

76
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,419
I came a few times

77
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,740
What's the big deal?

78
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,459
You asked for it!

79
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,380
Mu Shaoli

80
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,180
Put down the gun

81
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,060
Are you so concerned about his safety?

82
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,859
Or do you really want to go with him?

83
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,740
Zhong Wanruo

84
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,979
How dare you protect another man in front of me!

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,298
You should die!

86
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:45,899
Mu Shaoli

87
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,020
Put down the gun

88
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,179
You can give it a try

89
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,260
and see if I can shoot him dead before you fire?

90
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,580
Sheng Shihua must not die

91
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,419
Otherwise, the people of Mu City will suffer endlessly

92
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,458
Mu Shaoli

93
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,979
Let them go!

94
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:06,899
Wanruo

95
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,820
You don't care about me

96
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,580
But don't you care about

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,500
our baby?

98
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,899
Let them go!

99
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:23,380
Zhong Wanruo

100
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,859
Do you care about him so much that

101
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,060
you can risk the lives

102
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,339
of you and our baby?

103
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,580
Let them go!

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,820
You don't care about me

105
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,580
But don't you care about

106
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,140
our baby?

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,299
Zhong Wanruo

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I don't mind telling you,

109
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,539
I'm a dark person,

110
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:52,700
and even my soul is dark

111
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,940
However, there is still a clean place

112
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,339
in my heart, and you are there

113
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,020
But you

114
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,099
threatened me with your life

115
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,060
and our baby's life just to protect him

116
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,099
Back then, you betrayed

117
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,180
Liu Zirun and caused his death

118
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,659
Zhong Wanruo

119
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,099
Do you want to leave with Sheng Shihua?

120
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,580
Tell me!

121
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:09,779
Tell me!

122
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,260
Speak!

123
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,099
Why?

124
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,899
Why did Sheng Shihua come to you?

125
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,099
Is there any

126
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:18,500
dirty deal between you two?

127
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,620
I don't know what you're talking about

128
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,099
Zhong Wanruo

129
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,859
Do you think I'm a fool?

130
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,659
Zhong Wanruo

131
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,060
Shaoli is so nice to you

132
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,380
Why did you still see Sheng Shihua?

133
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,500
It's been so long

134
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,580
You still can't get over him

135
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,020
I married Shaoli

136
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,740
But all he cared about is you

137
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,580
Because of you,

138
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,740
he never came to my room

139
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,820
You're pregnant now

140
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,419
Why are you still involved with Sheng Shihua?

141
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,339
Don't you think

142
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,940
it's the right thing to do?

143
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,580
Or the baby's father

144
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,779
is actually...

145
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:13,899
Wanruo

146
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,859
Wanruo

147
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:16,620
Wanruo

148
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,539
Are you all right?

149
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,539
Doctor, Doctor!

150
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,260
I told you last time that

151
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
she needed good rest

152
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,820
Is she all right?

153
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,620
Of course she is not. She was bleeding

154
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,500
If anything happens to her again,

155
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,380
I'm afraid

156
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,939
no one can save this baby

157
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:54,020
Wanruo

158
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,899
Don't worry

159
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,220
The child is fine

160
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:06,500
Wanruo

161
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,340
I apologize for what I did

162
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,500
Haven't you humiliated me enough?

163
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,179
Sorry

164
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,059
Get out

165
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:24,819
Have a good rest

166
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,140
Sorry
