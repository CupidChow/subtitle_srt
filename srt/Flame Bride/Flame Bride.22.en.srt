1
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,660
Wanruo

2
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:04,500
I heard about it from Zhong Lei

3
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,460
You joined hands with me

4
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,260
just to avenge Liu Zirun

5
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,221
But now...

6
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:15,460
I told you before,

7
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,501
I helped you not because of personal reasons

8
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,781
Even if I don't have to avenge Zirun,

9
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,300
Xia Jun is still the biggest enemy of my family

10
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,501
So

11
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,820
you will stay, right?

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,301
I heard that you are not feeling well these days

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,221
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,421
Don't be so distant

15
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:46,781
I'm here to see

16
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,941
how deeply Zhong Wanruo hurt you

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,819
Look at this palm mark

18
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:57,180
It's so red and swollen

19
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,100
She must hate you to the core

20
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,180
You don't want me, who love you

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,101
but want her, who hates you

22
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,660
Don't you think

23
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:11,821
you are just asking for it?

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,821
Get out

25
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,460
Get out

26
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,660
Why are you so angry?

27
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,861
I'll wait for you

28
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,101
to change your mind

29
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,340
Wanruo

30
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,421
Wanruo, I'm so sorry

31
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:09,220
Trash

32
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:11,821
They are all pieces of trash

33
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,301
Marshal

34
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,220
Marshal

35
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
The Commander has issued an order, appointing you

36
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,660
as the general in charge of wiping out the Shengs' Army

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,220
When shall we set off for the camp?

38
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,421
Shaoli

39
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,381
Welcome, Commander

40
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,780
My family has stored

41
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,460
this good ginseng for hundreds of years

42
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,981
I wanted to give it to you

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,460
It's indeed precious

44
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,821
Thank you, Commander

45
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,180
Don't mention it

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,660
We are like sworn brothers

47
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,179
Don't stand on ceremony

48
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:03,261
Well

49
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:06,141
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving

50
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,821
Take care, Commander

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,541
Sorry, I can't see you off

52
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:11,460
Okay

53
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:22,741
Marshal

54
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,261
Don't eat this ginseng

55
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,660
What if he wants to poison you?

56
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,060
Don't worry

57
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,181
He urgently needed someone to help him

58
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:33,821
He won't hurt me now

59
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,540
Go ahead with your work

60
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,141
Yes

61
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,100
For women like you,

62
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,300
I can have as many of them as I want

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,181
Listen,

64
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,501
I'm tired of you now

65
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:20,460
Get out of my house!

66
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,099
This will be our last bargaining chip

67
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,539
Failure is not

68
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
an option

69
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,501
Marshal

70
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,061
Mrs. Mu seems to be determined

71
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,621
to be with Sheng Shihua

72
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:05,419
You should get over her as soon as possible

73
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:07,501
She would not be with Sheng Shihua

74
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,141
However, this battle is imminent,

75
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,099
and she is still at the station of the Shengs' Army

76
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,621
Doesn't she want to go through thick and thin with Sheng Shihua?

77
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,941
You know nothing better

78
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,340
Get out

79
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:18,659
Yes

80
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:45,220
Wanruo

81
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,621
Are you going to take side with Sheng Shihua?

82
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:50,420
Fine

83
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,621
I will win you back

84
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,381
on the battlefield

85
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,381
Wanruo

86
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:58,780
I know I hurt you

87
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,980
so badly

88
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,900
and terribly

89
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,181
But please trust me for the last time

90
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:08,700
I promise you with everything I have

91
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:11,581
that I will bring you back to me

92
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,061
and

93
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:14,941
spend the rest of my life

94
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,181
to make it up for you for what you suffered

95
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,100
Big news! Big news!

96
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,420
Buys some newspaper, sir

97
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,061
Big news! Big news!

98
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,061
Take a look!

99
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,700
Boss

100
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,741
Central Government stepped in,

101
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:33,701
demanding we cease fire with the Xias' Army

102
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,741
But we can choose not to accept it

103
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,501
We can continue fighting

104
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,099
The people of Mu City

105
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,099
will suffer if the war continues

106
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,099
Besides,

107
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:51,501
Wanruo doesn't want to see

108
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,299
the situation worsen either

109
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,340
But, boss...

110
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,381
I accept mediation

111
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,420
Commander, any comment on this matter?

112
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,101
Yes, please tell us about it

113
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,180
Guess who I saw just now?

114
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,820
Who is it?

115
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:57,741
Who is it?

116
00:08:57,741 --> 00:08:58,659
I saw Zhong Wanruo

117
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,101
Why is she here?

118
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,780
Didn't she marry Marshal Mu

119
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,981
and become his wife?

120
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,700
Why is she with General Sheng now?

121
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,341
I heard that General Sheng didn't even

122
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,900
enter the room on their wedding night

123
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,621
and was not interested in her

124
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:13,299
Who knows what a woman

125
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
like her can do?

126
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,260
Maybe she used some dirty means

127
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:18,580
to get General Sheng to sleep with her

128
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,381
Let's not talk about her,

129
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,741
an ominous woman

130
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:21,381
There are

131
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,501
just a few young talents in our city

132
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,819
And she had an affair with all of them!

133
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,461
Sorry

134
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:28,580
About what you talked about just now,

135
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,420
I have to clear up some misunderstandings

136
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,861
First,

137
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,141
I wooed Wanruo

138
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,261
and tried all sorts of methods

139
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:37,861
to win her heart

140
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,741
But she has been rejecting me

141
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,221
Second,

142
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,180
Wanruo and I did get married,

143
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,900
and we are still married now

144
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,381
So

145
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:51,940
her marriage with Mu Shaoli isn't legal

146
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,861
Zhong Wanruo

147
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,141
has always been

148
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,180
my legal wife
