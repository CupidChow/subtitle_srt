1
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,062
Actually, you only have yourself to blame

2
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:47,077
If you hadn't saved her like a hero

3
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:50,003
and allowed Sheng Fang to strangle her,

4
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,097
you wouldn't have ended up like this

5
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,579
Sheng Fang couldn't have escaped from the dungeon by himself!

6
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,737
Did you help him?

7
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,418
Yes, I told him about something

8
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,299
I told him that

9
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,378
Zhong Wanruo was involved with his son

10
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,898
Sheng Fang only had one son

11
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:09,618
He certainly couldn't endure

12
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:11,538
Zhong Wanruo pestering his son

13
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:12,859
So

14
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,139
It was you

15
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:21,419
It was you who killed the child of Wanruo and me

16
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:22,618
Child?

17
00:01:23,258 --> 00:01:25,579
I can give you a child, too, Shaoli

18
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,658
You don't deserve to have my child

19
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,378
You just deserve to die for the child of Wanruo and me

20
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,178
You left me with no choice

21
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,019
The closer I get to you,

22
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,659
the further you push me away

23
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,378
The more I love you,

24
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,018
the more you hate me

25
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,737
All of this was caused by you

26
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,458
Get lost, or I will kill you

27
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:00,258
Mu Shaoli

28
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,538
I hate you!

29
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,178
I hate myself too!

30
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,338
I hate myself for loving you so much

31
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:15,618
Wanruo

32
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:16,979
Wanruo

33
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,578
Wanruo

34
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,579
Wanruo

35
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,498
Are you sure the news is true?

36
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:40,338
No, we are not sure

37
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,859
We've found one of the workers

38
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,699
who built the Zhongs' Trading Firm

39
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:46,259
He confirmed there was a secret chamber in that firm

40
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,458
No wonder I couldn't find those weapons

41
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,579
So,

42
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:58,778
it's very likely these weapons are hidden in

43
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,738
the secret chamber of the Zhongs' Trading Firm

44
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:02,699
Commander

45
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,218
Let's besiege the Zhongs' Trading Firm

46
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,658
I believe they will hand over the weapons

47
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:06,458
No

48
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:09,099
If we besiege the trading firm openly,

49
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:11,938
Mu Shaoli and Sheng Shihua

50
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,019
will know the weapons are there

51
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:17,178
What's your plan, Commander?

52
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:23,898
Just do this...

53
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:25,819
Is everything ready?

54
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,259
I'm afraid we can't do it

55
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:30,259
Why?

56
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:32,658
Boss

57
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:38,699
Nizi, you look so beautiful today

58
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:43,738
Boss, I have something to tell you

59
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,099
Go ahead. What's the matter?

60
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:47,658
You can leave

61
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:49,898
I...

62
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,178
Alright, you guys talk

63
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:52,859
Talk

64
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,379
Sit down

65
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:03,738
Boss

66
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,058
I'm an orphan

67
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,139
Ever since I was a child,

68
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,338
my life has been hard

69
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:17,418
So I didn't know

70
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,978
the meaning of my life

71
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,458
I feared nothing

72
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,978
when I charged at the enemies

73
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,739
and fought in the war

74
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,699
But when I met you, boss,

75
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,898
I wanted to protect you even at the cost of my life

76
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:35,019
I understood the meaning of life

77
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,499
Nizi

78
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,297
What are you trying to say?

79
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,858
You're dressed so beautifully today,

80
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,218
like a flower

81
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:50,778
I'm not a flower

82
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,739
I don't want to be a flower either

83
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:55,379
I'm a blade of grass

84
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,298
Grass is stronger than flower

85
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,338
Heavy rain

86
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,379
can break a flower,

87
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:05,059
but can never break a blade of grass

88
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:07,379
Grass will only get stronger and stronger

89
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:12,537
So I just want to be a blade of grass

90
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:16,858
Even though it is inconspicuous,

91
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,778
and no one cares about it,

92
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,537
it is everywhere

93
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,179
It doesn't look pretty,

94
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,179
and it isn't noble

95
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,019
However, it is fearless

96
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:32,417
Nizi

97
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,499
What on earth are you trying to say?

98
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:38,898
Boss

99
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,739
I'm already very satisfied

100
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:43,898
if I can stand by your side

101
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:45,857
and see your smile every day

102
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,418
I just want to tell you that

103
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,338
you must trust me this time

104
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:58,977
I'll definitely help you fulfill your wish

105
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,699
I hope that one day,

106
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,778
you and Miss Zhong can get married

107
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,097
and have a happy marriage

108
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,139
and a happy life

109
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,977
Go! Let's go

110
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,098
Let go of me

111
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:44,538
Quick

112
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,418
Are you used to using this?

113
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,218
Boss

114
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:52,619
Boss

115
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:53,298
I got bad news

116
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:54,699
Go ahead. What happened?

117
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:55,977
I heard on the street that

118
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,818
some people took Zhong Wanruo away

119
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:03,939
Mu Shaoli

120
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,098
Tell our men to get ready

121
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:06,739
Fall in!

122
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:05,939
Can't you enjoy the music quietly?

123
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,499
Xia Jun

124
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,898
Was it you who killed my whole family?

125
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:23,059
Yes

126
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,978
I was the one who sent people to kill them

127
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,417
How did my family ever offend you?

128
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:34,658
Why did you have to kill them?

129
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,578
Blame it on your father

130
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,417
He loved money more than his own life

131
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,339
Zhong Wanruo, listen up

132
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,898
I'll definitely be the King of the Central Region

133
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:49,619
If you're smart,

134
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:51,297
hand over those weapons,

135
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,219
and I will spare your life

136
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,339
You son of a bitch

137
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:58,979
I'll never give them to you!

138
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:05,499
Do you think that I would

139
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,298
check it out in your trading firm myself?

140
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:10,818
So you

141
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,499
set up an inescapable trap there

142
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:22,297
You and Mu Shaoli have underestimated me

143
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:29,018
What's so great about your trading firm?

144
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,019
I admit that

145
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:39,739
you're quite capable

146
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:42,979
If you want to mess with me,

147
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,298
I'm afraid you are too inexperienced

148
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,459
This month,

149
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:51,139
under your order, Zhong Lei secretly

150
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:53,739
transported three batches of saltpeter into the city

151
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,178
Do you think

152
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,619
no one discovered it?

153
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,058
Mu Shaoli is just like my pet

154
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:08,697
Can a pet kill its master?
