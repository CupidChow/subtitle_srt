1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,319
Wanruo

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,119
If I don't return from this battle

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,519
Don't wait for me.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,999
Zirun

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,359
If you don't return from this battle

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,439
I will take your surname

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,759
and name myself after you.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,079
Then I'll follow you wherever you go.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,119
The early years of the Northern Kingdom

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,039
Warlord conflicts intensify

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,559
The Shengxia and Xia families
vie for the throne of King Huazhong

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,919
The Xia army lays siege to the forces led by

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,919
the vital military stronghold of Mu City.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,719
The commander of the Sheng army, Liu Zirun

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,999
is entrusted with a critical
mission in this dire situation.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,639
With no reinforcements in sight

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,599
he wages a bloody battle for two days and two nights.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,759
At the cost of his entire army

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,239
he manages to hold onto Mu City.

20
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:53,485
Marshal

21
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,015
Marshal

22
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,124
Zhong Wanruo

23
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,335
Why?

24
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,535
Why did she betray us?

25
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:11,325
Marshal, once you change you face,

26
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:13,524
you have to completely give up your identity as Liu Zirun

27
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:16,415
From now on, all that Liu Zirun has

28
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:17,695
will have nothing to do with you

29
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:19,135
Are you sure?

30
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:20,775
Just do it

31
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:32,725
Later, rumor has it that

32
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,365
Liu Zirun died in the war

33
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,655
because he was sold out

34
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:37,495
by Zhong Wanruo, his fiancee

35
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:39,775
In the following day of Liu Zirun's death,

36
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:41,055
Zhong Wanruo was said to

37
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:43,855
marry Sheng Shihua, the only son of the Sheng family

38
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:09,295
Mr. Zhao, I'm sure you've thought it over

39
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,205
before you find our firm

40
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:13,045
to ship this batch of porcelain

41
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:14,815
But you know,

42
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:18,205
there is a new tax policy

43
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,974
If we take the order at the previous price,

44
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:22,645
my family can't make any profits

45
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:23,975
and may even suffer a loss

46
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,534
I may agree to

47
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:29,975
your condition

48
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,605
But I want to see

49
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,695
your sincerity first

50
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:37,375
She

51
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,135
Doesn't she feel too ashamed to show up?

52
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,645
In order to climb up the social ladder, she betrayed her fiance

53
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,375
What a pity

54
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,295
Mr. Sheng doesn't

55
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,815
like someone like her

56
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,605
Zhong Wanruo has made a fortune

57
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:51,135
by doing business these years

58
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:52,725
I've heard that

59
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:57,445
she has some secret weapons

60
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,535
Whoever has them can conquer the world

61
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,094
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:04,855
You are here, Miss Xia

63
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:06,485
What else can we talk about?

64
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,015
It's about that bitch

65
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,045
Look at her coquettish look!

66
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:15,015
Let's not mention her

67
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,485
and ruin our good mood

68
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,255
I heard you and Marshal Mu are going to get engaged

69
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,135
My brother does approve of him

70
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,855
He wants us to get engaged

71
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:41,975
Miss Zhong

72
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:44,295
You do have a good point here

73
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,645
Money is not a problem for us

74
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:49,815
The problem is

75
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:53,135
how much sincerity you have to make this deal

76
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,015
Get lost!

77
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,374
Marshal

78
00:03:58,535 --> 00:03:59,095
Yes, yes

79
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:03,975
You

80
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:04,485
Thank you

81
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:15,815
Let me go. What are you doing?

82
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,255
Let go of me

83
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:19,934
Let me go

84
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,445
Tell me where those weapons are

85
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,085
What are you talking about?

86
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:29,284
I have no idea

87
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,285
You'd better think it over before answering

88
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,255
My patience is running out

89
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:37,844
I don't now, no matter how many times

90
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,495
you're gonna ask me

91
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,325
You don't know what's good for you, do you?

92
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:48,845
Fine!

93
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,015
Looks like

94
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,055
you won't tell me

95
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:57,284
until I pry open your month

96
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:58,735
and pull out your teeth one by one

97
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:01,405
Let go of me

98
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:03,765
I really don't know

99
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:07,375
Guards

100
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:07,935
Yes

101
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:10,765
Teach her a lesson

102
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:11,205
Yes

103
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:12,695
Wait!

104
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,815
Don't kill her!

105
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:18,615
Alright

106
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,375
Mu Shaoli

107
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,885
Let me go

108
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:24,765
What are you doing, you lunatic?

109
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,375
Zhong Wanruo

110
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:16,135
Marshal, Miss Zhong fainted

111
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,445
My brothers in heaven

112
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,525
Open your eyes and watch

113
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:41,695
how I will

114
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,735
dig out this cruel woman's heart

115
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:48,445
today

116
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,965
to avenge your death

117
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:09,695
Zirun

118
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,375
Zirun

119
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:15,405
Zirun

120
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:20,525
Zhong Wanruo

121
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,645
Are you crying for Liu Zirun?

122
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:23,965
Zirun

123
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:27,445
Don't die, Zirun

124
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:32,965
Liu Zirun

125
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,885
How could this be possible that

126
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:36,935
this vicious woman without any conscience and morality

127
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:39,205
who would do anything to achieve her goal

128
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:42,494
is calling my name in her dream?

129
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,285
Could it be that she is still

130
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:47,085
thinking of me and loves me?

131
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,055
Could it be that she was framed?

132
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,175
No, that's impossible!

133
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,205
Absolutely impossible!

134
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:54,255
I can't be bewitched by her

135
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,175
Otherwise, how could I face

136
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,735
those soldiers who died unjustly in the war?

137
00:07:58,735 --> 00:07:59,815
Zhong Wanruo

138
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:02,735
I'll make you confess your sin

139
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:05,495
and then kill you

140
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:12,695
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

141
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:14,845
Miss Zhong is weak

142
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:16,645
She is injured and infected

143
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:18,525
The doctor said she would be fine after the fever is gone

144
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:20,965
Give me the medicine

145
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:24,845
Off you go

146
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:25,765
Yes

147
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:56,734
What are you doing?
