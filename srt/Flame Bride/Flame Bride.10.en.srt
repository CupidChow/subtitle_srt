1
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:46,879
Did you just say that

2
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,532
we are a couple?

3
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:50,837
I heard in the camp outside the city

4
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:53,622
the surrendered soldiers are in separate battalions

5
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,061
That's right. It's to tell them apart

6
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:58,781
The Third and Fourth Battalions comprise of all surrendered soldiers

7
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:00,942
This is the crux of the problem

8
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:03,302
Though their battalions have names,

9
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:05,142
in fact, in the army,

10
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:08,062
everyone call them Battalions of Surrender

11
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,101
They are called differently

12
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:10,942
So they won't feel they belong to the place

13
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:11,942
What do you mean?

14
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,062
Split them up

15
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:16,222
and rearrange them into Xias' Army

16
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,540
As for the Commander,

17
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,222
he can't tell apart the surrendered soldiers with his own

18
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:22,502
So he won't be able to deduct their payment

19
00:01:24,022 --> 00:01:26,821
Zhong Wanruo was unwilling to marry me

20
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,422
Why did she help me?

21
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:31,942
It's just a cooperation

22
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:35,862
Mu Shaoli, you'd better stay strong forever

23
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,821
so that I can use your power

24
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,341
to find Sheng Fang

25
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,621
and avenge Zirun

26
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,502
Commander

27
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:44,222
Commander

28
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:45,461
Mr. Zhao...

29
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:48,302
What happened to him?

30
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:49,582
Marshal Mu went to the camp

31
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,142
and demanded to split up the surrendered soldiers

32
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:51,981
from the Sheng family and reorganize them

33
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:53,701
Mr. Zhao did not agree to it

34
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,741
So Marshal Mu punished him according to military law

35
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,541
Mu Shaoli

36
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,261
Don't talk nonsense

37
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:04,341
Brother

38
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,942
Shaoli must have his reasons for doing this

39
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:06,821
Shut up!

40
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,780
Xia Jun is increasingly wary of Marshal Mu

41
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,301
He has been cursing him when he comes back

42
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:42,741
But Mu Shaoli

43
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,822
helped him defeat the Shengs' Army

44
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:47,982
Xia Jun is suspicious by nature

45
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,022
Since he is so suspicious,

46
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,781
don't take the risk to see me again

47
00:02:53,822 --> 00:02:54,621
Miss Zhong

48
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,302
That night, Xia Jun was drunk

49
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,382
I heard him say,

50
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,661
"I want all the Zhongs

51
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,422
to die, and none of them can escape"

52
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,621
I was very worried about you when I heard that

53
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,781
Is what he said true?

54
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:16,022
According to your order,

55
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:18,180
all the surrendered soldiers have been reorganized

56
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,702
Even if the Commander comes in person,

57
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:21,901
he couldn't tell them apart

58
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,781
from his own men

59
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,181
Those who led the revolt

60
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:25,461
did so because of family difficulties

61
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,221
As per your order,

62
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,181
they got their payment

63
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,422
and a certain amount of compensation

64
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:31,181
The newly promoted head of the Battalion

65
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,142
is very grateful to you, Marshal

66
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,382
They are just trying to support their families

67
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:39,982
As long as they work hard,

68
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,382
I won't treat them shabbily

69
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:44,982
You should thank your wife properly this time

70
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,022
Meddlesome

71
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,382
Sorry, sorry

72
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:18,742
Zhong Wanruo

73
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:21,262
Why did you help me?

74
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:23,221
What are you up to?

75
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,502
I heard you settled the revolt

76
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,022
Shouldn't you thank me?

77
00:04:31,942 --> 00:04:33,861
Can't wait to reveal your intentions?

78
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,981
Tell me, what are you up to?

79
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,101
I just want you to do me a favor, Marshal

80
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,062
What is it?

81
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm looking for a man,

82
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:48,461
the former Commander of the Shengs' Army,

83
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,221
Sheng Fang

84
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:55,661
What?

85
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:59,861
Did Sheng Shihua ask you to help find his father?

86
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:02,742
It has nothing to do with Sheng Shihua

87
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,541
Don't associate everything with him

88
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:08,742
Are you angry cause I mentioned your ex-husband?

89
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,262
You're simply unreasonable

90
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,262
You clearly know that

91
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:14,702
there is nothing going on between him and me

92
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:18,341
But that doesn't mean there won't be in the future

93
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:21,822
If you don't want to help, then don't

94
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,301
Don't involve others in

95
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:27,421
If you were innocent in this,

96
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,901
why are you in a hurry to leave?

97
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:32,502
Have you forgotten your duty, darling?

98
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,781
As long as I'm here,

99
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:39,421
you can't be with him forever

100
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:41,901
I never thought about being with him

101
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:43,382
Say it again

102
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,341
I won't be with him

103
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,901
You're mine

104
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:56,981
You will always be mine

105
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,101
Kid

106
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,861
I'm the Commander of Shengs' Army

107
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,262
If you let me go,

108
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:05,182
I...

109
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:08,622
I promise you endless glory and wealth

110
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,181
Sheng Fang

111
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,101
You're a prisoner now

112
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:14,142
So stop bragging

113
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,661
I'm telling the truth

114
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,942
What's your relationship with Zhong Wanruo?

115
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:21,661
Zhong Wanruo?

116
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,341
She's my daughter-in-law

117
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:28,541
We do quarrel over family affairs sometimes

118
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,582
But we hold no grudge

119
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:43,502
I advise you not to play dumb

120
00:07:44,142 --> 00:07:45,861
Did Zhong Wanruo give that batch of

121
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:47,262
weapons to you?

122
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,622
If she did,

123
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:57,182
I wouldn't have ended up like this

124
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:02,502
Have you been deceived by her?

125
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:04,221
What do you mean?

126
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,101
Zhong Wanruo

127
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:12,661
She even betrayed her beloved man Liu Zirun

128
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,822
Do you think she's trustworthy?

129
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:19,702
Don't be fooled by her!

130
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,301
Do you think I'm a fool?

131
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,142
Could Zhong Wanruo alone make the decision

132
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,222
not to send reinforcements to Liu Zirun?

133
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,462
Tell me

134
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,181
What grudge do you have against her?

135
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:43,222
If she hadn't personally reported

136
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,781
that Liu Zirun colluded with the enemy,

137
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:49,700
how could I have given up on my right-hand man?

138
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:55,541
Why are you so concerned about her?

139
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,661
Did you fall in love with her?

140
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:05,661
Or do you want to get that batch of weapons?

141
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:09,742
Shut up

142
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:11,941
Just answer my questions

143
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,622
Kid

144
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,982
Zhong Wanruo is not easy to deal with

145
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,621
Be careful, or you will be

146
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,621
deceived by her and die a terrible death

147
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:35,180
Sheng Fang

148
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:37,060
Why are you so stubborn?

149
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:39,982
Do you think your son is still abroad?

150
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:44,222
What did you say?

151
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:46,941
Don't you know?

152
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,781
Your son, Sheng Shihua, returned from abroad last month

153
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:54,181
His camp is stationed in the suburbs of the city

154
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,862
What do you mean by that?

155
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:59,142
What do I mean?

156
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:06,901
Your son, Sheng Shihua,

157
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:10,060
stationed his camp in the suburbs of the city

158
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:12,181
He just has a few hundred men with him

159
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,862
If my army launch an attack,

160
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,541
he will die a terrible death

161
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:24,342
What on earth do you want?

162
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,820
Tell me,

163
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,821
what's the grudge between you and Zhong Wanruo?

164
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:34,342
She thought I sent my men

165
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,102
to kill her whole family

166
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,781
But I swear I didn't

167
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,742
I did send some men to her house

168
00:10:41,262 --> 00:10:43,862
But when they arrived, her family members

169
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:47,382
were long dead
