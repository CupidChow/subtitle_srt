1
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,168
Zhong Wanruo!

2
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,727
Say it again, I dare you

3
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,569
I won't marry you

4
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:06,049
Zhong Wanruo!

5
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:22,488
Wanruo

6
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,768
Wanruo

7
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,009
Since you love this place so much,

8
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,129
why don't you stay?

9
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:37,608
No

10
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:40,488
Sometimes, you leave a place to start a new life

11
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:43,208
If

12
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,167
I had chosen to accept the marriage,

13
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,728
would things between us end differently?

14
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:53,448
However, there are no ifs in life

15
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,409
but consequences and outcomes

16
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,289
Be a good Commander

17
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,129
and let the people of Mu City

18
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,009
live a peaceful and happy life

19
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,009
That will be the best outcome

20
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,089
Of course

21
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:09,809
Everything will go as you wish

22
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,369
Then, it's worth to have met you

23
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,129
Boss, since you don't want to part with her,

24
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:57,648
why don't you ask her to stay?

25
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:03,328
We will definitely meet again

26
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,088
like how rivers and mountains meet

27
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:07,928
if fate will bring us together

28
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:31,489
Boss

29
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:32,648
Buy some buns

30
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,689
Fresh, hot buns. It's delicious!

31
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:35,287
You can try it

32
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:36,169
Would you like to try it?

33
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,848
It's delicious!

34
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:42,688
How many do you want?

35
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:47,729
What are you doing?

36
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,049
How dare you steal my buns!

37
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,407
What are you doing? Don't you want to pay?

38
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:52,729
Why didn't you pay, you crazy woman?

39
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:53,848
My bun

40
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,049
Look, she didn't pay it

41
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:56,689
This woman

42
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,369
She is crazy

43
00:05:58,328 --> 00:05:59,647
Give me back my bun

44
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,729
The bun got dust on it. Don't eat it

45
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,847
She seems to be Xia Rubing. Xia Rubing

46
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:06,689
Come and take a look

47
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,609
This crazy woman

48
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:08,729
didn't pay for the bun

49
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:09,527
Lunatic

50
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,009
It's her

51
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:25,208
Xia Rubing

52
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:26,929
Xia Rubing

53
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,049
No, I'm not

54
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,128
Don't steal my bun!

55
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:33,288
Don't steal my bun!

56
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:35,408
Let's go

57
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:38,489
Let's bring her with us

58
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:41,888
She has already paid the price

59
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,489
The Central Group wanted to consolidate its rule

60
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:06,169
They turned a blind eye

61
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:07,448
to the battles

62
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,489
among the warlords

63
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,929
They even advocated using violence to solve violence

64
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,169
Under their propaganda,

65
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:14,967
the young men all stopped their studies

66
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,169
and joined the army

67
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,729
However, once a war breaks out,

68
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,568
only

69
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,009
the defenseless commoners will suffer

70
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,287
Ms. Zhong

71
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,968
What's your suggestion?

72
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:31,528
Should we continue living a pastoral life

73
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:32,968
or should we stop studies and join the army?

74
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,088
Yeah, yeah

75
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:35,847
Tell us what we should do

76
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:37,049
What should we do?

77
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:24,328
Zirun
