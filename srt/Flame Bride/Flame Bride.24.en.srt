1
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,844
In the end, you still helped Sheng Shihua to deal with me

2
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:47,037
Marshal

3
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:48,703
What should we do?

4
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:51,859
Shut down the Zhong family's trade routes

5
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:53,299
Why is it banned?

6
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,058
What crime had they committed?

7
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:56,098
Have you heard about it?

8
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,778
Maybe they offended someone

9
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:00,818
Why is it banned?

10
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,218
Wanruo

11
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,098
Why?

12
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:24,458
Why did you help Sheng Shihua deal with me?

13
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,978
Why can't you give me a chance to atone for my sins?

14
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,139
No

15
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,658
This must be a test for me

16
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,419
I can't duck out

17
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:29,539
You're not pregnant, Xia Rubing

18
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,218
Are you crazy, Xia Rubing?

19
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,699
How could you lie about your pregnancy?

20
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:41,019
Shaoli

21
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:44,379
Shaoli, I...

22
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:49,218
I just love you too much

23
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,938
I didn't mean to lie to you

24
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,539
So we never had sex

25
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,738
Please spare me, Marshal

26
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,539
Please spare me, Marshal

27
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,498
Mrs. Mu

28
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:04,099
threatened me with the lives of my family

29
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,218
and forced me say that

30
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:06,738
Please spare me, Marshal

31
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,579
Please spare me, Marshal

32
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,539
In this case, Wanruo won't be angry with me anymore

33
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,218
Mu Shaoli

34
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,738
Why do you only care about Zhong Wanruo?

35
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:18,699
We have been married for so long

36
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,539
It should be the end of my suffering

37
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:22,979
Why can't you love me?

38
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:25,778
Don't make it like no matter what I do,

39
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:27,699
I can't compare with Zhong Wanruo

40
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,658
I have never seen such

41
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,379
an ugly, pleading face like yours

42
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,419
When the time comes, we can break in from the west

43
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,579
Boss

44
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,658
Mu Shaoli shut down our trade routes

45
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,579
We can't get our supplies transported in

46
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,178
Though we still have some stocks,

47
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,737
we won't be able to hold on for long

48
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,379
if we can't get more supplies

49
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:23,179
Xia Jun is suspicious

50
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,819
We can make use of Xia Jun

51
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,778
to distract Mu Shaoli's attention

52
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:40,978
Commander

53
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,259
Shaoli

54
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,259
Now,

55
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,978
the Shengs' Army has reconciled with us

56
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,059
You can hand over the command to me

57
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:54,139
Are you so eager to kick down the ladder?

58
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:57,739
What are you talking about?

59
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,259
You're my brother-in-law

60
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,059
We're a family

61
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:05,457
Yeah. Since we are a family,

62
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:08,138
whether the army is under my command

63
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:10,819
or your command doesn't make a difference

64
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,179
Justice! Justice!

65
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,258
Murder!

66
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,778
Justice! Justice!

67
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,537
Murder!

68
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,939
Justice! Justice!

69
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,458
Murder!

70
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,179
Justice! Justice!

71
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,458
Murder!

72
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,179
Justice! Justice!

73
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:31,338
Don't worry, Mr. Matsuda

74
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,939
As long as you help me get back my military command,

75
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,619
I will grant you the right

76
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,499
to build this railway

77
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,338
Mu Shaoli actually seized the chance of

78
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,698
fighting the Shengs' Army

79
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,819
to get rid of all my trusted followers in the army

80
00:05:56,658 --> 00:05:57,658
Now, the Xias' Army

81
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,538
is almost under his sole control

82
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:01,939
Bad news, Commander

83
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:02,739
What's going on?

84
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,098
A group of protesters gathered at the door

85
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:11,418
Come out

86
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:15,218
Come out, come out

87
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:16,819
Come out quickly!

88
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,059
Come out

89
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,537
Justice! Murder!

90
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:22,338
Come out, come out

91
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,218
Come out, come out

92
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,658
Come out

93
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:29,819
Three years ago,

94
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,939
he leading his soldiers trampled my vegetable fields

95
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:32,857
My father argued with him

96
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:34,338
and was seriously injured by him

97
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:35,977
My father was a honest man

98
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,898
Yet he suffered so much at an old age

99
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,537
I feel so indignant

100
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:42,418
My three sons have joined the Xias' Army

101
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,139
They all died in war three years ago

102
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,418
But I haven't received any pension

103
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:49,179
How should I and my wife make a living?

104
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,138
Come out

105
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,418
Murder!

106
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,858
My daughter worked as a maid in Commander's Mansion

107
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,579
She just made a small mistake,

108
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,098
and Commander's sister beat her to death

109
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,939
Seeing that my sister is pretty

110
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,379
and well-educated,

111
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,018
Commander forced her to be his concubine

112
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,579
But after that, he treated her so badly

113
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,898
My poor sister died

114
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:16,499
when she was only seventeen

115
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:19,218
Come out, come out

116
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,338
Come out quickly, come out

117
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,019
Who on earth is it?

118
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,499
These people wouldn't protest of their own accord

119
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,139
Someone must have incited them

120
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,297
Check it out

121
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:38,657
Yes

122
00:07:41,658 --> 00:07:43,059
Zhong Wanruo

123
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,458
Mu Shaoli

124
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,018
Sheng Shihua

125
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,579
I won't let any of you off!

126
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,698
Good news, good news

127
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,818
Xia Jun doesn't dare to go out now

128
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:01,179
Miss Zhong

129
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:02,739
What are you going to do next?

130
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:04,978
If we drive a dog into an dead end,

131
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:06,098
it would fight back

132
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,179
Doesn't Xia Jun want these weapons I have?

133
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,657
Let's spread some fake news

134
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,218
Marshal

135
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,537
Why don't you take a rest?

136
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,179
What are you doing here?

137
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,417
You saved my life, Marshal

138
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,139
At this critical moment,

139
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:33,018
how can I leave you fighting alone?

140
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,177
Don't worry

141
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:36,499
Both the Shengs' Army and the Xias' Army

142
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:37,898
are under my control

143
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,258
Marshal

144
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,178
Since you still love Mrs. Mu,

145
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,979
why do you have to fight her?

146
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:47,578
I don't want to fight her

147
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:49,538
I can't accept that

148
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:51,658
she helped Sheng Shihua fight me

149
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:55,979
Our enemy has always been Xia Jun

150
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:59,818
She provoked Xia Jun badly

151
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:01,818
Xia Jun probably would fight back

152
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:05,058
Get our men into the city in batches

153
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,177
Yes

154
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:23,979
Why are you looking at me like this?

155
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:27,499
So you are dumped even though you are a Marshal

156
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,658
Actually, we share the same fate

157
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,099
You don't want to give up,

158
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:36,938
but there is nothing you can do

159
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,697
The more you want something, the less likely you can get it

160
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:43,859
The more unresigned you are, the harder you try

161
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:44,979
But in the end,

162
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,577
she is still who she is,

163
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,817
and you are no longer the man you used to be

164
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:52,139
Shut up!

165
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,818
Still denying it?

166
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:58,298
You obviously care about her very much

167
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:00,058
But you still pretend you don't care

168
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,578
Why do you have to pretend?

169
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:05,979
Actually, you only have yourself to blame

170
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,979
If you hadn't saved her like a hero

171
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:11,859
and allowed Sheng Fang to strangle her,

172
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,099
You wouldn't have ended up like this

173
00:10:14,219 --> 00:10:16,818
Sheng Fang couldn't have escaped from the dungeon by himself!

174
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:17,979
Did you help him?

175
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,019
Yes, I told him about something

176
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,499
I told him that

177
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,697
Zhong Wanruo was involved with his son

178
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,339
Sheng Fang only had one son

179
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,578
He certainly couldn't endure

180
00:10:31,578 --> 00:10:33,499
Zhong Wanruo pestering his son

181
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:35,099
So

182
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:39,218
It was you!

183
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,259
It was you

184
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,379
It was you who killed the child of Wanruo and me
