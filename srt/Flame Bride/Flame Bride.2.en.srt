1
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:04,769
What are you doing?

2
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,769
You were shouting Liu Zirun's name

3
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:12,328
It's none of your business

4
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,608
I just feel sorry for Liu Zirun

5
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,328
Does he know the true colors of the woman

6
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:23,448
whom he risked his life to protect?

7
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:30,808
How on earth did I ever offend you?

8
00:01:32,088 --> 00:01:34,689
You sold Liu Zirun out a year ago

9
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,649
Thousands of soldiers of Shengs' Army died

10
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:37,968
It's rightful for anyone

11
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,649
to kill a woman like you

12
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:42,489
Marshal

13
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:44,049
Commander wants to see you

14
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,488
Zhong Wanruo

15
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:55,008
Here is my kind advice

16
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,368
Commander is determined to get this batch of weapons

17
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,929
If you don't want to lose your life,

18
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:02,008
think about it carefully

19
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,888
Otherwise, no one will be able to protect you

20
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,089
Zhong Wanruo

21
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,767
You overestimated yourself

22
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:22,488
Sheng Fang, you despicable villain

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,328
Liu Zirun risked his life for you

24
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:25,648
How dare you treat him like this!

25
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,129
You'll die a horrible death!

26
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:33,928
Zhong Wanruo, the daughter of the Zhong family,

27
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,448
betrayed her fiance, Liu Zirun,

28
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,409
just to marry another rich man

29
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,249
What do you think of this story?

30
00:02:46,648 --> 00:02:47,569
Don't even think about framing me

31
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,368
I'm going out to tell everyone that

32
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:51,928
it's you, son of a bitch,

33
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:52,969
that sold Zirun out

34
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:53,969
Alright

35
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,608
Go out and tell them

36
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,009
But I promise

37
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,168
as long as you tell others about it,

38
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:04,529
I'll present

39
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:06,888
the head of Liu Zirun's mother

40
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:08,928
to you in one hour

41
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:12,568
Go

42
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:14,888
Go out and tell them

43
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,129
I'd suggest you

44
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,208
dress yourself up beautifully

45
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,809
and marry my son

46
00:03:26,369 --> 00:03:27,568
The more obedient you are,

47
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,208
the longer Liu Zirun's mother will live

48
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,809
Don't bother asking me again

49
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:27,729
I said I don't know, and I mean it

50
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,328
I'll give you one last chance

51
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,129
Are you going to confess or not?

52
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:42,328
Alright

53
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:53,609
And now?

54
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,288
Come on, aim better

55
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:20,968
Marshal

56
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:26,609
Marshal

57
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:28,288
It's an accident

58
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:36,689
Three days later

59
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,369
I will marry Miss Zhong

60
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:40,489
Yes

61
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:41,609
Shaoli

62
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,729
Shaoli, Shaoli

63
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:48,049
You are going to marry Zhong Wanruo?

64
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:51,369
Miss Xia, you should know

65
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,288
if Commander can't get those weapons,

66
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:54,528
everything will be just empty talk

67
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,729
What does marrying her have to do with obtaining these weapons?

68
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,528
Do you really have to

69
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:00,848
marry her to get these weapons?

70
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:02,968
I love you so much

71
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:04,369
You know that

72
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,729
Have you considered my feelings

73
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,569
before you decided to marry her?

74
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:13,009
Miss Xia,

75
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:15,288
you should know your feelings are nothing,

76
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,569
compared to

77
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:18,448
Commander's ambition

78
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:20,648
to seize the Central Region

79
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:22,968
Shaoli

80
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:40,848
Put it here

81
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:42,408
Put it here

82
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,049
Throw it out

83
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:45,088
Throw it out, all of it!

84
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,208
Marshal

85
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,088
Zhong Wanruo

86
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,448
Looks like you still haven't learned your lesson

87
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:00,369
What?

88
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,689
Do you think this betrothal gift is too shabby?

89
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:06,929
Or you don't like my persimmons?

90
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,689
Mu Shaoli, you lunatic

91
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,848
I want to go home!

92
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:14,648
Go home?

93
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:16,249
You are just a stray dog

94
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:17,169
Do you have a home?

95
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:19,169
I want to go home!

96
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,249
Oh, I almost forgot that

97
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:25,929
there are still dozens of people in the Zhongs' Chamber of Commerce

98
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:32,809
What do you want?

99
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,049
Stop eating!

100
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:16,848
I told you to stop

101
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:30,648
I told you to stop
