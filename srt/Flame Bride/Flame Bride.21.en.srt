1
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:49,906
The Xia army has suffered a lot this time

2
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:51,624
Without Mu Shaoli,

3
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,984
they are like a tiger without its teeth

4
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:57,463
Weapons and drugs are on the way here

5
00:00:57,984 --> 00:00:59,383
We must seize this chance

6
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,783
to weaken the strength of the Xias' Army

7
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:03,264
Wanruo

8
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:05,024
You went to see Mu Shaoli

9
00:01:05,304 --> 00:01:06,224
How was he doing?

10
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,024
Don't mention him

11
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:12,863
Have you ever thought about it?

12
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,304
Mu Shaoli and I will fight in a war one day

13
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:16,903
You're helping me now

14
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:18,944
Is it because you want o cut all ties with him

15
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:20,703
or because you just want to vent your anger?

16
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:24,623
Mu Shaoli insulted me,

17
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:25,983
hurt me,

18
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:26,983
and lied to me

19
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,623
Why should I forgive him?

20
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:30,263
Besides

21
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,584
Do you think I help you

22
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:34,983
just because of personal reasons?

23
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,103
You know it

24
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:38,823
I want to avenge Zirun

25
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,424
But now, except for you,

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,064
no one else can help me

27
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:45,183
Is this the only reason why you help me?

28
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:49,663
Wanruo

29
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:52,343
I met you earlier than Mu Shaoli did

30
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:54,383
If I hadn't run away from our wedding,

31
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,664
would you love me as much as

32
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,143
you love Mu Shaoli?

33
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:18,503
Get out of my way

34
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,743
Would she love me as much as

35
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:39,024
she loves Mr. Sheng?

36
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,024
Let me try again

37
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,384
Stop it

38
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:11,223
What made you so upset?

39
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:13,864
It's none of your business

40
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,024
Of course it is

41
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,943
We are the best duo

42
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:20,503
Besides,

43
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,503
we will be together forever

44
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,544
This is only your wishful thinking

45
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:30,264
But it's a good wish after all

46
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:35,503
Mrs. Sh...

47
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:36,902
Where are you going?

48
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:39,144
I'm going to my trading firm

49
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:40,063
I see

50
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:43,424
Be careful

51
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:49,783
God of Thunder, I want...

52
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:50,663
I don't want to hear it

53
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:52,704
What are you doing here alone?

54
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,463
Don't you know that

55
00:03:54,623 --> 00:03:57,544
the Xias' Army has declared war against Shengs' Army?

56
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:03,864
You're no longer their commander,

57
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:04,663
Liu Zirun

58
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,264
You're the Marshal of the Xias' Army now

59
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:11,783
If they find out that you came here,

60
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,903
guess what will happen to you?

61
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:15,704
Come on

62
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:17,663
Give it another try

63
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:19,423
Zhuantou

64
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:20,024
Boss

65
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:20,943
Did you see Zhong Wanruo?

66
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:22,423
She...

67
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:24,223
She went to the Zhongs' Trading Firm

68
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:26,863
God of Thunder

69
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:28,824
I want to see her

70
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:30,463
Just let me see her, okay?

71
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:34,064
God of Thunder

72
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,223
I'm warning you, Liu Zirun

73
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:39,584
Don't play a heartbroken man

74
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:42,503
When Wanruo was with you,

75
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:44,584
you didn't cherish her at all

76
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,342
What's the point of saying all this now?

77
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:47,783
You have already hurt her

78
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:58,663
Brother, what did you call him?

79
00:04:58,944 --> 00:04:59,463
No...

80
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:00,423
Wanruo, I...

81
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,463
Talk it out by yourselves

82
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:30,862
Wanruo

83
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:33,903
It's me

84
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,264
I'm Liu Zirun

85
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:00,422
So, during the past months,

86
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:04,783
when I suffered so much

87
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:10,504
and tried to hard to avenge you,

88
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,543
you did nothing but to

89
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:16,543
humiliate me, hurt me, and lie to me

90
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,064
You never told me the truth

91
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:23,422
For all the time,

92
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,944
my love for you supported me to live

93
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:28,223
I missed you

94
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,463
I kept thinking that I should avenge you as soon as possible,

95
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,422
so that I can join you in heaven

96
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:35,824
Every time Mu Shaoli touched me,

97
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:37,264
I wanted to kill myself

98
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,143
But now you're here saying that

99
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:44,223
you are Liu Zirun

100
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,102
Tell me

101
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,744
How could you bear to do that?

102
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:56,223
Wanruo

103
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:58,583
Back then,

104
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,144
I misunderstood you

105
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,064
I thought you betrayed me

106
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:09,744
It's been more than half a year

107
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,343
In these over two hundred days and nights,

108
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:14,223
have you ever thought about telling me the truth?

109
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:15,983
Have you ever thought that

110
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,863
maybe all of this was a misunderstanding?

111
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,583
Wanruo

112
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,263
Please let me explain

113
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:26,542
What a joke!

114
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,064
We've known each other since childhood

115
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,823
We've been in love for so many years

116
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,744
I can do everything for you

117
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,064
I can even die for you

118
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,422
But what about you?

119
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,303
I thought we were thinking the same

120
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:40,704
I didn't expect that

121
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,704
you didn't even trust me

122
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:45,824
Wanruo

123
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:49,343
Thousands of my soldiers

124
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,982
died before my eyes

125
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,783
How could I not suspect you?

126
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,983
If you were me, what would you do?

127
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:02,303
I would choose to trust you

128
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,184
I love you

129
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,903
So I wouldn't suspect you

130
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,384
Even if you were to

131
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,624
point your gun

132
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:13,944
at me

133
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:14,823
and shoot me,

134
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,423
I would think it's just an accident

135
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,744
and you didn't mean to hurt me

136
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:26,944
Sorry

137
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,703
Wanruo

138
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,343
Sorry

139
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,422
Wanruo

140
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:35,943
Give me one more chance, Wanruo

141
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,144
Let me explain, okay?

142
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:43,024
How could you do this to me?

143
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,542
How could you!

144
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,583
Get out

145
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,783
I don't want to see you again

146
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,783
Go

147
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,984
Wanruo

148
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:16,703
Wanruo

149
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:19,144
Wanruo

150
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:20,583
Are you all right?

151
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:24,344
Wanruo

152
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,143
Wanruo

153
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:29,903
Wanruo

154
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:30,864
Are you all right?

155
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:35,264
Wanruo
