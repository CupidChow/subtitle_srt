1
00:01:02,092 --> 00:01:03,812
Brother, what's wrong?

2
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:09,732
What are you going to do with Mu Shaoli?

3
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:12,252
I have nothing to do with him anymore

4
00:01:18,053 --> 00:01:19,053
Wanruo

5
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:22,332
What if there is some misunderstanding between you and him?

6
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,853
Even if there is misunderstanding,

7
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:28,773
it was true that he forced me to marry him,

8
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:31,452
abused me so many times,

9
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:33,092
and ridiculed me

10
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:35,972
Besides,

11
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,213
I once was pregnant

12
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:40,332
with his child

13
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:43,013
This is all true

14
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:47,372
Brother

15
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,171
It's all my fault

16
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:49,293
I'm so sorry

17
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:53,252
What does this have to do with you?

18
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:55,853
Besides, this is an ill-fated relationship

19
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:57,413
Now, he and I are even

20
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,172
Brother, you should feel happy for me

21
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:02,413
Do you really think so?

22
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,252
Yes

23
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:04,452
Will you forgive him?

24
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:06,293
Never

25
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:16,612
How dare he!

26
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,693
He didn't take me seriously at all

27
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:21,133
Commander

28
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:21,932
Please calm down

29
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,133
Calm down?

30
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,693
How can I calm down?

31
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:27,052
I thought he was just like a pet of mine

32
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:29,612
But he turned out to be a wolf

33
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,812
Mu Shaoli

34
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,492
I have to get rid of him now

35
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:39,013
Yes

36
00:03:09,853 --> 00:03:11,413
Are you alright, Marshal?

37
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:12,772
I'm fine

38
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,932
Looks like Commander Xia can't wait to kill me

39
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,212
Marshal

40
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:20,533
Go ahead

41
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,573
They were all strangers

42
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,212
I guess they were highly-paid killers

43
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,452
There is nothing to identify them

44
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:26,093
Marshal

45
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:27,492
What should we do next?

46
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,932
Spread the news of my injury

47
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,413
Exaggerate it as seriously as you can

48
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,652
Just say that I'm dying

49
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,732
Xia Jun declared war against Shengs' Army

50
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:41,051
Aren't you supposed to be at the camp?

51
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,212
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,813
Well, it's kind of funny

53
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,772
Though Xia Jun declared war against us,

54
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:47,732
his control over Xias' Army

55
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,172
is very weak

56
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:50,452
After he gave the order,

57
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,092
the battalion heads of Xias' Army

58
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,293
obeyed the order on the surface,

59
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,892
but they didn't take any actual action

60
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:56,732
Good news!

61
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,093
Last night, the Marshal's Mansion was attacked

62
00:03:59,093 --> 00:03:59,772
Mu Shaoli is seriously injured

63
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,652
His life is in danger

64
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,413
This isn't good news

65
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:06,051
Don't talk nonsense

66
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:06,932
Get out

67
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:07,813
Yes

68
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:08,652
Boss

69
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:09,973
Mu Shaoli is seriously injured

70
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:11,693
Xia Jun isn't good at leading troops

71
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,332
It's the best chance for us to launch an attack

72
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:19,733
Wanruo

73
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:21,053
Are you all right?

74
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,292
I'm good

75
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:27,532
You want to see him?

76
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:36,412
Where are your injuries?

77
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:37,532
Let me cheek it

78
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,772
I'm fine

79
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,573
These reporters spread fake news

80
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:43,772
I have military matters to attend to

81
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:44,733
You should leave

82
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,652
Marshal, do you feel better?

83
00:04:58,212 --> 00:04:59,613
Go to get my wife here

84
00:05:00,852 --> 00:05:01,652
Your wife?

85
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:04,813
Oh, oh

86
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,573
Get Mrs. Mu here

87
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,332
Okay, okay

88
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:12,972
Marshal

89
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,933
What excuse should I use to invite her here?

90
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,693
Just say that I'm dying

91
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:22,253
What do you think?

92
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,173
What if Mrs. Mu refuses to come?

93
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,212
How can she not come to see me

94
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,693
when I'm dying?

95
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:29,813
Okay

96
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:30,693
I'll go to invite her now

97
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,693
Wanruo

98
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,133
Will you come?

99
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:47,933
What did you say?

100
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:48,972
Mrs. Mu

101
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:50,373
Marshal Mu is dying

102
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:51,452
Hurry up and go to see him

103
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:53,852
He wanted to see you one last time

104
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:05,092
This way, please, Mrs. Mu

105
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:18,613
Wanruo

106
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:20,573
Wanruo

107
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:24,493
Wanruo

108
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:27,933
Wanruo

109
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:32,613
Wanruo

110
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,092
I knew you would come

111
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:36,173
You lied to me

112
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:37,532
Wanru

113
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:39,613
I'm really injured

114
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,493
But it's just not that serious

115
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:41,972
I wanted to see you

116
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,813
Do you think it's funny?

117
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:45,332
Wanruo, there is a misunderstanding between us

118
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,652
Mu Shaoli, why are you always so full of yourself?

119
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,253
What do you want to explain to me?

120
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,373
To tell me that you didn't hurt me?

121
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:52,493
Or you didn't lie to me?

122
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:54,733
Wanruo

123
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:55,532
Don't be angry

124
00:06:55,532 --> 00:06:56,412
Wanruo

125
00:06:58,173 --> 00:06:59,532
I did keep something from you

126
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:00,972
But I really didn't do it on purpose

127
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:03,972
I will never trust you again!

128
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:06,852
Wanruo

129
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:08,412
Wanruo

130
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,452
Wanruo, Wanruo

131
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:15,332
Mrs. Mu

132
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,892
You are

133
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:18,212
over one month pregnant

134
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,652
You're pregnant?

135
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,613
Oh, aren't you

136
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,092
the Mrs. Mu who is infertile?

137
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:29,813
Wanruo

138
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,173
I'm pregnant

139
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,092
You're pregnant!

140
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:35,292
Wanruo

141
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,452
I...

142
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:37,573
Congratulations

143
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:41,933
Wanruo, I...

144
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:43,772
Shaoli

145
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:45,253
I'm pregnant with your child

146
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:46,332
Are you happy about it?

147
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:48,332
Wanruo

148
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:49,253
Wanruo

149
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:57,013
Do you get it?

150
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,373
Yes, yes

151
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:00,573
Ms. Xia

152
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:02,092
Then my family...

153
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:05,292
Don't worry

154
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,133
After it's done,

155
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,373
I'll guarantee that your family is safe and sound

156
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,373
Thank you, Ms. Xia

157
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:29,133
Did you see Mu Shaoli?

158
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:33,733
Is he really dying?

159
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,453
He is fine

160
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:38,892
He just played a trick on us

161
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:40,891
Where is Sheng Shihua?

162
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:43,652
Over here

163
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:44,772
Quick

164
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:45,652
Here

165
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:46,973
And here

166
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:48,333
And over there

167
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:51,652
Retreat!

168
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:52,333
Let's go

169
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:55,973
Bad news, Commander

170
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,613
Why are you in such a panic?

171
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,692
The Shengs' Army raided our camp last night

172
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,253
What did you say?

173
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:05,133
The Shengs' Army raided our camp last night

174
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,532
They killed many of our soldiers

175
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:07,892
and burned down a lot of rations

176
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,812
Our army suffered heavy losses

177
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,172
Sheng Shihua!

178
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,572
I haven't made my move yet

179
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,052
But he raided my camp first

180
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:24,853
Now, I appoint you as the main general,

181
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:27,453
in charge of wiping out Shengs' Army

182
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:28,691
Now

183
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:30,332
Go to preside over the camp

184
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:30,892
Yes

185
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:31,932
I will collect

186
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:34,013
Sheng Shihua's head and present it to you

187
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,133
Shaoli

188
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,412
You came at the right time

189
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,253
I got someone to make you chicken soup

190
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,333
Have some while it's hot

191
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,292
Are you really pregnant?

192
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,373
Can you feel it?

193
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:12,932
You're still thinking about Zhong Wanruo, right?

194
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:15,093
As long as you behave yourself,

195
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,333
you will always be the lady of the house

196
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,493
As for other things,

197
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,213
they have nothing to do with you

198
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:22,973
Mu Shaoli

199
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,772
Do you think that

200
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:28,493
Zhong Wanruo loves you wholeheartedly?

201
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,613
It's none of your business

202
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:37,052
You probably don't know that

203
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:40,253
Zhong Wanruo is in the camp of the Shengs' Army

204
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,692
While you are thinking about her,

205
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,292
she is making out with Sheng Shihua

206
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:49,253
Does

207
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,812
Wanruo really love Sheng Shihua?
