1
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,967
We have left him swaggering around for a long time

2
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,169
Don't worry. He won't survive this time

3
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,648
Did Zhong Wanruo say it?

4
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:01,209
No

5
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:02,129
But she will

6
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,288
I certainly trust you, Shaoli

7
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:09,168
But I have to remind you that

8
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,448
Zhong Wanruo is no ordinary woman!

9
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,288
Even if we can't get these weapons,

10
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,088
we can't let others get them

11
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:18,969
Then...

12
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,928
let's get rid of the culprit of the problem

13
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:30,408
You are so violent to Ms. Xin

14
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:33,928
Violent

15
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:42,049
Does it hurt?

16
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,129
Honey

17
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:09,729
Boss

18
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:14,769
Let's go, boss!

19
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,889
Sheng Shihua

20
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,648
How dare you come back!

21
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:30,648
What?

22
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,609
Can't wait to dig your own grave?

23
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,088
Don't worry about me, Marshal Mu

24
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,449
Mu City is the place where my family thrived

25
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:42,408
Let's see how capable you are!

26
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:19,728
Shaoli

27
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,688
Sometimes, there is only one chance

28
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:28,329
The assassination at the Western Station failed

29
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,289
Sheng Shihua had fled

30
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,329
back to his base, Nanwazi

31
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:34,528
What do you...

32
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,889
I want Sheng Shihua dead more than you, Commander

33
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,247
That's just because

34
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:45,049
he is Zhong Wanruo's husband

35
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,688
while you are just...

36
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:48,769
Commander

37
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,808
I'll make him disappear

38
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,928
Shaoli, I mean no offense,

39
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:05,847
but you are the marshal of Mu City

40
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,729
and the right-hand man of my brother

41
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:09,848
How could you get involved with

42
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:11,928
a slut like Zhong Wanruo?

43
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:14,769
Sheng Shihua got tired of her

44
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,408
Is there any point of marrying a woman

45
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:19,129
Sheng Shihua dumped?

46
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,569
She didn't marry Sheng Shihua

47
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,129
But people say

48
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,209
Zhong Wanruo is

49
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,809
a just a snobbish woman

50
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,048
Back then, for the sake of power,

51
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,009
she even betrayed her beloved man, Liu Zirun

52
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,688
Do you want to end up like him?

53
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:36,449
No!

54
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:38,848
Perhaps in her heart, you are not as important as him

55
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:43,249
Did you follow me all the way here

56
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,648
just to tell me this?

57
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,048
Of course not!

58
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:51,288
There a woman who is much better than Zhong Wanruo

59
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:52,689
And she is standing right in front of you

60
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,288
Don't you think

61
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,689
it's a better choice to marry me

62
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,449
and unite with my family?

63
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,528
Miss Xia, are you done?

64
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,128
If you haven't finished yet, you can continue

65
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:06,248
Assistant Mo

66
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:07,168
Yes

67
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,689
Come in and chat with Miss Xia

68
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:13,129
Miss Xia, I still have military affairs to attend to

69
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,009
I got to go

70
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:14,689
Sorry

71
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,288
You!

72
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,288
Miss Xia, what would you like to talk about?

73
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:18,848
I will be a good listener

74
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:32,727
Doctor

75
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:34,369
Doctor

76
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,968
Doctor, is she all right?

77
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,288
Fortunately, her bones are not hurt

78
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:38,769
She will be fine after the bullet is removed

79
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:39,809
Okay, okay

80
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:45,607
Doctor

81
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:48,328
I... I'm still worried...

82
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:49,689
What are you doing? Get out!

83
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:58,408
Why?

84
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,088
You know that I love Shaoli

85
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:02,249
Why did you agree to let him marry Zhong Wanruo?

86
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:04,129
Romantic affairs are nothing

87
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,487
compared with power and authority

88
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:09,768
I hope

89
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,408
you know what is more important

90
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:13,809
More important?

91
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:15,848
What is more important?

92
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:17,369
To be the King of the Central Region?

93
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,727
To let the flag of Xias' Army

94
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:20,769
flutter on the wall of Mu City?

95
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,249
Just because

96
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,449
the groundless rumor about these weapons,

97
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,449
you sacrificed my happiness

98
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:27,047
Enough!

99
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,209
Stop messing around

100
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,929
No matter what,

101
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,329
I won't allow Zhong Wanruo to marry Mu Shaoli

102
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,848
Can't you get up on your own?

103
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,168
Zhong Wanruo

104
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,168
Are you putting on an act

105
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,689
or are you so deep in love with Liu Zirun?

106
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,689
You're trying to fool me again, aren't you?

107
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:13,768
Marshal

108
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:15,249
How was it?

109
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,889
The doctor said that she hasn't fully recovered from her previous injury

110
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,449
If she gets injured again,

111
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,968
her life will be in danger

112
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,449
Then find someone to take good care of her

113
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:25,929
I don't want

114
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,449
to see a dead bride at my wedding

115
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,088
Yes

116
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,648
Wanruo

117
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,968
Zirun

118
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,968
As we will be thousands of miles apart,

119
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,408
I can't have any message delivered to you

120
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,248
So when I'm not by your side,

121
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,608
let this hairband accompany you

122
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,247
During the war,

123
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,529
when you see this hairband,

124
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,608
you should remember that

125
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,649
I will be waiting for you at home

126
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:27,929
Bitch
