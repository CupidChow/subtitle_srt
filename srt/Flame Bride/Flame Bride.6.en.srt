1
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:43,797
Marshal

2
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,035
Marshal

3
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:46,787
- Marshal. 
- What's wrong?

4
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:47,435
Bad news

5
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,887
Your bride's car was hijacked

6
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:49,971
Hijacked?

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,211
Ms. Xin

8
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:57,291
Ms. Xin

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,450
Are you alright?

10
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:00,450
Where is Wanruo?

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,770
They took her away

12
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,611
Where were they heading?

13
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,570
Over... there

14
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:05,691
Quick

15
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,250
Move

16
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:09,571
Move

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,851
Let go of me

18
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:13,529
Move faster

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,810
Today, I will let you know

20
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,850
who is your truly bridegroom

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,850
Let go of me

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,210
Wanruo

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,051
Stop!

24
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,051
Stop!

25
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:28,730
Fight

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,411
Do you have a death wish?

27
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,650
Brother

28
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,970
Didn't I tell you

29
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,410
to look at the big picture?

30
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,611
Why did you hire them to hijack the wedding car?

31
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:44,251
Big picture?

32
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,131
Big picture again!

33
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:47,090
Why?

34
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,691
Why is your business important?

35
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,410
But my business not?

36
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,530
I love Mu Shaoli

37
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,330
I want to marry him

38
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:56,650
Since you didn't help me,

39
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,970
what's wrong with me

40
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,131
doing it myself?

41
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,571
Do you think you did it flawlessly?

42
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,090
Do you think Mu Shaoli won't figure out?

43
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,171
Listen,

44
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:07,370
this little trick of yours is easy to see through

45
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,690
How dare you question me?

46
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:11,890
Think about it

47
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:16,131
When Mu Shaoli comes to take revenge,

48
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,650
you'd better think about how to save your ass

49
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:25,931
Brother

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,051
Am I not your beloved sister?

51
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,970
You'll help me, right?

52
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,251
Brother

53
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,010
Brother

54
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,731
How about we go on a honeymoon in Europe?

55
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,409
Sure

56
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,090
Really?

57
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:53,931
That's great

58
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,491
It's settled then

59
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,090
You are the boss

60
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,290
Don't you think it's funny?

61
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:15,131
Yeah

62
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,090
Laugh again!

63
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,650
What are you doing?

64
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,850
Impossible!

65
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:36,890
Shaoli couldn't have married Zhong Wanruo

66
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:37,970
That's impossible

67
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,090
Even you are laughing at me?

68
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,011
Laugh again, I dare you!

69
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:51,010
Miss, I didn't

70
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:52,529
I didn't

71
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:54,731
You didn't?

72
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:55,849
You didn't?

73
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:57,289
Bitch!

74
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,010
You're all bitches!

75
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:15,450
What?

76
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,010
You regretted marrying me?

77
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,770
Are you feeling sad

78
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,811
for Liu Zirun

79
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,890
or Sheng Shihua?

80
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,770
Did you marry me just to humiliate me?

81
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:43,090
So you know what humiliation is

82
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,090
Do you think you can get away

83
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,770
with these evil things you did?

84
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,530
How could you live with peace of mind

85
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,410
after all these terrible things you did?

86
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,371
Do you think

87
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,491
you would have a happy marriage?

88
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:04,931
Wanruo

89
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,409
If I die in the war one day,

90
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,650
will you change

91
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,171
your surname to mine

92
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,611
and follow me resolutely?

93
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:21,171
Zirun

94
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,731
If you don't make it back,

95
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:25,969
I will change

96
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,409
my surname to yours

97
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,051
and

98
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,770
join you in heaven

99
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:33,890
No

100
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,211
You won't

101
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,731
Of course you won't

102
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,810
You won't, even if I were Liu Zirun

103
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,770
Who are you?

104
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,770
Why would you say that?

105
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,091
No!

106
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:48,130
You are in no place to mention his name

107
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,450
You can't compare with him at all

108
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,170
You are the one in no place

109
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,650
When you chose to betray Zirun,

110
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,091
you lost your place to mention him
