1
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:43,703
What's the big deal?

2
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:45,855
I don't believe that she really has these powerful weapons

3
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:47,475
We can

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,479
seize the Central Region

5
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,032
even without her help, can't we?

6
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:52,171
Rubing is right

7
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,450
Since Zhong Wanruo had not handed
over the weapons for such a long time,

8
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,972
it means she doesn't have them

9
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:57,972
Besides,

10
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:59,371
she is no longer fertile now

11
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,891
Why would I, a Marshal,

12
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,892
want a sterile woman?

13
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:08,251
It makes sense

14
00:01:08,932 --> 00:01:09,971
But what if...

15
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:10,891
Commander

16
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,652
A knife is a weapon only for someone who knows how to use it

17
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:21,292
Zhong Wanruo knows nothing about military affairs

18
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,572
So even if she really has those weapons,

19
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:25,811
she probably can't make use of them

20
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:29,852
You're right

21
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:31,451
Brother

22
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:33,412
We're a family now

23
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:36,492
Let's not argue for an outsider

24
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:55,371
Mu Shaoli is getting more and more disobedient

25
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:56,492
Commander

26
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:57,611
Shall I...

27
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,330
It's not time to kill him yet

28
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:13,012
I still don't know

29
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,331
if Zhong Wanruo has given these weapons to him

30
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,532
What if he puts up a desperate fight?

31
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:21,171
Then...

32
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:22,252
What's your plan, Commander?

33
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,012
Now, our biggest threat is Sheng Shihua

34
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:31,092
As for Mu Shaoli,

35
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,931
I bet he won't be able to cause any trouble

36
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:37,132
Yes

37
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:42,851
I'll incite the workers

38
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:43,931
and the merchants to strike,

39
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:46,931
and let some people cause turmoil in the city

40
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,771
The protesters

41
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,891
will march along the street to the bell tower

42
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:53,972
But these protesters

43
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,610
are just commoners

44
00:02:57,931 --> 00:02:58,891
This is the crux of the matter

45
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,291
Huh

46
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,731
Mu Shaoli

47
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:40,931
Let me go

48
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:42,812
Run

49
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:43,812
Run

50
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:45,771
Let us get out

51
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,132
Don't push. Step back

52
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:47,972
Step back

53
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:52,692
Step back, step back

54
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,731
Don't push!

55
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:00,651
Father

56
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:02,451
Father

57
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:05,211
Let's go

58
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:09,412
Sheng Shihua

59
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:25,331
Don't panic

60
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:37,651
Go to find him

61
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:39,291
Find whom?

62
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:40,371
Sheng Shihua?

63
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:41,692
Zhong Lei

64
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:42,932
Zhong Lei?

65
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,132
He has disappeared for a long time

66
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,331
I saw him today

67
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,331
I can't be mistaken

68
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:50,450
Off you go

69
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:50,891
Yes

70
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:57,932
Shaoli

71
00:04:58,252 --> 00:04:59,052
Are you all right?

72
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,971
I heard you got injured

73
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,012
I made some chicken soup for you

74
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,812
Thank you

75
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:19,771
What's wrong?

76
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:21,851
Are you worried about him

77
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,651
because he is injured?

78
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,651
You think too much

79
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:27,052
Don't lie to me

80
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,651
Your eyes betrayed you

81
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:31,891
Liu Zirun died

82
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,612
You have to start a new life anyway

83
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,091
But Mu Shaoli

84
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:37,971
isn't a good man for you

85
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,971
I have nothing to do with that kind of person

86
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:19,771
Marshal

87
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:20,851
We found Zhong Lei

88
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:40,411
Zirun

89
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,211
Sorry

90
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:46,451
I wanted to avenge Wanruo

91
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:49,851
But I'm so sorry

92
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:52,372
I'm useless

93
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,132
That stab didn't take his life

94
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,692
Liu Zirun

95
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,172
Do you know that

96
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,851
to protect your mother, Wanruo faced

97
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,771
so many slanders and infamy?

98
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:09,932
I thought

99
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,091
they would spare us

100
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,052
But they killed the dozen members

101
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,531
of the Zhong family

102
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,451
Zirun

103
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,012
If your soul is in heaven,

104
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:25,052
please open your eyes and take a look

105
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,091
Please

106
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,851
protect Wanruo from all harm

107
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,612
I will

108
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,091
avenge the Zhong family on my own

109
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:33,891
Okay?

110
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:35,451
Okay?

111
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,372
What do you mean

112
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:43,331
by what you just said?

113
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:49,612
Mu Shaoli

114
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:51,971
Go to hell!

115
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,132
Do you have a death wish?

116
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:56,172
Put down the gun

117
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:57,732
Go away

118
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:00,971
Go away

119
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:03,132
Don't pretend to be kind

120
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:05,211
Tell me

121
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,411
what happened between Liu Zirun and Zhong Wanruo

122
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:08,692
Tell me about it

123
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:09,531
You don't deserve to know it

124
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,372
I'm a good friend of Liu Zirun

125
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,172
I did all this to Wanruo

126
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:16,971
just because I wanted to avenge Zirun

127
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,291
Mu Shaoli

128
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,771
Why didn't you investigate this thoroughly?

129
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:24,132
Sheng Fang forced Wanruo to do these things

130
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:27,252
What did you say?

131
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:28,692
What did you say?

132
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:29,651
What...

133
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:33,891
Sheng Fang

134
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:36,291
feared Zirun's military talents

135
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:38,171
So

136
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,092
he fabricated Wanruo's testimony,

137
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:41,891
accusing Zirun of treason

138
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:44,012
He killed Zirun's whole family

139
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,571
Wanruo wanted to save Zirun's mother

140
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,731
So she had no choice but to agree to marry Sheng Shihua

141
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,690
Fortunately, Sheng Shihua

142
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,012
was angry that Sheng Fang

143
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,571
killed Liu Zirun's whole family

144
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:02,411
and forced him to marry Zhong Wanruo

145
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:05,492
So he left the Mu City

146
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,531
before the wedding,

147
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:09,252
leaving Wanruo

148
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,690
to face all the infamy alone

149
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,012
It turned out that I misunderstood Wanruo

150
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:17,931
I owe her a lot

151
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:19,571
I'm not a man

152
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:22,011
I mistreated her

153
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,291
You don't deserve her

154
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:28,492
You will never be worthy of her

155
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,092
God of Thunder

156
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,332
It's me

157
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:36,372
I'm Liu Zirun

158
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:43,131
What?

159
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,131
What did you say?

160
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,051
Except for Liu Zirun,

161
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:48,811
who else knows that nickname of yours?

162
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:50,811
I'm Liu Zirun

163
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,972
Who did you say you were?

164
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,891
You are Liu Zirun?

165
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,891
Impossible! Impossible!

166
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,972
Liu Zirun

167
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,411
Liu Zirun

168
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:10,410
You're really Liu Zirun
