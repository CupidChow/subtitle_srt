1
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,169
If you want to mess with me,

2
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,861
I'm afraid you are too inexperienced

3
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:49,728
This month,

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,090
under your order, Zhong Lei secretly

5
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,931
transported three batches of saltpeter into the city

6
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,490
Do you think

7
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,050
no one discovered it?

8
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,610
Mu Shaoli is just like my pet

9
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,931
Can a pet kill its master?

10
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,890
Mu Shaoli

11
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,810
I haven't taken revenge on you for killing my father yet

12
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,610
You father feared my military talents and was

13
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,131
afraid that my influence surpassed his

14
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,291
Thus, he sold me out to the Xias' Army

15
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,729
and caused thousands of soldiers to die in the war

16
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,370
Who should I take revenge on for this?

17
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,610
My father was the Commander of the Shengs' Army

18
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,329
Why would he do that?

19
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,170
Ask him about it after you join him in hell

20
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,571
Fine

21
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:07,651
Even if my father was in the wrong,

22
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,650
why did you send your men to kidnap Wanruo?

23
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:11,769
I kidnapped Wanruo?

24
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:13,770
What did you say?

25
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,011
Wanruo is missing?

26
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,091
Hey, hey, hey

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,210
Put down your guns first

28
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,851
Look at her

29
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:23,811
Wanruo

30
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,330
Don't worry about me

31
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,650
Guess which one of them

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,571
can survive today

33
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,730
Xia Jun

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,610
What do you want?

35
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,170
Why don't you

36
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,450
make a choice?

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,531
I'll shoot dead

38
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,450
the one you pick

39
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,130
Since Zhong Wanruo couldn't make a choice,

40
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,050
I'll do it for her

41
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,890
Xia Jun

42
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,251
Let them go!

43
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,490
Didn't you want that batch of weapons?

44
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,851
I'll give them to you

45
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:08,291
Wanruo, I'm not leaving

46
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,091
Bullshit!

47
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,210
If you really have those weapons,

48
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,490
you would have given them to Sheng Shihua long ago

49
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:18,170
Would you watch him lose to Mu Shaoli?

50
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,490
Look!

51
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,371
Look at this man!

52
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,371
He doesn't love you

53
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,610
He actually dodged the bullet

54
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,170
How dare he dodge it!

55
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,770
If anyone of you dares to dodge again,

56
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,730
I'll shoot her dead

57
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,091
Xia Jun, what on earth do you want?

58
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,210
What do I want?

59
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:49,291
It took me so many years and so much effort

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,730
to become the ruler of Mu City

61
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,329
But you two bastards ruined everything

62
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,531
Xia Jun

63
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,490
It was you who framed Zhong Wanruo

64
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,330
and sowed discord between Liu Zirun and my father

65
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:04,930
You're smart, kid!

66
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,490
Much smarter than your father

67
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,930
Xia Jun

68
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,011
My family had no feud against you

69
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,930
Zirun was just fulfilling

70
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,650
his duty to fight you in the war

71
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,251
You despicable villain

72
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:24,171
Don't move

73
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,611
So it was you who caused

74
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,931
thousands of my soldiers to die

75
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,251
and killed my family, the Lius

76
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,330
You!

77
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,691
Xia Jun, you didn't expect that

78
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,450
I'm Liu Zirun, right?

79
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,571
You are Liu Zirun?

80
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,131
Yes

81
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,171
I'm Liu Zirun

82
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:45,329
Well

83
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,731
I admit that in the Central Region,

84
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,650
you have the best military talent

85
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,770
Unfortunately, it was too late for me to find it

86
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:57,011
But so what?

87
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,931
With just a few words,

88
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,490
I made Sheng Fang suspect you

89
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,330
I didn't mobilize even a single soldier,

90
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,731
but I made the Shengs' Army suffer huge losses

91
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:13,770
Besides,

92
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,051
I even made your beloved woman marry someone else

93
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,250
In the Central Region,

94
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,251
I'm invincible!

95
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,530
You're so ridiculous, Xia Jun

96
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,611
You're so scheming and despicable

97
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,850
Yes, I'm

98
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,171
So, today,

99
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,210
I will kill these two men

100
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,811
before your eyes

101
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:46,811
Zhuantou

102
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,530
Zhuantou

103
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,090
Zhuantou

104
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:51,410
Zhuantou

105
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:53,931
Zhuantou

106
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,491
Why did you do this?

107
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,450
I knew

108
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,131
you would risk your life to protect him

109
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,810
So I had to be faster than you

110
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:07,130
Don't be sad, Nizi

111
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,250
Come here, Zhuantou

112
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:30,810
Zhuantou, Zhuantou

113
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,131
Don't die, Zhuantou

114
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,210
Looks like you are very lucky, General Sheng

115
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,289
Someone was willing to die on your behalf

116
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,251
Then, let me see

117
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,890
if Marshal Mu

118
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,171
is lucky as well

119
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,570
Brother

120
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:02,731
My trump card is here

121
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,089
I've had enough fun

122
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,970
It's their turn to play

123
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:09,371
Retreat

124
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:13,691
Retreat to the Marshal's Mansion

125
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,770
Retreat

126
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,330
Retreat

127
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:16,810
Retreat

128
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,131
Do you have any plan, Marshal Mu?

129
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:22,811
Quick, go upstairs

130
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:23,850
No matter what your plan is,

131
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,171
you must ensure Wanruo's safety

132
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,731
Wanruo is my woman

133
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:27,890
I will protect her for sure

134
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,690
Don't worry about it

135
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,970
Right now, the entire Marshal's Mansion is under my command

136
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,571
Move faster

137
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,931
Don't think that you are safe

138
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,371
hiding in this mansion

139
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:44,849
All the soldiers in this mansion are my men

140
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,650
Let's see where you can run to!

141
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,251
Oh, really?

142
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,171
Put down your weapons

143
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:02,371
Squat down

144
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,450
Put down your weapons

145
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:03,810
Squat down

146
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,051
Put down your weapons

147
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,250
You kept a private army behind my back

148
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:13,289
Xia Jun

149
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:15,731
You didn't trust me,

150
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,210
and I didn't trust you either

151
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,571
How could you be so arrogant as to think

152
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:20,731
I would show all my cards on the table?

153
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,171
Xia Jun

154
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,330
Let Zhong Wanruo go,

155
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,570
put down your weapon, and resign from your post

156
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:29,811
Maybe I will consider not killing you

157
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,649
Even if I am alone,

158
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:38,971
do you dare to kill me?

159
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,530
Don't worry about me

160
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,690
Xia Jun is not a good person

161
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,290
We can't let him rule Mu City

162
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:53,971
Watch out!

163
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:55,130
Wanruo

164
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:55,890
Be careful, Marshal

165
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,851
Mu Shaoli

166
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,570
Don't think that you can defeat me now

167
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,690
because you made me a figurehead

168
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,890
Give it a try and you will know

169
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,330
Shaoli

170
00:09:15,851 --> 00:09:17,130
Why did you have to do this?

171
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,091
My family has treated you well

172
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,409
If you join hands with me to defeat Sheng Shihua,

173
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,809
I promise you will enjoy endless

174
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,611
glory and wealth

175
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,011
in the rest of your life

176
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,091
Commander Xia

177
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:29,130
Do you think

178
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,331
I would still believe you now?

179
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,290
Well, you don't know what's good for you

180
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,690
Cut the crap

181
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,491
I have handed over all the evidence of

182
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,211
your collusion with East Island to the higher-ups

183
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,530
What did you say?

184
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,410
Xia Jun

185
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,290
As the Commander of Mu City,

186
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,851
you actually colluded with our enemy

187
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:47,890
You disgraced the Northern Kingdom

188
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:48,971
What do you know?

189
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,611
East Island and I were partners!

190
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:52,611
Fine

191
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,810
Even if you drive me out of Mu City,

192
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:55,930
I will

193
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,290
come back with the help of

194
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,809
East Island

195
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,091
You're right

196
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,091
So you must die today

197
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:04,170
Shaoli

198
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,809
Can't you let my brother go

199
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,491
for the sake of our marriage?

200
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:08,611
Don't beg him

201
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,491
Can't you tell that

202
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:12,050
he doesn't love you at all?

203
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,410
Besides

204
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,091
He isn't Mu Shaoli

205
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,851
He is Liu Zirun
