1
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,008
What on earth do you want?

2
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,565
Tell me,

3
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,315
what's the grudge between you and Zhong Wanruo?

4
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,981
She thought I sent my men

5
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:57,901
to kill her whole family

6
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,420
But I swear I didn't

7
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,420
I did send some men to her house

8
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,740
But when my men arrived,

9
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,820
her family members were long dead

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,899
If what Sheng Fang said is true,

11
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,421
and he had nothing to do with the Zhongs' death,

12
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:17,980
then who could be the murderer?

13
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,539
Brother

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,620
I'm telling the truth

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,540
I saw with my own eyes that

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,740
Ms. Xin was secretly meeting Zhong Wanruo

17
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,301
It's fine

18
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,820
Don't worry about it

19
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:26,301
Brother

20
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,380
What's your plan?

21
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,061
I already have an idea

22
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,260
All of this had to be Zhong Wanruo's conspiracy

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,701
It has nothing to do with Shaoli

24
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:39,260
So please don't vent your anger on him

25
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:45,900
Looks like you still want to marry him

26
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,980
Brother, you know I do

27
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,301
Alright

28
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,941
Since this is your dream,

29
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,100
I'll try my best to help you achieve it!

30
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,460
Really?

31
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:03,781
But...

32
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:08,701
Remember our family is your only backup

33
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,101
to secure your position in Marshal's Mansion

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,541
I know, brother

35
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,981
How many years have you been with me?

36
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,500
Three years

37
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,740
Three years

38
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,499
Sorry to make you suffer

39
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,219
Not at all

40
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,660
You gave me the glory

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,701
that every woman wants

42
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:37,900
Really?

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,301
Of course!

44
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,981
This is the consequence of betraying me!

45
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,261
Shaoli

46
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:22,821
Thank you for your hard work in the army these days

47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,101
But why didn't you ask me for help

48
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,581
since it was such a serious matter?

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,101
Since you let me take charge of it,

50
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,500
certainly, I should use some harsh means

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,141
That's true

52
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,180
However,

53
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,861
Zhao is a trusted helper of mine

54
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,101
It can never be wrong to appoint your trusted men

55
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,101
But I don't think Mr. Zhao has any talent

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,581
It took him a month to handle the revolt,

57
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,660
and all he did was to kill the leading deserters

58
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,500
He is simply a good-for-nothing and will

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,261
hinder you from seizing the Central Region

60
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,660
How are things going between you and Zhong Wanruo?

61
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,101
Since your marriage is just a part of the plan,

62
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,821
don't give your heart to her

63
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,100
Rest assured, Commander

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,460
She is just a woman

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,540
She can never compare with our goal

66
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,900
of dominating the Central Region

67
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,741
I won't take her seriously

68
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:23,980
Good

69
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,741
I'm glad to hear that

70
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,220
You know,

71
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,621
Rubing is in deep love with you

72
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,141
And

73
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:40,299
the two of you are about the same age

74
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,141
Why don't you

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,980
take her in as a concubine?

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,780
Rubing is such a beautiful

77
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,860
and knowledgeable girl

78
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:55,261
How could I make her my concubine?

79
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
Shaoli

80
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,540
Of course you can

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,100
You're a Marshal now

82
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,141
Successful men like us

83
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,501
all have many concubines

84
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,621
You just don't want to upset Zhong Wanruo, right?

85
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:12,860
How could this be?

86
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,420
She can never compare with Miss Xia

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,420
Great

88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,741
From now on, we're a family

89
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,501
Boss

90
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:39,501
Make do with it

91
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,900
This bunch of bastards

92
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,900
are having fun in the city, leaving us here

93
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,660
with only buns to eat

94
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,261
Isn't it annoying?

95
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,460
I'd lived a good life in the past 20 years

96
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,181
It's time to share the hardships with the people

97
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,061
That way, I can understand their needs better

98
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:53,900
Boss

99
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,900
What's your plan exactly?

100
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,621
Are you really going to join hands with Zhong Wanruo?

101
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,340
Zhong Wanruo controlled many businesses in Central Region

102
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:04,300
If we want to get weapons or supplies,

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,180
we have to rely on the Zhongs' Trading Firm

104
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,621
But she is quite hostile to us

105
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,141
Did you get any news

106
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,420
about my father?

107
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,860
Not yet

108
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,181
The whole Zhong family was killed,

109
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,540
and none of the Sheng family survived either

110
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,460
Where should I start with?

111
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,021
But I just found that

112
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:23,780
Ms. Liu, the old lady we saw the other day,

113
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,540
settled down outside the city with Zhong Wanruo's help

114
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,300
She should know some inside stories

115
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,701
Continue to investigate

116
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:31,860
I have to get to the bottom of this

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,181
I haven't got any news from Ms. Xin for a few days

118
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:40,621
Could something have happened to her?

119
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,621
Wanruo

120
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,420
You didn't go to the trading firm today?

121
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,660
You didn't go to the military camp either

122
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,941
Thank you

123
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:15,821
for your last suggestion

124
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,660
You're welcome

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,501
And...

126
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,061
Can you reconsider my request?

127
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,021
You still want to see Sheng Fang

128
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,300
He probably is the culprit of my family's death

129
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,460
I must find him

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,141
Alright

131
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,061
I promise you

132
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,941
I'll find him and hand him over to you

133
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,860
Really?

134
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,621
Yes

135
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:56,780
Thank you

136
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:02,420
Wanruo

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,300
Xia Jun

138
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:14,420
wants to marry Xia Rubing off to me

139
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,340
He wants her to be my concubine

140
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,821
You agreed to it?

141
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,381
I have no reason to refuse

142
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:29,741
That's right

143
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:33,101
You have no reason to disagree

144
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,580
Wanruo

145
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,021
Do you know that

146
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:49,341
what hurt me the most these years

147
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,101
was not the risk of

148
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,940
losing my life in the war,

149
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,101
but the painful memory

150
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,300
and the hatred from the past

151
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,980
I was consumed by the hatred

152
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,780
I was heartbroken

153
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,861
Heartbroken?

154
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,381
No

155
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:07,621
I won't feel heartbroken

156
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,420
Nor will I feel jealous

157
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,580
I'm sorry, Zirun

158
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:14,461
To take revenge,

159
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,699
I must have let you down

160
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,741
Zirun

161
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,341
Bless me in the heaven

162
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,021
so that I can avenge you as soon as possible

163
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,899
I promise you

164
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,779
we will see again

165
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,620
when your death is avenged
