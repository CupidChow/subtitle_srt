1
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:46,703
In the past

2
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,454
I eagerly await your victorious return

3
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,261
And now,

4
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,460
I just want to avenge you

5
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:56,341
This is the only reason why I'm still alive

6
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:58,941
You left this world,

7
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,140
leaving me, a notorious woman, behind

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,860
What's the point of all this?

9
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,820
Zirun

10
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:07,620
Wait for me

11
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,820
After I take revenge,

12
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,941
I'll join you immediately

13
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,021
What are you thinking about?

14
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,781
Nothing

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,301
Nothing?

16
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:45,259
You are thinking about Sheng Shihua, right?

17
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,021
Sure enough, you are

18
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,340
What on earth do you want?

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,620
What?

20
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:00,141
Do you regret

21
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,260
not leaving with him?

22
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,021
I don't know what you're talking about

23
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,060
Zhong Wanruo

24
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,500
Tell me

25
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,541
Now he left

26
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,140
Did your heart follow him away?

27
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:18,021
Yes

28
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,861
I've never loved you from beginning to end

29
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:23,180
He and I promised we would be together after he returns

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,581
You forced me to marry you

31
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,740
I don't want you or any of this

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,821
You still haven't learned your lesson

33
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,620
I'll teach you a good lesson now

34
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,300
Mu Shaoli

35
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,701
is disrespecting me more and more

36
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,660
I invited a lion to my home myself

37
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,180
Even if he is a lion,

38
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,900
he is no match for you

39
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,101
What a sweet talker

40
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,821
Did I hurt you just now?

41
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,701
Yes

42
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,780
That woman, Zhong Wanruo,

43
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,660
is fair and pretty

44
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Why is she so disobedient?

45
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,460
I want the Zhongs to die

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,620
and none of them can escape

47
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,541
She is just a woman

48
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,381
What does she have to fight me?

49
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,261
After Mu Shaoli

50
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:10,620
wipes out the remaining troops of Shengs' Army,

51
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:12,821
he will be of no use to me

52
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,660
When the time comes,

53
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,340
I'll take Zhong Wanruo in as my concubine

54
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,381
and let her be your sister

55
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,060
What do you think?

56
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:25,741
You must be joking, Commander

57
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,620
She socialized with me

58
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:30,061
for the sake of you, Commander

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,061
Did she?

60
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:41,420
Boss

61
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,420
Ever since you met your wife...

62
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,020
no, Miss Zhong,

63
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:47,860
you have been looking worried

64
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,701
If the Xias' Army

65
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:53,741
really gets that batch of weapons,

66
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,941
we will stand no chance of winning

67
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,261
Boss, don't think too much

68
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,460
Mu Shaoli hasn't got the weapons yet

69
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,220
Mu Shaoli is like a blade in Xia Jun's hands

70
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,181
If we can break down their alliance...

71
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,261
Boss

72
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,181
Do you have any ideas?

73
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,340
I want to join hands with Zhong Wanruo

74
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,061
Huh?

75
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,701
Join hands with her?

76
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:43,581
He not only has the hairband I gave to Zirun,

77
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,261
but also was so furious

78
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,300
about my relationship with Sheng Shihua

79
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,220
What is he thinking?

80
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,501
What exactly does he want?

81
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,420
Is he really just after that batch of weapons?

82
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:03,181
You're drunk

83
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,100
Zhong Wanruo

84
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,100
What does

85
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,980
your heart look like?

86
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,780
You're crazy

87
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,061
Marshal, we got bad news from the camp

88
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,100
Marshal

89
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,100
Some soldiers defected from the army

90
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,220
We need you to go back to take the reins

91
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:11,340
Did Sheng Shihua come back with his army?

92
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:12,420
No, no

93
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,900
It's because Commander treated soldiers unfairly

94
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,340
He embezzled the payment for these surrendered soldiers

95
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,821
and allocated it to his trusted ones

96
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:19,141
So the soldiers are in a rage

97
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:21,181
Marshal

98
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:23,621
What do you think the Commander is trying to do?

99
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,821
He is just afraid

100
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:28,021
these surrendered soldiers would swear loyalty to me

101
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Oh no, Marshal

102
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,780
A fight broke out in the Third Battalion

103
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,420
Let's go

104
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,580
Miss Zhong

105
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:43,900
Did you get any news?

106
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,420
A revolt broke out in the Third Battalion today

107
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Marshal Mu went out early in the morning

108
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,741
to handle the situation

109
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:49,780
These soldiers from Shengs' Army

110
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
surrendered a couple of months ago

111
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,981
Why did they suddenly revolt?

112
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,420
It's said the Commander deducted their payment,

113
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,660
which angered these soldiers

114
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:59,341
Mr. Zhao, the head of the battalion he just promoted,

115
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,740
killed a few soldiers who led the revolt

116
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,861
This enraged the surrendered soldiers

117
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,621
The two sides engaged in a fight

118
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:06,540
Is this news true?

119
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,021
Some of our suppliers sent supply to the camp

120
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:09,939
They confirmed the news is true

121
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,101
Alright, you can leave now

122
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:14,021
Yes

123
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:19,861
What's more, in Mu City

124
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,659
only Marshal Mu can

125
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,180
fight against Xia Jun

126
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,341
If you can win Marshal Mu over

127
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,899
to our side...

128
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:32,741
Looks like If I want to find Sheng Fang and avenge Zirun,

129
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:35,300
I have to join hands with Mu Shaoli

130
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,341
Who told you to come here?

131
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,461
I heard that

132
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:53,221
you were bothered by what happened at the camp

133
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,981
So I came to see if you are alright

134
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,020
Do you care about me?

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,940
We are a couple now

136
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,501
We will share

137
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:04,419
the same destiny

138
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:13,461
Did you just say that

139
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,179
we are a couple?
