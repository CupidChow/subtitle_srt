1
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,610
Wanruo and I did get married,

2
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:47,536
and we are still married now

3
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:48,669
So

4
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:52,286
her marriage with Mu Shaoli isn't legal

5
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:54,024
Zhong Wanruo

6
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:58,904
has always been

7
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:00,823
my legal wife

8
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:26,784
What's wrong?

9
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:29,584
Is there anything dirty on my hand?

10
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:31,983
Why did you shake my hands off so quickly?

11
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,183
I just don't understand

12
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,343
Why did you help me out?

13
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:42,903
Wanruo

14
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:44,784
Back then, I was not familiar with you

15
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:48,263
I didn't enter the room on our wedding night

16
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,543
I didn't know that I missed

17
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,864
such a perfect girl like you

18
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,664
Don't rush to give me an answer, okay?

19
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:57,584
I only have myself to blame

20
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,064
Recently, I have been thinking of

21
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,863
you getting out of the car

22
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,304
in a white wedding dress on your

23
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:04,463
and Mu Shaoli's wedding day

24
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:05,424
You looked so beautiful

25
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:07,903
I could have had you

26
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,622
Every time I think of this, I regret it

27
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,183
You're so outstanding

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,864
You don't have to...

29
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:16,663
Wanruo

30
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:18,704
Don't rush to reject me, okay?

31
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,264
I know you still love Mu Shaoli

32
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:23,384
But he is definitely not a good man

33
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:25,343
Even if you don't choose me,

34
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,104
you shouldn't choose a man like him

35
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:28,743
General Sheng

36
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,544
I want to talk with Wanruo

37
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,223
Please leave us alone

38
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:37,463
Since you want to talk, Marshal,

39
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:38,902
let's make things clear between us

40
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:43,024
Wait a minute

41
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:56,824
Wanruo

42
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:37,864
Wanruo

43
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,623
Do you still remember this hairband I gave you?

44
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:51,584
If you put on this hairband,

45
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:54,623
it means you agree to

46
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,104
go with me

47
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:57,104
Okay

48
00:03:58,544 --> 00:03:59,743
As long as you want,

49
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:04,264
I agree to go with you at any time

50
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,304
The hairband is a promise

51
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:10,824
As long as you put it on,

52
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:14,223
it means that you agree to go with me

53
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:16,543
Wanruo

54
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:18,704
Marshal Mu

55
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,463
All promises will expire

56
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,824
It's valid

57
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,504
only when I still love you

58
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:30,384
Wanruo

59
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:31,903
No, no!

60
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,183
You still love me, don't you?

61
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:34,944
Wanruo

62
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,184
It's dirty

63
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:47,863
It's dirty

64
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:51,863
The hairband is dirty

65
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:56,983
The hairband is dirty

66
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:57,584
Marshal

67
00:04:58,704 --> 00:04:59,543
How could the hairband be dirty?

68
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,223
Marshal

69
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:01,944
Don't be like this, Marshal

70
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:02,783
The hairband is dirty. Marshal

71
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:04,824
Marshal

72
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:06,503
Marshal

73
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:07,422
The hairband is dirty

74
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,184
Marshal

75
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,663
After coming out of the Commander's Mansion,

76
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,983
you've been looking pale

77
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:23,823
Wasn't the conversation with Mu Shaoli pleasant?

78
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:30,064
I'm done with him

79
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,583
Why would it be pleasant to talk to him?

80
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:35,064
Actually, you don't have to be like this

81
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,982
If you are really done with him,

82
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:40,982
why did you keep reminding yourself

83
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:42,384
not to make the same mistake again?

84
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:44,423
Wanruo

85
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,744
You can love whoever you want

86
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,064
I respect you

87
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:49,903
But it's on the premise that

88
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:51,823
you know me well enough

89
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,023
and know what kind of life you want

90
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,983
This is the most important thing

91
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:03,303
Wanruo

92
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,143
Give me a chance

93
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:07,662
Let me take care of you

94
00:06:08,423 --> 00:06:09,184
and help you

95
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:10,504
I'll help you

96
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,423
get whatever you want

97
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:16,583
Thank you

98
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:19,583
But there is

99
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:23,543
something that I want to do on my own

100
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:25,663
Or it will be pointless

101
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:33,184
Boss

102
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,783
Miss Zhong's place is so nice, not like ours,

103
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,783
where we only have terrible food to eat

104
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:39,704
Now,

105
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:42,064
though Shengs' Army and we ceased fire,

106
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,624
we can't let our guard down

107
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:46,584
After all, based on my past experience,

108
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,663
Xia Jun probably is just stalling for time

109
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,624
We can fight them again, can't we?

110
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,343
We are not afraid of

111
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,823
that bastard Mu Shaoli

112
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:57,983
Now,

113
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,184
we have to think carefully about

114
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,343
our next plan

115
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,144
Xia Jun is definitely not easy to deal with

116
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,064
Moreover,

117
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,463
his mansion is heavily guarded

118
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,903
The Central Government had just mediated

119
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,783
If we launch an attack now,

120
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:10,783
the Central Government would think that

121
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,343
we take them lightly

122
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:13,823
Then...

123
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,343
Do you have any good idea, boss?

124
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,264
Xia Jun

125
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,944
can rule the Mu City just relying on three things

126
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,303
Money, soldiers, and people's support

127
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:28,704
Money is a simple factor

128
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:29,983
It's just to widely expand businesses

129
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:33,223
My family will try our best to help the Shengs' Army

130
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:36,384
As for soldiers and people's support,

131
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,543
we need to make a careful and long-range plan

132
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:50,024
Marshal

133
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,624
There are so many military affairs

134
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:52,823
Why don't you handle them?

135
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:55,543
Military affairs?

136
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,303
After the peace talks,

137
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,543
Xia Jun has begun to devour my power

138
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:01,264
There in no way he would

139
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,744
let me handle important military affairs

140
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:04,862
Because of this,

141
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,584
you should pull yourself together, Marshal

142
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:07,863
Xia Jun is cruel and merciless

143
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,064
If you don't fight back...

144
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,542
How is Zhong Wanruo doing?

145
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,223
Zhong Wanruo

146
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,103
has been staying with Sheng Shihua recently

147
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,663
They have become new celebrities in the city

148
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:17,263
Is she

149
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,744
really with Sheng Shihua now?

150
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:21,824
Yes

151
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:29,024
As expected, she is in love with Sheng Shihua

152
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,143
Marshal

153
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:32,344
Perhaps

154
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,903
she had no other choice but to do so

155
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:40,703
Listen,

156
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:42,224
bring some men with you

157
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:44,504
to Nanwazi to teach Sheng Shihua a lesson

158
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,744
But we just made peace with them

159
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,423
Do as I say

160
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:51,263
Yes

161
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:12,464
Assistant Mo

162
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:16,464
Assistant Mo, Miss Zhong knew you would come

163
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:17,583
Zhuantou

164
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:18,263
Cut the crap

165
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,463
Let's go

166
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:20,624
Retreat!

167
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:25,984
Assistant Mo

168
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,104
Go back and ask Mu Shaoli

169
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:28,783
if he likes the present

170
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:29,942
Mr. Sheng gave him

171
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:31,783
Let's go

172
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:37,183
Commander

173
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,582
Marshal Mu raided the camp of Shengs' Army,

174
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,504
trying to burn their rations

175
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,624
However, the Shengs' Army was prepared

176
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,464
They switched the rations with explosives

177
00:09:45,464 --> 00:09:48,183
Marshal Mu suffered a great loss this time

178
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:49,783
Even his trusted aide, Assistant Mo,

179
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,024
was seriously injured

180
00:09:52,464 --> 00:09:54,823
Continue to keep an eye on Zhong Wanruo

181
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:56,024
Don't slack off

182
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:57,224
Yes

183
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:07,864
Marshal

184
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,903
Zhong Wanruo

185
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:13,303
In the end, you still helped Sheng Shihua to deal with me

186
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:15,984
Marshal

187
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,984
What should we do?

188
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,423
Shut down the Zhong family's trading routes
