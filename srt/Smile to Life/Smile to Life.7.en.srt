1
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
Chengcheng,

2
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,960
stop playing.

3
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,720
If you need anything, you can leave now.

4
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,160
You don't have to be perfunctory here.

5
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
I'm not perfunctory.

6
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,200
Right now,

7
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,920
I'm the three illusions of young people.

8
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't understand.

9
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,200
What are the three illusions?

10
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
The phone vibrates.

11
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,600
He likes me.

12
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
If I can fight back,

13
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,440
what kind of person are you?

14
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,080
The phone vibrates, of course.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,280
You had a fight with your boyfriend?

16
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,680
No.

17
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,480
No quarrel.

18
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,480
We're fine.

19
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm fine.

20
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Just quarrel.

21
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,000
What's there to say?

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,080
It's not like I've never been in a relationship.

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Chengcheng,

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,880
I want to eat apples.

25
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,480
Okay,

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,360
I'll peel it for you.

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
There are no apples left.

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,120
How about oranges?

29
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,120
I don't want oranges.

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,040
When my husband came to visit me this morning,

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
he brought oranges with him,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
You didn't buy me apples.

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,000
Your husband was here this morning,

34
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,960
That's right.

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,360
It's strange that he used to come with you.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,240
But now you always come in the morning,

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
and come when you're not around.

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,040
Caiyun,

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
I'll buy you apples.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
He's avoiding me on purpose.

41
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
It doesn't make sense.

42
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,160
Why is he avoiding me?

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,040
Hello, Mr. Bao.

44
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Chengcheng.

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,680
May I ask,

46
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,000
is there anything going on with Goddess Nan recently?

47
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,440
Ask Jiang Nan.

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,720
He's fine.

49
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,440
It's good.

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,720
Well … Well

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
Studio,

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
Is there anything I can do for you?

53
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,320
There's nothing going on in the studio lately.

54
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Jiang is writing a song in seclusion?

55
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,040
Closed-door training?

56
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,320
Him?

57
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Recently, I've received a few new songs,

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,480
and I'm practicing in seclusion?

59
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,600
Don't worry.

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
He's fine.

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
You're avoiding me.

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,720
Well,

63
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,520
at least he's getting better at work.

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,200
Jiang,

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,760
what's going on?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Did you have a fight?

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,840
Listen,

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Gu Jiayi has been contacting me for the past two days.

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,560
You don't have to tell me about her.

70
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,040
What are you

71
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,400
doing here?

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,720
half of the day

73
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,280
How about this?

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,560
I made it.

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,200
I just tasted it.

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,240
Try it.

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,560
Try it

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,120
What do you think?

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
It's delicious.

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Don't you think

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,760
it's a little mushy.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
It's a bit mushy.

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
But whoever makes cola chicken wings is different.

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,240
Am I right?

85
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,600
The smell from outside is the same.

86
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,440
It's a bit mushy.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,560
It's unique.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Very,

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,760
very special.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,080
Why do you like

91
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
such violent sports all of a sudden.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Leave me alone.

93
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,920
My sister told me about it

94
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,320
again. Tell me about it.

95
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,800
Thirty articles a week,

96
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,520
which doesn't satisfy your sister,

97
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,800
I was scolded,

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
except for your sister,

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
As for Kiki,

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,080
I have to guard against her throwing the pot at me.

101
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,440
There was a manuscript last week,

102
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,800
and it was her fault,

103
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,920
The wicked complained first,

104
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,520
and blamed me in front of Shan.

105
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,480
Every day,

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
I have to find a way to reduce stress.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,800
So miserable.

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,080
Maybe

109
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,880
you can be my girlfriend.

110
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,680
I'll use the back door for you.

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,360
Who would like to give it a try?

112
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,840
Me.

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,880
If you can defeat me,

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,920
I promise you.

115
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,720
Come on.

116
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,320
The coach hasn't called "start" yet.

117
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,880
Start

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,039
Do you want me to be your girlfriend?

119
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,960
You're here.

121
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm exhausted.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,560
Have you seen how radiant I've been lately?

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,240
She went to the hospital to get a shot of water light.

124
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,560
Those are only temporary but not permanent.

125
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
I'm telling you,

126
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,880
exercise makes people healthy.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm so tired of revising and writing during the day,

128
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,200
and I'm going to practice taekwondo at night,

129
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,920
It's like he's resurrected with blood in an instant.

130
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,480
You're making it look like I don't exercise.

131
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,360
I've been practicing the Eight-part King Kong Skill.

132
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay, okay,

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
This topic

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,960
is over.

135
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,960
Let's talk about

136
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,680
your superstar.

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Actually,

138
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
I haven't seen him recently.

139
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,000
What's going on?

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Mr. Bao said that

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,040
he has been working in seclusion recently.

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,400
Keqin,

143
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
do you feel like,

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
I've been living

145
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,520
a little unreal lately.

146
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm just

147
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,160
an ordinary girl,

148
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,080
Now the public opinion storm has subsided.

149
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I should

150
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,720
go back to my peaceful life.

151
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,800
How are you ordinary?

152
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,480
You are the most beautiful

153
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,480
in my heart. Be happy,

154
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,320
Greasy. All right.

155
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Let's not talk about him.

156
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,280
I really miss the time when we went on a trip together.

157
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
I've been stuck by so many trivial things lately.

158
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,240
I don't even know when I can go out to play again.

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,080
It's just a trip.

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,120
Where do you want to go?

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
I'll go with you.

162
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,200
Your chief editor can give you a leave of absence,

163
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,960
Me,

164
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm risking my life.

165
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
It's a big deal to go out to relax with my sisters.

166
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Must be allowed to leave.

167
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,120
I may not have enough time.

168
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
I have to ask for leave too.

169
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,360
What's the big deal?

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,680
Then you can ask for leave.

171
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,560
Is there anywhere you want to go?

172
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,960
You see,

173
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,120
we both just graduated,

174
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
I don't have much money on me,

175
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,600
so I think we should find someone close to him.

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
And in places with good scenery

177
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,400
and low expenses,

178
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,000
Right?

179
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,040
I remember now.

180
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,760
My colleague took annual leave last month

181
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,000
and went to Jingcheng,

182
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,880
When he posted it on his Moments,

183
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,800
he took a good picture.

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,360
Let's go to Jingcheng too.

185
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Then I'll do the strategy.

186
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
Let's make an appointment to go together then.

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,640
Okay.

188
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Order your food now.

189
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,840
I'm starving.

190
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,520
Okay,

191
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,080
Scan here.

192
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,920
Bag.

193
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
Didn't he just leave?

194
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,440
Let's eat.

195
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,880
After all these years,

196
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
you've lost weight,

197
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,600
Your taste hasn't changed at all.

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,480
You don't understand.

199
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,400
Practice with three points and eat

200
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
with seven points. How did you get in?

201
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,760
I called you and turned off the phone,

202
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
so I entered the password myself.

203
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,000
When I saw the lights weren't on and no one was there,

204
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,080
I was thinking about making something to eat myself,

205
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,760
Brother,

206
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,200
You have such a good habit.

207
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,760
He never changed the password.

208
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,800
I'll change the password tomorrow.

209
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
Is that so?

210
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,040
You're so stingy.

211
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,600
How can you talk to your brother?

212
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,480
You're generous,

213
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,240
you're generous,

214
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,400
You're the most generous.

215
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,960
Tell me,

216
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
it's been a long time since we came back,

217
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,680
Why did you come to me so late?

218
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
A man's energy

219
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,640
isn't dedicated to his career,

220
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,920
You're dedicated to love,

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,560
but now you're dedicated to your career.

222
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,040
Of course I want to devote myself to love.

223
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,240
I don't know whose good girl

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,960
is going to suffer again.

225
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,560
It's not the one you told me

226
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,280
on WeChat,

227
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,560
What kind of goddess.

228
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Do you still remember my dear family?

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,560
Wait.

230
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,600
Keqin,

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,200
what's your goddess's full name?

232
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,400
Yu Keqin,

233
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,640
the best friend of many oranges,

234
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,360
Yu Keqin,

235
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,000
that's right.

236
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,960
The woman I always told you before

237
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,720
who defended me when I was in school,

238
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,280
What a wonderful fate.

239
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Our girlfriends are still best friends.

240
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
All right,

241
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,560
what are you thinking?

242
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,800
Is that why you came to see me today?

243
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm here this time,

244
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,040
because I want to talk about you and many oranges,

245
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,480
In order to protect many oranges,

246
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,720
my dear family got scolded a lot.

247
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,520
I was thinking,

248
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,040
where did you fall and where did you get up?

249
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,280
Let's see what exclusive big melons you have.

250
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,200
Give it to my dear family.

251
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,120
Come closer.

252
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,280
I think you are the big one.

253
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,680
How long have you had a crush on her?

254
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
Have I ever talked to you?

255
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,840
So now I've changed tactics.

256
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,720
I don't have a crush anymore.

257
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,640
I obviously want to take the initiative

258
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,200
when chasing a man,

259
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,640
Otherwise, it'll get cold in someone else's bowl sooner or later.

260
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,920
In love, a man has to take the initiative

261
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,880
and give,

262
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
You have to take the initiative.

263
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,920
It's cold in someone else's bowl.

264
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,320
What is it?

265
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,400
What?

266
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:14,960
Have you finished eating?

267
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Finish it and leave.

268
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,760
We haven't seen each other for such a long time,

269
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
and you treat your brother like this?

270
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,240
Are you leaving?

271
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,880
I'm not leaving.

272
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,080
Are you leaving?

273
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm not leaving.

274
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,200
It's fine if you don't leave.

275
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Your brother I found a new film recently,

276
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,920
I'll show you how to taste it,

277
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,240
What film

278
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,440
doesn't have this

279
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,760
Mom,

280
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
What are you looking for?

281
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,240
I saw you put a bottle of vitamin here

282
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,560
a while ago.

283
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,040
I want to eat some.

284
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,520
I've finished taking that vitamin.

285
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,360
I'm done.

286
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,720
Didn't I just

287
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,440
buy you a new bottle a few days ago?

288
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,560
I gave the new bottle to Keqin.

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,480
She said she wanted to buy vitamins too,

290
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,040
so I gave them to her.

291
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay,

292
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
I'll buy it for you.

293
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,200
When you wake up,

294
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,640
can you clean the quilt first?

295
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,400
Fold it up.

296
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,640
It's a mess.

297
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,280
You don't look like a girl. Mom,

298
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,760
I'll clean the room myself in the future.

299
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,880
You don't have to help me clean up.

300
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,680
It's not enough for you to make a mess by yourself.

301
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,160
This one of mine

302
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
is called order in chaos.

303
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,360
Every time you help me clean up the house,

304
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,880
I can't find it anymore.

305
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,840
It's chaotic and orderly.

306
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,920
What's there to find?

307
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,760
No secrets,

308
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
What secret can I have?

309
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,720
I have a secret. How can I not tell you?

310
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,280
How dare you not tell me?

311
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,720
My dad bought watermelons and they're in the fridge.

312
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
You should eat more fruits,

313
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,120
so that you can supplement your vitamins.

314
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,120
All right,

315
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
I got it.

316
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,040
You think I'm nagging again, right?

317
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,400
This won't do.

318
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,920
We'll find out sooner or later.

319
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
I have to think of a way.

320
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,839
Hey,

321
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,839
rosy clouds

322
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:17,960
Okay, okay.

323
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,839
I'll be right there.

324
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,280
What are you doing?

325
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Did you stay up late again last night?

326
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
No one will treat you as dumb if you don't talk.

327
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,079
How many times have I told you?

328
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,880
Don't stay up late and work

329
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,000
will affect your health.

330
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,200
Wake up,

331
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Hurry up

332
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,680
Hello, Jia Yi,

333
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,160
Jiang Nan is out of the house,

334
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,160
Follow him.

335
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,240
I'm coming now.

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,080
Rui,

337
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,360
let me ask you something.

338
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,280
Help me analyze it.

339
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,360
Tell me,

340
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,880
the girlfriend of a friend of mine,

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
He's getting closer and closer to his rival.

342
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,360
Many oranges are with Zhan Zhilin.

343
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Not together.

344
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,320
It's just that she's always.

345
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,400
I said he's my friend.

346
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,800
Do you have any friends?

347
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know any of your friends.

348
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,040
Why not?

349
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Zhu Lin Feng No,

350
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,960
I almost forgot about him.

351
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,920
Let me tell you,

352
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,440
where is this woman?

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
It's just a delicate flower,

354
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,000
which needs to be watered carefully,

355
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,240
Like a spring breeze.

356
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
What you need to do now,

357
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
is to work hard,

358
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,000
Take the initiative?

359
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,480
Why should I take the initiative?

360
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,840
Let me tell you,

361
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,760
Jiang Zhan Zhilin is much better at teasing girls than you.

362
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
You haven't seen it before. How do you know?

363
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,560
Yes, yes, yes.

364
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,760
Hard-mouthed,

365
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,640
Hard-mouthed,

366
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,880
Keep going.

367
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,040
Turn right ahead

368
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,040
and go to Youfu Road first.

369
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,240
Youfu Road,

370
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,360
isn't that a musical instrument shop?

371
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,600
Good for you,

372
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,600
Jiang. Have you come to your senses?

373
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,000
Do you want to show the new song

374
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
to a lot of oranges at the first time,

375
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,760
But it's not appropriate for me to go with you.

376
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,840
Brother Rui is not good at being a third wheel.

377
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,560
You know that, right?

378
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,560
Listen,

379
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
you have to listen to everything I say in the future.

380
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,520
You know what?

381
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
Although I'm nagging,

382
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,520
but I'm talking about it in a reasonable way,

383
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,080
No one will treat you as dumb if you don't talk.

384
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,480
Thank you for coming to see me.

385
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,640
I'm fine.

386
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,520
That's good.

387
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,240
I just heard you play a part.

388
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,040
It's not bad,

389
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,160
You eavesdropped on my class.

390
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,560
What do you mean by eavesdropping?

391
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,640
As the owner of the musical instrument store,

392
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,680
it's just a private visit.

393
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,000
Let's see if the employees are working hard.

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,520
What's wrong with you?

395
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,240
It's okay. I'll be fine

396
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,760
after some rest.

397
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,160
Have a seat over there.

398
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,880
Sometimes,

399
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,680
my leg hurts for no reason,

400
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,600
Be careful.

401
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,160
Be careful.

402
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,520
What are you doing?

403
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,120
Don't move.

404
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,040
Does it hurt?

405
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,880
I'll go.

406
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,240
What's going on?

407
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,720
What's wrong?

408
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,600
Jiang Nan,

409
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,920
I think,

410
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,400
Your hairstyle is not very handsome today.

411
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,680
What's wrong with you?

412
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,280
Actually, what I want to say is,

413
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,880
the clothes we wear today,

414
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
It's not suitable to see many oranges,

415
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,920
what can I wear

416
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,200
and what can I not wear when I see her?

417
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,920
How about this?

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,440
Don't move.

419
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,120
Look at me,

420
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,040
what I'm trying to say is,

421
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,400
Our car is very dirty today.

422
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,120
I think we should wash the car first.

423
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
Virgo, you have to understand me,

424
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,600
do decent people like us

425
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,960
wash cars?

426
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
We're at the door.

427
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,880
Don't talk.

428
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,760
Face matters.

429
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,720
Wash the car before you come back.

430
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,280
Let's go.

431
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,240
I'll take you to Dr. Sui.

432
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,240
No, thanks.

433
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,640
I really feel much better.

434
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,920
What are you doing?

435
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,480
Put me down.

436
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,000
I just saw a doctor last week.

437
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,240
If you want to live for two more years,

438
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,760
You have to listen to me from now on.

439
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
It's okay, Dr. Sui.

440
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,240
Go ahead.

441
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,280
You've reached the stage of getting sick.

442
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,680
There will be muscle weakness in the limbs and trunk,

443
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,440
and then,

444
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,200
Maybe it's muscle atrophy.

445
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,160
Dr. Sui,

446
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,080
how much time do I have left to play the piano?

447
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
We have to go through some auxiliary tests

448
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
before we can judge it.

449
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
As long as we receive active treatment,

450
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,120
it can still be delayed.

451
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,360
Actually, I want to ask,

452
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,440
how much time do I have?

453
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,640
Generally speaking,

454
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,000
it's three to five years.

455
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
But the patient's condition is different.

456
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,640
If you control it well,

457
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,560
It can last for more than ten years.

458
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,280
Sorry,

459
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,200
it's okay,

460
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,920
Actually, I know

461
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
everything. I just want to make sure,

462
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,280
maybe

463
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,000
How many more years can I live?

464
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,880
Jiang Nan,

465
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
are you here to look for a lot of oranges?

466
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,360
Is she here?

467
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,520
She and our old gentleman

468
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
What's wrong with your eyes?

469
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
My eyes are a little dry.

470
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
I can't find him or not.

471
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,600
Let's go.

472
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,440
Thank you.

473
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,600
Take me to my mom's place first.

474
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,360
Thank you.

475
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,840
Is this the musical instrument store of Zhan Zhilin

476
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,320
and Many Orange in the live broadcast?

477
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,480
Go inside and have a look.

478
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,960
Okay.

479
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,720
Fang,

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,720
keep following me.

481
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,880
If I don't reply to your WeChat,

482
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,120
you won't contact me.

483
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,040
You took the initiative to find you

484
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
and you turned off your phone. Let's see what I can do with you.

485
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,400
Who are you going to deal with?

486
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,600
I'll clean up whoever turns off the phone.

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,960
It's okay. I have a charging treasure

488
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,840
Tell me,

489
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,520
Jiayi,

490
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,520
it turns out that many oranges work as teachers in this musical instrument store

491
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,400
to teach piano lessons,

492
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,080
She also teaches piano,

493
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,760
and,

494
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,320
The owner of this musical instrument store

495
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,720
is Zhan Zhilin,

496
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,400
The clerk said that many oranges were not feeling well,

497
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,600
so Zhilin Zhan accompanied many oranges to the hospital.

498
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,840
The hospital.

499
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,520
Send someone to follow us.

500
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,080
What a great opportunity.

501
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,720
Got it.

502
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,760
I'll arrange it right away.

503
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,720
How did you find this place?

504
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,000
After BeOne was disbanded,

505
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,800
my dad arranged a job for me.

506
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,480
Because of work,

507
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,520
I'll come to the hospital,

508
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,000
So when you're unhappy,

509
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,880
you come here for a walk,

510
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,400
I didn't expect you

511
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,080
to be unhappy sometimes.

512
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,320
What?

513
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,880
Don't tell me

514
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
I don't seem to be troubled.

515
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,840
Shout it.

516
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,440
Many oranges,

517
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
you have to live.

518
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,440
You have to live a good life.

519
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,440
Stay strong. Many oranges.

520
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,640
Many oranges. You have to work hard.

521
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
I feel much better when I shout it out.

522
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,120
It's your turn.

523
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,080
I didn't.

524
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,960
Really?

525
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,800
I don't believe it.

526
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,240
Remember to

527
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
take your medicine on time,

528
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,200
Got it?

529
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,640
If you don't feel well,

530
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,440
remember to call me.

531
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,920
Thank you for today.

532
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,840
I've delayed you for such a long time.

533
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,880
Didn't you say that?

534
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,280
Where am I?

535
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,520
But the only one

536
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
who can share your secret,

537
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,040
Let's go

538
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,080
Many oranges,

539
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,440
Jiangnan,

540
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,040
Why are you here?

541
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,440
Can't I come?

542
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,080
Is there anything you don't want me to see?

543
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,240
You saw Zhan Zhilin send me back.

544
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,360
Many oranges,

545
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
remember them well.

546
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,360
We're in an employment relationship,

547
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,640
so I'm asking you that

548
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,160
in the future, apart from the time of classes at the musical instrument store,

549
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,560
Don't have any contact with him.

550
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,360
Don't make trouble out of nothing, okay?

551
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,920
These days, you disappeared for no reason,

552
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,920
without seeing me,

553
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,360
Now you suddenly show up and take charge of me.

554
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,400
Besides,

555
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,440
If you don't want me to see Zhan Zhilin,

556
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,720
you have to give me a reason.

557
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,760
There's no reason.

558
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,640
As you said,

559
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,080
we're in an employment relationship,

560
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,280
Zhan Zhilin and I are also in an employment relationship.

561
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,400
You two suddenly become incompatible.

562
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,080
Now you want to drag me into the team,

563
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
and I don't think Zhan Zhilin is that bad,

564
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,320
He usually takes good care of me.

565
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
What do you need to take care of?

566
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,760
Can't I take care of you?

567
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,960
Besides,

568
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
even if you don't think about it,

569
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,640
If you weren't my girlfriend,

570
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,360
would Zhan Zhilin still be nice to you?

571
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,320
So you mean,

572
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,280
in order to target you, Zhan Zhilin,

573
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
That's why you approached me on purpose,

574
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,600
so don't be so shallow and ridiculous.

575
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,600
Being chased by a rich man is rushing you

576
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
to say that again?

577
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,360
Being chased by rich people is a rush.

578
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,400
What's wrong with you?

579
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,560
I didn't expect

580
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,080
Zhan Zhilin's progress to be so fast,

581
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,960
You have a lot of material.

582
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,080
Jiang Nan,

583
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,000
your bean sprouts are not easy to use.

584
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,280
I'll show you what she really is.

585
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,960
So annoying.

586
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
It's all my fault.

587
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,360
Your favorite,

588
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,440
stop beating around the bush,

589
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,720
Tell me,

590
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
where did you get the photos?

591
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,880
Jiang Nan,

592
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,960
I want to know what's going on.

593
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,560
You should know very well,

594
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,400
I told you long ago,

595
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Many oranges are not simple,

596
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,440
nowadays girls,

597
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,400
You have a lot of tricks.

598
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,880
So you asked someone to take photos of her.

599
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,120
You think I asked someone to take photos of her?

600
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,080
Am I that childish?

601
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,880
In your heart,

602
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,280
I've always been a

603
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,840
despicable and insidious woman.

604
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,680
This morning.

605
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,680
The agent called me and told me that

606
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,120
someone got a lot of materials

607
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
about Orange and Zhan Zhilin,

608
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,680
To sell it to the truth,

609
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,600
if I really want to destroy you,

610
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,360
I can pretend I don't know.

611
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,400
Let it be exposed.

612
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,880
It doesn't affect me anyway.

613
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,920
But I've been thinking about it for a long time,

614
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,040
and it'll embarrass you

615
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,960
if it's exposed.

616
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,320
A man and a woman

617
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,640
swim in the sea of flowers.

618
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,240
Those reporters are just reading pictures and making up stories,

619
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,560
from their mouths,

620
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,920
What kind words can there be?

621
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,200
So,

622
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,920
I bought these photos.

623
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
Why did I do that?

624
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,800
You should know it very well.

625
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I don't understand.

626
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,280
I know.

627
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,360
You misunderstood me before.

628
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,280
I know you hate me now.

629
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
But in the past,

630
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,880
I don't want to explain anymore.

631
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,040
And you won't believe anything I say.

632
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,440
I've deleted the photos.

633
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,680
What I can do for you,

634
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,680
That's all I have.

635
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,680
Take care of yourself.

636
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,200
Hopefully,

637
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,440
we can still be friends in the future.

638
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,000
Thank you.

639
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,160
I'm here.

640
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,480
Why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

641
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,440
Have a seat.

642
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,560
Where did you get this photo?

643
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,880
Gu Jiayi said

644
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,120
she asked someone to buy it.

645
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,400
Gu Jiayi didn't mention anything,

646
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,360
but deleted the photo in front of Jiang.

647
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,840
I'm very worried about this,

648
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
because I don't know if she has a backup.

649
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,720
I can't trust the person who sells photos.

650
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
That's what I'm worried about.

651
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,520
There's nothing between us.

652
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,640
So you two showed up there together?

653
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,840
It's not about the angle.

654
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,160
Jiang Nan, what do you mean?

655
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,120
I mean,

656
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,360
two people, two people, two people,

657
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,640
Solve the problem.

658
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,840
Don't fight yet.

659
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,440
Personally, I think,

660
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
now that it's over,

661
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,640
Let's figure out a solution together.

662
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,480
Actually,

663
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,560
Mr. Bao, I'm really good at this kind of thing.

664
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
Let's take the initiative.

665
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,240
Preemptively,

666
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,880
can you not keep us in suspense?

667
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,800
What can I do?

668
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,840
Do you want to say it or not?

669
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,520
I'd better stop.

670
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,920
Actually, I just want to say,

671
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,960
if you two

672
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,200
live together,

673
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,720
No way.

674
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,600
Why are you so excited?

675
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,160
You have to think like this,

676
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
that's all,

677
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,080
It might be a good solution.

678
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,360
Turn passive into active.

679
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,080
Even if this photo gets out in the future,

680
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,960
you two stay down to earth,

681
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We can live together quietly.

682
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,280
Let them talk.

683
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,800
If you think of another way,

684
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
I've already thought about it anyway.

685
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,400
It's none of your business.

686
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,320
Mom,

687
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,280
What are you looking for?

688
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,080
I saw you put a bottle of vitamin here

689
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
a while ago.

690
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
I want to eat some.

691
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,400
Moving out might be the only solution.

692
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,840
So what?

693
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,200
After thinking about it,

694
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,400
I don't think there is any other way.

695
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,640
I agree.

696
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,240
Why are you two looking at me like that?

697
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,600
Ren Chengcheng has agreed.

698
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,040
Do you have anything else to say?

699
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,680
You two have made up your mind.

700
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,920
What else can I say?

701
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,720
But I have a few conditions,

702
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,720
you tell me, you tell me,

703
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,800
First,

704
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,040
the fact that we live together,

705
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,360
You must keep it a secret for me.

706
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,520
My parents can't know about it.

707
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,200
No problem.

708
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,360
Second,

709
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,480
even if you want to live here,

710
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,440
But it doesn't count as my rent.

711
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,280
At least you have to control the food and the food.

712
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,640
Of course.

713
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,800
Third,

714
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,880
I don't sleep in tents.

715
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,640
I want to have my own cabin.

716
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,560
No problem.

717
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,240
Fourth,

718
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
why are there so many demands?

719
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,120
Fourth,

720
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,440
Jiang Nan,

721
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,640
You have to apologize to me

722
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,480
for what you said before.

723
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,720
What excessive words?

724
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
What excessive words?

725
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,639
Don't be so shallow and ridiculous.

726
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,639
I apologize for being chased

727
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,880
by rich people.

728
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,360
Don't look at me.

729
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,400
Tell me,

730
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,320
Okay,

731
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,040
I know what you said.

732
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,600
I've already said

733
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,600
my terms. Think about it.

734
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,520
I'll get going.

735
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,679
Chengcheng,

736
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,320
No,

737
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,120
With your temper,

738
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,800
why is it so hard for you

739
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
to just apologize?

740
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,560
Why should I apologize?

741
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,040
What can a man do if he apologizes?

742
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,760
You know nothing.

743
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
What are you trying to do?

744
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Didn't I do it for your own good?

745
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,159
For whom?

746
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,719
I'm sleepy.

747
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,560
Go upstairs and sleep first.

748
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm sleepy

749
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,920
again. Think about it,

750
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,040
Got it.

751
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,400
For this job,

752
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,600
I don't know how much time I have left.

753
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,040
Many oranges

754
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,800
are in such a hurry. Why did you ask me to come?

755
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,440
No one is following you, right?

756
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,640
I don't think so.

757
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,600
I'm looking for you.

758
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,080
I have something to tell you.

759
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,200
Sorry,

760
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,840
I may have caused you trouble.

761
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,680
What are you talking about?

762
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,560
We were photographed at Huahai

763
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,680
a few days ago.

764
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,080
How did you know that?

765
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,240
Gu Jiayi bought those photos and sent them to Jiang Nan.

766
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,200
I saw it.

767
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,240
What I'm worried about now is,

768
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,160
the people who sell photos don't keep their promises,

769
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,520
Once the photos are leaked out,

770
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,040
I'm afraid it'll affect you.

771
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,080
I'm really sorry.

772
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,400
I didn't expect to cause you so much trouble.

773
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,480
You don't have to

774
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,640
apologize. It's not your fault.

775
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
No matter what they say,

776
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,960
it doesn't matter

777
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,320
to me,

778
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,080
However,

779
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,040
it's quite special to be cared for.

780
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,720
Do you always care about Jiang Nan this much?

781
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,640
Are you still in the mood to joke?

782
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,040
I don't think we should

783
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,400
see each other again.

784
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
You take everything on yourself.

785
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,320
Aren't you tired?

786
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,960
The person you are destined to meet

787
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,520
will be met no matter what.

788
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,960
You can't stop it.

789
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,280
There's nothing you can do.

790
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,600
By the way,

791
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,960
it suddenly occurred to me that I have something else to do.

792
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,240
Can you do it yourself?

793
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,840
I'll get going then.
