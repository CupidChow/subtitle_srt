1
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,480
What are you doing?

2
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,840
You're awake.

3
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,760
I want to exercise with you in the future.

4
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,680
By the way,

5
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,080
I made a schedule,

6
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,880
I hope,

7
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,800
from now on, I can exercise with you every morning.

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll give you a massage tonight,

9
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,800
and I promise,

10
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
In the future reexamination,

11
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
I won't leave anything behind.

12
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,240
What smells so good?

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,400
Come with me.

14
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,280
It smells so good. This is

15
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,440
chicken soup with wild fungus.

16
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,640
I've checked the information.

17
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,720
It turns out mushrooms also have medicinal value.

18
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,360
It's comparable to ginseng.

19
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
Say what you just said again.

20
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,840
I haven't posted

21
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,400
any health videos for days.

22
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,520
I lost a lot of powder.

23
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,040
Come on,

24
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Morchella is rich in amino acids

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,800
and organic germanium

26
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,680
needed by human body,

27
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,240
While Agrocybe aegerita

28
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,280
has the effect of clearing away heat and benefiting eyesight.

29
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,760
It's nourishing and not greasy.

30
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,080
Okay.

31
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,040
Drink the soup first.

32
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,240
Sometimes,

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,200
I think all of this is very unreal.

34
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm here.

35
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,800
I've always been there.

36
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,840
Have a taste.

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,880
Come on,

38
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,400
Latte made with rose tea coffee

39
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,600
Try it

40
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,400
It's good. I'm glad

41
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,880
you like it.

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,200
If there is no class at the musical instrument store today,

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
do you want to go to the production room with me?

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,160
Is it really okay?

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,880
Although I've written lyrics for others,

46
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
I don't know how to create

47
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,080
a complete piece of music at all?

48
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
Your boyfriend runs a music studio,

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
and you write lyrics for others,

50
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,400
I've never heard you tell me about it before.

51
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,000
I posted it on the trumpet.

52
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,000
I didn't expect anyone to watch it.

53
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
Probably sold three songs.

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
I earned more than 30 thousand.

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
When you broke up with me,

56
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
you wanted to pay me back more than 200, 000 yuan,

57
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
Just a little sample

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,320
of it,

59
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
You can make a lot of money.

60
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,240
Let's put aside our work,

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,440
I have an announcement to make,

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,920
For the truth to develop better.

63
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
The Group has transferred its shares.

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
Ensure the inflow of funds.

65
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
According to Mr. Liang's instructions,

66
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
the truth will be prepared by two masters soon.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,480
From today on,

68
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,640
Kiki will also be the editor-in-chief of Truth.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Thank you, Chief Qin.

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,760
I hope for the next work,

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,840
I can work with you happily.

72
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,320
Siyou Pengfei Jiawei, come with me.

73
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,280
I didn't expect Kiki

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,080
to hug Liang Zhe's thigh so quickly.

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,480
You even want to step on Sis Shan's head.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It seems that my sister is really hard to protect herself.

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,600
No way.

78
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,160
I need to see her.

79
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,760
Come on,

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Let me keep an eye on your trumpet.

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Why is this name

82
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,520
so familiar?

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,000
This name is familiar to me,

84
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,480
too. I remember it now.

85
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,040
Did you create a channel on Cool Dog Concept Edition

86
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,000
under the same screen name of this trumpet,

87
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,960
That's right.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
I followed a lot of channels before,

89
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,080
all of which were created by this net name.

90
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
Last month,

91
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,680
the Cool Dog Concept Channel Award Scheme,

92
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
I took part in it,

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,040
and I got a bonus.

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,600
Did you secretly use this trumpet

95
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,080
to set up a music channel.

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,560
I followed it too.

97
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,600
Look.

98
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
Good for you.

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,480
It seems that you are still a rich woman.

100
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,240
Admire,

101
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,640
please take good care of me from now on.

102
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,000
No, I don't.

103
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,520
But then again, Chengcheng,

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you're running back and forth part-time,

105
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Are you too tired?

106
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,920
As for the musical instrument store,

107
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
should we consider stopping it?

108
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
No way.

109
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,080
It's not easy for students to like me so much,

110
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,120
she and her parents,

111
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,440
He asked me to teach by name.

112
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,120
I can't let it go.

113
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,880
Sit down.

114
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,160
Get ready to go.

115
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Gosh,

116
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,000
it turns out that the recording studio looks like this.

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,320
This is my first time in a recording studio.

118
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,760
I.

119
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,760
I really don't get it at all.

120
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Tell me about it.

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
In fact, the production process of a song is very simple,

122
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,480
usually the composition first,

123
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,240
Sample song,

124
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,280
then write lyrics and arrange music,

125
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,440
What about the final style after arrangement?

126
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,320
It will be decided according to a specific situation.

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,520
After all of this is done,

128
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
we can record it.

129
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,280
Right there,

130
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
recording the voices first,

131
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,880
Then record the instruments.

132
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
And then there's the retouching

133
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,040
and mixing of the master tape,

134
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,280
In the end, you can choose a day to post the song.

135
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
Gosh,

136
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,520
that's easy.

137
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,320
You're amazing.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,440
Chengcheng,

139
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
do you want to experience

140
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
the two of us?

141
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,320
Let's do a video of "Coke Chicken Wings",

142
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Me.

143
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,440
Didn't you say that

144
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,960
you want to leave traces in this world?

145
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,840
From now on, for every song I play,

146
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
there will be a version of you.

147
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,320
Don't be afraid.

148
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,560
I'll be there for you.

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Come on,

150
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,360
Don't be nervous.

151
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,240
Don't be so nervous.

152
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,880
Come on,

153
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,560
Stand here.

154
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,920
Let me debug

155
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,640
Chengcheng,

156
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Take a deep breath with me to relax.

157
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
WHOOSH!

158
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,880
One more time,

159
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,600
Suck,

160
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,840
Are you feeling better?

161
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,240
Chengcheng,

162
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
listen to the prelude of the song.

163
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,080
As you can imagine,

164
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
this song might appear on our pillow.

165
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,440
and might show up

166
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,280
in the subway,

167
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
In the classroom,

168
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
in the cafe,

169
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,520
The most important thing is that

170
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,440
this song now has your voice,

171
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,360
I feel like,

172
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
I feel happy

173
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,360
and fulfilled all of a sudden.

174
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,720
Let's get started.

175
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,680
The bright caramel color

176
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
is a sign of summer,

177
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,000
Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles,

178
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,960
the light smoke in the freezer, the smell of ice,

179
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Your hand pried open my feigned arrogance.

180
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,320
What?

181
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,920
You live above my sister's house?

182
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,400
I ran into her last night when I was throwing garbage.

183
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,200
She lives upstairs from her house,

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,040
falling from the sky and leaking out of the night.

185
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,160
It's you.

186
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,960
Cut the crap.

187
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,960
Seriously,

188
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
can you help me find out

189
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
the truth? What's going on?

190
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,400
After all, Jiang and Liang Zhe have a grudge,

191
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,360
and if we buy the truth at this time,

192
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,440
I don't think

193
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,840
it's a good thing.

194
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,960
Okay,

195
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,520
Don't worry.

196
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
I'll take care of it.

197
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,680
Keqin,

198
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
how is my sister today?

199
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm worried about the preparation of Mr. Shuang.

200
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,920
Kiki

201
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,560
had a hard time with us before,

202
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
It's getting worse now.

203
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,840
Chief Qin,

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,440
go away!

205
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,640
Sis Shan,

206
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,680
I'm so sorry.

207
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,160
He even asked you to come to me in person.

208
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,640
What's going on?

209
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,440
Our team has been thinking about

210
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
these topic selection proposals for a week.

211
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,200
Why are they all calling back?

212
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,440
I can't get through to the new boss.

213
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,920
I can't get through it.

214
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,320
I was just following orders.

215
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,520
I hope you can understand.

216
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,440
What about next week's content?

217
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
Shan is so capable at work,

218
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm sure she'll be able to handle it before she leaves work.

219
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,000
Sis,

220
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Are you free this afternoon?

221
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
Do you want to play badminton with me?

222
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,400
Why do you suddenly want to play badminton?

223
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,720
My sister likes to use sports to vent her emotions.

224
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,080
Who can she vent her emotions to?

225
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,280
You.

226
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
Of course it's not me.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,160
Someone else?

228
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,600
Either you don't go home,

229
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
or you stay in your room when you go home.

230
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,680
Can you get down to business?

231
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,120
Don't you know how to knock when you come in?

232
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,600
It's good for

233
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,960
both people and things.

234
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,360
You can't be so persistent.

235
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,120
Let bygones be bygones.

236
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,120
So my mom deserves to be forgotten, right?

237
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
Why are you still looking for that woman?

238
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
You think I don't know,

239
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
you made my mom commit suicide?

240
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,760
My mom has been dead for so many years,

241
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,120
as long as there's something wrong with that woman,

242
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,760
You feel so distressed.

243
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,000
All right,

244
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,920
let's not talk about it,

245
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,640
Let's not talk about it.

246
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,160
Are you okay?

247
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,400
It's okay.

248
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,800
I didn't see it.

249
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,000
You're pretty good at it.

250
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,600
You look down on me.

251
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
Who else do you have an appointment with today?

252
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,800
So you have an appointment with Mr. Bao.

253
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
If you two play basketball,

254
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
why did you call me here?

255
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
Don't you want to know the truth?

256
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,840
I think it's better to talk about this in person.

257
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,920
Your sister

258
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,440
I'm here.

259
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,600
Sister.

260
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,800
What's wrong with you?

261
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,480
Do you want to die?

262
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Why did you call him here?

263
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,960
This is fate.

264
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,400
Rui happened to have something to talk to you about.

265
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,240
Rui is really good at badminton,

266
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
you two are sure to be together.

267
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,400
Take it.

268
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,880
What a coincidence.

269
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,440
What a coincidence.

270
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
Kang Nam has just regained some popularity,

271
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,359
why don't you hurry up, by going up one flight of stairs.

272
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,000
You still have time to play basketball.

273
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,359
We're all busy.

274
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,040
Forget it.

275
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,119
You should exercise more

276
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
when you are busy. Exercise can promote dopamine secretion,

277
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,000
Dopamine can make people happy,

278
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,520
why don't you two play a game?

279
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,320
No way.

280
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,080
Who can't do that?

281
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,080
I can't.

282
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,160
Just hit me.

283
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
Why are you still acting like a fan?

284
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,400
Come on, Rui.

285
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,160
Shan is mighty!

286
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
What are you trying to do?

287
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,960
Don't you think they're a good match?

288
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,440
Just like the two of us,

289
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,560
you're trying to set up Shan and Mr. Bao,

290
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I'm sure

291
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
Brother Rui is the master who said that

292
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
in order not to let my sister wait for the next Jia Zi,

293
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
I have to help them.

294
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,800
Nice shot.

295
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
You're getting smarter.

296
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,320
I don't think the atmosphere is right.

297
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,760
I think the atmosphere is quite right.

298
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,000
Zhu Linfeng.

299
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,120
Rui,

300
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,600
you're too weak.

301
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,400
Did my sister break her kidney too?

302
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
You're the weak one.

303
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,600
Have you played with your sister before?

304
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
I'm telling you, if I were you,

305
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,440
you'd be worse than me.

306
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,760
Rui,

307
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,400
when I was studying photography in America,

308
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,040
It's okay. I learned Chinese medicine massage,

309
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:32,880
Come on,

310
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,680
Let me give it a try.

311
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Take a break.

312
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
You studied Chinese medicine massage in the United States,

313
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,800
can you be in China,

314
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,160
Treat me when you learn it well.

315
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,640
What's wrong with your sister?

316
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,840
Are you trying to defeat me?

317
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,360
Rui,

318
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,560
can I tell you something serious?

319
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
You're not young anymore,

320
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
so you should think about

321
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,680
your life.

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,320
Do you think Brother Rui doesn't want to?

323
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Your brother Rui needs someone, too.

324
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,360
I have someone who suits you.

325
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,520
Who?

326
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,560
My sister,

327
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,200
your sister's ball is too fierce,

328
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,720
Rui can't catch it.

329
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
I asked you to fall in love,

330
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,600
but I didn't ask you to play basketball.

331
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,560
If you play basketball like this

332
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,520
and fall in love with Rui,

333
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,040
what kind of relationship will you make Rui look like?

334
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:30,960
Orange,

335
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,440
< Cool Sing Producers > still hasn't reached a cooperation intention

336
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,360
with us.

337
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,080
Jiang has been trying to convince Alex,

338
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,000
but Alex is very tough.

339
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,960
Jiang has been working so hard for the new song,

340
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,320
so take care of him.

341
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,440
Orange,

342
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
I found out for you.

343
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,520
Alex is coming to Truth for an exclusive interview the day after tomorrow,

344
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,160
that's all I can do for you.

345
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,960
The rest is up to you.

346
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,440
Hey,

347
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,200
orange

348
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
Alex went down.

349
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,280
Don't tell me that

350
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,480
he's here for the interview,

351
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,600
I was the one who revealed it.

352
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
Or I'll lose my job.

353
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,800
Got it.

354
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,360
Hello, Director Alex,

355
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm Jiang Nan's assistant, Many Orange,

356
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,160
As for "Cool Singing Producer",

357
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,400
I hope you can give Jiang Nan another chance.

358
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,360
Assistant,

359
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,480
are you his girlfriend?

360
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,640
Yes.

361
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
This is the information about Jiang Nan since his debut

362
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,920
and his creative experience.

363
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,840
It contains his unique understanding of music.

364
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,280
I hope you can have a look.

365
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,160
I believe after you read it,

366
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,120
you can understand his music concept.

367
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,160
You're quite persistent.

368
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,400
But I've rejected Jiang Nan.

369
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,080
These things are unnecessary.

370
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
Please take a look.

371
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,920
Luckily, I moved fast enough.

372
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,440
I don't believe I can't handle you.

373
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,960
That's my friend over there.

374
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,760
Just give it to me.

375
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,640
Okay, thank you.

376
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,920
No.

377
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm telling you,

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,080
about this,

379
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,880
Don't worry.

380
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,360
Okay.

381
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,160
Leave it to me. No problem.

382
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,120
Slow down.

383
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,280
Don't worry,

384
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,800
slow down,

385
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,600
Be careful.

386
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,760
Bye.

387
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,680
Slow down.

388
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,560
Bye-bye.

389
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,520
-Bye. -Bye.

390
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,880
What on earth are you doing?

391
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,280
Thank you.

392
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,440
All right.

393
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
I'll come to you tomorrow morning for your advice.

394
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,640
Okay.

395
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
Good morning.

396
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,160
For Jiangnan, writing

397
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,000
is not a proposition composition

398
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,960
to cater to market preferences.

399
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,280
It's an empathy experience that cuts life apart.

400
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm his fan.

401
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,480
Like other fans,

402
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,480
my youth,

403
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,440
It started with Jiangnan's music.

404
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,560
His music gives me insight into the world.

405
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,640
Take care of my heart,

406
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,720
even if I'm a person who's afraid of death,

407
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,240
But because of his songs,

408
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,440
I saw the world.

409
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,680
It's so beautiful.

410
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
There must be

411
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
a lot of stories behind you, right?

412
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,400
No.

413
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,040
I learned all of these from his songs.

414
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
This is the "Coke Chicken Wings"

415
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,520
that Jiang Nan and I re-recorded,

416
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
He said this version

417
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,440
can bring more happiness to fans.

418
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,480
You recorded it together?

419
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,800
In other words,

420
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,040
you support his music career.

421
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,840
Of course,

422
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,800
so I also beg you

423
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,160
to give Jiang Nan the right to speak music.

424
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,160
He will give you a surprise.

425
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
So that's what he told you.

426
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,880
Is there any other reason?

427
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Five minutes are up.

428
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,920
You should go now.

429
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,400
Hey,

430
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,000
Come on! Come on!

431
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
Why are we here?

432
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,000
Look,

433
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,520
these two bottles of good wine,

434
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,480
I've always been here

435
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
waiting for you

436
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,120
to come and have a good drink with me.

437
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,920
Don't be so polite to me.

438
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,320
Just say what you want to say.

439
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,920
I heard that

440
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,200
the second season of the show is about to be held.

441
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,320
I want to ride the wave.

442
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,480
Take up an advertising space

443
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
and invest in the stage.

444
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,720
I'll take it all.

445
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,640
Okay.

446
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,320
Of course I'm willing to be rich.

447
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,080
Alex is so frank.

448
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,640
I have a little thing to do.

449
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,240
I heard that Jiang Nan

450
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
is also interested in participating in this show.

451
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,880
I … I don't like him very much.

452
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,440
See if he can

453
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,080
have it Mr. Liang,

454
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,920
You know me well.

455
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,520
Of course, I welcome investment.

456
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,200
However,

457
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,320
I have my own considerations for the show.

458
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,240
Yes, yes, yes.

459
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,440
Yes.

460
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,080
I'm not involved in the creation.

461
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,000
It's up to you.

462
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
But in terms of investment,

463
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,440
it's a deal.

464
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,520
Happy cooperation.

465
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,360
Thank you so much.

466
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,640
I didn't expect you to agree so readily.

467
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,920
Happy cooperation.

468
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,720
Happy cooperation.

469
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,160
You should

470
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,880
thank your girlfriend.

471
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,160
Chengcheng came to see you.

472
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,360
Not only did she come to see me,

473
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,160
she even listened to me.

474
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,720
The song "Coke Chicken Wings" you recorded together,

475
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,320
I changed my mind because of this song.

476
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,760
But

477
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,440
you took her with you to record songs.

478
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,960
Why don't you bring her directly to the show?

479
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,680
That song is for memory.

480
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,120
I never wanted to publish

481
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,800
my original intention,

482
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
I want her to be part of my songs,

483
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,200
which means that

484
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,320
she is as precious as my songs.

485
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,040
No,

486
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,840
it should be more precious.

487
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,400
So,

488
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,920
I will never allow her

489
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
to be disturbed or hurt.

490
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
This is also the premise of our cooperation.

491
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,120
Come on,

492
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,760
I really appreciate you more and more.

493
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,520
Why is this smell so familiar?

494
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
What did you put?

495
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,680
I put soup

496
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,360
with braised pig's trotters in it.

497
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
You are the pig's trotter.

498
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,840
In the water to soak my feet,

499
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,520
I put Sichuan pepper, moxa leaves,

500
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,360
safflower and cinnamon,

501
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,800
I put Sichuan pepper,

502
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,480
mugwort leaves,

503
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,720
safflower and cinnamon in it. Do you remember that?

504
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,200
From now on,

505
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,720
I'll soak my feet with you every day,

506
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
It can soothe muscles and promote blood circulation.

507
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,080
Jiang Nan,

508
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,640
Chengcheng,

509
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,040
You promised me before.

510
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
No matter what happens in the future,

511
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,760
we have to face it together.

512
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,240
Let's face it together.

513
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,800
I knew you were here.

514
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,960
You came here to drink in broad daylight,

515
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,680
but you seem to have fallen out of love again.

516
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,480
You came to see me in broad daylight,

517
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,200
did you get any news?

518
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,040
Jiang Nan is going to participate in < Cool Singer

519
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
Producer >, and when he becomes popular,

520
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,880
I have no hope at all.

521
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,560
< Cool Sing Producer >.

522
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,080
Hey,

523
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,040
How's the new song coming along?

524
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,960
Alex, in this proposition composition,

525
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,360
you have to say that it's biased.

526
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,600
It's actually quite ordinary,

527
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,600
but if you want to write it well,

528
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,840
It's not easy at all.

529
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,760
I have tried several styles of music,

530
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,720
but none of them

531
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,400
have the pure feeling

532
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,360
of the original music.

533
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,960
Wait, wait, wait.

534
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,160
Get to the point.

535
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,320
In a word,

536
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,240
I can't write it.

537
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,120
It's about to be filmed, bro.

538
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,360
Don't rush me.

539
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,040
The more you urge me, the less inspired I am.

540
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,840
Whether I urge him or not, the deadline is there.

541
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,120
What's your problem now?

542
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,440
It's because the music is not fluent Chengcheng,

543
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,480
what did you play just now?

544
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,760
The homework my student gave me,

545
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,360
please play it again.

546
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:55,920
Let me hear it.

547
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,960
This is the initial feeling I'm looking for.

548
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,080
Raw,

549
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,960
Immature,

550
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,000
Just like when we were just learning music,

551
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
as long as we were willing to persist,

552
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,040
You can reach where you originally wanted to go.

553
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,920
Chengcheng,

554
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,480
it turns out that our meeting was meant to be.

555
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,560
Let's go.

556
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
Why do you know how to play this song?

557
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,280
This song is my original.

558
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,440
There's no way I can't play it.

559
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,520
If you knew it,

560
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,080
why didn't you tell me?

561
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,640
Because this song

562
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,800
is a failure.

563
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,480
At that time,

564
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,480
I haven't performed a song for a long time.

565
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,080
I've been out of form.

566
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,400
It's like all of a sudden,

567
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,320
I lost my inspiration for music.

568
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,280
Mr. Dong,

569
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,360
Mr. Dong,

570
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,400
As you know,

571
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,920
Jiang Nan hasn't been in a good state recently,

572
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,000
I can't even write a complete piece of music.

573
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,040
Only the last few days?

574
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,840
It's been a long time since Jiang Nan sang a song.

575
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,760
No producer

576
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,679
will accept a song that is only half written,

577
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,520
Mr. Dong,

578
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,239
Mr. Dong,

579
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,560
Give me a few more days.

580
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,880
Let's write this song again.

581
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,400
I believe

582
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,040
you've found your feelings for music.
