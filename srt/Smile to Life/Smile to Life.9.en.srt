1
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,040
Shan,

2
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
Jiang Nan agreed.

3
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,720
Good job.

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,560
You taught them well, editor-in-chief.

5
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,960
All right, stop flattering me.

6
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,040
When did you make an appointment?

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,880
At the end of the month,

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
before work today,

9
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,600
Make sure to sort out the interview manuscript,

10
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,840
I need to confirm it in advance.

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,520
Don't be in such a hurry.

12
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
There are still many days left.

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,480
From now on, if you write 30 articles a week,

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
you have to finish the task on time.

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,560
If you have nothing else to do, go back to work.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
Stingy Qin,

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,520
why didn't you ask me to write 50 articles?

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,720
What are you looking at?

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,400
Just like your sister,

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,560
she knew she would force me.

21
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,320
But,

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Why does Keqin look pale?

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
Why are you here again?

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,760
I'm just concerned about your work.

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,760
Don't delay our work under such a banner.

26
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,760
Just a little delay.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,160
Did she mention me just now?

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,560
No.

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,040
No way.

30
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,800
Bao Rui didn't tell her it was me who helped her.

31
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Zhu Linfeng,

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,840
I have an appointment.

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm running out of time.

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,600
I don't want to dawdle with you.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
It doesn't make sense.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
It was a mistake for me to move in.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,520
Here,

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,600
Wait.

39
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,520
I wrote a new song.

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,200
Come and listen to it.

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
I don't want to hear it.

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,480
You said you like my song?

43
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,480
This is my first song

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,680
in so many years.

45
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
Doesn't it sound good?

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Sounds good.

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
It's so touching.

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,680
Well,

49
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,360
It's not a touching song.

50
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,080
Is this song for me?

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
No, no,

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
no. How come?

53
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,200
Many oranges.

54
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Don't think too much.

55
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,040
Now all you have to do

56
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,280
is cherish the last time

57
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,800
you spent with Jiang Nan,

58
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,520
And make good money,

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,520
so that my parents can rely on them in their later years.

60
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,320
It's best to complete your own happiness list.

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,640
However,

62
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,240
this song is really written for me.

63
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Many oranges.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,360
Many oranges.

65
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,400
There's a class at the musical instrument store

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
this morning. Help yourself to breakfast.

67
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
You finally have me in your heart.

68
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,120
Sorry, manager,

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
there's a traffic jam on the road.

70
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,760
It's okay.

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,640
The students aren't here yet.

72
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,760
But someone has been waiting for you for a long time,

73
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,280
you can talk first.

74
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
I'll go in first.

75
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,280
You wanted to see me,

76
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,880
but you didn't answer my call,

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
I can only wait for you here.

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
I didn't check my phone in the car,

79
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,960
didn't I tell you not to see each other in the future?

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,120
Why do you want to see me?

81
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,080
Can't I come to you if I have nothing else to do?

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
Are you really going to ignore me in the future?

83
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
I think it's better

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
if we don't meet each other.

85
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,840
If it gets caught again,

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,000
I won't be responsible for it.

87
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,640
So you're really going to ignore me.

88
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,000
Well,

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,720
it's a pity that Lin Yaoyin,

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,000
Lin Yaoyin,

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,280
what do you mean?

92
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,800
Lin Yaoyin's piano solo concert,

93
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,520
why didn't I know?

94
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,080
This is an in-house charity performance.

95
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Of course you don't know.

96
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
I saw that you shared his song in your Moments,

97
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
so I got this ticket.

98
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,080
What do you think?

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,280
Do you want to go?

100
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,640
Of course I want to go.

101
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,680
Where are he and Jiang Nan?

102
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,040
But my only idol,

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,080
do you need to be so worried?

104
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,240
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I didn't mean to.

106
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
How much is the fare?

107
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,200
I told you

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,520
it's a charity show,

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
There's no fare,

110
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,040
but,

111
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,480
Someone just said,

112
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,840
if we don't want to see each other in the future,

113
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
At this moment, my heart is very hurt.

114
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,280
Can I take it back?

115
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,640
Many oranges,

116
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,520
you have no principles.

117
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,240
I'm already a person

118
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
stuck in the back of my neck by fate.

119
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Is the principle that important?

120
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,720
Promise me one condition.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,680
Why do you all like to negotiate so much?

123
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,400
What do you mean?

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,960
It's not interesting.

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,760
Anyway, I won't say much

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,920
if you have one more,

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,120
You can't say it again.

128
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,960
If we don't meet,

129
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,960
we can't suddenly disappear again.

130
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,000
That's it.

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,760
That's it.

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,000
No problem.

133
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,840
Deal.

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,840
Jiang,

135
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
this song "Coke Chicken Wings",

136
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,080
It's much better than your cooking skills.

137
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,600
It's really nice.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
You are poor every day.

139
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,880
Sit down.

140
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm complimenting you. Can't you tell?

141
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,880
Look, this song has been formed.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,520
Do you need to think about the release?

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Where are you going to post it?

144
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,080
Our songs used to be released in record companies,

145
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,560
but now many musicians,

146
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
They all leased songs on Cool Dog Xingyao Project.

147
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,040
Why?

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,200
Because the copyright incentive is very high,

149
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,840
and the traffic support is very strong.

150
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,360
If our song

151
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,280
is released through Cool Dog Xingyao Project,

152
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,840
It must be very explosive.

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
I think so.

154
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,480
But as for how to operate it,

155
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,960
I've studied it,

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's click on this cool dog app,

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and you'll be a cool dog musician

158
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,760
on this app,

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,640
You can post new songs

160
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,080
directly on

161
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,360
Cool Dog Xingyao Project,

162
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
And fans can check your singer page,

163
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,880
and you can interact with fans,

164
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,720
And for every song you play,

165
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
the royalty income

166
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
is clear.

167
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
Not bad, Mr. Bao.

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,920
With your ability as a broker,

169
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,520
it's your first night in China

170
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,720
to have a drink.

171
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,040
Celebrate the return of your long-lost inspiration.

172
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,800
I don't want to drink anymore.

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,840
I want to go home for dinner.

174
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
Brother, you're such a wet blanket.

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,960
When can't I eat a lot of orange food?

176
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,720
The most important thing for me every day

177
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,040
is to eat well.

178
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Goodbye.

179
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,760
Bye.

180
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,760
Why didn't you turn on the light?

181
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,600
Have you eaten?

182
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm waiting for you on an empty stomach.

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,480
Wait for me.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,160
One of my students came late today.

185
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,080
I told you,

186
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,680
in this special case,

187
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,120
You have to report to me in advance,

188
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
and you have to report this, too,

189
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,240
Of course,

190
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,880
this is a big matter related to hungry people.

191
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,040
You can order takeout.

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,120
If you can't get used to it,

193
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,520
how can you get used to it without me?

194
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Can it be the same?

195
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,080
You didn't do it.

196
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
Then I'll get you

197
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,920
some simple samples,

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,000
Stop pretending to be cool.

199
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,320
Many oranges,

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,960
your phone

201
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,120
is here.

202
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
At 6: 30 tomorrow night, don't

203
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,640
forget,

204
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,280
He even made an appointment with Zhan Zhilin.

205
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,200
I've told you Zhan Zhilin has ulterior motives,

206
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,160
why don't you believe me?

207
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm so pissed off.

208
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,040
Where are you going?

209
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
The meal will be ready soon.

210
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm full.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,040
It's so strange.

212
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,840
Are men so fickle?

213
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,480
I just

214
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,080
don't want to waste food,

215
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,560
You're still stubborn when you're hungry.

216
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,880
Eat slowly. Don't burn yourself.

217
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Are you going to the nursing home tomorrow?

218
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,440
I'll go with you.

219
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,520
Okay,

220
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,600
Well,

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
I have something to do tomorrow night.

222
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,160
I want to ask for a leave.

223
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,560
Got it.

224
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,640
It's gone.

225
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,200
Aren't you going to ask me where I'm going?

226
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,440
Didn't you say that

227
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,800
you have something to do

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,960
tomorrow night?

229
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,040
Fine.

230
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,000
Come back early.

231
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,200
Caiyun is in good spirits today.

232
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,520
What's wrong?

233
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,440
I'm fine.

234
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,280
Don't worry about me.

235
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,040
My stomach hurts,

236
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,080
Stomachache,

237
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,440
Did you have a bad stomach?

238
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,040
It's all because

239
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,640
you give me those weird things every day,

240
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,800
You made me eat like this.

241
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,960
You're still stubborn at this time.

242
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:35,680
Let's go.

243
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,480
I'll take you to the hospital.

244
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,120
No.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,680
that

246
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Since Mr. Bao isn't here,

247
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
let's go to the hospital,

248
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
It will cause a crowd.

249
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
With such a heavy burden of idols,

250
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,240
I'm fine.

251
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,920
I'll just go back and have some rest.

252
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,560
Don't worry about me.

253
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,560
Okay,

254
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,680
I'll take you home first.

255
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,280
Let's go.

256
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,000
Be careful.

257
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,120
Come on.

258
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,880
Hello, Mr. Bao.

259
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
Jiang Nan seems to have had a bad stomach.

260
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,400
I suspect it's gastroenteritis.

261
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,840
Come here now.

262
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,760
No, I have a meeting soon.

263
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,280
Why don't you two go to the hospital?

264
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,080
He said he was afraid of being watched when he went to the hospital,

265
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,560
so he was willing to go after you came.

266
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,800
How about this?

267
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,400
I'll do it as soon as possible.

268
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,960
All right.

269
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,680
You can rest here for a while.

270
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,800
Mr. Bao will be here soon.

271
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,280
Where did you put the medicine?

272
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,640
I don't know that either.

273
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Feel free to look around.

274
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,680
You don't even know where your medicine is?

275
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,880
But.

276
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
Forget it. I'll buy it for you.

277
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm really confused.

278
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,520
I brought medicine when I came.

279
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,520
I'll get it for you.

280
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,880
Why hasn't he come yet?

281
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,400
It's half past six.

282
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,320
There's no reason not to come.

283
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,520
Come on,

284
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,280
Take the medicine.

285
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,760
No need.

286
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,320
I feel much better.

287
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,040
You don't need to take medicine.

288
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,040
You're already in such a serious condition.

289
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,480
How can I not take medicine?

290
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,720
Water

291
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
Hello, Mr. Bao.

292
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,599
When will you arrive?

293
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,960
I was stuck in a traffic jam.

294
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,760
We'll be there soon.

295
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,640
Okay.

296
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,760
Well, Chengcheng,

297
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
I feel much better.

298
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,839
If you have something to do, just go back to work.

299
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,680
Don't worry about me.

300
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,960
How could I do this?

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,480
I left you alone at home.

302
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,760
How about this?

303
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,960
I'll cook some porridge for you.

304
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,360
If it warms your stomach,

305
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
it might be better.

306
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,320
She doesn't doubt it at all?

307
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,720
Have I gone too far?

308
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,640
Forget it.

309
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,000
That's Zhan Zhilin,

310
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,120
I can't let her see you.

311
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
The concert has already started.

312
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Zhilin Zhan still hasn't waited for many oranges,

313
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
he doesn't know when he was attracted to her.

314
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Maybe it's because in this little girl,

315
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,080
he has a long-lost desire to live.

316
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,640
Always be in awe of ordinary days.

317
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,320
Cherish the journey of life.

318
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,640
All of this,

319
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
in a bleak world for him,

320
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,240
In a ray of light,

321
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,560
he believed,

322
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,200
Many oranges will definitely come to the appointment in the end.

323
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Because he knows,

324
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,760
how much does Lin Yaoyin mean to her?

325
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,120
So I clicked on Lin Yaoyin's song list,

326
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,400
and accompanied by the sound of the piano,

327
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,800
Waiting quietly for the arrival of many oranges.

328
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,320
It's hot. Be careful.

329
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,880
Sorry,

330
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,840
the traffic was too heavy just now.

331
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,600
How is it going?

332
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Mr. Bao, you're here.

333
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,640
that

334
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
Mr. Bao is here.

335
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,200
You should leave first.

336
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,040
Yes.

337
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,960
Seriously, Orange,

338
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
if you need anything, you can leave first.

339
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,080
I'll take him to the hospital later.

340
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,040
Let me go to the hospital with you.

341
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,200
No, thanks.

342
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,200
Well,

343
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
Mr. Bao alone will be fine.

344
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,080
You can leave now.

345
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,840
I'll be fine.

346
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,760
Mr. Bao,

347
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,240
feel free to contact me if you need anything.

348
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,600
I'll get going.

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,560
Slow down,

350
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,000
okay?

351
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,800
Do you need to go to the hospital?

352
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,560
Are you all right?

353
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,440
Something happened.

354
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,840
I feel better now.

355
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,040
Pretending to be sick?

356
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,640
What pretending to be sick?

357
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,520
He was indeed ill just now,

358
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,640
so what are you doing?

359
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm telling you not to bully a girl.

360
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,800
By the way,

361
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
I have something to tell you.

362
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,280
I have an appointment with a very good producer.

363
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,400
What producer?

364
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,120
Chen Dong You haven't heard of it,

365
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,640
but their company has produced

366
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,760
a lot of TV dramas,

367
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
And they're going to invite Director Guo

368
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
for this movie,

369
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
You can't always

370
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
wander around your music,

371
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,200
We need to expand our field, right?

372
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Sing well and act well,

373
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,560
get ready to cross the border,

374
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:42,920
Am I right?

375
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,080
You're like how good you were just now.

376
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,480
There's no need.

377
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,920
It's different this time.

378
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Did you receive WeChat?

379
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,240
Don't pretend you can't see.

380
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,640
I've sent you the time and place.

381
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,600
Please don't be late, okay?

382
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,320
Okay,

383
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,160
Got it.

384
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,000
also

385
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,240
Take a good look

386
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,240
at the script.

387
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,760
Pay attention to it.

388
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,760
Stop messing around.

389
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,400
Pay attention to it.

390
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,360
I'm leaving.

391
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,920
What are you doing?

392
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,800
Are you hungry?

393
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,840
Kind of.

394
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,080
Let's order

395
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,040
takeout Yingming.

396
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,440
It's over.

397
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,040
Many oranges haven't come yet.

398
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,120
Did I miss them?

399
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,120
Why are you here?

400
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,480
I admire Lin Yaoyin, too.

401
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,800
So I stopped by to take a look.

402
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,320
I still didn't make it.

403
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
It must be a wonderful performance tonight.

404
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
Wonderful.

405
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,920
Same as usual,

406
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,520
but it's okay,

407
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,200
Wait a little longer.

408
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,280
He will come again.

409
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,400
He will come again.

410
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,760
But I don't have much time left.

411
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't think too much.

412
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,280
I'm sorry

413
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,560
for letting you down.

414
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,560
I've been listening to the concert all night.

415
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm a little hungry. I'll take you

416
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,040
to eat something delicious.

417
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,840
As compensation.

418
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,760
No, thanks.

419
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,240
I really didn't expect that

420
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,960
you would come to his concert.

421
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
Do you think I'm waiting for you?

422
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
In my world,

423
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,520
only women are waiting for me.

424
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
There's no woman like me.

425
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Don't think too much.

426
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I just envy you

427
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,280
for listening to his concert.

428
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,200
If you don't want to eat,

429
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,080
I'll send you back.

430
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,360
No, thanks.

431
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Thank you.

432
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

433
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

434
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,360
Why are you back so soon?

435
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,320
Oh no.

436
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,440
I didn't clean it up. You're sick

437
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
and you're still eating these things,

438
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,920
Oh, no.

439
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
I didn't eat it.

440
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,280
Bao Rui just bought it.

441
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,000
He ate it.

442
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
You're pretending to be sick.

443
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm not pretending to be sick.

444
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,800
You saw that I didn't feel well just now.

445
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,440
Stop pretending.

446
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,400
How could you be like this?

447
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,360
Do you know how important today is to me?

448
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,760
Is it that important to go out with Zhan Zhilin?

449
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
How did you know that?

450
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
You even peeked at my phone.

451
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,880
Yes.

452
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,520
I did.

453
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,160
What's wrong?

454
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
He just gave me a ticket

455
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,680
to Lin Yao Yin's concert,

456
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,920
Before today, you were my God Nan,

457
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
no matter what you did,

458
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
I don't have to argue with you.

459
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
But for this matter,

460
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,920
you really let me down.

461
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,040
I decided to carry forward my spirit of sacrifice.

462
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,200
As your sandbag,

463
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,400
you can vent it on me.

464
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,400
You?

465
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,280
As long as it makes you happy,

466
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm willing to take a beating.

467
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,560
Wait.

468
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,560
Again.

469
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,880
If you don't work,

470
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,080
you'll be scolded even if you do work,

471
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,040
Devil?

472
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,200
Let's see how I'll deal with your beloved brother.

473
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,920
Why are you pestering me

474
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,240
every day? What do you want?

475
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,200
You're so amiable,

476
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,280
Does what you promised me count?

477
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,440
What did I promise you?

478
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
You said as long as I beat you,

479
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
you would be my girlfriend,

480
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,480
What I said always counts.

481
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,080
Really

482
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,360
Keqin,

483
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,440
are you okay?

484
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,640
Hand,

485
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,440
Where are the oranges

486
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
on this hand?

487
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,880
Many oranges.

488
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,320
Hey,

489
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:44,920
Hey,

490
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,240
Can you help me ask Yu Keqin

491
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,680
if many oranges are with her?

492
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,920
No.

493
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,640
I've been with Keqin all night,

494
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,720
but I don't see much orange.

495
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,760
Cut the crap!

496
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,880
Give the phone to Yu Keqin.

497
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,040
Jiang Nan,

498
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,120
he wants to ask you a lot about Cheng,

499
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,040
Why do you have Jiang Nan's number?

500
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,000
I told you we knew each other.

501
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,000
We used to be neighbors.

502
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,440
We grew up together.

503
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,040
Hello.

504
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,240
Come back with me.

505
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,720
Let go of me!

506
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
I want to go back to my own home.

507
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,520
I'm sorry.

508
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,640
I admit that I went too far today.

509
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,600
But,

510
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,440
I thought you went on a date with Zhan Zhilin.

511
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,800
So what?

512
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,040
Who are you to me?

513
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,960
You want to interfere with my right to make friends.

514
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,680
Me,

515
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
You always live in your own world.

516
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,840
Have you considered other people's feelings?

517
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,600
Yes.

518
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,640
Because you're a superstar.

519
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,760
I'm just a fake girlfriend

520
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,560
that you're bossing around.

521
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,320
No,

522
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,640
I've never thought of it that way.

523
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,440
I missed today's performance.

524
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,560
As long as you want to see it,

525
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,280
I'll take you there next time he comes.

526
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,760
You don't understand at all.

527
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
I missed today's concert.

528
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,920
I might never get another chance.

529
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
There will be a chance.

530
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,280
It's not that serious.

531
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,360
I promise you.

532
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,320
I'll make it up to you.

533
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,320
Jiang Nan,

534
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,120
do you think everything is easy?

535
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,400
But you know what?

536
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,920
For me,

537
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,960
it's hard enough to live.

538
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,800
I'll pay you back the money I owe you as soon as possible.

539
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,760
From tomorrow on,

540
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,440
you can be a superstar again.

541
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
I made many of my oranges,

542
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,080
and we went back to our own lives.

543
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,240
Many oranges.

544
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,760
Please let me keep a good memory of us.

545
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,040
Many oranges,

546
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,280
you are really worthless.

547
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,600
You just came back like this.

548
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,640
Drink some water

549
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,480
and go to bed early.

550
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,600
It's late.

551
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,360
Who is it?

552
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,320
It might be Zhu Xiaopang.

553
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,680
Be careful.

554
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,560
Jiang Nan,

555
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,400
what did you do to Orange?

556
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,000
Why did she run away from home because she was so angry?

557
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,640
Me,

558
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
That's my problem.

559
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,640
My phone is out of battery.

560
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,960
I didn't make a deal with him.

561
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,680
Really?

562
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,160
I'm telling you,

563
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,480
I don't care who you are.

564
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,880
Don't bully Orange.

565
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,040
Although you just gave me an interview,

566
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,600
that's not the same thing, okay?

567
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,840
Keqin,

568
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,600
what's wrong with this hand?

569
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Ask him,

570
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,640
I wanted to practice taekwondo with her,

571
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,560
Let her vent her anger.

572
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,520
Relax.

573
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,360
As a result, I accidentally used too much force

574
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,360
and sprained it.

575
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,760
Orange,

576
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,920
why am I always the one who gets hurt?

577
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,120
Did I have a grudge against them in my previous life?

578
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,240
I'm so pissed off.

579
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:38,680
All right,

580
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,960
you two stop messing around.

581
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,960
If you don't know,

582
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,680
you might think I have a lion in my house.

583
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,600
Well,

584
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm relieved to see that you're okay.

585
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,320
I'll go back now.

586
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,040
Today is the weekend.

587
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,760
Since you're all here,

588
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
you can stay here.

589
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,160
That's right.

590
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,200
I'm staying too.

591
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,960
It's so easy to take care of Keqin,

592
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,000
you two live in the same room?

593
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,280
Jiang Nan and I live in the same room,

594
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,240
but we haven't lived together for a long time.

595
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,480
Do you remember when I went to sleep at your house,

596
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,440
we hid under the bed and played video games together,

597
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,200
You.

598
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,400
Sleep on the sofa,

599
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,600
Me,

600
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Orange,

601
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,360
look at how badly I'm hurt.

602
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,840
The doctor asked me to rest at home.

603
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,840
It seems that

604
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,720
we can't travel to Jingcheng together.

605
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
It doesn't matter. There will be

606
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
plenty of opportunities in the future.

607
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
It's getting late now,

608
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,280
Let's go.

609
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,520
I'll take you upstairs to rest.

610
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,760
I'll get you a towel.

611
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,960
I fell down badly today.

612
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:28,960
Really?

613
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,160
Be careful.

614
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,280
What are you doing?

615
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,680
What are they talking about?

616
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,520
Why are you smiling so happily?

617
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,760
All right,

618
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,400
you're just a man,

619
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,160
Stealing corners to eavesdrop on people.

620
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,080
Go to sleep.

621
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,480
This is so fake.

622
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,720
What is this?

623
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,920
I'll learn from you.

624
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,120
Isn't it scary?

625
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,280
You don't understand.

626
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,560
My dear family and I,

627
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
we're finally going to be together.

628
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,440
Come on,

629
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,680
wake up.

630
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,800
Who said you two are together?

631
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,640
Listen to what women say the other way around,

632
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
Keqin and I are living

633
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,120
under the same roof now.

634
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,880
Although there are two rooms,

635
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,160
the relationship

636
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,120
has definitely gone up to a higher level.

637
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,440
All these years,

638
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,360
I didn't realize that you're still masochistic.

639
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
How did you deal with your sister-in-law?

640
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,680
Tell me about it.

641
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,720
Can you match

642
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,040
my charm?

643
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
Forget it.

644
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,240
When their girlfriends are together,

645
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,600
what will they talk about?

646
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,640
My dear family,

647
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,080
will you talk about me?

648
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,800
Will she talk about me with Yu Keqin?

649
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,640
Why is there no sound?

650
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,720
Dead pig.

651
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,760
Good morning.

652
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,360
Morning,

653
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,400
Well,

654
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,600
Zhu Xiaopang disappeared early in the morning.

655
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Keqin, they're gone.

656
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,000
Keqin is sleeping in my room.

657
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,160
Surprise.

658
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,880
You didn't sleep till noon,

659
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,240
yet you went to buy food early in the morning,

660
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,120
What?

661
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,200
For my dear family to recover smoothly.

662
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,600
I'll definitely buy her the freshest ingredients.

663
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,080
Chicken feet,

664
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,880
duck feet,

665
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,800
Pig trotters,

666
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,360
duck breast,

667
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,600
Chicken breast,

668
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,120
you can make up for it wherever you eat it.

669
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,880
What should I do?

670
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,640
Me,

671
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,680
I'm so perfect. What do I need to make up for?

672
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,920
What do you think I need to make up for when I'm so perfect?

673
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,360
Come here.

674
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,160
Who did my hand become like this?

675
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,920
Okay, okay.

676
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,840
Chicken breast and duck breast.

677
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,720
Oh, my God.

678
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Your food is so good.

679
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,000
Oranges are delicious to cook,

680
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,200
but as your bestie,

681
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,720
you don't know this dish,

682
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
Someone volunteered to do it.

683
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,080
As for the other dishes,

684
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,880
I cooked them all.

685
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,840
Let's start.

686
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,880
Sister-in-law,

687
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,800
your cooking is so delicious.

688
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,280
As expected of a culinary family,

689
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,400
Nan found a daughter-in-law like you,

690
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
It's lucky for him.

691
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,520
Actually, we're not,

692
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:03,800
Come on,

693
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,520
Eat more.

694
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,480
Since Jiang Nan is your buddy,

695
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,280
Then tell your sister Shan not to keep an eye on them.

696
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,960
I don't care about my cousin's business.

697
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,280
Qin Shan is your cousin,

698
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,480
why didn't you tell me before?

699
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,159
When she told the truth,

700
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,400
I was already abroad.

701
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,920
I didn't have time to tell you.

702
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Honey,

703
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:27,960
Come on,

704
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,120
Try this.

705
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,159
Cooperate with me.

706
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,320
Delicious.

707
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,199
Come on,

708
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,320
Have one, too.

709
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,280
Is it good?

710
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,840
Delicious.

711
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,560
Do you have to show off your love like this?

712
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,760
Don't forget that there are two singles sitting opposite.

713
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,520
If you want to say goodbye to being single,

714
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,560
I'll cooperate at any time.

715
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,960
Eat so many dishes

716
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,520
and I can't shut you up.

717
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,200
I've already taken the initiative,

718
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
why doesn't she accept me?

719
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,920
Because the point of Keqin now

720
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,480
is not in love,

721
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,440
Then where is it?

722
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
The exclusive big melon

723
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,600
you mentioned before,

724
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
It seems that an exclusive interview is not enough.

725
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,360
With Jiang Nan's doting eyes just now,

726
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,640
I got goose bumps all over the floor.

727
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,080
It's not like you don't know,

728
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,240
we're not real.

729
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,320
You know it very well.

730
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,120
I did it

731
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,680
to show Zhu Linfeng.

732
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,920
If you act like this, you'll get the best actor.

733
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,720
Don't use Zhu Linfeng as a cover.

734
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,120
I know you so well.

735
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
The way you look at Jiang Nan

736
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,840
is also wrong.

737
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,720
What's wrong with that?

738
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,360
Just admit it.

739
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,560
You've fallen into the trap.

740
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,560
If you keep living like this,

741
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,200
for the rest of your life,

742
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,360
I'm going to spend the rest of my life

743
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
with him,

744
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,520
Do I have to spend the rest of my life with Jiang Nan?

745
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,920
Tell me as soon as you get married,

746
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,320
and I'll be your maid of honor,

747
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,680
Stop talking about me.

748
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,120
Tell me about you and Zhu Linfeng.

749
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,040
You said he did what you told him to do,

750
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,040
or you would accept it.

751
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,560
He's not my type.

752
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,520
My boyfriend

753
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,080
must be the kind of man who is looked up to.

754
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,480
I got it.

755
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,560
Nan,

756
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
you're my brother.

757
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,200
Please help me.

758
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,880
Zhu Xiaopang

759
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
is at best a man who looks up to me.

760
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,440
Is your marriage with your sister-in-law

761
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
a big deal?

762
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,960
How about you get married with your son?

763
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,320
So this big melon

764
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,840
belongs to our family, doesn't it?

765
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,440
When she finishes her career,

766
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
she'll be interested in me.

767
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,440
Fatty,

768
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,560
your weird logic.

769
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,680
Don't get me wrong.

770
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,880
Don't get me wrong.

771
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,160
Pack up and leave.

772
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,200
Don't interfere with

773
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,800
their relationship here,
