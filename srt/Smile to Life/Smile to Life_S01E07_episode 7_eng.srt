00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,030

2
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,827
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,967
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,267
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:24,525
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:30,300
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,114
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:35,519
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,901
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,400
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,414
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:48,401
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,128
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,841
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:55,488
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,755
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,544
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:05,886
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:10,702
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:13,512
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,246
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:18,353
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,166
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:25,725
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:31,244
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:45,205
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,073

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,660
Cheng Cheng, stop playing.

29
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,554
Leave if you have something to do.

30
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:17,180
You don't have to act perfunctory with me.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm not acting perfunctory.

32
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:29,720
I have the three misconceptions of modern youth.

33
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:31,520
I don't understand.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,300
What "three misconceptions"?

35
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,540
My phone is vibrating.

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,040
He likes me.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
I can counter-kill.

38
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,100
Which one are you?

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,880
My phone is vibrating, of course.

40
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,780
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,460
No. We didn't have a fight.

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,400
We're perfectly fine. We're fine.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,520
It's all right if you had a fight.

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Why are you embarrassed about it?

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,080
It's not like I've never been in a relationship before.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Cheng Cheng, I want to eat an apple.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,200
Okay. I'll peel it for you.

48
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,140
We ran out of apples.

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,530
Do you want an orange?

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,868
I don't want an orange.

51
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:22,900
My husband brought me oranges the last time he came to visit me

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,060
and didn't buy me apples.

53
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,080
Your husband came this morning?

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,030
Yes. That's strange.

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,360
He usually comes with you,

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,940
but he has been coming in the morning lately,

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,880
when you're not here.

58
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:43,280
Cai Yun, I'll buy you apples.

59
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,161
 He's deliberately avoiding me.

60
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:51,680
 That doesn't make sense.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,860
 Why would he avoid me?

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,480
Hello, Lord Bao.

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
Cheng Cheng,

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,180
I want to ask if there's anything wrong with God Nan lately.

65
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,240
You mean Jiang Nan?

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,700
He's fine.

67
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,500
He's well.

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,485
Well, do you need my help with anything at the office?

69
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:24,400
Nothing much is going on at the office lately.

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,220
Lao Jiang is writing songs in self-seclusion.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,540
Self-seclusion?

72
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,400
He just took a few orders of new songs

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,960
and he's writing them in self-seclusion.

74
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,880
Don't worry. He's fine.

75
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,000
 He's avoiding me indeed.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,420
 Fine, at least his work situation is improving.

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,900
Lao Jiang, what's going on?

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,400
Did you have a fight?

79
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,100
Let me tell you, Gu Jia Yi has been contacting me these days.

80
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,120
You don't have to tell me about her.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,260
I don't mean to criticize you, what are you doing over there for so long?

82
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,140
You've been working on this all this time?

83
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:30,306
You made this?

84
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,520
I just tried it.

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,920
Try it.

86
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,380
Try it?

87
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,119
What do you think?

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
It's pretty good.

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,900
Don't you think it's a bit burnt?

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,800
It is a bit burnt,

91
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,171
but everyone makes cola chicken wings the same, right?

92
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,553
The ones you buy out there taste the same too.

93
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:05,360
The burnt flavor is special and unique.

94
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,120
It's special?

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,091
Yes.

96
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,063
â™«  The bright color of caramel  â™«

97
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:22,302
â™« Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles â™«

98
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:30,339
â™«  Maybe you added your favorite ingredients  â™«

99
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:37,205
â™«  Every day becomes magical because of you  â™«

100
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,337

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,860
Why do you like such violent sports all of a sudden?

102
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,620
Why do you care?

103
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,660
My cousin scolded you again?

104
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,120
Talk to me about it.

105
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,080
I have to write 30 articles a week.

106
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,008
Your cousin yells at me if there's anything not satisfying to her.

107
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:12,900
Besides your cousin, there's that Qi Qi too.

108
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,140
I have to beware of her passing the buck to me at any time.

109
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,865
Last week, she was the one who clearly made the error in the article,

110
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,140
but she complained first.

111
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,220
She shifted the blame on me in front of Sister Shan.

112
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,920
I have to find an outlet to relieve stress somehow.

113
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
That's pretty tragic.

114
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,100
Why don't you...

115
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,780
be my girlfriend?

116
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,660
I'll pull some strings for you.

117
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,555
- Who would like to try it next? 
 - Me.

118
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,721
If you can defeat me, I'll say yes.

119
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:11,486
Come on.

120
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,251
The coach hasn't given the signal to start yet.

121
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,551
Begin!

122
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,877
Do you still want me to be your girlfriend?

123
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,180
Why are you in a daze?

124
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,360
You're here.

125
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,180
I'm exhausted.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,580
Don't you think I look radiant lately?

127
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,780
Did you do hydro lifting at the hospital?

128
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,740
Those are just palliatives.

129
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,000
Let me tell you, only exercise can make you healthy.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm working my ass off writing and editing articles during the day.

131
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,580
When I go practice taekwondo at night,

132
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,100
I instantly feel completely resurrected.

133
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,528
You made me seem like I don't exercise.

134
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:11,442
I've been doing the Eight-Part Vajra Qigong lately.

135
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:12,840
All right, all right.

136
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,760
Let's leave that topic alone.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,370
Let's talk about your superstar.

138
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:29,160
Actually, I haven't seen him lately.

139
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,032
What's going on?

140
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:34,960
Lord Bao said he has been writing songs in self-seclusion lately.

141
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,524
Ke Qin,

142
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:46,033
do you think life has been unreal for me lately?

143
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm just an ordinary girl.

144
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,320
The gossip and scandal have subsided now.

145
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,180
I should go back to living my peaceful life, right?

146
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,400
How are you ordinary?

147
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,380
 â™ª You're the most beautiful in my heart â™ª

148
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,449
Be happy.

149
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,049
That's so cheesy.

150
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:09,740
All right, let's not talk about him.

151
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,660
I really miss when we used to go on trips together.

152
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,760
I've been distracted by so many trivial things.

153
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,540
I wonder when I can go on a trip again.

154
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,400
It's just a trip.

155
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,800
Where do you want to go? I'll go with you.

156
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Will your chief editor agree for you to take leave?

157
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,780
I... I'll risk it.

158
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,940
It's important to go on a relaxing trip with my best friend!

159
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,140
She has to approve.

160
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,245
Well, my schedule isn't set yet. I have to ask for leave too.

161
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:38,425
So what? Just ask for leave.

162
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:40,260
Is there any place you want to go?

163
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,960
Look, we both just graduated and we don't have a lot of money.

164
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,540
I think we should go to a place that is close,

165
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,120
has beautiful scenery, and isn't expensive, right?

166
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,540
I remember.

167
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,460
My colleague just took his annual leave and went to Jingcheng.

168
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,960
I saw his posts on WeChat Moments.

169
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,500
The pictures look really beautiful.

170
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Maybe, we should go to Jingcheng too.

171
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,480
I'll go make some plans. We'll find a time to go together.

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,100
Sure.

173
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,920
Let's order now. I'm starving to death.

174
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,220
Okay.

175
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
Scan here.

176
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:18,346
â™«  The bright color of caramel  â™«

177
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,056
â™«  is the sign of summer  â™«

178
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:23,732
â™«  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  â™«

179
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:27,367
â™«  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  â™«

180
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,976
â™«  You lift away my arrogant facade  â™«

181
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:33,476
â™«  It isn't the best feeling  â™«

182
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:38,353
â™«  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  â™«

183
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:42,049
â™«  Maybe you added your favorite ingredients  â™«

184
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:48,916
â™«  Every day becomes magical because of you  â™«

185
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Lord Bao...

186
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:03,318
Didn't he just leave?

187
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,320
Let's eat.

188
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,300
Although you lost weight over the years,

189
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,775
your table manners haven't changed at all.

190
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,421
You don't understand. It's 30% exercise and 70% diet.

191
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:05,120
How did you get in?

192
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,840
I called you and your phone was off.

193
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,449
I just entered the passcode and came in.

194
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,300
I noticed the lights weren't on and didn't see anyone.

195
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,240
I was thinking of making some food for myself.

196
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,440
Bro, you have such a great habit

197
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,660
of never changing your passcode.

198
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,060
I'll change it tomorrow.

199
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,040
Is that necessary?

200
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,240
Don't be so stingy.

201
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
How are you talking to your brother?

202
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,440
You're generous. You're generous.

203
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,320
You're the most generous person.

204
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
Tell me, why did it take you so long to come to see me

205
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
after you came back to the country?

206
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:38,189
Well, men either spend their energy on their careers or love.

207
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:40,240
You're spending yours on your career.

208
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,840
I am certainly spending mine on love.

209
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,760
I wonder which girl will suffer this time.

210
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,700
Is it that goddess you were talking about on WeChat?

211
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,000
You still remember my Ke Qin?

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,980
Wait, Ke Qin?

213
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,280
What's the full name of your goddess?

214
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,480
Yu Ke Qin.

215
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,440
She's Xu Duo Cheng's best friend, Yu Ke Qin?

216
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,400
That's right. She's the one I told you about before.

217
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,620
The heroine who stood up for me in school.

218
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,700
What a wonderful serendipity!

219
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,840
Our girlfriends are best friends.

220
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,140
Enough. What are you thinking?

221
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,600
So, are you here because of that?

222
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:32,440
I came this time to tell you about Xu Duo Cheng.

223
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,660
Ke Qin was scolded so many times for protecting Xu Duo Cheng.

224
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,840
I was thinking she should pick herself up where she fell

225
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,120
and see if you have any insider scoops for my Ke Qin.

226
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:46,887
Come closer.

227
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,500
You're the insider scoop. 
  (T/N: Also means "you are the idiot")

228
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,920
How long have you had a crush on her? Did she ever give you any response?

229
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,880
So, I changed my tactics.

230
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
I won't keep a secret crush anymore. I'll pursue her upfront.

231
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,700
Men should take the initiative.

232
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,760
Otherwise, someone else will get the girl.

233
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,240
Men should take the initiative and make the effort in love.

234
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,680
Only when you take the initiative and make the effort...

235
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
Someone else will get the girl...

236
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,100
What?

237
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,900
What do you mean by "what"? Are you done yet?

238
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,120
Leave if you're done.

239
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,740
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

240
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,760
Is that how you treat your brother?

241
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,324
Are you leaving?

242
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,700
I'm not leaving.

243
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,800
- Are you leaving or not? 
 - I'm not leaving.

244
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,080
Fine, don't leave.

245
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,600
I just discovered a new movie.

246
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,080
I'll show it to you.

247
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,140
What movie?

248
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,140
It's not here.

249
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,900
Mom, what are you looking for?

250
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,640
Didn't I see a bottle of vitamins here a while ago?

251
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,080
I want to take a few of them.

252
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,540
I finished those vitamins.

253
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,080
You finished them?

254
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,540
Didn't I buy you a new bottle a few days ago?

255
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,780
I gave that new bottle to Ke Qin.

256
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,520
She said she wanted to buy vitamins too,

257
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,500
so I just gave her mine.

258
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,160
All right, I'll buy more for you.

259
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,480
Look at your bed. Can't you organize and fold your quilt?

260
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,620
It's such a mess.

261
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,700
- You don't seem like a girl at all. 
 - Mom, I can clean my own room from now on.

262
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,200
You don't have to clean it for me anymore.

263
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,880
It'll be a mess if you clean it yourself.

264
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,600
It's called order within chaos.

265
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,860
Every time you clean the room for me, I can't find anything.

266
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,665
Order within chaos... What can't you find?

267
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,320
Do you have secrets?

268
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,820
What secrets would I have?

269
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,740
If I had any secrets, I would tell them to you.

270
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,540
Exactly, don't you dare keep a secret from me.

271
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,700
Dad bought a watermelon. It's in the fridge.

272
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,600
Go eat more fruits. That's a vitamin supplement too.

273
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,260
All right, got it.

274
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,840
You think I'm nagging again, right?

275
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,599
 That's not going to work.

276
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,000
 She'll find out sooner or later.

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,940
 I have to figure something out.

278
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,140
Hello, Cai Yun.

279
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,840
Okay, okay. I'll be there right away.

280
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,620
- What? 
 - Did you pull an all-nighter again last night?

281
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,820
No one will take you as a mute if you don't speak.

282
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,960
How many times have I told you? Don't stay up late for work.

283
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,800
It's bad for your health.

284
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,800
A pick-me-up. Hurry up.

285
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,360
Hello, Sister Jia Yi. Jiang Nan left home.

286
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,980
Follow him. I'll come over now.

287
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,480
Brother Rui, let me ask you something.

288
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,780
Help me analyze it.

289
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,200
Go ahead.

290
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,100
My friend's girlfriend is getting closer and closer to his enemy.

291
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,380
Xu Duo Cheng and Zhan Zhi Lin are together?

292
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,500
No, they are not together.

293
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,100
She's just always...

294
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,540
I told you, "It's my friend."

295
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,780
Do you have any friends?

296
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,260
Which friend of yours don't I know?

297
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,940
What do you mean by I don't have any? What about Zhu Lin Feng?

298
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,660
I almost forgot about him.

299
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,340
Let me tell you, women are delicate flowers.

300
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,380
You must water it with care and be a breath of fresh air.

301
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,165
What you need to do now is to take the initiative and chase her.

302
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:29,760
Why should I take the initiative?

303
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
Let me tell you, Lao Jiang.

304
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,560
Zhan Zhi Lin is much better than you in terms of picking up girls.

305
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,740
You've never seen it. How do you know?

306
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,200
Sure, sure.

307
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,160
You're just stubborn.

308
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,760
Just keep doing that.

309
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,820
Make a right, up ahead. Let's go to Youfu Road first.

310
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,783
Youfu Road, isn't that the piano company?

311
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:56,040
Not bad, Lao Jiang. Are you coming around?

312
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,780
Do you want to let Xu Duo Cheng hear your new song before everyone else?

313
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,940
But I don't think I should go with you.

314
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm not good at being the third wheel, you know?

315
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
Let me tell you, you should listen to my every word from now on, you know?

316
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,600
Although I like to nag, all my naggings are sensible.

317
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,960
No one will take you as a mute if you don't speak.

318
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,060

319
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,740
 Thank you for coming to visit me.

320
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,820
 I'm fine.

321
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,320
That's good.

322
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,480
I just heard you play. Not bad.

323
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,300
You eavesdropped on my class?

324
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,680
What do you mean by "eavesdrop"?

325
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,660
As the owner of the store, I was just visiting in incognito

326
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,806
to see if my employees are working conscientiously.

327
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,560
What's wrong?

328
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm fine. I just need to rest for a while.

329
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,020
Let's go sit over there.

330
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,880
My leg sometimes hurts for no reason.

331
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
Take it easy.

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,920
Be careful.

333
00:19:57,818 --> 00:19:59,945
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't move.

334
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,740
Does it hurt?

335
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,140
 Oh my! What's going on?

336
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:18,954
What's wrong?

337
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:24,480
Jiang Nan, I don't think your hairstyle is handsome enough.

338
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,780
Are you crazy?

339
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,700
Actually, what I meant to say is, this isn't the right outfit to wear when you go see Xu Duo Cheng.

340
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,180
Why do I need to put on a special outfit to see her?

341
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,880
How about this?

342
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,060
Don't move. Look at me.

343
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,260
Actually, what I meant to say is, "The car is really dirty today."

344
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,200
I think I need to go wash the car.

345
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,820
As a Virgo, you have to understand. We care about our appearance, don't we?

346
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,240
Why are you going to a car wash? We're already here.

347
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,820
- Stop talking. 
 - Pride is very important.

348
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,380
We'll come back after we wash the car.

349
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,500
Let's go. I'll take you to see Doctor Sui.

350
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,640
That's okay. I really feel much better now.

351
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,060
What are you doing? Put me down. I just went to see the doctor last week.

352
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,660
If you want to live for a few more years, you must listen to me from now on.

353
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,660

354
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,120
It's all right, Doctor Sui. Just tell me.

355
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:30,381
You've already reached the stage of contractures.

356
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,580
You will experience symptoms like weakness of muscles in your limbs.

357
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,100
After that, you might have muscular dystrophy.

358
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,416
Doctor Sui, how much longer do I have to play the piano?

359
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,520
We have to determine that through a series of auxiliary examinations.

360
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,953
As long as we treat it actively, you can delay the process.

361
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:55,860
Actually, I want to ask

362
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,477
how much longer do I still have to live?

363
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:05,505
Normally, you have three to five years.

364
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,340
However, it's different for every patient.

365
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,440
If we control it well, you can have over 10 years.

366
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,260
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,220
It's all right. I actually already knew before.

368
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,400
I just wanted to make sure.

369
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,098
Maybe I can live for a few more years.

370
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,700
Jiang Nan, you're here for Xu Duo Cheng, right?

371
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,340
- Is she here? 
 - She went with our...

372
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,660
What's wrong with your eyes, sir?

373
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,000
My eyes are dry.

374
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,862
We can't find her. She's not here. Let's go.

375
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,420
Thank you.

376
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,500
Take me to my mom's nursing home first.

377
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,300
Thank you.

378
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,665
Is this the music instrument store that live-streamed Xu Duo Cheng and Zhan Zhi Lin last time?

379
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:08,320
Go and check inside.

380
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,820
Okay.

381
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:19,600
Lao Fang, keep following them.

382
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:27,023
 Sorry, the subscriber you've called is not available.

383
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,420
If I don't return your messages, why can't you contact me first?

384
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,340
Your phone is turned off when I take the initiative to call you.

385
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,620
Just wait and see how I'll punish you.

386
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,178
Punish who?

387
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:37,858
I'll punish whoever turns their phone off.

388
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:39,930
It's okay. I have a power bank.

389
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,700
- Go on. 
  - Sister Jia Yi,

390
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,545
turns out Xu Duo Cheng is a piano teacher at this music instrument store.

391
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:53,020
- She's teaching piano. 
 - She can teach piano?

392
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,340
There's more. The owner of this music instrument store is Zhan Zhi Lin.

393
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,660
 His staff said Xu Duo Cheng wasn't feeling well

394
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,020
 and Zhan Zhi Lin went with her to the hospital.

395
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,060
The hospital?

396
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,820
Then why don't you ask someone to follow them?

397
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,020
It's such a nice chance.

398
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,800
 Got it. I'll go arrange it now.

399
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,720
How did you find this place?

400
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,300
After 2BeOne disbanded, my dad found me a job.

401
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,720
I would come to the hospital because of work.

402
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,800
So, when I'm not in a good mood,

403
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,162
I will come to take a walk here.

404
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:36,747
I didn't know you also have moments when you're in a  bad mood.

405
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:40,840
Why? Do I look trouble-free?

406
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:44,641
Go ahead and yell.

407
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,540
Xu Duo Cheng, you have to survive!

408
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,380
You have to stay alive!

409
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,420
You have to be strong and stay alive, Xu Duo Cheng!

410
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,840
Xu Duo Cheng, hang in there!

411
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,260
It feels much better after I yelled it out.

412
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,360
It's your turn.

413
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,740
I don't have anything to say.

414
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,260
Really?

415
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,200
I don't believe you.

416
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,400
You must take your medication on time, understand?

417
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,240
If you feel under the weather, remember to call me.

418
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,100
Thank you for today.

419
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,960
I've taken so much of your time again.

420
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,560
Didn't you say before that

421
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm the only one who shares this secret with you.

422
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm leaving.

423
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,060
Xu Duo Cheng!

424
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,940
Jiang Nan, why are you here?

425
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,980
Can't I come? What don't you want me to see?

426
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,500
You saw Zhan Zhi Lin taking me home?

427
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,860
Xu Duo Cheng, don't you forget,

428
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,700
we have an employer-and-employee relationship.

429
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,580
That's why I forbid you to contact him except when you're teaching at the music instrument store.

430
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,420
Don't be unreasonable.

431
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,020
You disappeared for no reason and avoided me for days.

432
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,720
Now, you're showing up without notice and being so controlling.

433
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,760
Besides, you have to give me a reason for not letting me see Zhan Zhi Lin, right?

434
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
There's no reason.

435
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,105
You said it yourself. We have an employer-and-employee relationship.

436
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:08,560
That's the same thing with Zhan Zhi Lin and me.

437
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,625
The two of you are suddenly so incompatible and you're making me take sides.

438
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,838
Plus, I don't think Zhan Zhi Lin is that awful.

439
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:16,380
He takes care of me a lot normally.

440
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,580
What do you need to be taken care of? Can't I take care of you?

441
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,120
Besides, why don't you think about this?

442
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,640
If you're not my girlfriend, will Zhan Zhi Lin still be nice to you?

443
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,805
You mean, Zhan Zhi Lin deliberately approached me to target you?

444
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:33,820
Don't be so shallow and laughable.

445
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,060
You just ingratiate yourself when a rich man pursues you.

446
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,760
Say that again.

447
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,380
You just ingratiate yourself when a rich man pursues you.

448
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
Are you crazy?

449
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,809
I didn't expect Zhan Zhi Lin to move so fast.

450
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:56,260
That's quite a big scoop.

451
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,260
 Jiang Nan, that beansprout girl isn't that simple. 
 (T/N: Used to describe weak, thin people)

452
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,980
 I'll show you her true character.

453
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:07,140
 So annoying. I shouldn't have said that.

454
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:11,045

455
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:16,579
 Sorry, the subscriber you've called is not available.

456
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:23,851
 Sorry, the subscriber you've called is not available.

457
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,700
Here's your favorite.

458
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,540
Don't beat around the bush. Go ahead.

459
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,480
Where did you get the pictures?

460
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:13,260
Jiang Nan, I think you should know the truth about this.

461
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,134
I already told you Xu Duo Cheng isn't an innocent girl.

462
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:20,154
Girls these days have a lot of tricks up their sleeves.

463
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:23,981
That's why you asked someone to follow her and take pictures?

464
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:26,820
You think I asked someone to take pictures of her?

465
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,580
Am I that childish?

466
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,740
Am I always a mean and insidious woman in your mind?

467
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,180
This morning, my manager called and told me

468
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,060
someone got a scoop on Xu Duo Cheng and Zhan Zhi Lin, and they're going to sell it to True Image.

469
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,780
If I really wanted to destroy your relationship,

470
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,160
I could just play dumb and let it get exposed.

471
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,580
It won't affect me anyway,

472
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,980
but I thought about it for a long time.

473
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,180
Once it's exposed, it will put you in an awkward place.

474
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,940
A man and a woman strolling in a sea of flowers.

475
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,340
Those reporters are good at making stories from pictures.

476
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,458
Nothing good will come out of their mouths,

477
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:10,340
so I bought all these pictures.

478
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,740
You should understand why I did that, right?

479
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,400
I don't understand.

480
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,960
I know you misunderstood me before

481
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:24,078
and you really hate me now,

482
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:28,220
but I don't want to explain what happened in the past.

483
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,940
Besides, you won't believe anything I say.

484
00:30:40,043 --> 00:30:42,880
I already deleted the photos.

485
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,800
That's all I can do for you.

486
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,393
Take care of yourself.

487
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:49,999
I wish we can still be friends in the future.

488
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,840
Thank you.

489
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,000
You're here.

490
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:09,460
Why do you want to see me in such a hurry?

491
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,160
Take a seat first.

492
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:25,040
Where did you get these pictures?

493
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,120
Gu Jia Yi said she bought them from someone.

494
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,481
Gu Jia Yi didn't ask for anything and deleted the pictures in front of Lao Jiang.

495
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm really worried about this because I don't know whether she still has copies.

496
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,420
We also can't trust the person who sold the pictures.

497
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,340
That's what I'm worried about too.

498
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,980
There's nothing between us.

499
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,860
But you two were really there together, right? It can't be just an issue with the angle of the photo.

500
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,180
Jiang Nan, what do you mean by that?

501
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,960
- What I mean is... 
 - You two!

502
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,420
Let's solve the problem. Don't fight.

503
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,000
I think since this already happened,

504
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,440
let's find a solution together.

505
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,860
Actually, I'm very good at handling something like this.

506
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,625
Let's take the initiative and be preemptive.

507
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,000
Can you not keep us in suspense?

508
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,600
What's your idea?

509
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,360
Are you going to say it or not?

510
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,520
I shouldn't say it.

511
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,900
Actually, I just want to say, you two should live together.

512
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,520
- No way! 
 - No way!

513
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,080
Don't get so agitated.

514
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,380
Think about it this way.

515
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,180
This might be a really good solution.

516
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,440
Turn a passive situation into an active move.

517
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,920
Even if this picture is exposed in the future, you two would be living together in peace.

518
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,660
Just let them gossip.

519
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,100
Come up with another idea.

520
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,180
I already came up with an idea, it's your decision whether to accept it.

521
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 Mom, what are you looking for?

522
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,460
 Didn't I see a bottle of vitamins here a while ago?

523
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,680
 I want to take a few of them.

524
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,000
 Moving out may be the only solution.

525
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,620
What do you think?

526
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,720
I thought about it.

527
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,100
I don't think there's any other solution.

528
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,494
I agree.

529
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:19,945
Why are you guys looking at me like that?

530
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,920
Cheng Cheng already agreed.

531
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,080
What else do you have to say?

532
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,760
You two already made a decision.

533
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,320
Does it matter what I say?

534
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,880
However, I have a few conditions.

535
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,120
Go ahead.

536
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,020
One, about us moving in together,

537
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,540
you must keep it a secret from my parents.

538
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,800
No problem.

539
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,920
Two, although I need to stay here,

540
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,240
you can't charge me rent.

541
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,940
You have to provide meals and accommodation.

542
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,120
Of course.

543
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,080
Three, I'm not sleeping in a tent.

544
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,880
I want my own room.

545
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,360
- No problem. 
 - Four...

546
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,440
Why do you have so many demands?

547
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,020
Four, Jiang Nan, you must apologize for your excessive and offensive comment.

548
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,120
What excessive and offensive comment?

549
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,550
What excessive comment?

550
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,940
 Don't be so shallow and laughable.

551
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,380
 You just ingratiate yourself when a rich man pursues you.

552
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,560
You want me to apologize?

553
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
Don't look at me.

554
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,677
You go ahead.

555
00:34:18,677 --> 00:34:22,699
All right, I understand what you're saying and I told you about my conditions.

556
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,980
You two think about it. I'm leaving now.

557
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,760
Cheng Cheng. Wait...

558
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,020
Look at your temper.

559
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,520
Why is it so hard for you to apologize?

560
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
Why should I apologize?

561
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,439
What's so bad about apologizing?

562
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:38,860
You don't know anything.

563
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,400
- Why are you giving advice? 
 - I was doing it for your own good.

564
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,700
For whose own good? I'm sleepy.

565
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,620
I'm going upstairs to sleep.

566
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,159
You're sleepy again? Think about it carefully.

567
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,859
Got it.

568
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:08,400
 I don't know how much longer I can do this job.

569
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,640
Xu Duo Cheng, why did you ask to see me in such a hurry?

570
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,740
No one followed you, right?

571
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,440
I don't think so.

572
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,340
I asked to see you because I have something to tell you.

573
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,640
- I'm sorry. I might've caused trouble for you. 
 - What are you talking about?

574
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,140
Someone took our picture when we were at the sea of flowers a few days ago.

575
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,200
How do you know?

576
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,165
Gu Jia Yi bought those pictures and sent them to Jiang Nan.

577
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:38,400
I saw them.

578
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,185
I'm worried that the person who sold the pictures will break their promise.

579
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:44,040
Once the pictures are exposed, I'm afraid it might affect you.

580
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,220
I'm really sorry.

581
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,300
I never expected to cause such a big problem for you.

582
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,680
You don't need to apologize.

583
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,960
This isn't your fault. I don't care what they say.

584
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,140
It doesn't matter to me.

585
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,400
However, it feels pretty special to have someone care about me.

586
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,645
Do you care this much about Jiang Nan too?

587
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:06,145
You're still in the mood to make jokes?

588
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:08,960
I think the two of us shouldn't see each other anymore.

589
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,360
Aren't you tired of shouldering all the responsibilities?

590
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,080
You will always meet the people you're destined to meet.

591
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,960
You can't stop it. There's nothing you can do.

592
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,360
That's right. I suddenly realized I have something else to do.

593
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,060
Are you okay on your own?

594
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,720
Well, I'm leaving now.

595
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:51,400

596
00:36:56,195 --> 00:37:02,735
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

597
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:09,149
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

598
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:17,046
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

599
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:22,633
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

600
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:26,379
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

601
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:30,359
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

602
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:36,812
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

603
00:37:36,812 --> 00:37:40,267
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

604
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,145
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

605
00:37:42,145 --> 00:37:44,445
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

606
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:47,459
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

607
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:51,247
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

608
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:54,564
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

609
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,532
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

610
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:02,818
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

611
00:38:02,818 --> 00:38:05,567
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

612
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:08,949
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

613
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:13,083
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

614
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,017
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

615
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:19,916
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

616
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:23,259
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

617
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,221
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

618
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,536
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

619
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:38,084
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

620
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:55,937
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

621
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:59,854
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

622
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:06,364
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

623
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:09,755
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

624
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:13,889
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

625
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:16,823
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

626
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:20,722
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

627
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:23,965
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

628
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:28,127
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

629
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:32,254
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

630
00:39:32,254 --> 00:39:38,543
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
