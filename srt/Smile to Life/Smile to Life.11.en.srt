1
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,520
Brother Nan,

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,640
are you feeling better?

3
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
What's wrong with you?

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm fine.

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Brother,

6
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,200
I didn't make myself clear.

8
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,960
So they got you two a big bed room.

9
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,320
Just open another room.

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,080
I just asked.

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,400
The hotel is full today.

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
All the rooms are full.

13
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
Because it's the peak tourist season,

14
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
they're all booked in advance.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,760
It's true,

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Nan. I was wrong.

17
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
I've been keeping an eye on this since I arrived at the hotel.

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,760
We really don't have

19
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,000
a room. We staff

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,280
have arranged a room for two people,

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,960
What should we do now?

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,840
There are no other hotels nearby.

23
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,680
Well.

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,120
That's all I can do.

25
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,960
Give me the room card.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,520
Go back

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,320
and take a shower.

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,720
What are you thinking?

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,040
You have to take a shower after the rain.

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm going to take a shower.

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll sleep on the sofa tonight.

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,880
You sleep on the bed.

33
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
You're not really taking off your clothes.

34
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,120
Hold on.

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,480
Why are you taking off your clothes?

36
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm drenched.

37
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,280
If you don't change it,

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,120
you'll catch a cold.

39
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm sorry,

40
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,200
it's all because of me that you got wet like this.

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
Go take a shower.

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
Be careful of catching a cold.

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,440
How is it going?

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Mr. Bao,

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
everything is arranged as you said.

46
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,720
And there are unexpected gains?

47
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,160
What sound?

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,800
Report to me as soon as you get anything.

49
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Don't bother.

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,560
I'll report it to you myself.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Mr. Bao,

52
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,800
you're here too.

53
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,760
You can't even handle such a small matter.

54
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
You don't have to come back.

55
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Did you take the wrong medicine?

56
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,360
Where's the cold medicine I asked you to buy?

57
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,360
Here,

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,560
Thank you.

59
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,520
Editor-in-Chief Qin Qin is also here for sports,

60
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
I just moved to this neighborhood,

61
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't just focus on fishing if you're okay.

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
It's time to work out.

63
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm leaving.

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Hello, mom.

65
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm at the hotel.

66
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,640
Don't worry.

67
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm telling you,

68
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
it's fun here.

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,920
If there's a chance, you and Dad

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,040
should come over and have fun.

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,320
How can we have the time?

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,160
Wait till later.

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
Family Fun is too busy.

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,120
He just came back.

75
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm exhausted.

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm soaking my feet.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,880
New boss, new look.

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Honey,

79
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,640
why did you use Jiang Nan's phone?

80
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,520
You two share a room?

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,680
Of course not.

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
It's because my phone is dead.

83
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm in a hurry to report my safety to you.

84
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
What's that noise?

85
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,440
Why is there a big mouse in this hotel?

86
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,160
There are rats in the room.

87
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,160
Yeah,

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,920
and this mouse is big and smelly,

89
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,760
Call the front desk.

90
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,360
You can't change rooms.

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,760
Well,

92
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,560
Girl,

93
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,440
if there's a mouse, change to a hotel,

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,960
Yeah, yeah,

95
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,000
yeah. You have to live better when you go out to play.

96
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
Don't be reluctant to spend money.

97
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
Got it.

98
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,400
By the way, girl,

99
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,360
when you're playing outside,

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,800
The food is very important.

101
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,400
Choose the clean one.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
My dear Chef Xu,

103
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,320
it's not like I'm going to explore the rainforest,

104
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,800
Don't worry.

105
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,160
It's getting late,

106
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
so I'll go to bed.

107
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,600
You and mom should go to bed

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,480
early. Bye-bye.

109
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Worship what?

110
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,640
I'm not done yet.

111
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,400
Are you sure

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
you want to share a room with a mouse?

113
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,920
This girl is really old.

114
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,680
Daughter-in-law,

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,960
do you think our girl has grown so big,

116
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,000
It's my first time going out this far with a boy.

117
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,120
What's wrong?

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm worried.

120
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,920
All right, I've read it.

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,240
Jiang Nan is

122
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,240
quite honest.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,520
Even if he has evil intentions,

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,440
we may not agree with him, right?

125
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,360
Look at you.

126
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,760
But I just don't know if the kid is eating well

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,480
when he goes out?

128
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
Do you live well?

129
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm still a little worried.

130
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,200
It's good to stay at home for a thousand days,

131
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
but it's hard to go out for a day,

132
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
It's not as good as staying at home.

133
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,800
You... You

134
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,480
can't comfort me.

135
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,280
You're making things difficult for me. Isn't

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,200
your daughter-in-law

137
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,520
making things difficult for you?

138
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,040
Isn't that normal?

139
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,880
The child has grown up

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
and graduated from college.

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,280
Besides,

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
she's in a relationship.

143
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,760
From now on,

144
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,000
this kid,

145
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
You don't have to tell us anything.

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
We have to tell Jiang Nan,

147
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,640
it's not that she doesn't love us.

148
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
He's afraid

149
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,560
that we'll be worried,

150
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,520
So,

151
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,640
as long as we live a good life,

152
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Just don't let the kids worry about you.

153
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,800
Isn't that right?

154
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,080
Many oranges,

155
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,040
wake up!

156
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,400
What are you doing?

157
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,040
Get up.

158
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
Go to bed.

159
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,000
What?

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,440
Forget it if you don't want to go.

161
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,040
I'll go.

162
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
It's more comfortable in bed.

163
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,480
Happiness comes too suddenly.

164
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,040
I'm not used to it.

165
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
No need to thank me.

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
You're snoring too loudly.

167
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I can't fall asleep either.

168
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
Did I snore?

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Really?

170
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,400
Jiang Nan,

171
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,200
thank you.

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,560
If it weren't for you,

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,960
I would have slept on the street tonight.

174
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,760
Got it.

175
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,440
Go to sleep.

176
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,680
Jiang Nan,

177
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,160
thank you for being in my life.

178
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,560
He gave me good luck one after another.

179
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,880
You made my last time so happy.

180
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Thank you. Please

181
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,400
confirm this position again. By then,

182
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,400
OK,

183
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,880
OK. Hello, Mr. Jiang Nan.

184
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,960
Here's a grinding stick

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,200
for you.

186
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
You're still young.

187
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,320
That's why you need it.

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,280
Director Liu,

189
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,440
why hasn't Female No. 1 come yet?

190
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
I won't be able to put on makeup later.

191
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm not sure

192
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
if you'll come later.

193
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Who will be responsible if I can't put on makeup?

194
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,040
None of your business.

195
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,880
Have you implemented everything in your department?

196
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay, no problem.

197
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,560
What's wrong?

198
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,960
Director,

199
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,760
the heroine can't come because of something.

200
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,600
Why don't you call her again and ask her.

201
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,480
Nonsense. You don't

202
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,640
give me actors when I'm filming,

203
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
What do you want me to shoot?

204
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
I want you to tell the production team,

205
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,040
no matter what happens,

206
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,960
Find the actors for me,

207
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
shoot what I want,

208
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,760
The beauty I want.

209
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,560
Choke.

210
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,920
I'll urge you again.

211
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,760
Director,

212
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,720
what happened?

213
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
The heroine Lisa

214
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,280
said she couldn't come because of appendicitis,

215
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,200
Director,

216
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,240
please give me some time.

217
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll figure it out.

218
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,800
Because this MV is really important to me.

219
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Calm down.

220
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Thank you.

221
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Find me someone,

222
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,720
an actor,

223
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,600
I want to shoot it.

224
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Something bad happened.

225
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,280
The heroine is going to be replaced.

226
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,280
I already know.

227
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
I was just about to call you.

228
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,240
But you really don't know,

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,080
the producer

230
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,280
just called me happily,

231
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,560
If Gu Jiayi wants to act,

232
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,760
why doesn't this woman give up?

233
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,120
Why did she take

234
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,920
this kind of MV before?

235
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,240
Now I suspect Lisa has appendicitis,

236
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,440
is it because of her?

237
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,560
Sis,

238
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,240
Look, our luggage is almost full.

239
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,080
Do you still want to bring these clothes?

240
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,880
Take it with you.

241
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
After the MV,

242
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,920
I can hang out with Jiang Nan,

243
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,280
By the way,

244
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,160
when will the bus arrive?

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,680
It should be here.

246
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,600
I'll contact Fang.

247
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,160
Brother,

248
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,120
Liang Zhe won the leading role in MV,

249
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,840
but Gu Jiayi went to

250
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
talk to the producer on her own initiative,

251
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,880
I went to reduce my pay.

252
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
Just wait and see.

253
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
Someone is more anxious about this than we are.

254
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,400
Rui,

255
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,520
Rui is here.

256
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,760
Please communicate with the producer,

257
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,240
mainly expressing two meanings,

258
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,160
First,

259
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,880
if Gu Jiayi takes photos,

260
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Our cooperation is terminated.

261
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,720
I'll pay for all the damages.

262
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,560
Second,

263
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,760
I already have

264
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
a suitable candidate for the MV heroine,

265
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,840
If the producer doesn't object

266
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,880
and can choose,

267
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,320
I don't have to accept my pay.

268
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,120
In addition,

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
If I fail to achieve the desired results in the end,

270
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
I will pay for all the MV costs.

271
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,120
Wait a minute.

272
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,880
I understand the first half. Who will be

273
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,480
the main actress in the second half of the MV?

274
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,400
Do I know him?

275
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,440
Many oranges. This song

276
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,640
was inspired by many oranges.

277
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,760
So,

278
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,800
she is the most suitable heroine.

279
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,160
Got it.

280
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,360
Just think it through.

281
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I've thought it through.

282
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:50,960
Okay,

283
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
Let me help you with the rest.

284
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,840
That bean sprouts,

285
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,480
no.

286
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,320
I don't care how you do it,

287
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,080
you have to let me play it anyway.

288
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
What's going on?

289
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,760
Why did the female number one suddenly stop acting?

290
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,520
It's okay.

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Don't worry.

292
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Mr. Bao is taking care of it.

293
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,040
But,

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,560
I might need your help.

295
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,120
What can I do for you?

296
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,600
Save the field,

297
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,680
save the field,

298
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,440
Hello,

299
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,040
Director Jiang Nan,

300
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,000
This is the girl you introduced.

301
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,800
Yes.

302
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,640
She's also my girlfriend.

303
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,960
Girlfriend,

304
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,280
have you read the script?

305
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
She can play the piano.

306
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm also teaching students at the musical instrument store,

307
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,720
scripts,

308
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,720
I think she's more familiar with it than I am, right?

309
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,120
Most importantly,

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,040
the inspiration of this song,

311
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
It comes from her.

312
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,640
If a real couple shoots an MV together,

313
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,320
the tacit understanding will be fine.

314
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,480
Come to all departments

315
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,600
to dress up and get ready,

316
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,440
Jiang Nan,

317
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
I'll leave it to you.

318
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,640
I'm not the director. I

319
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,000
got this song

320
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,240
because of you.

321
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,160
So you are the heroine of this song.

322
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,600
You have to believe in yourself.

323
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,600
No, I really can't.

324
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,920
It's an emergency.

325
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,760
If you don't shoot it,

326
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,760
Then this MV can't be filmed.

327
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,720
Lin Yun,

328
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,480
I'll leave it to you.

329
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Okay, no problem.

330
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,560
Sis,

331
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,400
What's wrong?

332
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,120
In a while,

333
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
you can move this position again.

334
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Let's go through the trick,

335
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,720
Okay,

336
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,640
And then,

337
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
director,

338
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
The actors are done.

339
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,880
I'm going to win the prize.

340
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,160
Again

341
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,800
A little more,

342
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,880
Again,

343
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,680
Cut

344
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,720
Both of you were good just now.

345
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,560
I want the truth,

346
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,160
I want a real couple.

347
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,359
In front of our MV,

348
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,920
show your true feelings.

349
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,000
Really

350
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,839
That's how you can impress the audience.

351
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,720
Come on,

352
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,319
Look at each other.

353
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,800
Look at each other.

354
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,720
Yes.

355
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,960
Keep an eye on each other.

356
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,599
Okay,

357
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
Look at each other

358
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,040
lovingly.

359
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,319
Watch

360
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,480
Get into your relationship.

361
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
Imagine your life,

362
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,800
what is your life like?

363
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,040
Okay.

364
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,680
Nice.

365
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,440
A tacit understanding.

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,880
This kind of tacit understanding can't be performed.

367
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,320
You can't sleep?

368
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Me too.

369
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,720
Where did you get it?

370
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,560
The director who gave it to me today

371
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,000
said,

372
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,680
It's very nice today.

373
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,560
Many oranges,

374
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,840
is this your first time shooting MV?

375
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,400
Of course. Is it

376
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,680
your first time to get wet in the rain?

377
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,720
Of course not.

378
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,640
Is it the first time to shoot MV in the rain?

379
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
What are you trying to say?

380
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
I mean,

381
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,480
the last scene today,

382
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,160
Professional actors might not be able to film it.

383
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,200
Then tell me,

384
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
can I also be an actress?

385
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
You're overthinking it.

386
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,120
Go to bed. I have to get up early

387
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,840
and go out to play tomorrow.

388
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,840
I'm still going to play.

389
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,720
I lost my phone last time,

390
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,760
what are you going to lose this time?

391
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,320
As long as I don't lose myself.

392
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,880
I'm not sure.

393
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,520
If you lose yourself,

394
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,920
as your creditor,

395
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,560
I've lost a lot of money.

396
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,240
Hello,

397
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,280
Mr. Bao?

398
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Prada got lost in the park,

399
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
she couldn't get through to her owner,

400
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,360
No, no.

401
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Prada Prada Prada,

402
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:53,880
Prada,

403
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,840
Prada.

404
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,240
Prada,

405
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,440
Mr. Qian

406
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,720
As for financing,

407
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,360
I think we can

408
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,240
talk about it again.

409
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,080
I must have a news pursuit.

410
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,120
But now the problem with the truth is,

411
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,560
Hello.

412
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,000
Where did it go?

413
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,560
Mr. Bao,

414
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
what are you doing here?

415
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,120
Are you fighting crickets?

416
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,920
Looking for a dog?

417
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,720
Looking for a dog?

418
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,760
Son,

419
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,960
Son,

420
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,400
I didn't expect you to have a dog?

421
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,880
Son,

422
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,600
Prada,

423
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,720
Prada,

424
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,800
isn't this my dog?

425
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Your dog?

426
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,120
Yes.

427
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,000
Prada,

428
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,400
No,

429
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
You don't have a dog like that.

430
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You don't care about it all day long.

431
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,040
Put it in the pet shop.

432
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,600
Do you know it's golden hair?

433
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,880
I really, really need a lot of exercise.

434
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,000
It will get depressed if it doesn't exercise.

435
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,200
You'll be depressed, you know?

436
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,960
You,

437
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,080
if you can support me, you can support me.

438
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,880
What if you can't raise it?

439
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Don't keep a kitten

440
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
or a dog. It's not a toy.

441
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm telling you,

442
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
if it weren't for me this day,

443
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,600
Wait.

444
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,640
Does it have anything to do with you whether I can have a dog or not?

445
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,200
also

446
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
You touched my dog without my permission.

447
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,760
Otherwise, Prada wouldn't have gone to

448
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,720
such a dirty place.

449
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
Don't you tie the leash when you walk your dog?

450
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,160
You should be responsible for it.

451
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,440
What if I get lost?

452
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,960
No,

453
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
I didn't tie the leash,

454
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,840
No, but I'll help you find a dog.

455
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,600
Don't you think

456
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,200
it's unreasonable to say that?

457
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,560
You almost lost my dog.

458
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
I haven't settled accounts with you yet.

459
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Are you trying to reason with me?

460
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,160
Okay,

461
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,320
You can hide from me if you don't mess with me, okay?

462
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,240
I … I won't touch your dog.

463
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,080
Who wants you to touch it?

464
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,720
Prada,

465
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,760
Pula,

466
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,800
Prada

467
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,240
doesn't recognize her?

468
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,960
Wait a minute.

469
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,920
What are you doing?

470
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
The dog seems to be frightened.

471
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
It has nothing to do with me.

472
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,000
What does it have to do with me?

473
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,080
Well,

474
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm sorry,

475
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,480
just now

476
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,800
I apologize

477
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
for my bad attitude,

478
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,760
You don't accept

479
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,480
Prada,

480
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,800
Prada,

481
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Prada,

482
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,720
come to your mom Prada

483
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,520
Let's go Prada,

484
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,160
Prada, be a good boy.

485
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,680
I just don't want it to lose its owner.

486
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,160
No.

487
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
The ingrate,

488
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,800
Prada,

489
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm your mom, Prada.

490
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
Childish.

491
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,960
Really?

492
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,360
Hello, this is your ice cream.

493
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,880
Please take it.

494
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,440
Thank you.

495
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,200
It's okay,

496
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,040
Heavenly Maid Scattered Hua Nian Nian Ping An,

497
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,920
Wipe it.

498
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,200
Here,

499
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,440
I bought you another one.

500
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,360
Thank you.

501
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,680
Seeing such a beautiful view,

502
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,640
in your mind,

503
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,520
Are the lyrics generated automatically?

504
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
It's not that exaggerated.

505
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,800
I just remember the current picture and feeling.

506
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,560
When you need to write lyrics,

507
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,800
you can use them.

508
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
It's like

509
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,840
a database,

510
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,440
Anyway,

511
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
you're awesome.

512
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,640
The lyrics of each song,

513
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,560
I think it's very graphic.

514
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,200
You are always able to capture

515
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,160
the brightest part of the audience's memory,

516
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,200
How did you do that?

517
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,960
Talent,

518
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,720
stinky fart.

519
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,240
The ancient banyan tree

520
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
was planted during the Ming Dynasty,

521
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,120
The tree was about 500 years old

522
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,280
and had been struck by lightning and didn't die,

523
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,640
Blooming,

524
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,440
this tree,

525
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,720
But it's very efficacious.

526
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
You still believe this?

527
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,200
Hello.

528
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,960
Don't peek.

529
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
You can't peek.

530
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Peeping won't work.

531
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,920
Is that so?

532
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,480
I hope Jiang Nan's career will be successful.

533
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,240
Become a superstar as soon as possible.

534
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,840
Jiang Nan,

535
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
your wish won't come true if you say it out loud.

536
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,640
Who told you I wrote this wish?

537
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
Wait a minute. I've been

538
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,800
in a big city for a long time,

539
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,280
Come out once in a while to relax.

540
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
It's pretty good, too.

541
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
It's pretty good.

542
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,520
The sunset is so beautiful.

543
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,080
Why?

544
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,840
Because after the glorious sunset,

545
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,680
there will be a galaxy of stars all over the sky.

546
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
This is the first time I've seen the sunset like this.

547
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:39,920
Do you like it?

548
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,280
In fact, what you see,

549
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,960
is a fireball that burned hundreds of millions of light years.

550
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
Why are you so bad at ruining the atmosphere?

551
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,920
But seriously,

552
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,880
the light you see,

553
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Maybe it burned out hundreds of millions of light years away.

554
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,600
Don't you think this is romantic?

555
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,960
We witnessed hundreds of millions of light years here,

556
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,320
their last glory.

557
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,960
Their light is crossing the Milky Way.

558
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,360
I came to see you

559
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,600
at a speed of 300 thousand kilometers per second.

560
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,840
Many oranges,

561
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,520
I find you have a gift for writing lyrics.

562
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,800
That was a good one.

563
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,120
Really?

564
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,040
Did I inspire you just now?

565
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,560
Will you write a new song?

566
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,720
I'll think about it.

567
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,320
actually

568
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
I didn't expect that one day,

569
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,040
I would sit and chat with you like this,

570
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,760
feeling

571
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,160
It's really like a dream.

572
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,080
Who do you think should be by my side?

573
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,440
Zhan Zhilin.

574
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
Actually, I also know

575
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,800
that

576
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,320
you've always wanted to ask me about Zhan Zhilin and me,

577
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,920
But these things are very complicated,

578
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,560
and you can't explain them clearly in a few words.

579
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,600
Besides, many years have passed,

580
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,560
and I don't want to talk about it anymore.

581
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,520
Anyway,

582
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,400
stay away from him!

583
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,280
Actually, I don't think

584
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
he's a bad guy,

585
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,400
Yes.

586
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,320
He's not a bad guy,

587
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm a bad guy,

588
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,040
Why are you two acting so weird?

589
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,640
He was so angry at the mention of the other party,

590
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,800
what did he say about me?

591
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,160
Just say

592
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,000
What? Forget it?

593
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,720
Even if you don't tell me, I know what he said about me.

594
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,000
What's wrong with you?

595
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,800
My stomach hurts

596
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,280
because I'm mad at you. Don't joke with me.

597
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,040
Do I look like a joke?

598
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,040
I'll take you to the hospital now.

599
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's go.

600
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,600
Why did you post so many flightpages again?

601
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
I can't even stick the script anymore.

602
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,240
My head is getting bigger.

603
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,080
Sis,

604
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,760
Actually, I know that

605
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
you are unhappy because of many oranges,

606
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
Don't take it too seriously.

607
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,960
This is a lot of oranges,

608
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
small white flowers on the surface,

609
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,520
Actually, she has a lot of tricks behind her back.

610
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,320
Do you remember at the press conference last time,

611
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,120
she kissed Jiang Nan forcefully,

612
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,720
You want to steal the MV again?

613
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,960
She just wants to be popular,

614
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,960
she just wants to use Jiang Nan

615
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,080
to get out of the circle,

616
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
With her?

617
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,719
She just

618
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,120
caught the weakness that men have a desire to protect.

619
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,120
I must show Jiang Nan

620
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,360
who she really is.

621
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Do you feel better?

622
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:39,760
No.

623
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,239
See a doctor first.

624
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,960
Be careful.

625
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,080
No way.

626
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,080
Men don't have to be afraid of itching.

627
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,400
Girlfriend, do you feel itchy?

628
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,800
Come on, girl. Help me

629
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,440
Come on.

630
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,520
Press here.

631
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,960
Is there a lump?

632
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,360
Yes,

633
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,360
Yes.

634
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,680
Little girl,

635
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,880
these are abdominal muscles,

636
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,240
He's holding back his smile.

637
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,560
How can my abdominal muscles not be hard?

638
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,360
What did you eat today?

639
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,360
We went to the snack street in the scenic area today,

640
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,200
drank milk tea,

641
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,040
Candied haws,

642
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,840
ice cream,

643
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,840
You even ate Malatang.

644
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
It's quite tasty.

645
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,480
I told you the food you ate there wasn't sanitary, right?

646
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,400
But I also ate what you ate.

647
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,600
I'm fine.

648
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,040
Stand up.

649
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,320
Acute gastroenteritis,

650
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,960
vomiting and diarrhea later,

651
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,480
He might also have a fever.

652
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,320
How about this?

653
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,280
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

654
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,640
To relieve your symptoms.

655
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,680
Jiang Nan,

656
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,760
what's wrong with you?

657
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,600
I want to vomit.

658
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,400
Have some water.

659
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,120
No way.

660
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
I need to go to the toilet again.

661
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
These are anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics.

662
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,600
You have to change another bottle after you hang it up.

663
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,560
Just call me.

664
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,440
Thank you for your hard work.

665
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,600
Thank you, nurse.

666
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,280
You're welcome.

667
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,360
Sorry to have wronged you.

668
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,720
I wanted to go out with you to relax for a day,

669
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,680
but I even dragged you into the hospital with me,

670
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,680
It's all my fault

671
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,840
to drag you to eat and eat that caused you to be hospitalized.

672
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,040
It's all my fault.

673
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,440
Now that you've admitted your mistake,

674
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,320
can you let me go to bed early?

675
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,280
Okay,

676
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,240
Get some rest.

677
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,760
Do you want to lie on that bed for a while?

678
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,640
It's okay.

679
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
I'll stay here with you.

680
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,040
Good night.

681
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,040
Good night.
