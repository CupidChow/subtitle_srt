1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,764
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,004
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,204
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:24,479
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:30,337
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:33,051
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:35,456
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:38,938
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,637
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:44,451
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:48,338
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:51,065
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:53,878
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:55,425
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,425 --> 00:00:58,792
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,507
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,507 --> 00:01:05,748
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:10,695
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,449
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,183
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:18,390
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,103
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:25,662
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:30,981
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:45,111
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:49,277

28
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:52,160

29
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:16,786
Why am I on the bed?

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,700
You sleepwalked last night and got up here by yourself.

31
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,240
You're good. You can get discharged now.

32
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,140
- Thank you, Nurse. 
 - You're welcome.

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,040
You're quite weird.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
You didn't want to share the king-sized bed with me in the hotel,

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,293
but you wanted to share such a small single bed with me in the hospital.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,060
Are you feeling any better?

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,000
Much better. Let's leave.

38
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,680
Brother Nan! The hotel staff said you didn't come back all night.

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,360
Lord Bao couldn't reach you, either. We were so worried.

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,440
Sorry. We visited Huxin Islet and Jiang Nan...

41
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,400
We're adults. What do you have to worry about?

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,500
We're checking out.

43
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,300
A night together on the islet?

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,400
Brother Nan really knows how to have fun.

45
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,060
I must report to Lord Bao as soon as possible.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,640
For me?

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,960
You lost your phone, didn't you?

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,580
This is for you.

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,540
No, thanks. I have a spare one at home.

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,860
Keep it.

51
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,080
This is a benefit for employees.

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,100
Everyone in the company gets one.

53
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,020
Not me.

54
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,780
Then take it as a "thank you" gift for the MV production.

55
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,680
No, thank you. It's the least I could do.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,140
Besides, the phone looks quite expensive.

57
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,200
I can't accept it. I mean it.

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm gifting it to you. Just keep it.

59
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,859
One more thing. When you get home, turn on your phone's location services.

60
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,800
Don't lose contact again.

61
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,640
Brother Nan, shall we go straight to the office or to your home?

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,340
Drive Xu Duo Cheng back to Happy Family first,

63
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,380
then take me to the nursing home.

64
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,880
Okay.

65
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,350

66
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,500
Sister-in-law, Brother Nan prepared these for you.

67
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,440
Bro, who are those men?

68
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,180
How about I go inside with you?

69
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,780
It's been such a long time since I last visited my father-in-law.

70
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,600
Don't mess around. Aren't you afraid of my dad forcing you to drink?

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
Okay. Go inside, then.

72
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,420
I've got a dinner date.

73
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,360
So, just enjoy your family dinner before coming back.

74
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,247
Okay.

75
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,947
You guys should head off now.

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,260
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye.

77
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,040
It's busy at noon when customers come.

78
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,440
Dad! Mom!

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,420
- You're back! 
 - I finished my business trip.

80
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,920
- Orange, you're back! 
 - Give Mommy a hug.

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,960
You are tanned.

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,360
Tanned? Isn't it genetic?

83
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,906
You've lost so much weight!

84
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:40,786
- Have I? 
 - Hurry. Sit down.

85
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:44,653
Jiang Nan bought you these local special snacks.

86
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,202
That's really thoughtful of him.

87
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:47,762
Thank him for us.

88
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:49,962
- Okay. 
 - He's so considerate. Look.

89
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,402
You like this, right?

90
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,722
My favorite mung bean cakes!

91
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:54,902
- Brother Ye. 
 - Oh, thank you.

92
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:57,562
- Uncle Liu, here you are. 
 - Thank you.

93
00:06:03,022 --> 00:06:05,162
Da Lin, it's for you.

94
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,002
I hate sweet things.

95
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,502
Da Lin, is there anything wrong with you?

96
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:19,202
Master, honestly, your future son-in-law is really thoughtful.

97
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,682
Stop, stop, stop. Who says he's my future son-in-law?

98
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,102
We must watch and observe and study him closely.

99
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:25,602
Watch your tongue.

100
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,182
I must say, Master's right.

101
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:29,955
We need to watch him.

102
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,075
He must be truly good to Orange.

103
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,302
What's the point of these fancy things?

104
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:38,222
Come on, Da Lin. Be quiet, okay?

105
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,702
Now you're talkative?

106
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:41,442
Okay, everybody, get down to business now!

107
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,642
We got a big order for lunch.

108
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,642
Many customers will come. We need to hurry.

109
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:46,162
Let's go.

110
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,165

111
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,960

112
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:11,902
Hello, Teacher Yang.

113
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:12,942
Hi, Na Na.

114
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:15,082
Teacher Xu is waiting for you inside. You can go inside now.

115
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,562
- Bye-bye. 
 - Work hard!

116
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,242
- Teacher Xu. 
 - You are here.

117
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:26,502
Did you learn the piece I asked you to practice last week?

118
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:28,642
- Play it, then. 
 - Okay.

119
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:33,020
â™«  I'm not used to traveling or playing the piano alone  â™«

120
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,120
â™«  I'm not used to watching the ocean or movies alone  â™«

121
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,710
â™«  I'm not used to reading, walking, or watching the sunset alone  â™«

122
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,240
â™«  I'm not used to being alone and single   â™«

123
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,542
You're intoxicated, aren't you?

124
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,382
It makes me want to fall in love.

125
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,302
Send it to Chen Dong.

126
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:00,742
Send it to Chen Dong?

127
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,682
Send it to him as a token of thanks.

128
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:06,122
If he likes it, it can act as a "thank you" gift.

129
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,982
You're hopeless.

130
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,782
Am I?

131
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:16,562
 I'll stay at Ke Qin's for the night and not go back.

132
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,882
 Find yourself something to eat.

133
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:24,802
 Approved. I want cola chicken wings as a reward.

134
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,102
Surely, you're hopeless.

135
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,122
I'm serious. Have dinner with me tonight.

136
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:37,122
Xu Duo Cheng will go to her best friend's place.

137
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:39,402
Can I say, "No, thanks?"

138
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,242
I also want to date someone.

139
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:43,442
You...

140
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,262
Just go on listening to songs.

141
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,762
"When reversing, one hand operates the steering wheel,

142
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,962
with the other resting on the passenger seat."

143
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:03,222
"Turn your head to the rear,

144
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:10,262
and fasten the seat belt for the girl in the passenger seat."

145
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:13,702
"It's an opportunity to get closer."

146
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:16,802
"Less than 50 cm apart,

147
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,482
when a man and a woman stare at each other for more than one second,

148
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,902
their odds of falling in love is 70%."

149
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,722
 - What are you doing?  
 - Nothing.

150
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:24,922
Just waiting for my girlfriend to get off work.

151
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,322
Drive away. You can't park here.

152
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,422
Look, she's coming!

153
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,302
Ke Qin!

154
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,062
Chubby Zhu!

155
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:42,102
Did you put a locator on me?

156
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:43,982
How did you know I came to work today?

157
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:46,682
Well, my sister told me you'd have a regular meeting today.

158
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,022
So why are you here?

159
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,702
To pick you up.

160
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,542
Don't bother. I'll just take a taxi.

161
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:55,582
Please, allow me to drive you home. You know, the car-hailing services aren't that safe,

162
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:58,362
and your hand is injured. I'm worried about you.

163
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:00,982
At least allow me to follow you.

164
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:04,242
Anyway, I can't let you out of my sight.

165
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:28,880
What are you doing?

166
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,002
I-I-I'm trying to help fasten your seat belt.

167
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,502
I'm not paralyzed.

168
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:02,702
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry!

169
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:03,882
I'm sorry!

170
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:06,002
Chubby Zhu!

171
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:08,662
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,402
No! I...

173
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:21,422
Ke Qin, I didn't mean to, really.

174
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:24,350
Go home now. Orange will come to visit me soon.

175
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,562
You said you were hungry, right?

176
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:28,802
How about I go to your home and cook dinner for you?

177
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:33,262
Did I offend you before so you came to get back at me now?

178
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:35,382
I'm sorry. I apologize.

179
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:37,602
No, Ke Qin, don't do that.

180
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:40,522
Then why do you keep trying to pursue me? You are pestering me.

181
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,902
We didn't have any conflicts at school, did we?

182
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:46,322
You got me wrong. I'm not here for revenge but out of gratitude.

183
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:48,962
Gratitude? Fine. Choose another way, okay?

184
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:50,662
Let's become sworn siblings. You can take me as your elder sister.

185
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,642
No, no, no. I'm also okay with being your younger sister.

186
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:53,862
No, no, no!

187
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:56,522
I don't want you to be my sister. I want you to be my girlfriend!

188
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:58,742
Please! Just leave me alone!

189
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:00,362
Don't you think I'm miserable enough?

190
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,442
Please! I've wished for many years to be with you!

191
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,262
You're not my cup of tea.

192
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,042
I'm destined to hurt you.

193
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,162
Please, I can even kowtow to you, Brother Chubby!

194
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:10,822
But how do you know it before you try it?

195
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,082
Please, give me a chance!

196
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,882
- Leave me alone, please! 
 - Please!

197
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,782
- Please! 
 - You...

198
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:18,742
Are you performing the wedding ceremony?

199
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:21,662
No, no, no. It's a mistake.

200
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,382
Orange, let's go upstairs.

201
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:32,122
Xu Duo Cheng is going to have dinner with us?

202
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:37,222
Right now, at once, immediately, get lost!

203
00:13:57,902 --> 00:14:01,002
Hello, Jiang Nan? Your wife took my wife away!

204
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:02,982
 My dinner plan is ruined!

205
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:05,862
Your wife? You've got a thicker skin, don't you?

206
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:06,982
 Cut the crap.

207
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,282
Where are you?

208
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,602
 At home.

209
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:12,102
Wait for me. I'll meet you there soon.

210
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,022
Dinner is ready!

211
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,222
I'll start!

212
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:24,522
Go ahead.

213
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:28,402
Yummy!

214
00:14:30,382 --> 00:14:34,302
Ke Qin, I have to say, Chubby Zhu's so nice to you.

215
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:36,682
Maybe you could try dating him?

216
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,622
How can you tell he's nice to me?

217
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,182
Tell me. What did you do in Jingcheng?

218
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,142
I've heard the female lead of the MV is now you.

219
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,742
What happened?

220
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:51,642
Actually, I don't know much about what happened, either.

221
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,282
All I know is that the original actress had to be absent due to some emergency,

222
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,162
so I was asked to act as Plan B.

223
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:03,122
I have to say, maybe Jiang Nan planned it.

224
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:07,342
Maybe he really fell in love with you and specially prepared the surprise for you?

225
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:09,502
Impossible.

226
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:13,222
It was just an accident but indeed thrilling.

227
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:16,282
Come on, don't keep me guessing. Continue.

228
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:20,162
That day, because...

229
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,942
Next time before you come in, remember to ring the doorbell.

230
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:40,162
Don't you know I'm not the only one living here now?

231
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,902
You're also bad to me.

232
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:44,822
Am I that annoying?

233
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,622
You got dumped?

234
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:52,682
I did everything I could but she still refused to be my girlfriend.

235
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,422
Why are you smirking?

236
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,502
Here comes your helper.

237
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:03,122
- Zhu Lin Feng. 
 - Lord Bao!

238
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:04,702
Long time no see.

239
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,582
You two reminded me.

240
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,602
It's time to change the password.

241
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,422
You are so grumpy.

242
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:17,462
What's wrong with him?

243
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:19,062
He got dumped.

244
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,542
Now his mind is lost.

245
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:26,242
Lord Bao, my muse isn't into me and told me to go away!

246
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:28,842
She even told me to go toward the Pacific Ocean.

247
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:31,602
I don't want to live any longer.

248
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,062
I have no experience, either.

249
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:35,322
Lord Bao!

250
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:38,882
Well, just do as she asked you to, right?

251
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:41,482
Why don't you stand up first?

252
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:42,982
Stand up.

253
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:47,542
Listen, just stay away from her.

254
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:50,062
Leave her alone for some time and don't get in touch.

255
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:53,102
After a period, she'll realize,

256
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:58,102
"I didn't only lose a man but my spiritual support!"

257
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,342
- Really? 
 - Of course.

258
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:03,782
You've made so many attempts. Why not have your last one?

259
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:08,322
- It makes sense. 
 - Of course.

260
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:11,681
Wait, haven't you always been single?

261
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,402
Why are you so experienced?

262
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:18,142
Watch some idol dramas and you'll know everything, right?

263
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:22,042
- Which drama? 
 - Which drama?

264
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,662
That's basically what happened.

265
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:31,482
It's just been a few days and so much happened?

266
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,482
The hero saved the beauty.

267
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:35,422
You had a romantic getaway together,

268
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,482
and you went to hell and back together.

269
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,535
Tell me the truth.

270
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:42,675
During the MV filming, did you need to...

271
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,822
kiss?

272
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,582
So you did?

273
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:57,262
My goodness, what exactly happens in the MV? I'm looking forward to it!

274
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:59,522
Jiang Nan and I were only acting,

275
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,602
and the kissing scene was in a play-within-a-play.

276
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:02,742
It wasn't real.

277
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:06,342
That doesn't matter. What matters is your feeling.

278
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:13,042
When Jiang Nan kissed you, did you feel anything special?

279
00:18:21,482 --> 00:18:23,142
I couldn't tell.

280
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:25,782
I hadn't kissed anyone else.

281
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,082
Oh, my God!

282
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:31,882
Why are all of my friends so innocent in romance?

283
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,182
I'm lost for words.

284
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:40,102
You have experience in this, right?

285
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:44,862
Can you tell me what a passionate kiss is like?

286
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:47,962
Surely, it's...

287
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:56,222
Not for kids. Let's drop it.

288
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,822
It's so salty.

289
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:03,222
If you don't like it, I'll eat it.

290
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:05,122
Isn't it delicious?

291
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,942
- I'm starving. 
 - This tofu isn't as good as Xu Duo Cheng's.

292
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,382
Good enough for me.

293
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:20,222
Don't mind him. I'm telling you, he's got so picky about food because of Xu Duo Cheng's recipes.

294
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,442
I'm here to seek comfort, not torture.

295
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:28,542
By the way, Lao Jiang, when are you going to confess your love to Xu Duo Cheng?

296
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,682
Confess?

297
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:34,182
She agreed to date you when you never confessed?

298
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,562
Bro, are you having hearing problems?

299
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:38,262
I'm talking about a proposal.

300
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:39,402
Proposal?

301
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,602
You move so fast.

302
00:19:41,602 --> 00:19:43,562
Teach me some time, will you?

303
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,402
Well, bro, hurry to eat.

304
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,600
Let's finish and go home.

305
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,900
No. I don't want to be alone.

306
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,242
You'll also be alone at home, right?

307
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,062
Let's continue watching the unfinished horror film.

308
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:58,802
Good idea.

309
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,322
Enjoy yourselves. I have to go to the nursing home first.

310
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,762
See you.

311
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,502
You...

312
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,482
Why is it you again?

313
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:24,802
I'm here specially for you.

314
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:27,662
So you have nothing to do every day?

315
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,662
Let me treat you to lunch to celebrate your official return to work.

316
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:36,902
No, thanks. Brother Chubby, you're still young.

317
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,302
Can you do anything meaningful?

318
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:42,382
Don't waste your time on me anymore. That's all.

319
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:43,742
I know you don't like me.

320
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,062
- I won't come to you again. 
 - No, please...

321
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,422
What did you say?

322
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,322
Did I get it wrong?

323
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:55,522
Sorry. Happiness came so suddenly before I knew it.

324
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,782
You heard it right.

325
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,082
I'm here because I want to talk it out face to face.

326
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:06,662
I know I'm silly and stupid, and not good enough for you,

327
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:09,282
but I'm always trying my best.

328
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:10,722
Indeed.

329
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:13,282
Everyone has the right to be into someone.

330
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:15,942
Now the right is yours.

331
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:21,762
I don't want to, but as long as it's what you want, I'll do it.

332
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,722
I hope you can fall in love with someone,

333
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:29,102
who loves you as much as I do.

334
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,782
Take care.

335
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:45,342
 Lord Bao, your method has to work, please!

336
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,442
Lao Jiang, don't tell me you're going to propose like this.

337
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:59,102
You know, I'm really doing a quite hard and heartbreaking job.

338
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:02,802
Since early in the morning, I've had to be a third wheel.

339
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:06,522
Do you know we singles should be protected?

340
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,622
PDA is pretty cruel,

341
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,422
and don't forget we're getting busier.

342
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:15,782
I need to go check the post-production later.

343
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,422
I'm getting older.

344
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:20,462
Can you be more considerate?

345
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,662
Why are you here?

346
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:52,662
For you.

347
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,922
How's it going?

348
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:55,362
Is everything okay?

349
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:57,382
I sent you messages on WeChat but you never replied.

350
00:22:57,382 --> 00:22:59,362
I lost my phone some time ago.

351
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,362
You lost your phone?

352
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:03,682
I was so worried about you, you know?

353
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,462
What do you have to worry about?

354
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:08,262
And what could happen to me with Jiang Nan around?

355
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,122
Let's go. I'll send you back.

356
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,760

357
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,342
Lin Yao Yin?

358
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:23,082
Yes.

359
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:26,602
As compensation, this... give it to me.

360
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:29,222
But I had a hard time getting it!

361
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:32,382
Precisely because of that, it's precious enough to be a gift for me.

362
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:33,622
- No way! 
 - Right?

363
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,262
- Thank you for the gift. 
 - Give it back to me!

364
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:36,922
Give it back!

365
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:38,682
Stop! You...

366
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:40,582
Give it back to me!

367
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,762
Give it back!

368
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,082
 Lin Yao Yin?

369
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,722
 You really like Lin Yao Yin so much?

370
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,722
 Of course.

371
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,262
 I never expected to come across this out-of-print CD here.

372
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:17,102
 How lucky I am!

373
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,862
 Give it back!

374
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:20,562
 Give it back to me!

375
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:31,962
Lao Jiang, the post-production of the MV is done.

376
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:33,762
Any comments?

377
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,982
It's up to you.

378
00:24:38,982 --> 00:24:40,262
Okay,

379
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,562
but don't make other changes later.

380
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,142
I won't.

381
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,240
Seems that you've been somehow love-stricken, lovesick, and lovelorn.

382
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,940
Can you stop being insane?

383
00:24:55,942 --> 00:25:00,782
Xiao Du told me everything about your MV filming days.

384
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,022
What did he say?

385
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:07,042
He said Xu Duo Cheng and you stayed together in the hotel,

386
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:10,142
acted together, hung out together hand in hand,

387
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,882
and visited the Huxin Islet together and...

388
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:13,382
And what?

389
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:17,002
Took a night walk, for the whole night.

390
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:18,142
Perfect.

391
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,002
Bao Rui, can you go wash your brain?

392
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,882
Tell me, then. When you saw Xu Duo Cheng and Zhan Zhi Lin together,

393
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:26,062
why were you as mad as a wet hen?

394
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:28,082
I was just worried Xu Duo Cheng would suffer.

395
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:29,982
She has never dated anyone nor has any related experience.

396
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:32,462
How can she deal with Zhan Zhi Lin and his tricks?

397
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:34,230
Right.

398
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:39,802
But even if Xu Duo Cheng is tempted by Zhan Zhi Lin, what does it have to do with us?

399
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:42,902
You're not a real couple anyway.

400
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:46,802
I'm just... I'm just being responsible.

401
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:51,042
Lao Jiang, why not just admit you're jealous?

402
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:54,422
- I... 
 - Not only are you jealous but also anxious.

403
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:57,402
Anxious about what?

404
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:00,302
Fine. Now, listen to me.

405
00:26:00,302 --> 00:26:02,222
Take the initiative.

406
00:26:02,222 --> 00:26:06,282
Or else, if Xu Duo Cheng falls in love with Zhan Zhi Lin, you'll regret it.

407
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,682
Brother, long time no see.

408
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,902
Xu Duo Cheng is a nice girl.

409
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:49,202
Don't get her involved,

410
00:26:49,202 --> 00:26:52,262
and don't you dare hurt her.

411
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,342
Everyone loves a nice girl.

412
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,882
You can love her and I can't?

413
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,862
I'm warning you, never approach Xu Duo Cheng.

414
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:04,002
If you feel resentful, come at me!

415
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,222
Your mother can approach my father but I can't approach Xu Duo Cheng?

416
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,202
Fine.

417
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,622
Good timing. I haven't had a fight for a long time.

418
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:21,322
Bring it on!

419
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:32,862
Stop, you two!

420
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,030
Stop! Stop!

421
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,602
Jiang Nan, are you okay?

422
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:46,262
What were you doing?

423
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:48,282
You're not my father!

424
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:17,582
Lao Jiang?

425
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:21,502
What's going on here?

426
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:23,922
You're a celebrity. Your face is your business card.

427
00:28:23,922 --> 00:28:25,462
Let me see. Let me check!

428
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:27,502
I'll stay at your home tonight.

429
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,282
I said, "I'll stay at your home tonight."

430
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:32,402
And, tell Xu Duo Cheng I suddenly had to go on a business trip for a week.

431
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:34,762
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

432
00:28:37,222 --> 00:28:39,162
I'll get you the ointment.

433
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:57,522
 Jiang Nan is on a sudden business trip and will come back in a few days.

434
00:28:57,522 --> 00:29:00,042
 Don't worry. You can do whatever you want.

435
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:03,602
 Business trip?

436
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,010

437
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,682
â™«  I dreamt of sailing alone  â™«

438
00:29:19,682 --> 00:29:24,014
â™«  Every day and night, under the starry sky  â™«

439
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:28,340
â™«  I dream of drifting in the vast ocean alone  â™«

440
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,545
â™«  My eyes become bloodshot and my lips are parched  â™«

441
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,440
â™«  I see an island, perhaps it is not far  â™«

442
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,766

443
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:52,620

444
00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:00,770
â™«  Covered by flowers and its fragrance  â™«

445
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:15,850
â™«  I see an island, I sail toward you  â™«

446
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:24,440
â™«  I see an island, I swim toward you  â™«

447
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,990
â™«  I see an island  â™«

448
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,790
â™«  I run to you; I see you  â™«

449
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:47,702
 Why are you silent?

450
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:49,942
 What should I say?

451
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:52,622
 It's been only half a day and you lost your phone

452
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:54,622
 and got soaked.

453
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,402
 You're really a troublemaker.

454
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:58,062
 Don't criticize me anymore.

455
00:30:58,062 --> 00:30:59,842
 I've already had a bad day.

456
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:06,826
â™«  Every day and night, under the starry sky  â™«

457
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:11,052
â™«  I dream of drifting in the vast ocean alone  â™«

458
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:17,557
â™«  My eyes become bloodshot and my lips are parched  â™«

459
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:32,202
 Now, listen to me.

460
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:34,262
 Take the initiative.

461
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:37,982
 Or else, if Xu Duo Cheng falls in love with Zhan Zhi Lin, you'll regret it.

462
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:44,782
I'll go back tonight.

463
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:47,522
I'm dying for the cola chicken wings you cook.

464
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,860

465
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:52,262
 Aren't you on a business trip?

466
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:56,802
 I settled the matter. I'll be back soon.

467
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:10,662
Hello, do you have a membership?

468
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,982
Yes.

469
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:15,242
151-6089.

470
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:22,182
Hello?

471
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:23,702
Xu Duo Cheng, where are you?

472
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:25,222
I'm shopping in the supermarket.

473
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,702
 The one near our home?

474
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:29,862
- Yes. 
 - Wait for me there. I'll go pick you up.

475
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,462
What happened to your lips?

476
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:41,682
I told you. I collided with a wall. 
  (T/N: Double meaning, "a cockroach did this")

477
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,702
What exactly happened to your lips?

478
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:49,322
A cockroach caused this. Believe me.

479
00:32:49,322 --> 00:32:51,162
Cockroach?

480
00:32:53,942 --> 00:32:56,442
Why's he so weird today?

481
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:01,102
Take a break.

482
00:33:01,702 --> 00:33:03,282
- I'm good. 
 - Let me do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

483
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:06,262
- I'll do it. 
 - I'll do it. Get out of here.

484
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,642
Why are you blushing?

485
00:33:35,382 --> 00:33:37,802
I-I-I'm not blushing.

486
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:41,622
It's too hot. Well, leave me alone. I can handle this.

487
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:43,322
No.

488
00:33:43,382 --> 00:33:46,242
If you play some sort of trick,

489
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:49,542
I'll become a pig to slaughter at your mercy.

490
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,922
How can I do anything?

491
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:52,882
What the hell is going on in your head?

492
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:55,182
Who knows?

493
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:01,822
If you don't leave here, you won't get anything to eat.

494
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,122
Okay.

495
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,822
Stew the chicken wings for a while longer!

496
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:28,721
Seems that these days, you're not as good at cooking as before.

497
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:31,181
From now on, you should practice cooking more to raise your skill level.

498
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:35,222
They say women are complicated and unpredictable,

499
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:38,282
but in our family, you're the complicated and unpredictable one.

500
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:41,242
One moment you hate my recipes and say the food is too bland,

501
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:43,982
and now you're wolfing down the food.

502
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,641
What did you say?

503
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:48,181
"Bland diet?"

504
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:49,542
Not that.

505
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,342
"Wolf down the food?"

506
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:53,322
You said, "Our family."

507
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:56,001
These two words are just right.

508
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,701
Thumbs-up.

509
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:03,202
I have to say, the food is too salty.

510
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:05,522
You must practice more.

511
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:12,142
 Orange, Dad is here!

512
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,642
 Open the door.

513
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:16,962
- What's wrong? 
 - My dad's at the door!

514
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:27,950

515
00:35:33,317 --> 00:35:39,857
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

516
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:46,271
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

517
00:35:47,658 --> 00:35:54,268
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

518
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:59,855
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

519
00:35:59,855 --> 00:36:03,401
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

520
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:07,481
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

521
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:13,834
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

522
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:17,394
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

523
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:19,167
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

524
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,467
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

525
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:24,381
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

526
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:28,369
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

527
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,686
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

528
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:35,554
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

529
00:36:35,554 --> 00:36:39,940
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

530
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,689
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

531
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:46,080
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

532
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,114
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

533
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:53,048
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

534
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:57,047
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

535
00:36:57,047 --> 00:37:00,390
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

536
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,452
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

537
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:08,667
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

538
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:15,215
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

539
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,968
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

540
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:37,048
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

541
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:43,495
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

542
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,886
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

543
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:51,020
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

544
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,854
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

545
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,853
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

546
00:37:57,853 --> 00:38:01,196
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

547
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:05,258
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

548
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:09,373
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

549
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:15,562
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
