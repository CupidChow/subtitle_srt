1
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
Where is this place?

2
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,720
My home,

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,880
your home,

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,320
I bought it many years ago,

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,040
and now I bring you here to relax.

6
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,039
Don't worry.

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,240
Aunt Fen is at home.

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,160
Aunt Fen has been taking care of me since I was four years old.

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,440
What about now?

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,920
Take care of the house for me.

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,480
Aunt Fen,

12
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Lin,

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
I was counting the days yesterday.

14
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
I thought it's time for you to come.

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
Who is this lady?

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,880
This is my friend.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,640
Many Aunties

18
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,320
Cheng Fen are good,

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,720
It's so pretty.

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Aunt Fen,

21
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,800
Lin was able to bring her here.

22
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
He's not an ordinary person.

23
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,200
The room is ready.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,000
What do you need?

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,280
Just tell Aunt Fen.

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,760
Let's go.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,520
Hurry up

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,560
Come in.

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,120
Everything is ready.

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,920
What about you,

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Chengcheng?

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,720
You're welcome.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
Just feel like you're at home.

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,920
When the meal is ready,

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll ask Lin to call you.

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,960
Thank you, Aunt Fen.

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,200
All right, Aunt Fen,

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,760
now you're taking one bite at a time,

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
You treat her better than me.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,120
I'm jealous.

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,440
Kid,

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,920
don't listen to him.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Sit down and rest for a while.

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,600
See you later.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
Look,

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
no matter how beautiful my fireworks are,

47
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
There was only a brief moment.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,320
Since it can't last long,

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,200
it's better not to give people hope.

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
So I made the right decision.

51
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,960
Right?

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,160
Why are you smiling at me?

53
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,400
He cooked this dish.

54
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,760
You know how to cook?

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,200
This dish is my favorite dish.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
My mom taught me to make it.

57
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,400
You're lucky today,

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,920
I haven't had this dish cooked by him for a long time.

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,880
There's soup?

60
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,040
Wait a minute.

61
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,480
Aunt Fen

62
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,160
is so nice.

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,680
Eat more.

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong with your hand?

65
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay. It's just

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
that

67
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,920
I've been feeling weak lately,

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,760
It won't affect your normal life.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Now that you're like this,

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,960
don't you think about telling your family?

71
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,560
It will be hard

72
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,200
in the future.

73
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,000
So what if I tell you?

74
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
Watching everyone

75
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
spend all their savings in the family,

76
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,480
Then he borrowed money for me everywhere.

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
And even if I tell you,

78
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
the result will be the same.

79
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,040
Wouldn't it be better to have less time

80
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,320
for everyone to be sad?

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not about the length of time.

82
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,160
You don't need to go through the process,

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
so the pain will be less.

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,120
Am I right?

85
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,280
I hope that

86
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,000
the person I love,

87
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Don't feel sad because of me.

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,120
Have some shrimp.

89
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,040
Zhu Xiaopang,

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,040
I stayed up all night for two days,

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
You disturbed me as soon as I had a sweet dream.

92
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,920
What do you want to do?

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
Did you dream about me?

94
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,240
Just say it.

95
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.

96
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
No, no, don't hang up.

97
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,120
Here's the thing.

98
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,400
Many oranges

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,280
left with Zhan Zhilin. What?

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
What on earth happened?

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
Tell me now.

102
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Jiang Nan was waiting for a lot of oranges downstairs,

103
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,680
but when he saw Zhan Zhilin's car turn around and leave,

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,920
I didn't catch up. I lost him. I called Cheng a lot

105
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,080
and didn't answer his calls.

106
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,440
I don't know if a lot of Cheng'an is safe now.

107
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,440
Okay, I got it.

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,640
I'll call Orange,

109
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Okay,

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,560
I'll wait for your news.

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,200
Okay,

112
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,160
What do you mean?

113
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,920
Wait.

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
You too.

115
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,840
I need to answer a phone call.

116
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,760
Hello, Keqin,

117
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,600
what's going on between you and Zhan Zhilin in Jiangnan?

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Where are you?

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,720
When are you coming back?

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,240
I won't go back tonight.

121
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
It's a bit complicated.

122
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,280
My heart is a little confused.

123
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
I won't talk to you anymore.

124
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Tell me honestly.

125
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Are you with Zhan Zhilin?

126
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
Where did he take you?

127
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,600
It's okay.

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
Don't worry.

129
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,960
If you really don't want to say it, just don't say it.

130
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,240
How about this,

131
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,240
you take a selfie of me every hour,

132
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,720
I want to make sure you're safe.

133
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,240
Okay.

134
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,680
Well,

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
how can I buy

136
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,000
only one earring?

137
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,440
Keqin,

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,520
what's going on?

139
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,040
Did Chengcheng tell you where she went?

140
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
She refused to tell me.

141
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,360
Just say you're tired.

142
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,280
But judging from her condition, she should be fine.

143
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
That won't do.

144
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,120
She's with Zhan Zhilin.

145
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,960
She refused to tell me.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,120
What can I do?

147
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,920
But I asked her to send me

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,160
a selfie every hour,

149
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,800
At least I can make sure she's safe.

150
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,920
Has she sent it to you now?

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,960
Can you forward it to me?

152
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay.

153
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's wait for the next hour's photo.

154
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
These are

155
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,720
two portraits

156
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,040
that my mom asked someone to draw many years ago,

157
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,080
One is in my room,

158
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,560
and the other is here.

159
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
I used to laugh at her girlish heart,

160
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
but unexpectedly,

161
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,400
Now I can only look at these two paintings to miss her.

162
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,080
When you fought with Jiang Nan last time,

163
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,880
I heard something about her.

164
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
Since you have nothing to do with Jiang Nan,

165
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,920
I'm telling you these things,

166
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,320
maybe

167
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
It can make you forget him faster.

168
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,680
My dad had an affair

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,200
with Jiang Nan's mom,

170
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,040
Ironically,

171
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,640
Jiang Nan knew all this,

172
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,960
But he was trying to protect his mother.

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
He didn't mention a word to me.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,280
I was the last aunt

175
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,760
and your dad to know,

176
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,280
My mom and her mom are best friends,

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
do you know how my mom died?

178
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
It's because she can't get through this.

179
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,480
That's why he committed suicide by jumping off the building.

180
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
Now you know

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,320
how Jiang Nan's mother went crazy.

182
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,400
If I had known earlier,

183
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
why would my mom be so upset?

184
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,000
Maybe she wouldn't have died.

185
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
I'm sorry

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,480
for bringing up your sadness.

187
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,320
I meant it when I said I didn't want to hear your apology.

188
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
I want to take care of you seriously.

189
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
When I say I like you,

190
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
I mean it.

191
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,280
I admit,

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,800
when I first got close to you,

193
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,720
It was because I was angry with Jiang Nan,

194
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
but then I found out,

195
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
You're different from other girls.

196
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,760
Do you still remember the flower sea I took you to?

197
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,760
That was the happiest time

198
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,360
in my life.

199
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
Snacks are ready.

200
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
Come down and eat.

201
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,080
Many oranges.

202
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
I just want you to be happy.

203
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,800
If he can't do it,

204
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,240
I'll do it.

205
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,680
Zhu Linfeng,

206
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,200
turn on your phone,

207
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,160
Isn't it in your phone?

208
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,000
I know where this is.

209
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,240
It's Zhan Zhilin's villa in the mountains.

210
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,240
Well,

211
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,160
how can you tell that it's Zhan Zhilin's family?

212
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,640
This wallpaper

213
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,440
is the guest bedroom on the second floor of their villa.

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,040
When I was decorating,

215
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,240
Auntie asked me to choose it with Zhan Zhilin.

216
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,600
That's fine.

217
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,920
Formose Kang,

218
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:56,960
Chengcheng,

219
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,760
I finally found you.

220
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,600
We're out of gas.

221
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,800
Luckily,

222
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,520
many oranges are coming soon,

223
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,120
Many Aunties

224
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,760
Chengfen.

225
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,520
Where is Miss Xu?

226
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,760
Did she go out so early?

227
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,920
She just asked me to get water and take medicine.

228
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,360
She didn't take her medicine.

229
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,120
Where did he go?

230
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,600
Chengcheng,

231
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
why did you come here?

232
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,840
You clearly have me in your heart,

233
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
why did you lie to me?

234
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,560
You promised me that night.

235
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,200
will always be by my side.

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,320
You can't break your promise.

237
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,440
That night,

238
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,400
I saw that you were drunk.

239
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,720
I'm so sad.

240
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm just comforting you.

241
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,920
If you want to comfort me,

242
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,080
what is this?

243
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,880
Why did you kiss me?

244
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,280
Me

245
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,040
You still want to deny it?

246
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,760
Why did you run away from me?

247
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,600
I've never liked you.

248
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,000
Never.

249
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,520
What are you doing?

250
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,920
Isn't your tears enough to show that you like me?

251
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,000
You're hiding something, aren't you?

252
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,040
That kiss is nothing.

253
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,040
Don't come to me again.

254
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,560
Don't come to me again.

255
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,600
Many oranges,

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
I haven't finished yet.

257
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,600
You can't leave.

258
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,560
I've said everything I need to say.

259
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,520
Why are you avoiding me?

260
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,480
Tell me a reason.

261
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,240
Why?

262
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
Jiang Nan, are you still a man?

263
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,400
Didn't you say many oranges?

264
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,280
I don't want to see you again.

265
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,080
You're still pestering her.

266
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,400
This is between us.

267
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
What does it have to do with you?

268
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,800
Zhan Zhilin.

269
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,840
Chengcheng.

270
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,920
Chengcheng,

271
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,880
Chengcheng.

272
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,600
Chengcheng.

273
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,120
Thank you.

274
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,000
You're welcome.

275
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,200
Which room is Director Zhang in?

276
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,920
Nurse,

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,800
may I ask,

278
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,400
Which department should I go to?

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,760
-At the end over there. -Okay. Thank

280
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,720
you.

281
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,320
You're welcome,

282
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,240
sister.

283
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,160
Are you okay?

284
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,360
Why are you so careless?

285
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,600
Sister is fine.

286
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,520
I just fell down accidentally.

287
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,520
It'll be fine soon.

288
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,000
Sister, look.

289
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,600
So cute.

290
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,640
Dad took Pudding for a walk.

291
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,440
Let's play with pudding next time.

292
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,160
Okay?

293
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,960
Okay.

294
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,840
You named it Pudding.

295
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,320
It's so nice.

296
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,480
Mom didn't allow me to have a dog before.

297
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,240
But Pudding is a good boy.

298
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,720
Now I like it, too.

299
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,640
Where's Mom?

300
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,840
I want to take care of you wholeheartedly.

301
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm afraid I don't have time to take care of the puppy.

302
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,800
No,

303
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,520
when I wasn't sick before,

304
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
My mom doesn't allow me to have a dog.

305
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,560
She said a puppy can only live for more than ten years,

306
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,720
and it will be very sad if the puppy dies.

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,640
It's better not to raise it.

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
I don't think what I said is right.

309
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Chengcheng,

310
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
let me tell you a secret.

311
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,480
What?

312
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,560
I heard my dad talking to Dr. Sui.

313
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,760
They said I only have ten more years to live.

314
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,320
Don't talk nonsense.

315
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,800
You must have misheard me.

316
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,240
I heard it right.

317
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,080
If I live for ten years,

318
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
my parents will love me as well.

319
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,480
If pudding lives for ten years,

320
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,720
I'll love it too.

321
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,840
Why do you care how many years you can live?

322
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,600
I saw on the show that

323
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,520
some trees have lived for hundreds of years,

324
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,200
Some trees even lived for 1000 years.

325
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
Is that really that long?

326
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,640
Yes,

327
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,920
there are thousand-year-old trees,

328
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,480
Does the tree think that

329
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,000
people who live to be 100 years old

330
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,520
also live a short life?

331
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,160
I guess so.

332
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:23,960
Chengcheng

333
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,520
I've warmed up the porridge.

334
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,720
You'll feel better later.

335
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,440
Just one bite.

336
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,000
Okay,

337
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,440
Doudou,

338
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,680
we're going back to take medicine.

339
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,680
I'll hang out

340
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
with Chengcheng

341
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,480
some other day. Bye.

342
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,080
Bye.

343
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,800
gradual freezing is irreversible.

344
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
The damaged muscles and neurons

345
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,640
will only get worse.

346
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,240
Moreover,

347
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
with the current medical treatment,

348
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,720
It can only be delayed.

349
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,600
It can't be cured.

350
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,360
It's like a sudden fall.

351
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,560
Is it a disease?

352
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes.

353
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,160
At first, there will be muscle weakness

354
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
or convulsions.

355
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,680
What's wrong with you?

356
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,440
Heavenly Maid Scattered Flowers.

357
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,280
Fragments are safe.

358
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,040
Wipe it.

359
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,840
What are you doing?

360
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,520
What is this?

361
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,600
This is a health care instrument.

362
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,760
Why do you use

363
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,440
this thing?

364
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,640
Who will help us play the piano?

365
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,200
Your fingers become more flexible.

366
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,080
Many oranges,

367
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,480
you started paying IQ tax at such a young age,

368
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,360
Security guard,

369
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,120
look if you don't believe me.

370
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,120
What happened to your medicine?

371
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,800
Isn't it normal for a health girl like me

372
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,080
to carry a medicine bottle with her?

373
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,040
Do you think everything is easy?

374
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
For me,

375
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
it's hard enough to live.

376
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,680
You don't understand at all.

377
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,200
I missed today's concert.

378
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,240
I might never get another chance.

379
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,560
Generally speaking,

380
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,000
from the onset of the disease to being completely bedridden,

381
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,240
It will take about two to three years.

382
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,080
And this process is gradual.

383
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,480
What about you?

384
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,840
Be mentally prepared.

385
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,280
One more thing,

386
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,680
you must protect her well in your life.

387
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,280
Be very careful not to let her fall.

388
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,880
Zhan Zhilin,

389
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,200
you knew many oranges were sick, didn't you?

390
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Why didn't you tell me about your girlfriend

391
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,800
and you wouldn't ask her yourself?

392
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Why did she tell me?

393
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,280
That's because she believes in me.

394
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,080
Do you understand?

395
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,840
Brother,

396
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
what are you doing?

397
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,560
Let's chat.

398
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,520
What are you doing, Jiang Nan?

399
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,760
You said it first last time,

400
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,320
but this time it's my turn to say it first.

401
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
What I want to tell you is,

402
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
I got it.

403
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
Your illness is the same as Doudou's.

404
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,160
But I know what I want.

405
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,520
Chengcheng,

406
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,320
I like you.

407
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,760
You like me.

408
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's enough.

409
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,880
I believe I can take good care of you.

410
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
Can you give me a chance?

411
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,400
Don't run away again.

412
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,960
Okay?

413
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,520
I don't want to drag you down.

414
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
You're so silly.

415
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,160
Do you know how worried and scared I am?

416
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,840
You shouldn't be responsible for these things.

417
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,880
And you shouldn't face it.

418
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
So you have to bear it yourself.

419
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,640
You didn't tell me when you were sick.

420
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Even if you like me, you won't admit it.

421
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,560
If you don't dare to face it and run away,

422
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,640
who do you think I am?

423
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,840
What do you want me to do?

424
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,520
What can I do?

425
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,160
It's hard for me to see you every day.

426
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,080
But you keep

427
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,880
appearing in my world.

428
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,280
What do you want me to do?

429
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,720
What do you want me to do?

430
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,240
All right, stop crying.

431
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,520
It's my fault.

432
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
I was too anxious.

433
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
I shouldn't blame you.

434
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,640
Chengcheng,

435
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,680
what happened in the past,

436
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Let it go.

437
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,600
In the future,

438
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,000
let's face it together.

439
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,080
Okay?

440
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,920
You can't go back on your word if you agree.

441
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,560
By the way,

442
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
how did you find the mountain villa?

443
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,800
Haven't I untied our location?

444
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,040
God has his own good plan,

445
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,800
don't you think so?

446
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,520
Where's your phone?

447
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,240
Rebind it

448
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,480
for me,

449
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,920
That's more like it.

450
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,440
Then tell me.

451
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,960
How did you find me?

452
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,160
Didn't you send Yu Keqin a photo?

453
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
Based on the background in the photo,

454
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,440
it should be the bedroom on the second floor of Zhan Zhilin's house.

455
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,400
I bought the wallpaper with him,

456
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,200
before you and Zhan Zhilin,

457
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,640
That's great.

458
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,840
I can tell that

459
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,360
you both care about each other.

460
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,080
It's because I care too much.

461
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,960
That's why he hates me so much.

462
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,600
He was very concerned about his mother's death,

463
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,120
he said,

464
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,760
What did you know in advance?

465
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,320
Is there any misunderstanding?

466
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,360
No,

467
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
there's no misunderstanding.

468
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,880
What he saw was too one-sided.

469
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
It's not what he thinks.

470
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,000
Did Zhan Zhilin say something to you?

471
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,160
No.

472
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,040
Anyway,

473
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
the problem between us can't be solved,

474
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,000
The most important thing for you right now,

475
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,120
is to take good care of yourself.

476
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
You're in good shape.

477
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,840
It's different to be taken care of.

478
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Dr. Sui, don't make fun of me.

479
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,760
Can I leave the hospital now?

480
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
I've read your examination report.

481
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,560
It's nothing serious.

482
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,200
You can get discharged today.

483
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
But remember,

484
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,280
after you go out,

485
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,000
This can't happen again.

486
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,080
All right,

487
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
I won't hold you up.

488
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,960
Remember to check on time.

489
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,040
Thank you, Dr. Sui.

490
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,400
Take good care of her.

491
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm going to go through the discharge formalities.

492
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,120
Otherwise,

493
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,320
Yu Keqin will know.

494
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,000
You had to come over and kill me.

495
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
In your eyes,

496
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,600
is Keqin so fierce?

497
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,320
Your bestie

498
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
is very good at fighting.

499
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,200
Mr. Liang,

500
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,880
Sit down.

501
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,400
It's been a long time.

502
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,160
You're getting more and more glamorous.

503
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,440
Look at what you said.

504
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,200
I'm so sorry to hear you say that.

505
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,560
Sir,

506
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,600
what would you like to drink?

507
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,280
Just like her.

508
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,600
Okay,

509
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll cut to the chase.

510
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,560
I'll do it.

511
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,200
I want to tell you a good news,

512
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,520
I bought the truth,

513
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,200
From now on,

514
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,840
the truth is the double-master establishment,

515
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,280
You're on an equal footing

516
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,320
with Qin Shan.

517
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
Are you telling the truth?

518
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,120
I never lie.

519
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,640
As long as you work hard,

520
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,840
your benefits will be indispensable.

521
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,240
Thank you for your appreciation,

522
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,080
Mr. Liang. Don't worry,

523
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll do my best.

524
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,200
I won't let you down.

525
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:03,960
Come on.

526
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,920
Take the medicine.

527
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,720
I

528
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,320
asked Rui to buy a lot of dishes,

529
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,720
Make your favorite later,

530
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,400
Okay,

531
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,040
Why are you two so troubled?

532
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,280
You always quarrel,

533
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,560
and go to the mountain to quarrel.

534
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,680
All right,

535
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,720
you're the only one who talks too much.

536
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,920
Since you entered the door,

537
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,840
look at how ungrateful you are.

538
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,360
You forgot me when you had Orange, right?

539
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,400
I even helped you to talk about it.

540
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,440
Where's the cool singer producer?

541
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,000
This variety show was so popular last year,

542
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,360
I followed it all the time.

543
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,400
Jiang Nan,

544
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,040
are you going to be on "Cool Sing Producers"?

545
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,360
I don't think so.

546
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,400
Jiang and Alex have different ideas,

547
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,440
but Alex is still

548
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,680
very interested in Jiang.

549
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,320
Right?

550
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,680
What idea?

551
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,120
Why don't you cooperate?

552
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,040
It's not a big problem.

553
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,640
When I talked to Alex last time,

554
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,160
I only talked about music creation,

555
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,320
He wants the dominant power.

556
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,520
He has something to do,

557
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,560
I'll talk to you next time.

558
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,760
He will back down.

559
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,800
Don't worry.

560
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,400
Right, Rui?

561
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,520
Yes,

562
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,040
Chengcheng,

563
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,160
I'll go wash the vegetables first.

564
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Let me give you a hand.

565
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,920
Why are you lying with your eyes open?

566
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,240
I'm serious.

567
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,480
When I'm done with the new song,

568
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,000
contact Alex for me,

569
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,480
But I think

570
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,840
Alex has a point.

571
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,800
After all, in the eyes of the public,

572
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,440
you are already a loving couple.

573
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,320
Hands free.

574
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,520
I don't want to consume my personal life

575
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,760
with Chengcheng too much,

576
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,280
also

577
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,960
Don't let Chengcheng worry about this.

578
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,560
Fine, fine. First place

579
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,840
for loving your wife,

580
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,640
But about this matter,

581
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,480
let's not delay it.

582
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,400
Maybe Keqin and Chubby are here.

583
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
I'll open the door.

584
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,320
It's impossible.

585
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,760
That devil wouldn't let them

586
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,960
get off work so early.

587
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,600
Why are you here?

588
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,840
I heard that you broke up with many oranges.

589
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,320
I'm here to comfort you.

590
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,720
Who told you that?

591
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
I know you are very sad right now.

592
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,040
But the best way to forget a relationship,

593
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,000
is to start the next one.

594
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,960
Why are you still here?

595
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,720
I don't know who told you that we broke up.

596
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,360
But you saw it with your own eyes.

597
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
The two of us are fine,

598
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,160
I sincerely advise you,

599
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,720
Find someone you like each other.

600
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,920
Stop fighting with me.

601
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,280
Didn't we have a deal?

602
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,480
You may leave now.

603
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,680
Hurry up.

604
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
Gu Jiayi, why are you here again? Come in. Come in.

605
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,760
Orange,

606
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,720
don't leave without saying a word next time.

607
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,040
I've been worried for the whole night.

608
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,040
Yes.

609
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,720
Brother Nan said he would cook in person,

610
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,360
but we both came here hungry.

611
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,600
Cut the crap!

612
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
-Come and help me. -Okay, I'm

613
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,400
coming.

614
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,320
Are you all right?

615
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,480
Cheers!

616
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,920
Since when do you know how to cook so many dishes?

617
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,680
And they're all my favorites.

618
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,600
Me,

619
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
You're so talented,

620
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,480
you'll find more surprises in the future.

621
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,680
Don't eat it if you don't believe me.

622
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,480
I can wipe out all the delicious food

623
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,280
on my own.

624
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:34,920
Believe it,

625
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,800
I'll eat it. My ribs

626
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,640
are a little salty.

627
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,640
It's impossible.

628
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,120
According to the method my father-in-law taught me,

629
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,080
I practiced it five or six times,

630
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
I've never made any mistakes.

631
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:43,960
Let me try it.

632
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,120
Father-in-law smells

633
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,120
good. Father-in-law smells good.

634
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,160
Keqin,

635
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,800
this is delicious.

636
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,640
Try it.

637
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,720
If you like it,

638
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,000
I'll learn to cook it for you.

639
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,040
That's enough.

640
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,960
That's enough.

641
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,080
As long as you two are throwing sugar at me like crazy,

642
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,880
you should consider

643
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,440
how I feel as a single person.

644
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,160
A high-quality young man, Rui is still single.

645
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,560
Looks like I have to

646
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,800
take care of your whole life.

647
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,120
Why don't you change your career to be a matchmaker?

648
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,320
Stop it.

649
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,520
By the way,

650
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,639
why did you get off work so early today?

651
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,920
Sis Shan has been annoyed lately,

652
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
and she doesn't want to see me hanging around in front of her.

653
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,719
The group company sold the controlling power of the truth,

654
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,520
and the big boss also trained the assistant of Sister Shan herself,

655
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,840
Kiki helped him to the top

656
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,960
and became co-editor-in-chief with Shan,

657
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,840
The topic selection proposal can only be approved

658
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,000
if both editors agree.

659
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,800
That means Qin Shan has been given the power of separation.

660
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,199
She can endure it.

661
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,880
That's right.

662
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
Liang Zhe, the boss,

663
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,000
looks like a bad person.

664
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Liang Zhe,

665
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,679
it's the truth about Liang Zhe's acquisition.

666
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,440
Qin Shan is in big trouble now.

667
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,639
Before Qin Shan kept chasing Jiang,

668
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,800
I was really annoyed with her.

669
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,719
But this lady,

670
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,880
apart from being bad-tempered,

671
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,880
Your work efficiency is good,

672
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,840
and your principles are strong.

673
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,080
That's something to admire.

674
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,280
Since when do you know my sister so well?

675
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,120
We don't know each other.

676
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,120
All right,

677
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,520
