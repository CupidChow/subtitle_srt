1
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,400
What's wrong?

2
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,520
Mr. Zhan,

3
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm afraid the dinner you ordered won't work.

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,880
Family Fun is temporarily closed.

5
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Shut down.

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,720
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
Today,

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,200
Auntie,

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,000
aren't you the one who came to the exhibition that day?

10
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,160
Auntie,

11
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,160
I heard that Family Fun has closed down,

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,240
Come and see what happened.

13
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,440
Thank you.

14
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,000
Gu Jiayi came to our restaurant for dinner today,

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
but I don't know why.

16
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
When I was eating,

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,640
I suddenly became allergic.

18
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,000
It's serious.

19
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,560
So she was sent to the hospital.

20
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,800
We can only close the store now.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,960
When it opens, someone will make a scene.

22
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,480
Close it,

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
It's still clean.

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,960
Auntie,

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,640
what about Chengcheng?

26
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,360
Chengcheng sent Gu Jiayi to the hospital.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,720
I wonder how she is now.

28
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Zhan,

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Gu Jiayi,

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,640
Will it be hard for Chengcheng?

31
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,480
I don't think so.

32
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Does Jiang Nan know about this?

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,720
Jiang Nan didn't come today,

34
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,040
and I think

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,400
Jiang Nan is a public figure,

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,840
When something like this happens,

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,040
it's best not to involve him.

38
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,680
Sis,

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,320
You can do it today.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
You look so alike.

41
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,080
I was worried something would happen to you.

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,720
I know it in my heart.

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,360
I don't have to risk my life

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
for a lot of oranges

45
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,000
Right,

46
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Where are they?

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
He's still waiting outside.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,400
I guess

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
he's scared out of his wits.

50
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,600
Chengcheng

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
What's wrong with this allergy?

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,640
I don't know either.

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,839
I wrote down her taboos in the notes,

54
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,160
and confirmed them repeatedly when I served them.

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,760
I didn't put peanuts in my cooking.

56
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,160
Come in, all of you.

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Get your hair done.

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,280
Miss Gu,

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm sorry,

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,560
Although we still can't figure out

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,960
which part of the problem went wrong?

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,600
However,

63
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,160
it must have happened to you in our shop.

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,240
We will give you an explanation.

65
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,040
It's inevitable for people to make mistakes.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,920
Maybe your shop assistant didn't notice.

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
I'm paying attention.

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
I really didn't add any peanut butter at all,

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,480
Jiayi,

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,120
If it's really about our happy family,

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,560
we'll take full responsibility for it.

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,760
I will. I will.

73
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,400
What do you mean if?

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
Because of the food problem in your restaurant,

75
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,080
so many people have taken photos of it.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,280
You're still thinking of sophistry.

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,560
It's not that we want to argue.

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,480
But everything needs to be verified,

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,160
self-examination and self-correction,

80
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Do you want to drink three glasses of wine?

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,920
I think you're just a black shop.

82
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,360
If you hadn't used Jiang Nan as your signature,

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,920
who would have gone to a small restaurant like yours?

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,880
We haven't figured it out yet.

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,360
Don't blame me here.

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,600
Jiang Nan,

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,400
you're allergic to peanuts,

88
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,240
Do you remember,

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,080
since you know you're allergic to peanuts,

90
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Why didn't you pay attention to it?

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,640
I told you,

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Jiang Nan,

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280
My sister Jiayi was with you before,

94
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,480
but now she's like this because of your girlfriend,

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,840
Don't you feel bad or guilty at all?

96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Everyone caught the video on the internet,

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
Jiayi has long said that she can't eat peanuts,

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,120
It's because there's something wrong

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,800
with many orange dishes.

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,080
She is jealous of my sister Jiayi.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,960
You.

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,360
Little girl,

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,120
this man is smooth and smooth,

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,440
Why are you so mean?

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,920
You.

106
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,600
Bitter,

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,320
can I be your father at my age?

108
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,200
Don't point at me, okay?

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Be polite.

110
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,120
The Fly House?

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,440
Why did you go to the Fly House?

112
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
Have you seen flies?

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
My nickname is flyswatter.

114
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,600
I only shoot flies. You

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,840
… You old man,

116
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,600
Why am I old?

117
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,560
You just called me "Old Man" after I said "Polite".

118
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm an old cook, you know?

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,320
You … You … Me

120
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,000
… What me?

121
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,040
Let me tell you,

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,280
what you said just now

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
has already constituted slander. You said

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
I could sue you.

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,480
I'll sue you,

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,200
Yes

127
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
The dishes are made by our restaurant.

128
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,400
You … But we don't know what allergens are,

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,160
right?

130
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,720
We really don't know the allergen?

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,600
What's wrong?

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Are you still trying to blackmail me?

133
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,840
What are you doing?

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
That's what everybody says on the internet,

135
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,040
Dad,

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,520
What about you?

137
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't waste your time with me.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Explain it to everyone.

139
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,640
That's enough.

140
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Now is not the time to argue for nothing.

141
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Anyway,

142
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
we'll find out about this matter.

143
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,120
Yes.

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,160
Not only do you find out?

145
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Don't worry. Miss Gu,

146
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,440
we'll take full responsibility

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,360
for the medical expenses and losses.

148
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't worry.

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
How can you bear it?

150
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,760
Do you know how many announcements

151
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
are arranged behind Jiayi?

152
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,200
Can you afford the penalty?

153
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,200
How could I...?

154
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,360
I'll pay for it.

155
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,680
No, no, no.

156
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,400
Jiang Nan, I'll do it.

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't worry,

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm here.

159
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,200
It's okay,

160
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Gu Jiayi.

161
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
That's okay, right?

162
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,680
Now that it has happened,

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,000
there is no point in pursuing it.

164
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,400
It was just an accident.

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm sure they don't want to.

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
Don't worry.

167
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,360
About the online matter,

168
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll ask the team to take care of it.

169
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,960
careful study

171
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,400
Pay attention to it.

172
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,120
About this,

173
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,600
I owe you one. Okay. The patient

174
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,640
just woke up.

175
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,520
If you need to rest,

176
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,960
don't just stand here.

177
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,360
That's right.

178
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,440
We won't bother you then.

179
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Have a good rest.

180
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,360
We'll get going.

181
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,320
Thank you.

182
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Go, go,

183
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
have a good rest.

184
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,120
Jiang Nan,

185
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
can you stay?

186
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,440
I have something

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
to tell you alone.

188
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
-Let's go. -Dad, where

189
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,560
are you going?

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
Let's go!

191
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,360
Me

192
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,919
Dad, dad,

193
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,200
I killed that little girl,

194
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,920
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,680
You're too arrogant.

196
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,720
There are only two people in this room.

197
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm like this,

198
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,600
can't you care about me for a moment?

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,560
How do you expect me to care?

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
You used to

201
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
peel apples for me.

202
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,840
I don't think you have anything else to do.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,560
I'll get going.

204
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,000
Jiang Nan,

205
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,840
I forgive family happiness.

206
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,920
It's all because of you.

207
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,080
I'm already like this.

208
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,000
Isn't it enough?

209
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
If you ask me,

210
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,360
there's nothing selfless about love,

211
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,440
are selfish,

212
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,680
Me.

213
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,760
Jiang Nan.

214
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,960
Help me lie on the bed.

215
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,040
Miss, where are you going?

216
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm going to buy some water.

217
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,880
Water?

218
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,600
I guessed right.

219
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,680
That's right.

220
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,320
Why can't I get out?

221
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Why are you so unlucky? Hello

222
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,160
Keqin today,

223
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,480
Why is Gu Jiayi involved with you again?

224
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
The news on the internet has exploded.

225
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,280
Where are you?

226
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,960
I'll go find you.

227
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,400
No, thanks.

228
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,320
It's almost done.

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,640
Just go to work with peace of mind.

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Now the Internet is scolding

231
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
you and Family Fun.

232
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,400
You have to be careful.

233
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,480
Hello, Rui.

234
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,320
Where are you?

235
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,520
When Family Fun is in trouble,

236
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
I don't trust Gu Jiayi very much.

237
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,520
Sister Shan almost had an accident the night before yesterday.

238
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,240
What?

239
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Something happened to Qin Shan, too.

240
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,520
Are you all right?

241
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
We have nothing to do,

242
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
and I just saw the family reunion.

243
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,280
Don't worry too much.

244
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll take care of what happens online.

245
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,920
Just relax a hundred times.

246
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,760
Okay,

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Thank you.

248
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,280
Qin Shan and Family Joy had an accident together.

249
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,920
What a coincidence.

250
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,040
Stop looking.

251
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm fine.

252
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't worry about me.

253
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,320
Don't get involved in the family affair.

254
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
How can I not care about your business?

255
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,520
Now that you're developing your career,

256
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,920
we'll get you into trouble.

257
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,680
And because of the family affair,

258
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,760
you have to talk to her again,

259
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you jealous?

260
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,360
I'm talking to you about business.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't change the subject.

262
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,840
Okay,

263
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
I get it Gu Jiayi

264
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,840
After what happened to Family Fun,

265
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
My first reaction was,

266
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,640
will this matter hurt you?

267
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
So I came right away.

268
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
But now

269
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,520
I don't know what's going on.

270
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,320
So what I can do,

271
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
is to minimize the loss.

272
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,280
Chengcheng

273
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,400
No matter what happens in the future,

274
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,840
you are not allowed to say "get me into trouble" again.

275
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,920
And,

276
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,560
no matter when,

277
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
I'll always be there for you.

278
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
But... But

279
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,800
what?

280
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,080
But you remember she's allergic to peanuts,

281
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,240
Me,

282
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
I have a good memory.

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,280
Then why did you carry her back to bed?

284
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,680
When did I carry her back to bed?

285
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,400
Just now.

286
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,120
You came back and peeked.

287
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,120
No, I didn't.

288
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
You still refuse to admit it.

289
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,080
I … I just sneaked a peek in when I was passing

290
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,680
by.

291
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,440
And

292
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,880
the hospital has surveillance cameras.

293
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,640
You're back.

294
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,840
You're back.

295
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,200
What do you think?

296
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,440
How is Gu Jiayi?

297
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,440
Mom, don't worry.

298
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,400
Gu Jiayi is fine. Not only

299
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,640
is he fine,

300
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,520
They don't hold us accountable anymore.

301
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
Not only did she not hold us accountable,

302
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
but she also offered to help us

303
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,040
solve the problems on the Internet,

304
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,000
What a surprise.

305
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,560
Are you tired?

306
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,120
Come on.

307
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Please have a seat.

308
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,960
Thank you

309
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
for informing me just now.

310
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I did it for many oranges,

311
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,840
not for you.

312
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,840
By the way, Ye,

313
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,880
the surveillance of the kitchen and the family.

314
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,760
Have you checked it?

315
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,920
Zhan reminded us that

316
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,240
there's no surveillance in the kitchen,

317
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,280
There's an investigation

318
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,240
in the lobby,

319
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
I didn't find anything wrong.

320
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
The kitchen must be monitored immediately.

321
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,000
All right,

322
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,560
just do what you should do.

323
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,200
The investigation has started.

324
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,720
Right?

325
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,960
Don't stop our business.

326
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,200
It's time for dinner.

327
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,200
The guests will be here soon.

328
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,960
Let's move.

329
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,160
No one will come.

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,280
It doesn't matter if someone came to scold me before,

331
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,040
but the Health Bureau is here.

332
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,720
What are they doing here?

333
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,040
Someone reported that the hygiene of our store was not up to standard,

334
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,920
saying that a customer had a bad stomach here.

335
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,320
As soon as the front foot Health Bureau left,

336
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,120
someone started to post it on the internet,

337
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,160
They said there was something wrong with the hygiene of our family,

338
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
but these people couldn't spread rumors.

339
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Why is it so hard to do something?

340
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,840
Uncle,

341
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,720
don't worry,

342
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
That's how business works.

343
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,000
When there's no one in the store,

344
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
People will think there's something wrong with this store.

345
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,400
That's why they didn't come.

346
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
If there are a lot of customers

347
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
in this shop,

348
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,800
People outside will think,

349
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,000
this restaurant should taste good.

350
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,680
Everyone wants to come in and try it.

351
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
Zhan,

352
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,920
I understand that.

353
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,040
But where are the guests?

354
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
Where are the guests coming from?

355
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,720
Lin,

356
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,880
is Zhan the one who has a way?

357
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,280
Ask people from the company to have dinner.

358
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,240
The rumor has broken itself.

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,320
Master,

360
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,120
as long as we can attract new guests,

361
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,280
We can keep them with the taste.

362
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,520
Of course not.

363
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,640
Ye Tao,

364
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
are the potatoes ready?

365
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,960
All right.

366
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,440
I heard that

367
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
you also arranged employees for the company,

368
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
Give a good review to Family Fun.

369
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
The main thing is that the family food is delicious,

370
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,560
so it doesn't matter whether you tell me or not.

371
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
If Family Fun

372
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,400
has always maintained this quality,

373
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,560
It's only a matter of time before business gets better.

374
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,120
this time

375
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,920
Thank you again.

376
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm not helping you.

377
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,960
I think it's necessary for us

378
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,400
to check the surveillance footage again.

379
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,120
You also suspect Gu Jiayi,

380
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,840
don't you?

381
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,880
They don't know what Gu Jiayi is like,

382
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,480
and they can't suspect her

383
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,840
as a big star.

384
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,600
And there were so many people that day,

385
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
even if someone did it,

386
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,400
It's hard to find that person.

387
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,520
So don't you think

388
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,640
Gu Jiayi came at a coincidence that day?

389
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,960
About this matter,

390
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,520
I don't want Chengcheng to worry about it.

391
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,720
She's not in good health,

392
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,880
and having fun with her family

393
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
is enough to worry about her.

394
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,280
Slow down.

395
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,520
Pull it back.

396
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,120
Look at what he did on his hand,

397
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,560
I've seen this picture three times,

398
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
You don't have good eyesight, do you?

399
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,520
I'm being careful.

400
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,120
Then you do it.

401
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,160
Recently,

402
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
the comments on the Internet,

403
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,000
He's not very friendly to many oranges.

404
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,480
You should take care of her emotions.

405
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Don't worry.

406
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,080
Chengcheng was depressed before,

407
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,920
but under my care,

408
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,880
It's getting better.

409
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,600
At this time,

410
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,520
can you stop mentioning yourself?

411
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,600
Sorry,

412
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,840
this is my natural reaction as her boyfriend.

413
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,360
This is the only surveillance video of our family.

414
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,960
We've watched it for so long.

415
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,440
Didn't you see anything?

416
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,200
Chengcheng also told me.

417
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
She didn't take the wrong dishes.

418
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,080
I also specifically asked Lin,

419
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,600
and he said,

420
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,320
He even changed his oil into corn oil.

421
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Then what exactly went wrong?

422
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,680
Go back. Go back.

423
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
This is the position.

424
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,960
Can you improve the picture quality a little bit?

425
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,800
This is the clearest.

426
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,960
But you see,

427
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,080
after this,

428
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,240
She never appeared in the picture again.

429
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,080
From the picture alone,

430
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,400
this person's hand seems to have touched the bowl.

431
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,360
But with this alone,

432
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,040
it doesn't mean anything.

433
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,080
Hello,

434
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm Gu Jiayi,

435
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,360
A few days ago, because of my hand mistake,

436
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
the video of Family Fun Restaurant became popular.

437
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,760
I let a lot of people know about Family Fun Restaurant.

438
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,960
I didn't expect that because I ate allergic food by mistake,

439
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,400
it caused such a big storm.

440
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,320
Because of my personal affairs,

441
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,560
I took up public resources,

442
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,960
It's causing trouble for everyone,

443
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,800
and here,

444
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,800
I apologize to all of you,

445
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
and I also hope that

446
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
you can stop maliciously speculating about

447
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
my relationship with many oranges on the internet,

448
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,880
And stop spreading bad comments about family fun.

449
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,320
I've accepted Family Fun's apology,

450
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,680
and I'm willing to believe that

451
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,480
Family Fun didn't do it on purpose,

452
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,280
I hope the netizens

453
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,040
can give the client some space.

454
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,440
Don't overdo it.

455
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Thank you.

456
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,040
Why did you send this video?

457
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,280
There's nothing else I can do

458
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,440
to help the family solve the problem.

459
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,320
Isn't that a one-time solution?

460
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,200
Besides,

461
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,320
it's under a lot of pressure for me

462
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,960
to send an apology video for our family, okay?

463
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,720
Don't you know how many people

464
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
are staring at my news?

465
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,200
Gu Jiayi,

466
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,480
don't think I don't know what you want to do.

467
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,760
Jiang Nan,

468
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm the victim of this.

469
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,600
We haven't figured out

470
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,280
the family reunion yet.

471
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,280
In the past,

472
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,600
maybe you were the victim.

473
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,200
But now you're hurting others.

474
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,000
Gu Jiayi,

475
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
don't make me hate you more and more.

476
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,440
Family fun is really popular now.

477
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,040
What do you mean by Gu Jiayi?

478
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
It's not as high as

479
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
being on the hot searches,

480
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
You're not being nice.

481
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,680
Brother Nan and Zhan Zhilin are investigating, aren't they?

482
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,520
Don't tell Keqin.

483
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Many oranges don't know about this.

484
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,280
I'm the ideal type now.

485
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,680
How could he know about this?

486
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,080
Don't worry.

487
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,560
Okay,

488
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,000
Who are they?

489
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,040
Orange must be feeling really bad right now.

490
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm so mad.

491
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,360
These people clarify that they don't care about

492
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,640
gossip. They're a bunch of people,

493
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,160
I don't believe it.

494
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,280
Keep shooting.

495
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,480
I don't know when the family reunion thing

496
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,120
can be solved?

497
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
My dad just pulled himself together,

498
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,120
and this happened again,

499
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
Zhan Zhilin and I have started the investigation.

500
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,480
But I didn't expect Gu Jiayi's video

501
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,680
to push you and your family

502
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,080
to the forefront again.

503
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,360
Why didn't you tell me about your investigation?

504
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,280
According to the surveillance video,

505
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,800
someone bumped into you,

506
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,960
That person's hand touched the dish,

507
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,360
so he had a chance to do it.

508
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,440
But we can't be sure yet.

509
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,240
Besides,

510
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,040
having fun with your family has made you very upset.

511
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,640
I don't want you to

512
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,120
hurt your brain cells any more,

513
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,600
Now you know how to tell me.

514
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,640
I'm telling you now,

515
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
to cheer you up.

516
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
No matter how many doubts there are from the outside world,

517
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,120
no matter what happens in the future,

518
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,640
You have to be the most optimistic orange,

519
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,720
what about this?

520
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,960
Let's solve it together.

521
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,160
Cheng,

522
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
Don't say no.

523
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes.

524
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,400
Jiang Nan,

525
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,000
thank you.

526
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
It's good to have you here.

527
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,360
How can a kiss be enough to reward me?

528
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,600
I didn't sleep last night,

529
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,000
but I saw a little pig

530
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,320
sleeping very soundly.

531
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,280
What about me?

532
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,160
I dare not disturb her dream.

533
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,840
So,

534
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
I had to carry her back to her nest.

535
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,400
You're the piglet.

536
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,800
Come on,

537
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,320
I'll make it up for you.

538
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,920
Hey,

539
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,560
Someone posted a message on my Weibo saying that

540
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,240
he took a video of family fun,

541
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,080
And his shooting angle

542
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,640
is exactly what we need.

543
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
I've contacted him.

544
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,600
That's great.

545
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
If you have any news,

546
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,600
let me know. Let's go find this person.

547
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,840
This person is very important.

548
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,360
Chengcheng,

549
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,480
don't worry.

550
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,920
He hasn't replied yet.

551
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,040
Anyway, don't worry.

552
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,520
Things will be solved.

553
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,880
Jiayi,

554
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,880
it seems that some netizens really caught it,

555
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,480
He even contacted Zhan Zhilin,

556
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
didn't he ask you to find a lot of people

557
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,240
to disturb your vision?

558
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,680
Jiayi,

559
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,240
did anyone really take a photo of it?

560
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
Think about it.

561
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,400
I'm sorry,

562
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,480
Tie.

563
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,040
Crisp and tasty.

564
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,840
Great,

565
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,480
Was it taken at that time?

566
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,440
Why are you so careless?

567
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,760
Hurry up and find a way.

568
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,600
If it's exposed,

569
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
you'll know the consequences.

570
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:56,960
Chengcheng,

571
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,560
I wrote an article for you,

572
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,560
I didn't tell you the truth,

573
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
but one of the media finally approved it for me.

574
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,920
Don't worry,

575
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,080
I will help Family Fun fight against your innocence

576
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,960
to the end.

577
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,120
Have you heard from me?

578
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,160
No news.

579
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,240
-Yes. -But Zhan Zhilin hasn't

580
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,240
heard from me yet?

581
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't worry.

582
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,720
Let's eat first.

583
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,200
Zhan Zhilin said he was in contact,

584
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,960
but why hasn't he heard back yet?

585
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,120
No news is not a bad thing.

586
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,600
now

587
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,960
Hurry up and eat.

588
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,280
We need to ensure nutrition.

589
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
It's Zhan Zhilin,

590
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,200
Old Iron,

591
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,800
Crisp and tasty.

592
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,200
It's him. Unfortunately,

593
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,680
the picture quality is a bit poor.

594
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,400
Otherwise, I can see her face clearly.

595
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,440
Who do you think this person is?

596
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
If you want to harm Gu Jiayi like this,

597
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
no matter who she is,

598
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,320
I'll send this video to Mr. Bao,

599
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,360
and ask him to clarify it.

600
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
It's time to clear our name.

601
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,200
Don't forget,

602
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,760
it's yours too.

603
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,600
Jiang Nan,

604
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,360
you're here.

605
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
Take a look at what you want to eat.

606
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,000
I remember the desserts in this restaurant,

607
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
were your favorite before.

608
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,080
I asked you out today,

609
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,400
not for dinner,

610
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,320
I just want to ask you,

611
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,160
why are you doing these little tricks behind your back,

612
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,680
What do you mean?

613
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,520
I didn't know this would happen

614
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
in many of Orange's restaurants.

615
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,360
In front of me,

616
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,800
you don't have to act anymore.

617
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:13,960
Gu Jiayi,

618
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,360
about this matter,

619
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,760
Does it have anything to do with you?

620
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
Every time something happened,

621
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
you were always the first to suspect me.

622
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,720
Don't you think it's such a coincidence?

623
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,880
You first praised and promoted Family Fun,

624
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,440
and then the ingredients of Family Fun were switched.

625
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,760
Now you deliberately released an apology video,

626
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,960
just because

627
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,880
the family happiness belongs to a lot of Cheng's family,

628
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,000
So you always put yourself

629
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,360
in their shoes,

630
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,520
We have found the evidence now.

631
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,800
And called the police.

632
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,000
Whether you did it on purpose or not,

633
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,200
don't get involved in my business anymore.

634
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,960
You still suspect

635
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,680
someone I can't love.

636
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,840
I'm not the only one.

637
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,160
Why don't you suspect others?

638
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,760
You're so sure it's me.

639
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,520
I'll tell you one last time.

640
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,400
No matter whether there are many oranges or not,

641
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,760
there is no possibility

642
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,840
between us.

643
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,040
Master,

644
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,200
master, master,

645
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,400
Master Master,

646
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,160
what are you doing?

647
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,480
Someone posted videos and statements on the internet,

648
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,200
saying Gu Jiayi is allergic and someone framed us,

649
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
That man hit Chengcheng on purpose.

650
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,000
I took the opportunity to sprinkle peanut powder

651
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,240
into it. Sprinkle what?

652
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,440
Peanut powder?

653
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,440
What powder?

654
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,680
Peanut powder.

655
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,400
I told you someone set us up.

656
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,760
We didn't do it.

657
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,520
Great,

658
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
it can't be us.

659
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,760
Master,

660
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,000
that's not what you said that day.

661
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,200
What did I say that day?

662
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,000
The other day,

663
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,080
I told you to go out,

664
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,600
Turn over the sign.

665
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,200
We're closed.

666
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,880
Hurry up!

667
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Master,

668
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,480
Master,

669
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,080
Let's take advantage of this opportunity,

670
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,360
and have a 20% discount event.

671
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,160
Let's celebrate.

672
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,160
Take a good look at this traffic.

673
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,440
Let's ride the wave.

674
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,760
You're young,

675
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,000
Lin.

676
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,120
You're too immature.

677
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,920
You've been a teacher for so many days.

678
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
I realized a truth,

679
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,840
this traffic,

680
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,200
It's just a temporary delicacy

681
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,800
that lasts forever,

682
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,920
For ever,

683
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,400
an iron bar is ground into a needle,

684
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,560
and

685
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,920
You need to accumulate wealth and gain strength.

686
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,240
Be on guard against arrogance and rashness.

687
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,520
Master,

688
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,800
get ready.

689
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,200
There are a lot of customers waiting to order.

690
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,080
You first,

691
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,680
more importantly,

692
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,840
We need to assess the situation.

693
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,040
Give me my spoon.

694
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
What makes you so unhappy?

695
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,480
You forgot what you promised me, didn't you?

696
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,200
Sis,

697
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,680
Don't blame me for talking too much.

698
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,960
At this time,

699
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,400
only Mr. Liang can help us.

700
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,280
We can't risk big things for the sake of small ones.

701
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,280
I'll ruin your future.

702
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,080
What do you want?

703
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
Do I need to repeat my request?

704
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,360
What if I don't agree?

705
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
If you don't agree,

706
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,240
it seems that you know the consequences better than anyone else.

707
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,760
Since you were one step ahead of Jiang Nan,

708
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,000
and got the video of that netizen,

709
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,760
Then why didn't you clean it up?

710
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,760
Why did you ask him to send it to Jiang Nan?

711
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,160
Now the trend of public opinion on the Internet has reversed,

712
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,080
and they are all apologizing to Family Fun and Many Orange.

713
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,040
If you don't find a vague video

714
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,600
and send it to Family Fun for clarification,

715
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,600
Jiang Nan will find this strange.

716
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,080
With Jiang Nan's character,

717
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,679
he will definitely pursue it to the end,

718
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,280
What if there's any missing evidence?

719
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,760
It turned out to be troublesome.

720
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,719
Be content.

721
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm telling you, this is the best ending.

722
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,120
By the way,

723
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,520
ask your studio

724
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,400
to issue a statement right away,

725
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,000
Just say that you've been followed by black powder lately.

726
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,600
Let this matter come to a conclusion.

727
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,560
It saves you from having a long night and having a long dream.

728
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,639
How should I write it?

729
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,639
I don't need to teach you.

730
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,920
No need.

731
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,920
According to this statement from Gu Jiayi's studio,

732
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,760
she used to have black fans

733
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,800
following the person who came to have fun with her family,

734
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
She's one of her anti-fans.

735
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,240
She has issued

736
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,400
a formal warning to the black powder.

737
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,000
What's the use of warning?

738
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,080
We should call the police and arrest her.

739
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,800
Actors are also public figures.

740
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,840
Many things

741
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,040
are inevitable.

742
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,040
The anti-fans nowadays are so scary.

743
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,320
No wonder stars hire bodyguards.

744
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
Why don't I go practice too?

745
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,680
To protect you.

746
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,200
You're small,

747
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,800
but,

748
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,120
I still think about

749
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,160
Gu Jiayi's allergy,

750
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,360
It's not that simple.

751
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,720
The anti-fan's statement

752
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,920
is too logical.

753
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,560
Chengcheng,

754
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,920
do you remember,

755
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,320
The man who hit you that day,

756
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,160
do you have any obvious features?

757
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,880
It's an obvious feature.

758
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,080
I remember now.

759
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,720
There's a scar on that man's arm,

760
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,120
something like that.

761
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,600
It's almost as long as a finger

762
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,520
and a finger-length wound.

763
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,880
It's her.

764
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,240
Jiayi,

765
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
it's lucky that you're here at the last minute.

766
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,680
Otherwise, we wouldn't even know

767
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,080
what to do with this show.

768
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,480
We must work together again next time.

769
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,040
Okay,

770
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Otherwise, it would be a waste.

771
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,720
Sure,

772
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,480
Xiao Mei,

773
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Make an appointment.

774
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,800
Mei,

775
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,280
you must give me this chance.

776
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,120
No problem.

777
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,320
Why are you here?

778
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,200
You guys talk first.

779
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,160
I'll go upstairs first.

780
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,560
You're only allowed to work here.

781
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,600
I can't have it.
