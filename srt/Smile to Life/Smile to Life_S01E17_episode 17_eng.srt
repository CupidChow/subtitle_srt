00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,780

2
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:13,654
♫  I've walked around in a big circle  ♫

3
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:15,994
♫  To finally meet you  ♫

4
00:00:15,994 --> 00:00:19,194
♫  How can my love be restrained?  ♫

5
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:24,469
♫  My love for you is too obvious  ♫

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:30,327
♫  I guess you must have already discovered it  ♫

7
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:33,141
♫  On that clear evening  ♫

8
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:35,546
♫  It was romantic meeting you  ♫

9
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:38,928
♫  An unforgettable memory  ♫

10
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:41,627
♫  I heard that passionate love  ♫

11
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:44,441
♫  Can dissolve glaciers  ♫

12
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:48,428
♫  I say good night to you every night  ♫

13
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:51,155
♫  If you get used to it as well  ♫

14
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:53,868
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

15
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:56,615
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

16
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,782
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you   ♫

17
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:01,497
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

18
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:05,838
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

19
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:10,685
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

20
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:13,439
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,173
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

22
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,380
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,093
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

24
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:25,652
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

25
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:31,371
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,189
    🎈

27
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,841

28
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,140
Where is this?

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,760
- My house. 
 - Your house?

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,700
I bought it years ago.

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,740
It's perfect timing now to bring you here to relax.

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,040
Don't worry. Auntie Fen is there.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,580
Auntie Fen started taking care of me when I was four years old.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,700
She's taking care of the house for me now.

35
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,040
- Auntie Fen. 
 - Xiao Lin, I was counting the days yesterday.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,100
I thought it was about time you'd come here.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,140
This lady is...

38
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,500
This is my friend, Xu Duo Cheng.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Hello, Auntie Fen.

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,320
She's so beautiful.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,400
Auntie Fen.

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,780
You must be special for Xiao Lin to bring you here.

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,180
Your room is already prepared.

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,180
Let me know if you need anything else.

45
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,920
Let's go.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,360
Hurry!

47
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
Come inside.

48
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,320
I prepared everything.

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,000
Cheng Cheng, you don't have to be too polite.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,880
Think of it as your own house.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,980
I'll tell Xiao Lin to call you when dinner is ready.

52
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,040
Thank you, Auntie Fen.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,420
All right, Auntie Fen.

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,740
Now you keep calling her "Cheng Cheng".

55
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,220
You're treating her better than me.

56
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm going to be jealous.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,800
This child.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,180
Don't listen to his nonsense.

59
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,280
Take a seat and get some rest.

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,440
I'll see you later.

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,240

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Look at mine.

63
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,980
 No matter how beautiful fireworks are, they will only last for a mere second.

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,120
 Since it won't last, it's better not to give him any hope.

65
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,840
 Therefore, I've made the right decision, right?

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,860
Why are you smiling at me?

67
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,400
He made this dish.

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
You even know how to cook?

69
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,900
I really love this dish.

70
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,980
My mom taught me how to make it.

71
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,660
You're in luck today.

72
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,120
I haven't had this dish in a long time.

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,880
There's soup too. Wait a moment.

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,380
Auntie Fen is so nice.

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,460
If you think so, you should eat more.

76
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,840
What's wrong with your hand?

77
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,860
I'm fine.

78
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,360
Recently, I've been having weaknesses often.

79
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,560
It doesn't affect daily life.

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,400
In your current state, you're still not

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,740
going to tell your family?

82
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,280
It'll get harder as time goes by.

83
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,200
What can they do if I tell them?

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,840
Should I let them spend all their savings

85
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,860
and borrow money from everywhere for me?

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Even if I tell them, it won't change the result.

87
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,240
Isn't it better if they have less time to be sad?

88
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,800
This isn't about the duration.

89
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,040
If they don't need to go through the process,

90
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,840
it will be less painful for them, right?

91
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,980
I just hope my loved ones won't be sad because of me.

92
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,320
Have a shrimp.

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,240
Chubby Zhu, I stayed up late for two consecutive nights,

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,960
and you woke me up just when I started to have a nice dream. What do you want?

95
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,980
Did you dream about me?

96
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,100
Just tell me what you want, otherwise I'm hanging up.

97
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
 No, no, don't hang up!

98
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,640
Here's the thing.

99
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Xu Duo Cheng left with Zhan Zhi Lin.

100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,020
What? What happened? Tell me right now.

101
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,860
 Jiang Nan was waiting for Xu Duo Cheng outside your apartment building,

102
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,740
 but he saw Zhan Zhi Lin's car turn around and leave.

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,760
He chased after them but lost them.

104
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,160
Xu Duo Cheng won't answer her phone either.

105
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,460
We don't know if Xu Duo Cheng is safe.

106
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,960
All right, I got it. I'll call Orange.

107
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay. I'll wait to hear back from you.

108
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,420
 Okay.

109
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,060
What did she say?

110
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,780
Let's wait.

111
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,833
You should have some too.

112
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,740
I'll go upstairs to take a call.

113
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,020
Hello, Ke Qin.

114
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,780
What's going on between you, Jiang Nan, and Zhan Zhi Lin?

115
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,900
 Where are you? When are you coming back?

116
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,520
I'm not going back tonight.

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
It's a bit complicated and I'm confused,

118
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
so I won't tell you now.

119
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,420
Be honest with me.

120
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,400
Are you in a relationship with Zhan Zhi Lin?

121
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,880
Where did he take you?

122
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,160
I'm fine. Don't worry.

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,660
 If you really don't want to tell me, then don't.

124
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,579
How about this? Send me a selfie every hour.

125
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,580
I have to make sure you're safe.

126
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,079
 Okay.

127
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,480
Wait... This earring...

128
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,800
Who buys just one earring?

129
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
Ke Qin, what's going on?

130
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
Did Cheng Cheng tell you where she went?

131
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,960
 She won't tell me. She just said she was tired,

132
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,760
but judging by her state, I think she's fine.

133
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,140
That's no good. She's with Zhan Zhi Lin.

134
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,120
She won't tell me. What can I do?

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,420
But I told her to send me a selfie every hour.

136
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,700
 At least we can make sure she's safe.

137
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,500
Did she send one to you? Can you send it to me?

138
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,860
Okay.

139
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,700
Let's wait for her next selfie in an hour.

140
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
This...

141
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,920
This is one of the two portraits my mom asked someone to draw years ago.

142
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,480
One of them is in my room and the other one is here.

143
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,241
I used to make fun of her for being a young girl at heart.

144
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,040
I never thought I would only be able to remember her through these two portraits.

145
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,640
When you fought with Jiang Nan last time,

146
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,680
I heard something about Mrs. Jiang.

147
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,500
Since you're no longer with Jiang Nan,

148
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,620
if I tell you about this, maybe it'll make you forget him faster.

149
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,080
My dad and Jiang Nan's mom had an affair,

150
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
but the ironic thing is,

151
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
Jiang Nan already knew about it.

152
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,660
But he didn't mention a word to me

153
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,540
just to protect his mom.

154
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,080
I was the last person to know.

155
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,560
Mrs. Jiang and your dad?

156
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,080
My mom and his mom were besties.

157
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,240
Do you know how my mom died?

158
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,940
She committed suicide by jumping off a building

159
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,280
because she couldn't get past that situation.

160
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Now you know why Jiang Nan's mom went crazy, right?

161
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,400
If I knew why my mom was so upset sooner,

162
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,900
perhaps she wouldn't have died.

163
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,380
I'm sorry to bring up a sad memory for you.

164
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,240
I was serious when I said I don't want to hear you apologize.

165
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm also serious about wanting to take care of you.

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,160
I was also serious when I said,

167
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,200
"I like you."

168
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,240
I admit,

169
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,340
at first, I approached you because I was mad at Jiang Nan.

170
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,680
But later on, I discovered that you're not like other girls.

171
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,640
Do you still remember the sea of flowers I took you to see back then?

172
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,660
That was the happiest time

173
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,260
of my life.

174
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,780
 The pastries are ready! Come downstairs to eat!

175
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Xu Duo Cheng,

176
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,860
I just want you to be happy.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,080
If he can't do that, let me do it.

178
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,140
Zhu Lin Feng, unlock your phone.

179
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,060
Don't you have it on your phone?

180
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,000
I know where this is.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,760
It's Zhan Zhi Lin's villa in the mountains.

182
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,780
Wait, how can you tell it's Zhan Zhi Lin's villa?

183
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,840
This wallpaper is in the second-floor guest room of the villa.

184
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,400
Mrs. Zhan asked me to pick it out with Zhan Zhi Lin when they were furnishing it.

185
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,200
You even have this skill?

186
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,620
Sherlock Jiang.

187
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,560
 Cheng Cheng, I finally found you.

188
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,680
 It's out of gas. Good thing I'm almost there.

189
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,380
Xu Duo Cheng.

190
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,020
Xu Duo Cheng.

191
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,620
Auntie Fen.

192
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,540

193
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,780
- Where's Ms. Xu? 
 - She went out this early?

194
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,760
She just asked me for some water to take her medicine.

195
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,200
She didn't take her medicine?

196
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,020
Where did she go?

197
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,580
Cheng Cheng!

198
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,600
How did you find this place?

199
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,040
You clearly have feelings for me.

200
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,980
Why did you lie to me?

201
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,900
You promised to forever stay by my side that night.

202
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,320
You can't break your promise.

203
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,540
That night, I saw you were drunk and really upset.

204
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,420
I was just comforting you.

205
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,700
If you were just trying to comfort me,

206
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,840
then what's this?

207
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
Why did you kiss me?

208
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
- I... 
 - You're still trying to deny it?

209
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,220
Why are you running away from me?

210
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,800
I never liked you.

211
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Never!

212
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,040
What are you doing?

213
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,580
Aren't your tears enough to prove your feelings for me?

214
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,800
You're hiding something, right?

215
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,440
That kiss didn't mean anything.

216
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,019
Stop coming to see me anymore.

217
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,360
Don't come to see me anymore!

218
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,939
Xu Duo Cheng, I'm not done yet. You can't leave!

219
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,540
I already said everything I need to say.

220
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,560
Why are you hiding from me? Give me a reason.

221
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
Why?

222
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,360
Jiang Nan, are you a man?

223
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,280
Didn't Xu Duo Cheng tell you she doesn't want to see you anymore?

224
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,460
- Why are you still bothering her? 
 - This is between us!

225
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,120
What does it have to do with you?

226
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,820
Zhan Zhi Lin!

227
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
Cheng Cheng!

228
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,740
- Cheng Cheng! 
 - Cheng Cheng!

229
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,440
Cheng Cheng!

230
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,460

231
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

232
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,180

233
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,420
Excuse me, where is Director Zhang's office?

234
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,540
Nurse, may I ask which department I should go to for this?

235
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,000
All the way down that hall.

236
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,300
- Okay, thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

237
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,140
Sister, are you okay?

238
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,440
Why were you so careless?

239
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,680
I'm fine now.

240
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,600
I just fell down by accident.

241
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
I'll be better soon.

242
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Sister, look.

243
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,200
It's so cute.

244
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,920
Daddy took Pudding on a walk.

245
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,080
- Let's play with Pudding together next time, okay? 
 - Sure.

246
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,640
You named it Pudding? What a nice name.

247
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Mommy didn't allow me to have a dog before,

248
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,220
but Pudding is really obedient.

249
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,960
Now, Mommy really likes him too.

250
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,160
Your mom wanted to take care of you wholeheartedly.

251
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
She was afraid she wouldn't have time to take care of a dog.

252
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,360
That's not true. Mommy didn't let me to have a dog even when I wasn't sick.

253
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,920
She said dogs can only live for around ten years

254
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,880
and I would be very sad when it died.

255
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,400
It's better not to have one. I don't think Mommy is right.

256
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,800
Sister Cheng Cheng, let me tell you a secret.

257
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,960
What is it?

258
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,620
I heard Doctor Sui talk to Daddy.

259
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,240
They said I only have ten more years to live.

260
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,340
Don't say nonsense.

261
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,980
You must've heard it wrong.

262
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,940
I didn't hear it wrong.

263
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,340
If I can only live for ten more years, Mommy and Daddy will still love me.

264
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,953
If Pudding lives for ten years, I'll still love him.

265
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:51,280
Why should we care about how many years we can live?

266
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,360
I saw on TV that some trees have lived for a few hundred years

267
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,420
and some trees have even lived for a thousand years.

268
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,960
Did they really live that long?

269
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,220
Yes.

270
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,120
There really are thousand-year-old trees.

271
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,120
Then would trees think people who live to 100

272
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,420
live for a really short time too?

273
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,020
They might.

274
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,680
Cheng Cheng, I already heated up the porridge.

275
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,420
Have some when you feel better later.

276
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,760
Okay.

277
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,520
Dou Dou, we need to go back to take your medicine.

278
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,360
Come visit Sister Cheng Cheng another day.

279
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:35,503
- We're leaving. 
 - Bye.

280
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:36,903
Bye-bye.

281
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,500
 ALS is irreversible.

282
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,380
 The damaged muscles and neurons will only become worse over time.

283
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,760
 Plus, with our current medical treatments,

284
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,140
 we can only prolong the process, not cure it.

285
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,380
 Does falling down suddenly count as an episode?

286
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,680
 Yes.

287
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,180
 At first, there will be symptoms such as muscle weakness or twitching.

288
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
 What's going on with you?

289
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,340
 Like the heavenly maid scattering flowers, may you have peace year after year.

290
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,940
 Wipe your hand.

291
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,660
 What are you doing?

292
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
 What's this?

293
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,000
 It's a health maintenance device.

294
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
 What's it for?

295
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,620
 This helps piano players like me to get more flexible fingers.

296
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,360
 Xu Duo Cheng, you've already started paying IQ tax at such a young age. 
 (T/N: Spending money without thinking)

297
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,840
 Mr. Security Guard, look at this.

298
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,520
 Just now, what was with the medicine?

299
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,280
 Isn't it normal for a health-conscious girl like me to carry medicine all the time?

300
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,220
 Do you think everything is really easy?

301
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,500
 For me, it's hard enough just to survive!

302
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,900
 You don't understand at all!

303
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,880
 I might not have another chance once I miss tonight's recital!

304
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,420
 Normally, it will approximately take two to three years

305
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,180
 from having her first episode to being fully bedridden.

306
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,780
 Plus, this is a gradual process.

307
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,440
 You need to be mentally prepared.

308
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,760
 There's one more thing.

309
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,080
 You must protect her in her daily life.

310
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,080
 Be especially mindful not to let her fall.

311
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,340
Zhan Zhi Lin, you knew about Xu Duo Cheng's condition a long time ago, right?

312
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,260
Why didn't you tell me?

313
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,280
She's your girlfriend! Can't you ask her yourself?

314
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,260
Why did she tell me?

315
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,860
It's because she trusts me! Do you understand?

316
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,100
Brothers, what are you doing?

317
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,640
We're talking.

318
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,420
What are you doing, Jiang Nan?

319
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,080
You spoke first last time.

320
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,720
It's my turn to speak first.

321
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,320
What I want to tell you is, I know you have the same disease as Dou Dou,

322
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,860
but I'm very sure about how I feel.

323
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,960
Cheng Cheng, I like you and you like me.

324
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,600
That's enough.

325
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,580
I believe I can take good care of you.

326
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,380
Can you give me a chance?

327
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,620
Stop running away, okay?

328
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,980
I don't want to be a burden to you.

329
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,320
You're so silly.

330
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,860
Do you know how worried and afraid I am?

331
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,320
You shouldn't bear this burden

332
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
or face this problem.

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,620
So, you're bearing this burden all by yourself?

334
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,060
You won't tell me that you're sick nor admit that you like me.

335
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,600
You don't dare to face me, so you avoid me instead.

336
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,980
Who am I to you?

337
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,820
What do you want me to do?

338
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,540
What can I do?

339
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,180
It's hard for me to see you every day

340
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,760
but you keep showing up in my life.

341
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,160
What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do?

342
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,640
All right, don't cry.

343
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,540
It's my fault.

344
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,640
I was too anxious. I shouldn't blame you.

345
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,880
Cheng Cheng, let's put the past behind us.

346
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,700
We'll face the future together, okay?

347
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,620
You promised me. You can't back out anymore.

348
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,540
By the way, how did you find the villa in the mountains?

349
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,220
Didn't I disable our location sharing?

350
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,120
I have my own ways.

351
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,020
Speaking of which, where's your phone?

352
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,040
Hurry and enable our location sharing again.

353
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,660
Done.

354
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,620
That's more like it.

355
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,420
Well, tell me now.

356
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,460
How did you find me?

357
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,860
Didn't you send a selfie to Yu Ke Qin?

358
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,300
Based on the it's background in the picture,

359
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,140
I guessed it was the second-floor bedroom of Zhan Zhi Lin's house.

360
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,100
Back then, I bought that wallpaper with him.

361
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,240
You were so close to Zhan Zhi Lin back then.

362
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,680
I can tell you both really care about each other a lot.

363
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,860
He only hates you so much because he cares so much.

364
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,160
He really cares about his mom's death.

365
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,260
He said you knew about something in advance.

366
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,720
Is there a misunderstanding between you two?

367
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,120
No, there's no misunderstanding.

368
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,380
What he saw was too unilateral.

369
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,200
Things weren't what he thought they were.

370
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,320
Did Zhan Zhi Lin tell you something?

371
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,720
No.

372
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,400
Anyway, the issue between us can't be resolved.

373
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,800
The most important thing for you is to recuperate.

374
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,520
You're looking good.

375
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,240
Having someone taking care of you sure makes a difference.

376
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,220
Don't make fun of me, Doctor Sui.

377
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,080
Can I be discharged?

378
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,620
I saw the results of your examination report.

379
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,840
It's nothing serious.

380
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,400
You can be discharged today,

381
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,620
but you must remember, do not let something like this happen again after you leave.

382
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,840
All right. I won't disturb you two.

383
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,160
Remember to come for your checkups on time.

384
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,500
Thank you, Doctor Sui.

385
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,300
Take good care of her.

386
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
I'll go handle the discharge process now.

387
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,700
Otherwise, Yu Ke Qin will kill me if she finds out.

388
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,300
Is Ke Qin that vicious in your eyes?

389
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,900
Your bestie is a top-level fighter.

390
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,600
- President Liang. 
 - Sit.

391
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,300
Long time no see.

392
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,760
You look more dazzling each time.

393
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,560
Look at what you're saying.

394
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,900
You're making me blush.

395
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,440
Sir, what would you like to drink?

396
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
- Same as her. 
 - Sure.

397
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,680
I'll cut to the chase then.

398
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,900
I came to tell you some good news.

399
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,220
I bought True Image.

400
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,280
From now on, there will be two editors-in-chief at True Image.

401
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,180
You and that person named Qin Shan will be on equal footing.

402
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,200
Are you serious?

403
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
I never lie.

404
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,580
As long as you do your part,

405
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,640
you'll benefit as well.

406
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,260
Thank you for your appreciation, President Liang.

407
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,020
Don't worry. I will do my best.

408
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,000
I won't let you down.

409
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,960
Come on,

410
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,700
take your medicine.

411
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,360
I had Brother Rui buy a lot of ingredients.

412
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
I'll make your favorite dishes later.

413
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,280
Okay.

414
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,140
How are you guys so finicky?

415
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,760
If you fight, then just fight. You even had to go into the mountains to fight.

416
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,840
That's enough.

417
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,080
You talk too much. You've been yapping since you came through the door.

418
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,820
Look at you and your ungratefulness.

419
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,520
You forgot your brother, now that you have Orange?

420
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,360
To think I negotiated for you to go on Cool Singer-Songwriters.

421
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,980
That variety show was really popular last year.

422
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,760
I kept up with every episode.

423
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,160
Jiang Nan, are you going to be on Cool Singer-Songwriters?

424
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,500
We don't know yet.

425
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,380
Lao Jiang and Alex have different visions,

426
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,760
but Alex is still really interested in Lao Jiang.

427
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,140
Am I right?

428
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,180
What vision?

429
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,820
Maybe we should cooperate with him.

430
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,120
It's nothing serious.

431
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,760
When I talked to Alex last time,

432
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,680
he just wanted to have the final say regarding song writing.

433
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,920
He had an emergency and set another time to talk next time.

434
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,736
He will concede. Don't worry.

435
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,200
Am I right, Brother Rui?

436
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,460
Yes.

437
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,027
Cheng Cheng, I'll go wash the vegetables first.

438
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,360
I'll lend you a hand.

439
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,040
Why are you lying through your teeth?

440
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,300
I mean it.

441
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,200
When I finish my new song, contact Alex for me.

442
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,960
But I think what Alex said made sense.

443
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,460
After all, you two are already an affectionate couple in the eyes of the public.

444
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,860
Don't bring it up. I don't want to exploit our personal life.

445
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,520
Besides, don't make Cheng Cheng worry about this.

446
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,940
Fine, fine, fine. You're the model husband.

447
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,280
However, we shouldn't drag this out.

448
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,240
It's probably Ke Qin and Chubby. I'll go get the door.

449
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,880
No way.

450
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,760
How could that She-Devil let them get off work so early?

451
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,920
Why are you here?

452
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,960
I heard you and Xu Duo Cheng broke up.

453
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,840
I came specially to comfort you.

454
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,540
Who told you?

455
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,900
I know you're very upset right now,

456
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,480
but the best way to forget a past relationship

457
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,800
is to start a new relationship.

458
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,800
Why are you still here?

459
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,020
I don't know who told you we broke up

460
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,200
but now you've seen it yourself.

461
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,080
We're fine.

462
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,420
I sincerely give you a word of advice.

463
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,640
Find someone who likes you back. Stop getting hung up on me.

464
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,760
Don't we have a deal?

465
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,460
Go home now.

466
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,920
- Hurry up. Hurry up and come inside. 
 - Why is Gu Jia Yi here again?

467
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,840
Orange, next time, you can't leave without a word like that.

468
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,160
You made me worry all night.

469
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Yes, Ma'am.

470
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,880
Didn't Brother Nan say he's going to cook himself?

471
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,760
We both came hungry.

472
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,080
Cut that nonsense. Come and give me a hand.

473
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,300
- All right. 
 -  I'm coming.

474
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,200
Are you okay?

475
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,380
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

476
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,040
When did you learn to make so many dishes?

477
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,880
And they're are my favorites too.

478
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,960
I'm extraordinarily talented.

479
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,380
You'll find out more surprises about me in the future.

480
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
If you don't believe me, then don't eat.

481
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
I can finish this entire table myself.

482
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,640
I believe you. I'll eat it.

483
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
- The spareribs are a bit salty. 
 - Impossible.

484
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,300
I practiced five or six times according to my father-in-law's recipe and never failed.

485
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,440
Let me try it.

486
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,680
Your father-in-law is good. Your father-in-law is really good.

487
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,040
Ke Qin, this tastes really good.

488
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,740
Try it.

489
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,440
If you like it, I'll learn how to make it for you too.

490
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,200
That's enough. That's enough, okay?

491
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,160
You two couples just won't stop with the PDA.

492
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,880
Can you think about how a single man like me will feel?

493
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,860
Our outstanding young man, Brother Rui, is still single.

494
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,400
Seems like you also need to count on me to find you a wife.

495
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,720
You should switch careers and be a matchmaker instead.

496
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,940
Stop it.

497
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,379
By the way, why are you off work so early today?

498
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,780
Sister Shan has been really agitated lately and doesn't want to see me hanging around her.

499
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,199
The corporation group sold the control rights of True Image.

500
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,139
The big boss even promoted Qi Qi, Sister Shan's assistant, who she personally trained

501
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,239
and made a co-editor-in-chief.

502
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,620
Topic selections can only be approved if both editors-in-chief agree.

503
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,199
Doesn't that mean they took power away from Qin Shan?

504
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,999
How can she bear that?

505
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:38,920
Exactly. That big boss, Liang Zhe, doesn't seem like a nice man.

506
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,280
Liang Zhe?

507
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,579
Liang Zhe bought True Image?

508
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,180
Qin Shan is in big trouble now.

509
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,860
Qin Shan kept hounding Lao Jiang in the past and I was really annoyed by her,

510
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,900
but besides having a bad temper, that woman is pretty efficient in her work

511
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,520
and has principles. That's something worth appreciating.

512
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,980
Since when did you know so much about my cousin?

513
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,020
No discord, no concord.

514
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,840
All right, we've talked so much but we haven't toasted each other.

515
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,140
I wish everyone safety, peace, and good luck with everything!

516
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,600
- Come on, cheers! 
 - Cheers!

517
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,950

518
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,540
 I'll send you the information on ALS bit by bit.

519
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,920
 Jiang Nan, you're very considerate.

520
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,440
 Cheng Cheng, I'll take good care of you

521
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,700
 so you'll always be so energetic.

522
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:29,050

523
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:40,430
♫  I walked past many side roads before you met me  ♫

524
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:47,009
♫  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  ♫

525
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:54,806
♫  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  ♫

526
00:36:54,806 --> 00:37:00,593
♫  You shine a light to all my loneliness  ♫

527
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:04,139
♫  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  ♫

528
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,219
♫  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  ♫

529
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:14,572
♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

530
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:18,032
♫  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  ♫

531
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:19,905
♫  I suddenly became very foolish  ♫

532
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,205
♫  I was just like a wooden person  ♫

533
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:25,219
♫  My longing still asks me at night  ♫

534
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:29,007
♫  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  ♫

535
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:32,324
♫  Why have I become so strange?  ♫

536
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:36,392
♫  It has become difficult to guess your every word  ♫

537
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:40,678
♫  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  ♫

538
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:43,327
♫  I don't want to wait any longer  ♫

539
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,718
♫  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  ♫

540
00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:50,852
♫  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  ♫

541
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,886
♫  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  ♫

542
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:57,685
♫  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  ♫

543
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:01,028
♫  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  ♫

544
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:05,090
♫  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  ♫

545
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,305
♫  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  ♫

546
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:15,953
♫  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  ♫

547
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:33,706
♫  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  ♫

548
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:37,686
♫  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  ♫

549
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:44,133
♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

550
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:47,624
♫  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  ♫

551
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:51,658
♫  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  ♫

557
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:16,200
