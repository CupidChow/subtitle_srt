1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080

2
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:13,730
♫  I've walked around in a big circle  ♫

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,970
♫  To finally meet you  ♫

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,170
♫  How can my love be restrained?  ♫

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,445
♫  My love for you is too obvious  ♫

6
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:30,303
♫  I guess you must have already discovered it  ♫

7
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:33,017
♫  On that clear evening  ♫

8
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:35,422
♫  It was romantic meeting you  ♫

9
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:38,904
♫  An unforgettable memory  ♫

10
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,603
♫  I heard that passionate love  ♫

11
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:44,417
♫  Can dissolve glaciers  ♫

12
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:48,304
♫  I say good night to you every night  ♫

13
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,131
♫  If you get used to it as well  ♫

14
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,844
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

15
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,391
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

16
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:58,758
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you   ♫

17
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,473
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

18
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:05,814
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

19
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:10,661
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

20
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,415
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

21
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:16,149
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

22
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,356
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

23
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:21,069
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

24
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,728
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

25
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:31,047
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

26
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:45,180
    🎈

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,045

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,040
Sister Shan, Jiang Nan agreed!

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,260
Not bad.

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,480
You taught me well, Chief Editor.

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,880
All right, enough brown-nosing.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,820
- Did you set a date yet? 
 - End of the month.

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,819
You must have the interview questions sorted out by the end of the day.

34
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,399
I need to confirm them in advance.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,440
We don't need to be in such a rush.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,028
There are still many days to go.

37
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:17,300
You must complete 30 draft articles per week on time as well.

38
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,640
Go back to work if there's nothing else.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,820
 What an exploiter.

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,200
 Why don't you ask me to write 50 articles?

41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,340
 What are you looking at? You're just like your cousin,

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,460
 all you two do is pressure me.

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,260
Ke Qin... why does Ke Qin not look good?

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,960
Why are you here again?

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,740
I'm just concerned about your work.

46
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,360
Stop using that excuse to disturb us.

47
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,560
I'll just take a short while.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,960
Did she mention me just now?

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,980
No.

50
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,960
That's not possible.

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,440
Bao Rui didn't tell her that I helped her?

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,540
Zhu Lin Feng, I have an appointment with someone. I don't have time.

53
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,500
I don't want to waste time with you anymore.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,900
That doesn't make sense.

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,800
 It was a mistake for me to move in here.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,020
Here you go.

57
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,720
Wait.

58
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,600
I wrote a new song. Come listen to it.

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,460
I don't want to listen to it.

60
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,760
You said you like my songs.

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,420
This is the first song I wrote in years.

62
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,603
♫  The bright color of caramel  ♫

63
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,501
♫  is the sign of summer  ♫

64
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,132
♫  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  ♫

65
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:50,734
♫  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  ♫

66
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:54,363
♫  You lift away my arrogant facade  ♫

67
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,713
♫  It isn't the best feeling  ♫

68
00:03:56,713 --> 00:04:01,383
♫  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  ♫

69
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:05,289
♫  Maybe you added your favorite ingredients  ♫

70
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:11,956
♫  Every day becomes magical because of you  ♫

71
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:15,781
♫  I like the taste of cola chicken wings  ♫

72
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,052
♫  I want to be close to you, I'll never get tired  ♫

73
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,855
♫  The perfect amount of sweetness  ♫

74
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:23,439
♫  Secretly fermenting these memories in cola  ♫

75
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,860
♫  I want you to count on me forever  ♫

76
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,260
♫  I can't obstain from the taste of liking you  ♫

77
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,630
♫  A match made in heaven; just perfect  ♫

78
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,200
Doesn't it sound good?

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,500
It does.

80
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,940
It's so touching...

81
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:47,522
This...

82
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,019
This isn't a touching song.

83
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,980
 Is this song written for me?

84
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,280
 No, no, no. How could that be?

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,740
 Xu Duo Cheng, don't get the wrong idea.

86
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,020
 What I need to do now is to cherish the last moments I have with Jiang Nan,

87
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,660
 and I should earn more money

88
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,480
 so my parents will be supported in their senior years.

89
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,620
 It will be best if I can finish my Happy List too,

90
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,840
 but... this song really sounds like it's written for me.

91
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,220
Xu Duo Cheng. Xu Duo Cheng.

92
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,500
 I have piano lessons at the music instrument store this morning.

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,760
 Help yourself to breakfast.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,400
 You finally have a place for me in your heart.

95
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,510

96
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm sorry, Manager. I was stuck in traffic.

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,020
That's okay. The student isn't here yet,

98
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,500
but someone has been waiting for you for a long time.

99
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,100
Have a chat first. I'm going inside.

100
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,400
You want to see me?

101
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,020
You didn't answer my calls.

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,280
I had no choice but to come here.

103
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,220
I didn't look at my phone in the car.

104
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,980
Didn't I say we shouldn't see each other so often anymore?

105
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,820
What do you need?

106
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,240
Can't I come to see you if I don't need anything?

107
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,360
Are you really planning on ignoring me?

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,540
I just think it's better if we don't see each other very often.

109
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,620
If someone takes pictures again, I won't be responsible for it.

110
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,360
So, you are really planning to ignore me.

111
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,060
Fine, too bad for Lin Yao Yin.

112
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,100
Lin Yao Yin?

113
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,980
What do you mean?

114
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,100
Lin Yao Yin's Solo Piano Recital?

115
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,620
Why didn't I know about it?

116
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,260
It's a private charity event. Of course you wouldn't know about it.

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,340
I saw that you've shared his tracks before on WeChat Moments,

118
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,460
so I got this ticket.

119
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,500
What do you think? Do you want to go?

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Yes, of course!

121
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,840
Jiang Nan and him are my only two idols.

122
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,780
Must you be so blunt?

123
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

124
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,580
How much is this ticket?

125
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,480
I'll pay you.

126
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,500
I told you it's a charity performance.

127
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,200
The ticket is free.

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,260
However, someone just said we shouldn't see each other anymore.

129
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm very hurt by that.

130
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,980
Can I take that back?

131
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,320
Xu Duo Cheng, you have no principles.

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,240
Destiny already has me by the throat.

133
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,440
Is it that important to have principles?

134
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,700
You're right. Well, only if you agree on one condition.

135
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,280
Why do you all love to drive a bargain?

136
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,900
What do you mean?

137
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,100
Nothing.

138
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,360
You're not the only one anyway.

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,780
Go ahead!

140
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,520
You cannot say, "We'll never see each other," again

141
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,660
or go missing all of a sudden.

142
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,520
- That's it? 
 - That's it.

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,720
No problem. Deal.

144
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,133
♫  The bright color of caramel  ♫

145
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,931
♫  is the sign of summer  ♫

146
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,562
♫  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  ♫

147
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:46,164
♫  The light vapor of the freezer, the taste of ice  ♫

148
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:49,793
♫  You lift away my arrogant facade  ♫

149
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,170
♫  It isn't the best feeling  ♫

150
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,140
♫  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  ♫

151
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,240
Lao Jiang, your song "Cola Chicken Wings"

152
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
is much better than your cooking skills.

153
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,500
It's a really nice song.

154
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,740
You and your loquaciousness.

155
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,760
Sit down.

156
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,360
Can't you tell I'm complimenting you?

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
You see, this song is already complete.

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,740
Shouldn't you think about the release?

159
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,820
Where do you plan to release it?

160
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,060
We used to release our songs on record labels,

161
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,280
but a lot of musicians are releasing their songs through the KuGou Celestial Objects Plan.

162
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,220
Why? Because it has a really high copyright incentive

163
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,860
and great flow support.

164
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,300
If we release this song through the KuGou Celestial Objects Plan,

165
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,540
it will surely be a big hit.

166
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,660
I think that's doable,

167
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,580
but how will we do that specifically?

168
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,560
You see, I did some research.

169
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,907
We can open this KuGou App.

170
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,780
You can register to become a KuGou musician on this App.

171
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,400
After that, you can just release new songs on your own through this KuGou Celestial Objects Plan.

172
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Plus, your fans can check your Musician home page and you can interact with them.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,200
You can also see all the play data and royalty revenue clearly for every song.

174
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,940
Not bad, Lord Bao.

175
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,420
You're the best agent in China

176
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,800
in terms of professional proficiency.

177
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,020
Let's go have a drink tonight to celebrate the return of your long-lost inspirations.

178
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,260
I'm not drinking. I'm going home for dinner.

179
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,140
Brother, you're such a killjoy.

180
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,980
You can eat Xu Duo Cheng's cooking at any time.

181
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,220
What I need the most is to have good meals every day.

182
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,120
Goodbye.

183
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,660
Bye-bye.

184
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,580
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

185
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,320
Have you eaten?

186
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,700
I'm waiting for you with an empty stomach.

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,800
Waiting for me?

188
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,160
A student of mine came late today.

189
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,060
I told you,  you need to report to me in advance for special circumstances like this.

190
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,560
I have to report this too?

191
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,760
Of course.

192
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,060
This is a matter of whether I'm going hungry.

193
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,500
- You can order takeout. 
 - Takeout food doesn't agree with me.

194
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,580
Well, it agreed with you when I wasn't here.

195
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,920
How is that the same?

196
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,980
It's not your cooking.

197
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,560
Well, I'll go make you something simple.

198
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,780
 How silly. Playing cool.

199
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,400
Xu Duo Cheng, your phone got a notification.

200
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,700
 Coming!

201
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,820
 Tomorrow at 6.30 p.m. Don't forget.

202
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,580
 She's still seeing Zhan Zhi Lin?

203
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,320
 I told you Zhan Zhi Lin has an agenda.

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,540
 Why won't you believe me?

205
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,060
 Pissing me off.

206
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,280
Where are you going?

207
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,340
The food will be ready soon.

208
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,560
I'm full.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,180
That's strange.

210
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,640
Men are this fickle too?

211
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,320
I just don't want to waste food.

212
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Why are you still acting tough if you're hungry?

213
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,680
Take it easy. Don't burn yourself.

214
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,660
Are you going to the nursing home tomorrow?

215
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,980
I'll go with you.

216
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,200
Okay. Well... I have a previous engagement tomorrow night.

217
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,240
I want to take some time off.

218
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,260
Got it.

219
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,460
That's it?

220
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,100
You're not going to ask where I'm going?

221
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,540
Didn't you already tell me?

222
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,800
You have a previous engagement tomorrow night.

223
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,860
Fine.

224
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,820
Come home earlier.

225
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,100
Cai Yun was in good spirits today.

226
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,680
What's wrong?

227
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,020
I'm fine. Don't mind me.

228
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,800
You have a stomachache?

229
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,700
My stomach hurts.

230
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,140
Did you eat something that disagrees with you?

231
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,360
It's all your fault.

232
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,620
You make me eat strange things every day.

233
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,100
That's why this happened.

234
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,220
Look at your state, stop acting tough.

235
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,520
Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

236
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
No!

237
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,340
Well, Lord Bao isn't here.

238
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,880
If we go to the hospital on our own,

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,760
we'll attract a big crowd.

240
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,360
You care so much about your reputation.

241
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,460
I'm fine.

242
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,900
I'll just go home and get some rest. Don't mind me.

243
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,680
Fine, I'll take you home first.

244
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,960
Let's go.

245
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,800
Slow down.

246
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,960
Come on.

247
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,320
 Hello, Lord Bao.

248
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,020
Jiang Nan seems to have a bad stomach.

249
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,480
I think it might be the stomach flu.

250
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
Come over now.

251
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
But I have a meeting now.

252
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,100
 Why didn't you go to the hospital?

253
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,060
He said he doesn't want to attract a big crowd.

254
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,140
He's only willing to go when you're here.

255
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,660
How about this? I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

256
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,620
Rest here for a while.

257
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,980
Lord Bao will be here soon.

258
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,900
Where is the medicine in your house?

259
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,720
I don't know either. Try to look for them.

260
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,380
You don't even know where you put the medicine?

261
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,860
- But... 
 - Forget it, I'll go buy some for you.

262
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,580
I was so anxious that I forgot.

263
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,280
I brought medicine with me. I'll go get it for you.

264
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,500
 Why isn't she here yet?

265
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,060
 It's already 6:30.

266
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,380
 There's no reason for her not to come.

267
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,000
Come on, take your medicine.

268
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,140
That's not necessary.

269
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,400
I feel much better now. I don't need to take it.

270
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,060
You are already in this state.

271
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,320
How can you get better if you don't take medicine?

272
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,540
Water.

273
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,359
Hello, Lord Bao.

274
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,760
When will you be here?

275
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,079
 I'm stuck in traffic.

276
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
 I'll be there in a bit.

277
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,479
Okay.

278
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,180
Cheng Cheng, I feel much better now.

279
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,079
If you need to do something, just go. Don't mind me.

280
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,080
I can't leave you at home alone in this state.

281
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,140
How's this? I'll go make you some congee.

282
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,840
It'll warm up your stomach and might make you feel better.

283
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,220
 She's not suspicious at all?

284
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,140
 Have I gone too far?

285
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,280
 Never mind. That's Zhan Zhi Lin.

286
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,880
 I can't let her see him.

287
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,920
 The recital already started

288
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,620
 and Zhan Zhi Lin still hasn't seen Xu Duo Cheng.

289
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,560
 He has no idea when he started to feel an attraction towards this girl.

290
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,680
 Maybe it's because of her hope for life,

291
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,560
 her respect for the mundane,

292
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,760
 and how she cherishes the journey of life

293
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,840
 that has been missing from his life for a long time.

294
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,960
 All of these are like a ray of light that shines into his gloomy world.

295
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,540
 He believes Xu Duo Cheng will surely come to their date in the end

296
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,180
 because he knows how much Lin Yao Yin means to her.

297
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,740
 Therefore, he turns on Lin Yao Yin's playlist

298
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,480
 and quietly waits for Xu Duo Cheng's arrival in the accompaniment of piano tunes.

299
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,960
- It's hot. Be careful. 
 - I'm sorry. The traffic was really bad.

300
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,340
How is he?

301
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,840
You're here, Lord Bao.

302
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,620
Well... Lord Bao is here. You can leave now if you need to go.

303
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,980
That's right. I'm serious, Orange.

304
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,700
You can go if you need. I'll take him to the hospital later.

305
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,460
Should I go to the hospital with you guys?

306
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,260
That's okay. Well... I'll be fine if Lord Bao is here.

307
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,020
You can go now.

308
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,460
I'll be fine.

309
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,660
Lord Bao, call me if there's anything.

310
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,460
I'm leaving now.

311
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
Take it easy.

312
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,780
Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?

313
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,380
Are you okay?

314
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,320
What's going on?

315
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,700
I feel better.

316
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,860
- You're pretending. 
 - What do you mean by I'm pretending?

317
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,660
I was sick just now.

318
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,140
What's this for?

319
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,260
Don't tell me you're bullying that girl.

320
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
By the way, I have something to tell you.

321
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,580
I made an appointment with a brilliant producer.

322
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,680
What producer?

323
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,620
Haven't you heard of Chen Dong?

324
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,780
Their company presented a lot of TV shows.

325
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,280
Besides, they are planning to ask Director Guo to direct this film.

326
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,260
You can't just keep dawdling in your music territory.

327
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,220
We have to broaden our horizons, right?

328
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,520
A good singer can try acting too. Prepare to make a crossover. That's right.

329
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,160
Look at you, what a good actor you were just now.

330
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,640
That's not necessary.

331
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,440
It's not the same this time.

332
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,320
Did you receive a WeChat message? Don't pretend to not see it.

333
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,820
I already sent you the time and the location.

334
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,620
Don't be late, okay?

335
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,520
All right, got it.

336
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,820
There's more.

337
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Here's the script. Look through it carefully.

338
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,740
Take it seriously. Don't mess around.

339
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,160
Take it seriously. I'm leaving now.

340
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,080
What are you doing?

341
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,280
- Are you hungry? 
 - A little bit.

342
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,440
Let's order takeout.

343
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
Brilliant idea.

344
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,960
 The recital is over and Xu Duo Cheng is still not here.

345
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,020
 Did I overlook?

346
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,020
Why are you here?

347
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,540
I really like Lin Yao Yin too.

348
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,920
That's why I came by to check it out.

349
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,820
I still didn't make it.

350
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,020
Tonight's recital must've been spectacular, right?

351
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,500
It was spectacular, as usual,

352
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,540
but it's all right.

353
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,040
Wait for a bit longer. He'll come back again.

354
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,000
He'll come back again,

355
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,460
but I don't have much time left.

356
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,700
Stop letting your imagination run wild.

357
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,260
I'm sorry for letting you down.

358
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm a bit hungry after listening to the concert all night.

359
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll treat you to a great meal as compensation.

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
That's all right.

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,260
I really didn't expect you to come to his recital too.

362
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,960
Do you think I was deliberately waiting for you?

363
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,040
In my world, girls only wait for me not other way around.

364
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,520
Don't get the wrong idea.

365
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm just really envious that you could listen to his recital.

366
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,700
If you don't want to eat, I'll take you home.

367
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,880
That's all right.

368
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,100
Thank you.

369
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,140
I'll need to go now.

370
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

371
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,060
Why did you come back so soon?

372
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,600
 Oh, no. I didn't clean up.

373
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,100
Why are you eating these when you're sick?

374
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,380
 I'm doomed.

375
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
I didn't eat them.

376
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,820
Bao Rui ordered it. It was for him.

377
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,540
You pretended to be sick?

378
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,700
I didn't. You saw how terrible I felt earlier.

379
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,060
Stop pretending.

380
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,340
How could you do that?

381
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,060
Do you know how important it was for me?

382
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,080
Is your date with Zhan Zhi Lin that important?

383
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,960
How did you know?

384
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,380
You looked through my phone?

385
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,540
That's right. I did.

386
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,040
So what?

387
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,380
He only gave me a ticket to Lin Yao Yin's piano recital.

388
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,180
Before today, you were my idol.

389
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,800
I could forgive you no matter what you did,

390
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,500
but you've really disappointed me on this matter.

391
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,480
I've decided to sacrifice myself to be your sandbag.

392
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,220
Vent your anger on me.

393
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,200
You?

394
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,180
As long as it'll make you happy,

395
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,420
I'm willing to take a beating.

396
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,300
Wait!

397
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,300
Do it again!

398
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,060
I get scolded for not doing the work and also for doing the work!

399
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,000
She-Devil, I'll show you how I punish your dear cousin!

400
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,500
You keep imposing yourself on me! What exactly do you want?

401
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,260
Ke Qin, does your promise still count?

402
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,380
What did I promise you?

403
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,360
You said you'll be my girlfriend if I can defeat you.

404
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,520
My words always count.

405
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,320
Really?

406
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,920
Ke Qin, are you okay?

407
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,380
My hand.

408
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,280
This one.

409
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,680
 Where did Xu Duo Cheng go?

410
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,660
Xu Duo Cheng!

411
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,080
 - Hello?  
 - Hello?

412
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,160
Can you ask Yu Ke Qin if Xu Duo Cheng is with her?

413
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,080
No. I've been with Ke Qin all night and didn't see Xu Duo Cheng.

414
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,880
Enough nonsense. Hand the phone to Yu Ke Qin now.

415
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,620
It's Jiang Nan.

416
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,940
He wants to ask you about Xu Duo Cheng.

417
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,340
Why do you have Jiang Nan's number?

418
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,040
I told you we knew each other.

419
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,940
We used to be neighbors. We've been childhood friends.

420
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,780
Hello?

421
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,760
Come home with me.

422
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,160
Let go of me!

423
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm going back to my own home.

424
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I admit I've crossed the line today.

426
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,160
However, I thought you went on a date with Zhan Zhi Lin.

427
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,100
What if I did?

428
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,180
Who are you to interfere with my right to make friends?

429
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,880
I...

430
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,060
You always live in your own world.

431
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,020
Have you ever considered other people's feelings?

432
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,160
That's right.

433
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,940
Because you're a superstar.

434
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,540
I'm just a fake girlfriend who you can boss around.

435
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,160
That's not it. That has never crossed my mind.

436
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,660
You missed the recital today.

437
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,460
As long as you want, I'll surely take you to it next time he comes.

438
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,840
You just don't understand.

439
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,160
I might not have another chance once I miss tonight's recital.

440
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,620
You'll surely have another chance. It's not that serious.

441
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,540
I promise I'll make it up to you.

442
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,600
Jiang Nan, do you think everything is very easy?

443
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,740
But did you know?

444
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,660
For me, it's hard enough just to survive!

445
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,500
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

446
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,460
Starting tomorrow, you'll be a superstar

447
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,260
and I'll be Xu Duo Cheng.

448
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,880
Let's go back to our normal lives.

449
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Xu Duo Cheng.

450
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,360
Please, leave me with a happy memory of us.

451
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,140
♫  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  ♫

452
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,270
♫  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  ♫

453
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,430
♫  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  ♫

454
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:21,870
♫  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  ♫

455
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,320
 Xu Duo Cheng, you're such a loser.

456
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,920
 How can you just come back like this?

457
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,220
Drink some water. Get some rest soon.

458
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,220
It's so late. Who is it?

459
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,160
Maybe it's Chubby Zhu.

460
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Watch out!

461
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,380
Jiang Nan, what did you do to Orange?

462
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,100
Why did you make her so angry that she ran away from home?

463
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,140
- I... 
 - It's my fault.

464
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,960
My phone ran out of battery and I didn't tell him.

465
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,380
Is that true?

466
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm telling you, I don't care who you are.

467
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
You are not allowed to bully Orange.

468
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,160
Although you just agreed to do an interview,

469
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,400
that's a different story, okay?

470
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,800
Ke Qin, what happened to your hand?

471
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,400
Ask him!

472
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,620
I wanted to practice Taekwondo with her,

473
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,060
so she can vent off some frustration and relax.

474
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,780
But I accidentally used excessive force

475
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,360
and sprained her wrist.

476
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,720
Orange, why do I always get hurt?

477
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,200
Do I have a grievance with them in the previous life? I'm so pissed off.

478
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,100
All right, stop messing around.

479
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,380
Those who don't know might think I have a lion in the house.

480
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,400
All right, I'm reassured now that I see you're fine.

481
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm going home then.

482
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,180
It's the weekend.

483
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,440
Since you're already here, why don't you just stay?

484
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,500
That's right. I'll stay too.

485
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,160
That way, I can take care of Ke Qin.

486
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,400
You two will share a room. Jiang Nan and I will share a room.

487
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,540
We haven't lived together for a long time.

488
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,680
I still remember when I slept over at your house when we were children.

489
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,580
We used to play Gameboys under the blanket.

490
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,080
You'll sleep on the sofa.

491
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,760
I...

492
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,380
Orange, I'm already hurt.

493
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,180
The doctor told me to rest and recuperate at home.

494
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,200
Seems like we can't go on a trip to Jingcheng anymore.

495
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,420
That's all right.

496
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,440
There will be plenty of chances later.

497
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,840
It's getting late.

498
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,900
Let's go. I'll take you upstairs to get some rest.

499
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,500
I'll get you a towel.

500
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,260
I fell really hard today. It really hurt.

501
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,020
Really? Take it easy.

502
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,040
What are you doing?

503
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,200
What do you think they're talking about?

504
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,880
Why are they laughing so hard?

505
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,480
That's enough. You're a man.

506
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,400
Don't eavesdrop on someone else's conversation.

507
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,800
Go to sleep now.

508
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,860
This is so fake. What the hell is it?

509
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,760
I'll imitate it for you.

510
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,960
Is it scary?

511
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,280
You don't understand.

512
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,540
Ke Qin and I are finally getting together.

513
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,180
You should come to your senses.

514
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,980
Who said you're together?

515
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,060
A woman's remark always means the opposite of what is said.

516
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,400
Ke Qin and I are already living under the same roof.

517
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,280
Although we are in different rooms,

518
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,820
our relationship definitely went up a big step.

519
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,240
I've known you for years and I didn't know you have masochist tendencies.

520
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,760
How did you seal the deal with Sister-in-law?

521
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,460
Tell me about it.

522
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,620
Can you match my charm?

523
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,020
Fine, don't tell me.

524
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,720
What do you think besties will talk about when they're together?

525
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,980
Will Ke Qin talk about me?

526
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,400
 Will she talk to Yu Ke Qin about me?

527
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,340
 Why don't I hear anything?

528
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,520
What a pig.

529
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,760
- Good morning. 
 - Morning.

530
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,860
Chubby Zhu was gone early this morning.

531
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,340
Did Ke Qin and him leave?

532
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,800
Ke Qin is sleeping in my room.

533
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,760
Surprise!

534
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,780
You usually sleep till noon.

535
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,520
I didn't expect you to go grocery shopping so early in the morning.

536
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,520
What? In order for my Ke Qin to recover successfully,

537
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,360
I certainly have to buy the freshest ingredients for her.

538
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,060
Chicken feet, duck feet, and pig trotters?

539
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,300
Duck breast, chicken breast?

540
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,920
Eat what you want to supplement, right?

541
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,660
What should I supplement?

542
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,000
- I... 
 - I'm so perfect. What do I need to supplement?

543
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,720
Tell me, what do I need to supplement when I'm already perfect?

544
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,200
Get over here! Whose fault was it that my arm turned out this way?

545
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,160
All right, all right.

546
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,440
Chicken breast, duck breast...

547
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,940
Oh, my God.

548
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,840
The food is so good at your house.

549
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,980
Orange is a great cook.

550
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,852
You're her bestie. You didn't know?

551
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:47,320
Someone volunteered to make this dish.

552
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,080
I made all the other dishes.

553
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,480
Start eating.

554
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,020
Sister-in-law, you are such a good cook.

555
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,880
You're worthy of being a descendant from a family of chefs.

556
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,120
Brother Nan is so lucky to find a wife like you.

557
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,220
Actually, we're not...

558
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,900
Come on, eat more.

559
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,520
Since Jiang Nan is your buddy,

560
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,280
tell your cousin, Sister Shan, to cut them some slack.

561
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,380
I can't do anything about my cousin.

562
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,980
Qin Shan is your cousin?

563
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,780
Why haven't you mentioned it before?

564
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,380
When she started True Image, I was already studying abroad.

565
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,620
I didn't have time to tell you.

566
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:28,980
Honey, come on.

567
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,020
Try this.

568
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,959
Work with me.

569
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,119
It's delicious. Come on, you try one too.

570
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,160
Does it taste good?

571
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,600
Yes.

572
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,360
Can you stop feeding us dog food? 
  (T/N: Can you stop the PDA?)

573
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,660
Don't forget there are two single dogs sitting across you.

574
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,320
If don't want to be single anymore,

575
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,060
I can cooperate at any time.

576
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,240
Just eat! Why can't all this food keep your mouth busy?

577
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,300
I'm already being so proactive.

578
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,580
Why won't she just accept me?

579
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,220
Because Ke Qin is not focused on love now.

580
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,620
What is she focused on then?

581
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,200
As you mentioned before, the exclusive scoop.

582
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,580
Seems like an exclusive interview isn't enough.

583
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,960
The way Jiang Nan looked at you dotingly gave me so many goosebumps.

584
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,620
It's not like you don't know it's not real between us.

585
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,120
You know very well whether it's real or fake.

586
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,160
I only acted like that for Zhu Lin Feng.

587
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,720
If you two were faking it, you deserve an Oscar.

588
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,860
Don't use Zhu Lin Feng as an excuse.

589
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,220
I know you so well.

590
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,520
The way you look at Jiang Nan isn't normal either.

591
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,420
How is it not normal?

592
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,260
Just admit it. You already fell for him.

593
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,700
If you keep staying here, you'll have to spend the rest of your life with him.

594
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,020
The rest of my life?

595
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,320
 Do I have the rest of my life to spend with Jiang Nan?

596
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,140
Let me be the first to know if you're getting married.

597
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,380
I'll be your bridesmaid.

598
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,700
Enough about me.

599
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,780
Let's talk about you and Zhu Lin Feng.

600
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,220
He listens to everything you say.

601
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,200
Maybe you should just accept him.

602
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,400
He's not my type.

603
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,780
My boyfriend must be someone who everyone admires.

604
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,860
I have an idea.

605
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,220
Brother Nan, you are like my real brother.

606
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,540
Please, help me.

607
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,060
Chubby Zhu is at the most someone who admires me.

608
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,420
Does your marriage with Sister-in-law count as a big scoop?

609
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,560
Why don't you have a shotgun marriage?

610
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,280
Wouldn't Ke Qin get that big scoop?

611
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,720
Once she accomplishes her career issue, she'll have time for me.

612
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,240
You fatso, what kind of weird logic is that?

613
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,800
Don't misunderstand me.

614
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,960
Misunderstand what?

615
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,040
Pack your things and get out of here.

616
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,900
Don't be in the way of the young couple.

617
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,640
Ke Qin.

618
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:46,760

619
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:57,634
♫  I walked past many side roads before you met me  ♫

620
00:37:57,634 --> 00:38:04,048
♫  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  ♫

621
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:12,045
♫  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  ♫

♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

626
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:35,271

627
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,944

00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:50,845
♫  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  ♫

644
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:54,825
♫  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  ♫

645
00:39:54,825 --> 00:40:01,272
♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

646
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:04,663
♫  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  ♫

647
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:08,797
♫  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  ♫

648
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:11,831
♫  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  ♫

649
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:15,630
♫  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  ♫

650
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,973
♫  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  ♫

651
00:40:18,973 --> 00:40:23,035
♫  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  ♫

652
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:27,150
♫  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  ♫

653
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:33,539
♫  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  ♫
