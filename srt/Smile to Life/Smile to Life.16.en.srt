1
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
What are you doing here?

2
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
I'm here if you need me.

3
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,320
Giving a helping hand in the snow,

4
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
many Chengzhen are gone.

5
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,360
Orange,

6
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,480
why would I lie to you about this?

7
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm telling you,

8
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
don't worry.

9
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,280
What about you now?

10
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,000
He's a fan of the authorities,

11
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,440
so he asked me, a bystander, to analyze it for you.

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,240
I still can't figure out one thing,

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,160
I can clearly feel it,

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,720
Many oranges really like me.

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,480
Why does she always reject me?

16
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,480
That's right.

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,360
Right?

18
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,760
Even though she refused me,

19
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
but when my mom was in trouble,

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,080
She worked so hard

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,200
and worked so hard,

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,880
Is it not because of me at all?

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,800
That is,

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
even if she really doesn't like me,

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,720
It's not that urgent to pack up and move them.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,560
That's right.

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,680
It shouldn't be.

28
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,040
Are you here to pay tribute?

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,640
Come up with an idea.

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,520
Actually, I think this

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,040
is a good thing.

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
It's a good thing.

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,720
Think about it,

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,120
If she doesn't want to fall in love with you,

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,960
or be with you,

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Can't you just say it?

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,920
Why are you so extreme?

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,480
There's only one possibility,

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
that is, she's running away.

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,200
Escape from what?

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,760
To run away from my feelings for you.

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,840
But,

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
where exactly is she stuck?

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
You have to ask her face to face.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,520
We can die clearly even if we die.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
I'd like to ask her face to face.

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
She doesn't attend classes at the musical instrument store

48
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
to avoid me now.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,680
She stayed at Yu Keqin's house all day,

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
and finally celebrated her birthday today,

51
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,000
I have a chance to meet her.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,240
Now I even missed this opportunity.

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
I don't even know where to find her.

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Where's your father-in-law?

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,920
It's impossible for her not to have family fun all the time.

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,360
Wake up the person in your dream in a single word.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,480
Of course.

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,880
I told you that you're obsessed

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,520
with the situation.

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,760
Go play coquetry with your father-in-law and beg him.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,280
Orange will come out to see you

62
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
sooner or later. Good for you.

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
The ginger is still old and spicy.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,680
What's wrong with you?

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,520
Wisdom,

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Do you understand?

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,360
Have some.

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,680
Only when you're full will you be able to fight.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,079
Where are the fillings?

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,399
Pay attention to discretion

71
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,200
and strength,

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,960
Tell me,

73
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,160
how did you bully Chengcheng?

74
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
Tell me

75
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,040
the truth. Don't lie.

76
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,080
Uncle,

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,920
in fact, over the years,

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,040
I've been living alone

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
until Chengcheng and you guys showed up,

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,120
That's why I feel the warmth of home again.

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you flirting with me?

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,840
About you and Chengcheng,

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,200
Uncle,

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,960
I really like Chengcheng.

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,680
How could I bully her?

86
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,360
But she's been

87
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,760
a little angry lately,

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
He doesn't talk to me much.

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,080
Of course,

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,280
there must be something wrong with me.

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,040
So?

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,480
I came to see you today.

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
I just want you to do me a favor.

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Ask her out.

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
And then?

96
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,800
I'll make her a big table of her favorite dishes.

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,200
Is that okay?

98
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,640
You're quite responsible.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,120
Tell me.

100
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
What are you cooking?

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,800
Well,

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,480
I don't know how to do it.

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,160
So I came to learn art from you today.

104
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,360
Are you going to learn art from me in this outfit?

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,040
It's a bit inappropriate.

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,600
By the way,

107
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
the rose at the door

108
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,080
is from you, right?

109
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,840
It's expensive, isn't it?

110
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,680
Do you want to propose to Chengcheng?

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,000
Let me tell you,

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
Chengcheng is still young,

113
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,080
I want to keep her for a few more years.

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,800
It's not a proposal.

115
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,440
Apologize,

116
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,160
Dalin,

117
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,280
Sending flowers is just an apology ceremony.

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,960
If you propose to me,

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,000
it won't be that simple.

120
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,600
Am I right?

121
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,720
So I'd like to ask you

122
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,040
to put in a good word for me,

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,840
Look me in the eye.

124
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
Are you serious?

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
What should we do?

126
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,680
Chengcheng likes perch the most,

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,720
so let's make tinfoil perch,

128
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,240
No, no, no.

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,320
We've ordered all the fish for lunch.

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,440
Replenishment is in the afternoon.

131
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,840
Why don't we exchange it for something else?

132
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,520
I can't do that.

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,400
If you want to cook, just make Chengcheng's favorite,

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,520
and I'll go buy perch now.

135
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,320
Wait for me.

136
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,520
No.

137
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,440
Dalin,

138
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,440
No,

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,720
If you don't choose vegetables,

140
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,840
why are you picking flowers here?

141
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,880
How bad it would be if Jiang Nan came back to see it?

142
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,920
I don't care.

143
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Dressed like that,

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,000
why did he make such a bouquet of flowers?

145
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,520
He even said that

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
marriage proposal is a good thing.

147
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
Proposing is a good thing. Proposing is good.

148
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,720
What's good?

149
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,280
What if Chengcheng can't figure it out and agrees?

150
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,760
Chengcheng,

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,680
Dalin,

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
What did you just say?

153
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,480
Chengcheng,

154
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
don't listen to him.

155
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,480
By that day, you'll be all dressed up,

156
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,480
Chengcheng.

157
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,680
Tell me,

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,560
you ruined the surprise.

159
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,880
You really don't keep your mouth shut?

160
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Looks like it's not a surprise.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,080
It's a shock.

162
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,400
Chengcheng doesn't want to, right?

163
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,440
Mr. Wang,

164
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,760
let me ask you one last question,

165
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,080
As a star investor,

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,840
do you have any suggestions for young people?

167
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
As long as I keep my feet on the ground,

168
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,600
I'll watch from afar,

169
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,000
It's good that you don't disturb her.

170
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,920
Keqin is so charming at work.

171
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,480
Mr. Wang,

172
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
you are indeed a star investor.

173
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,240
After talking to you,

174
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,160
I learned a lot about investment,

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,400
Thank you for taking the interview with Truth in your busy schedule.

176
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
Miss Yu, you flatter me.

177
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
It's a small gift. I can't accept

178
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,679
such an expensive gift.

179
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,039
Actually,

180
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm the best investment capital.

181
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
Miss Yu, you don't understand this, do you?

182
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,840
I want to

183
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,960
To get to know you better.

184
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,880
Mr. Wang,

185
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
I'm afraid you have some misunderstanding about me.

186
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
I especially like girls like you who just left school,

187
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,160
who are simple and pure,

188
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,080
Miss Yu,

189
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,280
what kind of person do you think we are?

190
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,920
Who are you?

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,760
Let go of me.

192
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You brat is looking for a fight.

193
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,520
Wang Wei

194
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,720
Keqin,

195
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,200
have a seat.

196
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,680
You're awesome.

197
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,160
Me,

198
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm fine if you don't show up these days,

199
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,720
why do you make trouble for me when you show up?

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,400
Tell me,

201
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
can you beat him?

202
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,680
Can he beat me?

203
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Then why are you showing off?

204
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,880
Why are you everywhere?

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm really surprised.

206
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,320
If I see him touching you,

207
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
can I not do it?

208
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
As a man,

209
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,880
how can I watch the woman I love

210
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,720
being bullied?

211
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,000
I did it for you.

212
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,440
Then who am I doing this for?

213
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
If he hadn't hit you,

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,520
would I have kicked you so hard?

215
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,360
So you did it to save me, too?

216
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,520
Don't tell me

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,720
about your kick,

218
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,920
He's really handsome.

219
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,360
To be honest,

220
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,880
the thought of being scolded by your sister again,

221
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,960
I want to kick you, too.

222
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Sister.

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,880
Sis,

224
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,360
It's not our fault.

225
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,160
That Wang Wei is a scumbag.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,080
Is that what he said?

227
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,040
Even so,

228
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,880
you can't beat him to the hospital.

229
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,520
Me

230
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,480
Yu Keqin, don't you know how to refuse?

231
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,800
When a reporter calls the interviewee to the hospital,

232
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,720
do you want to make headlines in the news?

233
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,800
Sis,

234
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,680
I did it.

235
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
If you want to blame me,

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,120
what's the use of blaming you

237
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
for the one million yuan

238
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,920
I spent on the advertising fee?

239
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,000
Sis Shan,

240
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,160
your salary will be halved this month.

241
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,200
Pay for Mr. Wang's medical expenses.

242
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,920
Don't let me see you two again.

243
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,080
Keqin,

244
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
don't be sad.

245
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
My sister has a venomous mouth.

246
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
What do you know?

247
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm sad about my salary,

248
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,360
Qin Shan,

249
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
How do you care about the servants?

250
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm giving you face,

251
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,040
so I accepted the interview.

252
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,800
Well,

253
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,360
look at you.

254
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,640
Here,

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,920
you hurt me like this.

256
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,360
Mr. Wang, you must have been kicked out of your mind, right?

257
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,320
Don't you remember why you were beaten?

258
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,360
What do you mean?

259
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
Let me remind you.

260
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,600
You were beaten by Yu Keqin because of sexual harassment.

261
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,800
Qin Shan,

262
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,120
let me tell you,

263
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
You can eat the food,

264
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,000
but you can't talk nonsense.

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,480
The coffee shop where I asked you to meet me.

266
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
Our interviews are basically held there.

267
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
If you forget,

268
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
I can get the surveillance footage.

269
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Make sure what should be taken is not taken.

270
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,920
You can see it.

271
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,080
When the press release is accompanied by surveillance screenshots,

272
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
it will be difficult for you to attract attention if you don't want to.

273
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,000
I've figured out the title,

274
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,680
"Star investor harassing female reporters. ",

275
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,680
He was beaten and admitted to the hospital.

276
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
It's simple and direct.

277
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm here to warn you,

278
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
As for this matter,

279
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,200
that's enough.

280
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,640
Silly boy.

281
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
You were fooled by the fishmonger.

282
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
For this fresh fish,

283
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,080
the mouth of the fish is tightly closed.

284
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,960
Your eyes are black and white.

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,360
What did you buy?

286
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
You can't even pick a fish.

287
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,200
You're so good-looking but useless,

288
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,400
just like people,

289
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,840
Fancy.

290
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,920
Chengcheng won't like you.

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,480
Lin,

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,840
what are you talking about?

293
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,480
Master,

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
I'm telling the truth.

295
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,520
Chengcheng won't agree to his proposal.

296
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,520
Who said that?

297
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,440
I heard it in the kitchen just now.

298
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,720
Chengcheng came just now.

299
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
She left as soon as she heard the proposal.

300
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Chengcheng just arrived.

301
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,960
How can Chengcheng hear me?

302
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,920
Me,

303
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,040
Who in Dalin

304
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
can fall in love with each other?

305
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,960
Why are you following me around?

306
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,240
Master,

307
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm doing this for Chengcheng's own good.

308
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,120
See you at the amusement park at 8 PM.

309
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
I want to talk to you.

310
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,200
Uncle,

311
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Chengcheng contacted me,

312
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll get ready.

313
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm leaving.

314
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Lin,

315
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,760
you're worse than this fish.

316
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,920
Can you do me a favor?

317
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,320
Chengcheng,

318
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,040
you're here.

319
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,040
Jiang Nan,

320
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
I asked you to come here today,

321
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
I just want to tell you,

322
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,080
don't look for me everywhere.

323
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,600
Don't bother Keqin.

324
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,040
And don't have fun with your family anymore.

325
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
We made a mistake in the beginning.

326
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,600
We were forced to open our business,

327
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,120
and ended quietly like this.

328
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Isn't that great?

329
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,960
But I can feel it.

330
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
You have me in your heart.

331
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
Jiang Nan,

332
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,960
if my previous concern,

333
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,480
I made you misunderstand.

334
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,880
I apologize to you,

335
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,720
we can't be together.

336
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,200
What concerns do you have?

337
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,440
Tell me if you have any questions.

338
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
We can face it together.

339
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,400
We solved it together.

340
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,320
How on earth can you understand?

341
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,080
I have someone I like.

342
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,600
I don't believe

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,560
you did it on purpose, right?

344
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,480
I don't want to hurt you like this.

345
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,920
But this is the truth.

346
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,280
Do you know what you're talking about?

347
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,440
He said,

348
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
I don't want to see you again.

349
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
What does it have to do with you?

350
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
He said he didn't want to see you.

351
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're going to do it, aren't you?

352
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,480
Many oranges,

353
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
even if you can fool others,

354
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,560
Can you fool yourself?

355
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't like you.

356
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
What can I say to make you believe it?

357
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,080
Many oranges.

358
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,240
I don't believe it.

359
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,720
All of this is fake.

360
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,920
Do you believe me this time?

361
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,280
Thank you for taking me home.

362
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,440
Many oranges,

363
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
do you think after kissing me,

364
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,240
Then you'll be fine.

365
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,880
Zhan Zhilin,

366
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,240
thank you for helping me out just now.

367
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,359
But I really didn't expect that

368
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,800
you would do it that way.

369
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,800
So you're really

370
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,400
going to ignore Jiang Nan.

371
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,880
Won't you regret it in the future?

372
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,480
You saw what happened tonight.

373
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,240
There won't be any future

374
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,320
between Jiang Nan and me.

375
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,240
All right. You

376
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,680
can go upstairs.

377
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,400
I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow morning.

378
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,600
No, thanks.

379
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,920
I can go by myself.

380
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,280
See you at 9: 00.

381
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,840
You didn't sleep all night?

382
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,000
Where's Orange?

383
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,000
If you ask me,

384
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,400
it's just

385
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,920
disappointment in love right now,

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
We have to be proud of

387
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,400
our careers. For you,

388
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
The best way to heal is to work.

389
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,240
I'm telling you,

390
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,760
I've already made an appointment with Alex,

391
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,880
Let's meet him this afternoon.

392
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,920
I think

393
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,640
we can really go to this project,

394
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,320
It took me a lot of effort to make an appointment.

395
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,760
Don't say you won't go.

396
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm telling you,

397
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,040
Okay,

398
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,520
I'll go.

399
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,880
Are you sure?

400
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,880
I'll go to the hospital to see Doudou first.

401
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
I promised him before.

402
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,640
I'll contact you this afternoon.

403
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,880
Wash your face.

404
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,880
I'll take it myself.

405
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,920
Thank you.

406
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,520
As for you,

407
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,160
besides saying thank you to me,

408
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,160
Won't you tell me anything else?

409
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,120
Actually, you don't have to come with me.

410
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,320
Seeing a doctor and taking medicine,

411
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,880
I've long been used to it.

412
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,880
You're not responsible for me.

413
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,280
You don't want me to be responsible for you.

414
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Zhan Zhilin,

415
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm just kidding.

416
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,080
You're a man

417
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,280
who takes it seriously.

418
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,440
Where are you going?

419
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,920
Go back to Ke's

420
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,200
in-laws. Let me drive you home.

421
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
No, thanks.

422
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,280
If Jiang Nan blocks you downstairs,

423
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I can share it with you.

424
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,360
Right?

425
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,760
Let's go.

426
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,080
Doudou,

427
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,400
this is the book you mentioned last time,

428
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,640
I specially found it for you.

429
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,400
Do you like it?

430
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,920
I like it.

431
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,200
Thank you, Jiang Nan.

432
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,560
By the way, Jiang Nan,

433
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,800
Pudding has eaten up all the dog food you brought.

434
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,440
It's really delicious that you bought it.

435
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,640
Pudding,

436
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,760
you named it,

437
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,800
It's so nice.

438
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,040
That's

439
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Brother Jiang Nan,

440
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Didn't we agree that

441
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,480
you would come with Chengcheng?

442
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,160
What's wrong with Chengcheng?

443
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,640
She's fine.

444
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,800
She's just a little busy lately.

445
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,920
Next time,

446
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Next time, I'll visit you with Chengcheng.

447
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,880
Okay?

448
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,560
Doudou,

449
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,840
it's time to take your medicine.

450
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,040
Don't pester your brother Jiang Nan.

451
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,240
Mom,

452
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,960
No, I don't.

453
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,000
Be good,

454
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,640
No.

455
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,800
Let me do it.

456
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,720
Thank you.

457
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,920
One piece.

458
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,160
Come on.

459
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,080
None of the ten plans can be used,

460
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,120
which is not idol gossip,

461
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,680
It's just a rumor about the illegitimate child

462
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,400
of a star. Please figure it out,

463
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,320
The truth is the news media,

464
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,640
not the paparazzi marketing account,

465
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
That's what netizens eat when they eat melons.

466
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
If you don't do something exciting,

467
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,560
you won't get 100 thousand.

468
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,080
Is your news true?

469
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,080
You dare to send out news when you're not sure.

470
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,440
Taking a picture of a minor's face without even hitting the code,

471
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
it's not professional ethics for you to do so.

472
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Who's going to watch it if we don't put some good stuff in it?

473
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,200
And I wrote "Suspected" on it, didn't I?

474
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,040
We won't take the responsibility then.

475
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,160
I'll say it one last time.

476
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,680
If I see

477
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,920
this kind of gossip headline party again,

478
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
You don't have to see me anymore.

479
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,520
You just want to get mad at me.

480
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,480
He's just one level higher than me.

481
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
All right, don't be mad.

482
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
Now that the company is facing financial problems,

483
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,760
she has a temper,

484
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,720
It's inevitable.

485
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,840
Mr. Alex,

486
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,440
you've listened to Jiang Nan's new song,

487
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,000
Now his songs have a very good response,

488
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,360
and his earnings on paid websites

489
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
are also very good.

490
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,200
Besides,

491
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,160
my time is limited,

492
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,040
Let's get straight to the point.

493
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,120
Okay,

494
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
As you all know,

495
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,160
the first season of this show was so popular,

496
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,200
So this season,

497
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
I have no shortage of singers I want to be with.

498
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,040
Yes.

499
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,880
Although some people strongly recommend you to me,

500
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,880
I also recognize your strength.

501
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,600
But this time,

502
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,400
apart from the label "Strength Singer",

503
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,440
We need something else.

504
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,880
To meet the expectations of the market.

505
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,840
What do you mean?

506
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,480
I heard that you have a girlfriend,

507
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
who was on a lot of hot searches a while ago

508
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,040
and the heroine of the short music film is also her.

509
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,080
Here's the thing Mr. Alex,

510
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,920
that girl was surprised,

511
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,160
Outside the circle,

512
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,800
she doesn't know anything about our industry.

513
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,720
It's okay.

514
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
You just need to talk about it,

515
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,000
During the broadcast of the program,

516
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,920
what was Jiang Nan's life and love

517
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,280
situation like?

518
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,320
How to launch it together with the effect of the program.

519
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,240
After discussing this,

520
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,000
let's continue our conversation.

521
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,240
Well,

522
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,040
what do you mean?

523
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,080
It's very simple. It's just that

524
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,920
your people set it up during the broadcast of the program,

525
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,880
You can discuss it with your girlfriend.

526
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,560
A singer with a topic,

527
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,600
plus your previous experience,

528
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm sure I can make it out of the circle.

529
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,360
It's even hotter than before.

530
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,040
Yes.

531
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,560
Sorry,

532
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,880
my personal life is not a variety show,

533
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
There's no need to show it to everyone.

534
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,640
I just want to sing well,

535
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,360
no matter how good your song is,

536
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
It's useless if no one knows.

537
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,520
Yes

538
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,880
What you need to do is to get people to notice you.

539
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
That's why I noticed your song.

540
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,440
It can only be said that

541
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,320
we have different ideas,

542
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,400
Sorry to bother you.

543
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,560
Mr. Alex,

544
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,200
please don't mind that.

545
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,560
What about the music maker?

546
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,440
Your brain is a bit stubborn.

547
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,400
How about this?

548
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,800
I'll go back and persuade him.

549
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,040
I'll keep in touch.

550
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,040
I'll talk to him.

551
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,040
Sorry to bother you.

552
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,040
Jiang, Jiang,

553
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,960
so soon?

554
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,600
I thought you were going to stay in there for a long time.

555
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm used to the way

556
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
you walk away.

557
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,320
If I don't walk inside, I'll be scolded for you.

558
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,800
Rui,

559
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm sorry,

560
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,640
I used to be a little willful,

561
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,720
but what's wrong with you today?

562
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Did you take the wrong medicine?

563
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Or is it because of Orange?

564
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,080
What about me?

565
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,000
I think you two should calm down first.

566
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,760
You can talk to her after this time.

567
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,560
Right?

568
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
It's too late for her to avoid me now.

569
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,040
Let's focus on our career.

570
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,400
Actually, what Alex said today,

571
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,640
I think it makes sense.

572
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,440
We can sing first,

573
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,880
right?

574
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,400
And then,

575
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,080
let's not talk about it,

576
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,120
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

577
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,920
I knew it.

578
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,520
Jiang,

579
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
listen to my advice,

580
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,880
It's the right time for us to sing now.

581
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,520
I'm not thinking about those things right now.

582
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,280
If you are frustrated in love,

583
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,600
you have to be proud in your career.

584
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,080
Makeup artist,

585
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,800
I'm about to take a photo here.

586
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
Come and fix my makeup first.

587
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,640
Miss Gu, please wait a moment.

588
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,920
I'll be ready soon.

589
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
It's her play that matters.

590
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,480
Or is my play more important?

591
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm sorry, Miss Gu,

592
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,800
but this notice has been changed temporarily.

593
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,200
Sis,

594
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,040
Let me help you.

595
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,680
By the way,

596
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,000
today is the day when Jiang Nan and Alex meet.

597
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,520
Although I've already told you in advance,

598
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm not sure about Jiang Nan's temper.

599
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,840
Ask for more information.

600
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,680
Xiao Fu,

601
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,840
Mr. Liang, you're here.

602
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,360
What do you think?

603
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,000
Did it go well?

604
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,920
It's going well.

605
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
This flower is your favorite.

606
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,560
This is for you.

607
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

608
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,200
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

609
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,080
Take a good picture.

610
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,440
Come on!

611
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,560
Bye.

612
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,840
I heard that

613
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
Mr. Liang asked her to bring money into the team,

614
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
Who did I think it was?

615
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,680
So it was arranged by Mr. Liang.

616
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,160
But when it comes to acting,

617
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,640
the camera doesn't care who you are.

618
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,600
Of course,

619
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Kang,

620
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,120
It's still spicy.

621
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,560
I'm still young,

622
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,760
I need your advice in the future.

623
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,800
Jiayi,

624
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,480
Okay.

625
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,440
See you in the play.

626
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Jiacheng,

627
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,800
let's have lunch together later.

628
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,440
Okay.

629
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,640
Isn't this

630
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,640
Senior? Senior,

631
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,240
Unexpectedly,

632
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,040
the best host fell on me this time.

633
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,040
You're going to broadcast the late-night news.

634
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,640
I'm so sorry.

635
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,440
Congratulations,

636
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,280
Senior. Don't worry.

637
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,760
What about me?

638
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,480
I'll take over from you

639
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
and work with

640
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,400
Jiacheng.

641
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,880
At one time, I thought,

642
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,680
you and the truth of the news were all I had.

643
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,720
But I don't know since when,

644
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,480
we have gradually embarked on

645
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,080
two completely different paths.

646
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,400
My feelings

647
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
are in it,

648
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,800
My youth,

649
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,520
my dream,

650
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,080
Now I'll give it back to you.

651
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,240
Shi, let me explain.

652
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,920
Me,

653
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,800
I will always remember

654
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,280
our beauty.

655
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,040
Better than

656
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,320
Jiayi,

657
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,120
Director,

658
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,960
you're in a great state today.

659
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,920
Very good.

660
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,840
Thank you, director.

661
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,320
Very good Director,

662
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,360
Xiaofu,

663
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,800
Look,

664
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,120
Jiayi

665
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,440
is in such a good state,

666
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,320
What's wrong with you?

667
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,760
That scene just now,

668
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,560
you did a great job.

669
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,040
It must be the relationship between us.

670
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,800
You think too much.

671
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,400
This is my professional quality.

672
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,360
You can hold whoever you want?

673
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,640
You don't have to show it to me.

674
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,800
Jealous.

675
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,560
As long as you listen to me,

676
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,080
I'll take care of you,

677
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,800
You will always be the best actress.

678
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,040
But with me,

679
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,000
you're not even a nominee.

680
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,200
My best male lead,

681
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,480
is coming back to me soon.

682
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,280
But Jiang Nan and many oranges,

683
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
I've told you before,

684
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,800
Many oranges are no match for me.

685
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,560
Jiang Nan only belongs to me,

686
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Jiayi.

687
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,160
We have news from Alex.

688
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,760
His assistant said that

689
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Jiang Nan's cooperation talks collapsed.

690
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,960
I know why

691
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,560
I didn't tell you the details.

692
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
Jiang Nan.

693
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,160
Got it.

694
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,960
Okay.

695
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,840
Mr. Liang,

696
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,360
let's find out the truth,

697
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,720
We're really short of money,

698
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,160
and we're considering a share transfer.

699
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,240
Keep an eye on him.

700
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,040
Buy it at a good price.

701
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,520
We're not in the media industry. Why would we buy it?

702
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,240
Why do you think I've been raising Kiki?

703
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
What I like is the influence of the truth,

704
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,640
I know I can use it sooner or later.

705
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,440
I've been raising troops

706
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,640
for thousands of days. I'll contact her later.

707
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,640
By the way,

708
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,520
make an appointment with Alex,

709
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,400
Tell him I need to talk to him about the investment.

710
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,480
Okay,

711
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,320
Go ahead.

712
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,639
Can you lend me some paper?

713
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,000
How about this?

714
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,000
I'll exchange the ticket with you.

715
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,719
This is Jiang Nan's ticket.

716
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,679
You can change the wrapping paper anyway.

717
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,000
Auntie,

718
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,239
let me tell you,

719
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
When I was cleaning the living room today,

720
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,560
I found an earring,

721
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,920
See if it's Chengcheng's aunt.

722
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,840
You scared me to death.

723
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
I thought something happened to my mom again.

724
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,880
It's okay.

725
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,080
Caiyun is fine.

726
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,719
Don't worry,

727
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,679
Auntie.

728
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,760
Thank you.

729
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,719
Thank you for your hard work.

730
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,199
It doesn't matter.

731
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,600
Don't be so polite to me.

732
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,000
Get back to work.

733
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,600
I'll send you a photo of the earring.

734
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,480
What are you doing here?

735
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,400
I lost my earring.

736
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,560
I'm looking for earrings.

737
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,760
Please

738
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,600
stay by my side all the time.

739
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,240
Okay?

740
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,800
She just likes me.

741
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,480
Auntie,

742
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
that earring is Chengcheng's,

743
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,480
I'll ask Du to go get it now.

744
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,040
Okay,

745
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,960
I was waiting for

746
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,120
a lot of oranges at home,

747
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,960
We have to improvise again.

748
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,160
Turn around,

749
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,360
turn around,

750
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,880
Where are you going?

751
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I can go anywhere.

752
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,800
I can't see him anymore.

753
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
Let me take you to a place.

754
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,760
Zhan Zhilin's car.

755
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
Sleep for a while if you're tired.

756
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,400
It's quite a long way.

757
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,360
Thank you.

758
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,760
Sorry to trouble you again.

759
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,480
Many oranges,

760
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,760
what if you really want to thank me?

761
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,600
Don't always say thank you to me.

762
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,160
I'm sorry,

763
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,760
these words,

764
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,360
Is that okay?
