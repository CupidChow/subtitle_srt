1
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,360
Many oranges,

2
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,760
you promised me you wouldn't tell anyone about this.

3
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,840
If you dare to tell anyone, just wait and see.

4
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,040
Jiang,

5
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
why are you still playing?

6
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
I asked you to buy skin care products.

7
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,120
That's all you bought.

8
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
Look at your eyes. It's been

9
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
a year's worth of skin care products.

10
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,240
Are you eating it for dinner?

11
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
Many oranges are so healthy,

12
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,280
she,

13
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
Maybe he really eats skin care products for food.

14
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,320
What are you looking at?

15
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm picking out clothes for you.

16
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,480
Pick out clothes.

17
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
You don't have any clothes to wear.

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,360
When I see my parents wearing it,

19
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
I'll tell you that they all like to dress steadily,

20
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,000
Your fashion doesn't work with them.

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
For the first time today,

22
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,360
you must pay attention to it.

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
Aren't you single?

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,080
Where did you get so much experience?

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,040
You're right.

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,280
Let me tell you,

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm really good at this.

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
First of all,

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
your parents are looking for a son-in-law.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
We have to find a suitable person

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
with a stable job,

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,360
Am I right?

33
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,040
She wants to be nice to her daughter.

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
You have a good personality and don't care,

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,640
but you miss you,

36
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,480
The work is bleak.

37
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,360
He's not gentle with girls,

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,000
though he's not a playboy,

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,760
But with your temper,

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,360
Rui,

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Are you serious?

42
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm so bad.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
Not very serious,

44
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,920
but,

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
How you behave depends on yourself.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
She has to go through her parents first.

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,080
How?

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,520
First of all,

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,960
put on this suit.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,520
Secondly,

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
I'll give you a few tricks.

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
You just caught her mother and praised her.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,880
It can praise everything in the sky and nothing on the earth.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,720
As the saying goes,

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,240
Mother-in-law likes her son-in-law more and more.

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,880
Go on.

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,560
Don't lose a man's face. Okay,

58
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
okay, okay. I got it.

59
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm telling you, I got it.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,320
Pay special attention to it for the first time.

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,280
-Got it. -Bye. Bye.

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,160
Unstable job and bad temper,

63
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,680
am I that bad?

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,760
What's the next schedule?

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,560
It's gone.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,480
Isn't there a commercial shooting?

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,640
That's canceled.

68
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,680
When did you

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
cancel it?

70
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,200
It was just notified.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,360
They said there was a new employee over there.

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,640
and

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
It's Mr. Liang's idea.

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,600
Hey,

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
Now you call me, don't you?

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,760
What's wrong?

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
Mr. Liang is angry.

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
If I am angry,

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
Then it's not about advertising.

80
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,040
Got it?

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,320
It seems that Mr. Liang is trying to cut off my financial resources.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
I beg you.

83
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,040
Miss Gu is begging me now.

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,960
I beg you to check it online.

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,280
I've been busy for so long,

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
it's time for me to take a holiday.

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,680
Enjoy life

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,040
and love.

89
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,760
Give yourself a break

90
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
and take some time off.

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,560
Go with whoever you like?

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm not going anyway.

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
What are you going to tell your parents this time?

94
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Chengcheng,

95
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,000
your boyfriend is here.

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,200
Something's wrong with the atmosphere,

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,160
boyfriend?

98
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,840
How old are you?

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,480
27 years old, uncle.

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
What does it belong to?

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,360
Chicken?

102
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,240
What blood type?

103
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,920
O-shape?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,600
What constellation?

105
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,200
Virgo,

106
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,440
I've been in love a few times.

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Just

108
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,720
We talked about it

109
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,560
when we were in college. What did I say?

110
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
If you say it once,

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,640
you won't say it twice.

112
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,400
It's not too fake.

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,440
Do you believe it?

114
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,360
All right. Prepare

115
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,520
the dishes.

116
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,880
What do you like about Chengcheng?

117
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Chengcheng's pleasure

118
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
in helping others,

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,560
He's warm-hearted and kind,

120
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,080
asking for nothing in return.

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,120
Yes.

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,920
That's right.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,040
That's what we've been teaching Chengcheng.

124
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,760
What's the most important thing to be a man?

125
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,960
You have to be kind

126
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,760
and tolerant.

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Help people without asking for anything in return.

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Our child is very simple,

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,080
you tell me, I tell you,

130
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,680
Tell me

131
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,240
So fake.

132
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,560
Jiang Nan,

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,040
you have a lot of social experience,

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,040
I don't think so.

135
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,920
Chengcheng is in a relationship for the first time,

136
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,320
but she's still in the lactation stage,

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
We only have such a precious daughter,

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,360
we don't want her to be wronged at all.

139
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't worry about that,

140
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,760
uncle and aunt.

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,920
I'll take good care of Chengcheng.

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
With what guarantee?

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,640
That's right.

144
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,960
It's a signature cold dish,

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
smooth-tongued.

146
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
Dry pot specialty,

147
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,159
stir-fried signature hot dishes

148
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,560
with flowers,

149
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
Big pig's trotter,

150
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,680
nourishing good product,

151
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,520
Tortoise tortoise,

152
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,320
I'll let you try my specialty again,

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,600
Heart, liver, spleen and lung,

154
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,960
Tell me,

155
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,760
With what guarantee?

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Really?

157
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,320
Of course it's true.

158
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,840
Auntie,

159
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,480
if you don't tell me,

160
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,920
I really thought you were a dancer?

161
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm just an accountant.

162
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,640
Auntie,

163
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,360
have a drink.

164
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,000
Drink,

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,040
Uncle.

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,720
If all of this is true,

167
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,360
that would be great.

168
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
Comrade,

169
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,320
can we put away our closed mouth

170
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,840
a little bit.

171
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,360
What do you think?

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Did my trick work very well?

173
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
When Father Xu and Mother Xu sent you out,

174
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
your eyes were smiling,

175
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,080
Good for you.

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,120
I've finally

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,320
passed.

178
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
But let me tell you,

179
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
many Cheng's parents

180
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
are quite different from what I think.

181
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,280
So what?

182
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,960
From what you mean,

183
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
you seem to like a lot of oranges.

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
They're from the same family.

185
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
Why do you say that?

186
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
Because I haven't seen you smile

187
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,000
so happily for a long time.

188
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120
Ever since you got on the bus,

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,680
the corners of your mouth have never come down.

190
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,800
It's good.

191
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,840
I'm tipsy.

192
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,560
It's normal to drink a little wine.

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,920
-Move your

194
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,040
facial muscles. -Okay.

195
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,520
Keep getting drunk

196
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,560
and drive your car.

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Life is really a box of chocolates.

198
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,360
I never know what the next one will taste like.

199
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,720
Did I do well today?

200
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,840
Come with me to the nursing home tomorrow to see my mom.

201
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,680
Okay.

202
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

203
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,560
Go, go, go,

204
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,680
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

205
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,160
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,240
Don't be afraid. It won't bite.

207
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,960
It's okay.

208
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm not afraid of dogs.

209
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
It's strange. It's usually common

210
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
and strangers are so scared.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,720
I don't know why I'm so excited to see you.

212
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Maybe I'm more popular with your dog.

213
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,080
I like dogs, too.

214
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,360
What's its name?

215
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,600
His name is Prada,

216
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,120
but he's not really our dog.

217
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm the owner of Sweetheart Pet Shop.

218
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,040
He's usually busy with work,

219
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
He keeps putting him in foster care with us.

220
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,080
I can't take care of it.

221
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Isn't it your dog

222
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
who's pitiful?

223
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,760
I really know your pet shop.

224
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,560
It's right next to my house.

225
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,360
This kind of dog needs a lot of exercise,

226
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,960
and I happen to have the habit of running in the morning,

227
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Let's leave a number later.

228
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
When I go down to run in the morning,

229
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,760
I'll take it with me.

230
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
Thank you so much.

231
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,440
Prada,

232
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,680
what about me in the future,

233
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
It's your wild daddy.

234
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,760
Okay?

235
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,200
Rui,

236
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,800
-Bye. -Bye.

237
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,800
Come on, let's go.

238
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,200
Why are you here?

239
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,920
I often run here.

240
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,680
Really?

241
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,000
Actors are so dedicated now?

242
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,280
The morning run starts at 10 km,

243
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,320
Rui,

244
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,680
You like dogs,

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,880
too. What a coincidence,

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,680
Me too.

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
Since it's such a coincidence,

248
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
let's have a cup of coffee together.

249
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Okay,

250
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Otherwise, you would have come here for nothing.

251
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,720
Let's go.

252
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,720
You asked me to come here this morning,

253
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,520
not just for a cup of coffee, right?

254
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,680
Liang Zhe and I broke up.

255
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,120
I know.

256
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,960
It happened some time ago,

257
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
but your brother Rui really doesn't know it now,

258
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,040
I should congratulate you or comfort you.

259
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,120
Rui,

260
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
don't make fun of me.

261
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
Are you here for Jiang Nan?

262
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
I want you

263
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,040
to help me persuade Jiang Nan,

264
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,480
Tell him to stop messing around.

265
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
Actually, I can tell that

266
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
he still has me in his heart.

267
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,000
He did all this to piss me off.

268
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,040
Miss,

269
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,200
I think your way of thinking,

270
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,520
It's more or less strange.

271
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
Tell me why your ex will still like you

272
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,320
after we break up.

273
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,520
It was all my fault in the past,

274
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
but now I've grown up.

275
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
And I know,

276
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,920
Jiang Nan has always regarded you as his brother.

277
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,760
That's true.

278
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,840
So,

279
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
if you reconcile with us in the middle,

280
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
He will definitely come back.

281
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,160
Let me tell you,

282
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
you really flatter Brother Rui about this.

283
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,640
Your brother Rui is a single golden retriever,

284
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,120
who doesn't know anything about love.

285
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,000
And you also know that he has a girlfriend now,

286
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,360
right?

287
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,160
You know him too?

288
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,800
They are doing well.

289
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,280
Rui,

290
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,400
let me tell you,

291
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
You can't be fooled

292
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
by her silly and cute appearance.

293
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,240
She's very resourceful.

294
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,480
Jiayi.

295
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
We've known each other for a long time, haven't we?

296
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,520
There's something

297
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,520
I have to advise you, Rui,

298
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,040
We can earn more money if we lose it.

299
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,000
If she's not pretty, we can do it again.

300
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,920
But he has a bad heart.

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,640
I won't be able to cure it for the rest of my life.

302
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,600
One more thing for you.

303
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,800
When it's time to let go, let's put our hands down.

304
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,600
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

305
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,760
Why do you have to force yourself

306
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,360
to embarrass everyone?

307
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,520
But why do you want me to let go?

308
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
He's mine.

309
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
Jiang Nan was hard at the time,

310
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,720
but I was just an 18-star.

311
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,400
What can I do for him?

312
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,160
If I didn't take that step,

313
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
we would both be dead now.

314
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
But you see,

315
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,160
I have resources now.

316
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,800
I can help him now.

317
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,560
Why can't we get back together?

318
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Anyway,

319
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,920
I won't give up on Jiang Nan.

320
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,600
Besides,

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,400
I have to let him know,

322
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
Who loves him the most?

323
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,000
You go in first.

324
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,760
I'll park the car.

325
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,560
Okay,

326
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,320
Many oranges.

327
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,080
You look so pretty today.

328
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,720
What are these?

329
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,600
This is

330
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,960
the nail polish I told you about,

331
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
This is a phototherapy machine.

332
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,200
After using these,

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
Your nails will be like mine.

334
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Won't it fall off even if you wash your hands?

335
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,160
Of course not.

336
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,400
Have a look.

337
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,600
Which color do you like?

338
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,320
I like them all.

339
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,920
If you all like it,

340
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,680
let's make a dance.

341
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
Let's choose this one first.

342
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,960
rosy clouds

343
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,760
Are you doing your nails?

344
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Does it look good?

345
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,480
It looks good.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
I haven't heard you play the piano for a long time.

347
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,280
Can you play me a song?

348
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,079
Okay.

349
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,839
What do you want to hear?

350
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,600
I want to hear you play "Island"

351
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,840
and listen to Chengcheng.

352
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,480
I didn't expect

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,160
to see a celebrity so close,

354
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,840
I always thought that big stars have their own airs,

355
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,280
but I didn't expect them to be so approachable?

356
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,880
Yeah,

357
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,240
we just met,

358
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,760
The moment we met,

359
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
you turned your elbows out.

360
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,080
What do you think?

361
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,480
All right,

362
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,320
what are you waiting for?

363
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,320
Sister-in-law,

364
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
it's not finished yet.

365
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,280
Okay,

366
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,000
I won't take any onions,

367
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,760
Sister-in-law,

368
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,840
I really have to congratulate you this time.

369
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,160
Look at this son-in-law.

370
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,160
Not bad.

371
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,640
Right?

372
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,840
Jiang Nan

373
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,680
is polite,

374
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
You're talented.

375
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,600
I'm satisfied.

376
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,800
Madam,

377
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,400
what are you doing?

378
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Don't be too happy.

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
Didn't Jiang Nan say

380
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
he only had one girlfriend

381
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,280
at the dinner last night?

382
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,240
She is a first-line actress Gu Jiayi,

383
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,400
Gu Jiayi

384
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,640
still wants to get back together with Jiang Nan?

385
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,920
Don't talk nonsense.

386
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,440
What nonsense did I say?

387
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
It's all on the internet.

388
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm not the only one who eats melons.

389
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,640
Madam.

390
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,000
Thank you for today.

391
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,920
I haven't seen my mom so happy for a long time.

392
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,480
Next time,

393
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
I'll think about it again. What else is interesting?

394
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,720
Why did my mom call you?

395
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
You'll know when you answer it.

396
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,600
Auntie

397
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,760
Hello, Jiang Nan,

398
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,240
is it convenient for you to come over and have fun with your family today?

399
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,640
Mom,

400
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
Didn't we just see each other yesterday?

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
Jiang Nan is very busy,

402
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,160
who can stand it when you see him every day?

403
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,920
I asked you to come here.

404
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,560
You just fell in love. What's wrong?

405
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,520
I can't invite you.

406
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,120
Uncle,

407
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,760
No, I didn't.

408
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,720
What are you doing?

409
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,880
I don't know how to talk nicely.

410
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,000
You scared such a good son-in-law away again.

411
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,240
-Stop it. -Are you a good son-in-law? You won't know Mom

412
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,080
and Dad until time passes,

413
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,040
Why are you looking for Jiang Nan

414
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,040
all of a sudden?

415
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,160
It's nothing.

416
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,000
It's almost time for dinner.

417
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,720
We don't want you two to eat takeout.

418
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,160
So I asked you to come to the restaurant for a meal.

419
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Try it.

420
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,960
Come and eat.

421
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,600
Thank you, Auntie.

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Jiang Nan,

423
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,040
where are you and Chengcheng?

424
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,560
You two have just been in love for a short time,

425
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
which means you are in a hot relationship now,

426
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,120
But after a long time,

427
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,440
you will find out,

428
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,280
He has this weakness,

429
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,920
she has that weakness,

430
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,880
And then?

431
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,320
There will be a little friction between you.

432
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,280
If that day really comes,

433
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,400
I hope you can take care of my Chengcheng,

434
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
How tolerant she is.

435
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,640
There's only one child in our family.

436
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,240
It's a bit unreasonable for us

437
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,800
to spoil him.

438
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,640
Aunt,

439
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,240
you and uncle can rest assured.

440
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,520
I'm sure I'll get along well with Chengcheng.

441
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,040
Okay.

442
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,120
It's a bit heavy.

443
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,160
Jiang Nan

444
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
… You … You also met Uncle, right?

445
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,120
Back then, Uncle, I was in my prime.

446
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,160
Handsome and handsome,

447
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,280
the nickname of that man is "Love Killer".

448
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
Those girls chasing me,

449
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,560
they can go straight from family fun

450
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
to the traffic lights in front of them,

451
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,040
Then turn around and do it,

452
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,640
but,

453
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,120
Ever since I met your aunt,

454
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,840
I've rejected all those people of the opposite sex.

455
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,160
What about Xiao Li

456
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
who didn't contact her?

457
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:40,800
What Xiaoli?

458
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,320
How many times have I told you?

459
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,440
That means nothing happened to the neighbors.

460
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
You … Xiao Li … Xiao Li … I … Xiao Li … What are you doing? Why are you joking

461
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
so seriously all the time?

462
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm kidding.

463
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,640
Are you kidding me?

464
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,080
Look,

465
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,280
can you make a joke like this?

466
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,680
He's in a hurry.

467
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,040
My heart is beating. It's not

468
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
my fault. I'm wrong.

469
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,400
As a matter of principle,

470
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,440
who will you save when Gu Jiayi and Chengcheng fall into the water?

471
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,280
Who are you saving?

472
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,840
Dad.

473
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,880
Auntie,

474
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,480
Uncle,

475
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
I know why you called me here today.

476
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,040
Don't worry, you two.

477
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,440
Gu Jiayi and I broke up for so long,

478
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,400
and now I'm with Chengcheng,

479
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,200
I will treat Chengcheng wholeheartedly.

480
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
It's a matter of principle.

481
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Let's eat

482
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,840
When they come to dinner,

483
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,760
they seem to forget that

484
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,200
each other is only a nominal boyfriend and girlfriend,

485
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
At this moment,

486
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,520
in every phrase of paternalism,

487
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,720
Between every cup and cup,

488
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,880
they are the closest family.

489
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,280
Sorry to make you laugh.

490
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,840
My parents don't usually

491
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,920
do this. It doesn't matter.

492
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,480
I think they're cute.

493
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,720
I can tell that they really have a good relationship.

494
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,120
They are like this,

495
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,680
because they care about me too much.

496
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
Where else do you plan to go later?

497
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,600
Me,

498
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,800
Hey,

499
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,120
Is it convenient for you

500
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,760
to say it's serious?

501
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,040
Okay, I got it.

502
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,240
What's wrong?

503
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
I have a friend in the hospital.

504
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,680
Can you take me to Binhai Hospital?

505
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,320
Okay,

506
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,640
Chengcheng,

507
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
you're here.

508
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
What happened?

509
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,600
Does it hurt?

510
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,480
It doesn't hurt.

511
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,680
Today, I pushed the walker to play with the kids.

512
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
I had a big fall.

513
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,280
The doctor asked me to stay here for a few days.

514
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,800
When you're discharged from the hospital,

515
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,440
I'll take you to the amusement park,

516
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,960
Really?

517
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,800
The doctor said,

518
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,000
I can't use the walker anymore.

519
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,920
I can't walk anymore.

520
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,040
I can only sit in a wheelchair.

521
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,600
But the doctor said that

522
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,080
wheelchairs have wheels,

523
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,480
Like a small car,

524
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
faster than walking,

525
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,800
So that we can go further away.

526
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
I also want to go to the aquarium,

527
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,240
the Science and Technology Museum,

528
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,160
Where do you want to go?

529
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,360
I'll take you there.

530
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,800
Let's pull the hook,

531
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,760
pull the hook.

532
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,760
Sister Chengcheng,

533
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,040
who is this brother?

534
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,560
He belongs to my sister.

535
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,840
Is he your boyfriend?

536
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,120
Doudou.

537
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,600
Chengcheng,

538
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,360
come here.

539
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
If he makes you unhappy,

540
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,840
just tell me,

541
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,400
I'll grow up soon.

542
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,160
I'll protect you when you grow up.

543
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,280
Okay,

544
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,800
This kid,

545
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,560
little kid,

546
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,960
How old are you?

547
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,560
Anyway, what about

548
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,840
a bigger illness than yours?

549
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,800
I saw it

550
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,800
on the website of Woodenhead Association

551
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,120
a while ago when he could still walk.

552
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,920
It's just a little bit of a turn.

553
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,320
He's very lively,

554
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
knowing about his illness.

555
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,920
And very optimistic,

556
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,000
the last time I saw him,

557
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
He told me he wanted to have a puppy,

558
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,040
but he knew his mother would take care of him every day,

559
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,280
It's been very hard.

560
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,200
So it's not easy to make this request.

561
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,520
The gradual freezing disease

562
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,920
is really scary.

563
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,640
You don't have to be too sad.

564
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,320
The only thing we can do,

565
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,320
is to make him happy

566
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,920
in his limited life.

567
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
It's getting late.

568
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Don't you have to prepare

569
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
tomorrow's announcement tonight?

570
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Go back first.

571
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,080
I'll go to the doctor

572
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
to find out Doudou's condition.

573
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,720
Then you should go back early tonight.

574
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,840
Are you sure you don't want to tell your family?

575
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,760
Your monthly medical expenses are now 4thousand,

576
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,080
and,

577
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,960
If the disease continues to develop,

578
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,360
it will definitely affect your normal life.

579
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,760
So much pressure.

580
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,120
It's too hard for you.

581
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
Thank you, Dr. Sui.

582
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,520
I'm not going to tell them.

583
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,040
I really don't want them to worry about me.

584
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,880
You can't keep it a secret.

585
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,480
Yes,

586
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
I'm just like Doudou,

587
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
He's also suffering from gradual freezing.

588
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,280
It won't take long for Doudou

589
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,240
to suffer from the pain,

590
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,240
I'll face it, too.

591
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,400
Sorry,

592
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,920
lots of oranges.

593
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,920
Dr. Sui,

594
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,480
why are you so busy?

595
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Mr. Zhan's style is getting bigger and bigger now.

596
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
What kind of high-end equipment did you bring us this time?

597
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,480
The equipment must be the highest-end and the most advanced,

598
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,080
if you don't buy 10 or 8 units,

599
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,600
Based on our relationship,

600
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
it doesn't make sense.

601
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,720
So what?

602
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,040
Your father sent you down to the grassroots level,

603
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,840
and even gave you a sales task.

604
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,440
You know me.

605
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,760
By the way, Dr. Sui,

606
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,680
the girl who just went out is also your patient.

607
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,280
Yes.

608
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,280
What do you mean?

609
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,560
I'm telling you, don't make a bad idea.

610
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I was just asking

611
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,240
Dr. Sui,

612
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,520
Bed No. 8, please go and have a look.

613
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Tell him I'll be there soon.

614
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,280
Okay,

615
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,120
Just wait for me.

616
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,880
Let's have lunch in the canteen downstairs.

617
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,920
A lot of orange

618
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,160
gradual freezing.

619
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,440
Hello, uncle.

620
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,320
Is Jiangnan

621
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,040
Chengcheng with you?

622
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,720
Uncle,

623
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,520
No.

624
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,680
She hasn't come home yet?

625
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,840
No.

626
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,760
I can't get through to her phone.

627
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,160
This kid is getting more and more troublesome now.

628
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,680
Uncle,

629
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,560
don't worry,

630
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,400
We're visiting a friend of Chengcheng's

631
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,560
in the hospital this afternoon.

632
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
I guess she's still in the hospital and delayed her return home.

633
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,520
I'll go back to the hospital now.

634
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,320
Don't worry.

635
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,960
Okay.

636
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,760
Take care of yourself.

637
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,240
Why are you here?

638
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
I happened to come to the hospital on business,

639
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,280
and I saw you coming out from Dr. Sui,

640
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,240
A kid I know is sick,

641
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,920
so I went to see Dr. Sui and asked him about his condition.

642
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,920
But what I saw on it is,

643
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,000
many oranges.

644
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Why are you peeking at her medical record?

645
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,440
I apologize to you.

646
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm sorry,

647
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,600
What's the use of sorry?

648
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,960
Don't cry.

649
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm not crying.

650
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
I just can't figure it out,

651
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
I can eat two bowls of rice for every meal.

652
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,880
Even my dad thinks I can eat it.

653
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,560
In the 1000-meter school sports meeting,

654
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,640
I can run first every time.

655
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,560
No one can beat me.

656
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm the best piano player in our class.

657
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,040
I just graduated from college,

658
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,720
and my future has just begun.

659
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,160
A lot of Orange Exhibition Forest.

660
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,320
No wonder you asked me to leave first.

661
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm sorry.

662
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
When did you find out?

663
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,120
Three months ago,

664
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,320
well,

665
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,320
You don't have to think of words to comfort me.

666
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,200
Actually, I've accepted it.

667
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,640
If my parents can

668
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,360
accept my departure.

669
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,440
I think I'll feel better too.

670
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,040
Didn't you tell them?

671
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,720
Where's Jiang Nan?

672
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm not going to tell them.

673
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,400
So,

674
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,160
can you keep this a secret for me?

675
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,920
Okay,

676
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,400
I'll keep it a secret for you.

677
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,200
There are conditions.

678
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,840
Come with me.

679
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,720
What do you mean?

680
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,120
I'm hungry.

681
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,400
Let's eat together.

682
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,240
What day?

683
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,200
On Friday,

684
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,840
Okay.

685
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,760
Friday,

686
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,360
and then like this,

687
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,480
Tell me

688
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,840
the exact time.

689
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,360
Okay?

690
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,560
Okay.

691
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,240
Goodbye.

692
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
Jiang, Jiang,

693
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,000
listen to me,

694
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,360
After the last event,

695
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,040
the number of calls has increased significantly.

696
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,960
Brilliance Meichuang,

697
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,240
such a great opportunity,

698
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
Can we be more enthusiastic?

699
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,040
Gao Xing,

700
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm sleepy.

701
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,640
Go to bed first.

702
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Why are you sleepy again?

703
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
What's going on?

704
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,440
Our iron tree is about to blossom, isn't it?

705
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Thank you for today.

706
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,440
Thank you for listening to me,

707
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,320
this matter has been in my heart for a long time.

708
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,440
Now you finally say it.

709
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,880
I feel much better.

710
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,000
I feel much better.

711
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,920
You haven't come home at this late hour?

712
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,400
Your family should be worried, right?

713
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,280
Yes.

714
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
My phone's dead.

715
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,120
What about me?

716
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,360
You're the only person in the world

717
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
who knows about your condition,

718
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,160
So if you feel unhappy in the future,

719
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,760
call me.

720
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,640
Let's go back.

721
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,480
Mom and Dad,

722
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,760
I'm back.

723
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,600
You're back.

724
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,840
What took you so long?

725
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,800
That's right. It took you so long

726
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,560
to go to the hospital.

727
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,360
That friend is in the hospital,

728
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,480
so I stayed with him for a while.

729
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,640
What's wrong with you lately?

730
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,680
He didn't answer the phone.

731
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,600
You didn't reply to my WeChat messages.

732
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,240
What do you want to do?

733
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,720
My phone is out of battery.

734
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,880
My phone is out of battery.

735
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,520
Just listen to her.

736
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,680
Just come back.

737
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,160
Go inside and have a rest.

738
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,960
Mom and Dad,

739
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
I'm going to take a shower.

740
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,760
This … This … This … This child … Sorry, the phone

741
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
is out of battery.

742
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,840
I'm home now.

743
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,560
Sorry, my phone is out of battery.

744
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,639
I'm home now.

745
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Silly girl,

746
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,960
can't you see that Zhan Zhilin

747
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,400
is playing with her feelings?

748
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,719
Why are you still throwing yourself at me?

749
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,320
The day I found out about my illness,

750
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,920
I felt like the sky was falling.

751
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
You haven't even graduated from college,

752
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,560
yet you received the death notice in advance.

753
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,200
At that time,

754
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,960
I woke up every day and opened my eyes,

755
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,040
I hope all of this is just a dream.

756
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,000
But the reality

757
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,800
gave me a slap in the face.

758
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,280
And then I figured it out,

759
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,840
since I can't change it,

760
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,120
Then I'll cherish every day in the future.

761
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,280
Do what you want to do.

762
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,480
Do you really think so?

763
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,280
What can I do if I don't think so?

764
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
Maybe it's bad,

765
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,800
but it's also an essential experience in life.

766
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,360
In fact, from another perspective,

767
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,360
it's quite good for you to think like this.

768
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,920
At least you don't have to worry about the bank deposit.

769
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
You don't have to worry about your children's education in the future.

770
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,040
You don't have to worry about getting old one day.

771
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,400
You don't have to worry about seeing the one you love.

772
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,600
They left you one by one.

773
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,880
Your way of comforting people is really special.

774
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,320
Actually, the one who left early,

775
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,400
there's nothing wrong with that.

776
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,280
At least you don't have to bear

777
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,840
the pain of being abandoned.

778
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,160
Mom,

779
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,280
I really can't figure it out,

780
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,320
why did you leave me?

781
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,280
He chose to jump off the building,

782
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,080
but the girl was still so young,

783
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,400
But she tried so hard to live.

784
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,360
You haven't texted me back yet.

785
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,760
What's going on?

786
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
What's wrong with Jiang Nan?

787
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,840
Hang up on me.

788
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,920
Have another drink with me.

789
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,280
Just one cup.
