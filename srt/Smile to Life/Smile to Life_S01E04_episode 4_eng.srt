00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:08,910

2
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,827
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,967
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,167
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:24,542
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:30,300
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,114
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:35,519
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,901
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,700
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,414
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:48,401
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,128
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,841
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:55,388
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,755
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,570
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,811
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:10,658
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,512
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,246
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:18,353
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,166
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:25,425
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:32,044
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:45,298
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:48,857

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,900
Auntie, don't sit there. It's too dangerous!

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,420
Uncle Jiang will be here soon. Come back with me.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,500
That's right, Auntie! It's too dangerous there.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,780
Why aren't they here yet?

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Jiang Nan!

33
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:17,367
Jiang Hai, why are you here?

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,720
Aren't you really busy?

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
If I didn't come, I'm afraid you would really jump off.

36
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,720
I won't.

37
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,500
You have your career and your clients to attend to.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,800
You have no time to spend with me.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,841
Stop making a scene. I really have been busy lately.

40
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:42,240
I understand. Work is the most important, right?

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,800
Cai Yun, it's not like that.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,340
In my heart, you're the most important.

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,260
Her emotions seem to have stabilized now.

44
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,860
Yes.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,580
 That's weird.

46
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,800
 Why did Lord Bao ask me to bring keys to God Nan at a sanatorium?

47
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,680
 There's even an antique Strauss piano.

48
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,580
 This is the right room number.

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,460
God Nan.

50
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,660
Do you still remember?

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,440
This is where we had our first date.

52
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,320
That day, you told me,

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,920
"Cai Yun, our life will only get better."

54
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,560
Later, our lives,

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,440
really did get better.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,200
But you had less and less time

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,140
to spend with me.

58
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,420
Cai Yun, I'm sorry.

59
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,720
It's okay.

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,220
However, I can't let you take care of our son in the future.

61
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,000
He'll only learn to not care about his family from you.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,080
Our daughter-in-law would be devastated.

63
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,720
I just hope my son

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,900
can become a man with an indomitable spirit.

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,700
Yes, he definitely won't let you down!

66
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,880
Why are you here?

67
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,460
 Why is Jiang Nan wearing that outfit?

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,200
Why are you playing my husband's piano?

69
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,780
I really love this piano,

70
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,160
so I couldn't control myself.

71
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,053
Jiang Hai.

72
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,657
  - Jiang Hai?  
 - Do you know her?

73
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,480
Lord Bao asked me to deliver these keys. Take them.

74
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm sorry to disturb you.

75
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,920
Cai Yun, she is a new assistant I just hired.

76
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,760
It's getting late. We should get some rest.

77
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,460
Please, rest assured. The new song is being written at this moment.

78
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,740
Don't be anxious. I'm sure it won't affect us at all.

79
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,420
Don't worry. Leave this matter to me. That's it for all.

80
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,920
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to make some connections for you.

81
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,060
By the way, there's a serious matter.

82
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,200
You have to write a new song. Even if you can't think of anything, you must write it!

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
I understand.

84
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,940
Also, when you're free, try to go on more dates and out to eat with Xu Duo Cheng.

85
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,920
- Why? 
 - What do you mean by "why"?

86
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,120
There's no media gossip about you now.

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,220
Don't you know to thank her for helping you so much?

88
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,780
You can also experience life along the way to get inspiration for your new song.

89
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,980
You spend your whole day with me just like a monk.

90
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,340
It would be strange for you to be able to write a new song.

91
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,720
If I am a monk, it's only because your place seems too much like a temple.

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,100
It's a temple, all right. Hurry and leave this temple now.

93
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,840
These are all your favorites.

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,940
Here, have some.

95
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,340
What's wrong?

96
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,440
Does our Cai Yun have something on her mind?

97
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,960
Honey, is no one playing the piano today?

98
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,140
I'll go play a song for you. What do you want to hear?

99
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,100
I think the girl who came to deliver the car keys to you last time

100
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,480
played really well.

101
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Do you like her?

102
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,400
I haven't heard such a nice piano playing in a long time.

103
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,120
Mr. Jiang, please, come to my office.

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
I have to go for a bit. Take your time to eat.

105
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,860
Your mom's condition has been very unstable for the past two days.

106
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,860
I have a hard time ensuring a situation like a couple of days ago won't happen again.

107
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,960
My mom has been taking her medication recently.

108
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,700
Why is her condition getting worse?

109
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,800
Mental illness is caused by both psychological and physiological factors.

110
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,840
Medication can only assist treatment.

111
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,600
We need to reevaluate her condition.

112
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,800
Perhaps, that girl's piano playing can help calm her down.

113
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Doctor, you're the professional.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,420
We can't ask a young girl to cure my mom, right?

115
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,380
Mr. Jiang, treatment methods for mental illness are always changing.

116
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,680
Sometimes, treatment methods that are effective can be a surprise to us as well.

117
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,900
You saw what happened before.

118
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,080
Although that young girl has never met your mom,

119
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,820
but her piano playing really can calm your mom down.

120
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,760
I think perhaps that young girl's piano playing

121
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,460
allowed your mom to feel something special.

122
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,320
I understand what you are saying.

123
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,340
Let me think about it.

124
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,480
 My mom is not in a good mental state. You saw that too.

125
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,200
 She still believes she's in her twenties and mistakes me for my dad.

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,960
 Then... Should I call her Auntie or Sister?

127
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,480
 Forget it. I'm here to play piano.

128
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,500
 I'll just play the piano.

129
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,460
It's you.

130
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,660
You remember me?

131
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,260
I came and played the piano last time.

132
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,660
You said you liked it, so Mr. Jiang hired me to play piano for you every week.

133
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,860
Come in.

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,540
You played so beautifully!

135
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,440
Your nails are very pretty. They are shiny.

136
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,420
This is acrylic nail polish.

137
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,380
Acrylic nail polish?

138
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I've only used impatiens balsamina before. 
  (T/N: Flower used as orange nail polish)

139
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,140
That's okay. If you like it, Mrs. Jiang, I can paint your nails for you next time.

140
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
Really?

141
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,940
You don't have to call me Mrs. Jiang.

142
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,160
My name is Cai Yun.

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,280
Okay, Cai Yun.

144
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,040
You can call me Cheng Cheng.

145
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
Cheng Cheng.

146
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
I like you.

147
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,360
I like you too.

148
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,920
What are you two doing?

149
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,040
It's a girl's secret. I'm not telling you.

150
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,890

151
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,780
You got along really well with my mom.

152
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,180
Of course.

153
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,240
I've always been a very approachable and likable person.

154
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Can't you tell?

155
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,140
I just complimented you, yet you are not humble at all.

156
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,720
It's the truth.

157
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,020
You're right. You are very likable,

158
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,480
considerate towards others, and very good at helping share your rumored boyfriend's worries.

159
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
Who wants to share your worries with you?

160
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,060
Xu Duo Cheng!

161
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
Are you free later?

162
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,820
I don't have anything to do in particular. Why?

163
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,780
If you're free, I'll grant you a wish.

164
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,220
I'll go with you to do whatever you want.

165
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,980
 A wish?

166
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,600
There's a lot of time before the movie starts. Let's walk around first.

167
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
Okay.

168
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,080
You have quite a big head.

169
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,380
It's called being smart!

170
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,160
Look at this pan! It's great for hitting people!

171
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,520
I think this pan is perfect for hitting you.

172
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,003
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

173
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:19,408
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

174
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,890
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

175
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,589
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

176
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,303
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

177
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:32,290
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

178
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,117
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

179
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,830
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

180
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,377
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

181
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:42,744
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

182
00:13:42,744 --> 00:13:45,539
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

183
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,998
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

184
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:55,417
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

185
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,960
 I really feel like I am in a relationship,

186
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,540
 but this is only an illusion.

187
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,560
 It's fake.

188
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,920
 Although we are in a fake relationship,

189
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,120
 but the three-part date is perfect.

190
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,280
 God Nan, thank you for completing my second wish.

191
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,760
 I'll treat you. You can choose the place.

192
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,840
I know the owner of this Sichuan restaurant very well.

193
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,520
Their Sichuan cuisine is very authentic,

194
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,500
especially this chili diced chicken.

195
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,720
It's crispy and flavorful.

196
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,620
Try it.

197
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,820
I don't eat any spicy and stimulating food.

198
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,640
Do you have... some kind of disease?

199
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,640
Do you have hemorrhoids?

200
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,960
No, I don't.

201
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm just a young girl who likes to live healthily.

202
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,740
What should we do then?

203
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,760
Boss, can you make any non-spicy dishes?

204
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,060
Non-spicy? I don't know how to cook non-spicy dishes.

205
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,320
Even my wok is spicy.

206
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,440
Boss, can I make a dish myself?

207
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,760
What? Are you a good cook?

208
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,060
Of course. I'll show you my skills as well.

209
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
You're talking big.

210
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,640
Boss, give me some face and let her try.

211
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,320
Seeing that you are an old customer of mine,

212
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,060
I'll let you make one dish.

213
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,780
Okay. Thank you, Boss!

214
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,500
Here it is!

215
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,680
Here comes Xu Duo Cheng's specialty dish!

216
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Cola chicken wings?

217
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,560
That's right.

218
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,120
It doesn't look special at all.

219
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Try it first.

220
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,860
What do you think?

221
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,500
It's all right.

222
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,420
When I was little, my mom always made cola chicken wings for me.

223
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,400
I haven't had it ever since she fell ill.

224
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,680
If you like it, I'll make more for you next time.

225
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,540
My dad is a chef.

226
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,620
My skills are only superficial compared to his.

227
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,600
Next time, I'll let you taste my dad's cooking.

228
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,940
God Nan, thank you!

229
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,600
For what?

230
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,100
I've always dreamt of having a date like this.

231
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,280
Although it's not real... but I really want to thank you.

232
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm very happy.

233
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,160
Not real?

234
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,340
Am I an AI robot?

235
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,719
It's because this has been too realistic,

236
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,640
so it feels like I am in a dream.

237
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,320
God Nan, can you stay in my dream for a bit longer?

238
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,140
I'll reluctantly agree

239
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,880
because of these chicken wings.

240
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,320
How did you know you can enter through the east gate?

241
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,760
I used to come here all the time. Of course, I know.

242
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,180
I used to always imagine that I could sit on this Ferris wheel with my date

243
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,160
to watch the stars from the closest distance I could get at the top.

244
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,640
Just treat this as satisfying my small selfish want.

245
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,360
Xu Duo Cheng, an airplane would be closer to the stars than a Ferris wheel,

246
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,240
but we can't go up there now.

247
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,340
It's okay. It's good to just look at it.

248
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,600
What are you doing?

249
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's go!

250
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,220
Run! Keep running! I'm telling you to run!

251
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,960
Why aren't you running anymore?

252
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,680
Tell me, how did you two get in here?

253
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,120
What were you doing? If you don't say, we will call the police.

254
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400
Don't, don't!

255
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,060
That... no matter what, we don't look like bad guys.

256
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,140
Look at what?

257
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,860
So if you don't have "bad guy" written on your face, you're not a bad guy?

258
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,080
How about this? We'll pay you.

259
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,240
Please, make an exception.

260
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,040
Don't just give us that nonsense.

261
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,860
Even if you're the owner's son,

262
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,320
you still must explain yourself to me.

263
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,000
Brother Security Guard, we really just wanted to ride on the Ferris wheel.

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,540
We just didn't time things correctly.

265
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,280
Eight out of the 10 people who sneak in say the same thing.

266
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
What should we do?

267
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,680
Brother Security Guard, I originally wasn't planning to tell anyone about this,

268
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,820
but I really have no other choice.

269
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,860
She's my girlfriend.

270
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,860
I can tell. Say something I don't know.

271
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,320
She... has an incurable disease.

272
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,920
She doesn't have much time left.

273
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,380
Her last wish is to ride on the Ferris wheel.

274
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
We have no other choice.

275
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
It's understandable.

276
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,160
Then why couldn't you come tomorrow during the day? Why must you come now?

277
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,140
That makes sense.

278
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,820
During the day... she has surgery.

279
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,900
He doesn't seem to be lying.

280
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,740
- Is what he is saying true? 
 - It should be.

281
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,560
Who would joke about that?

282
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,700
She seems so young.

283
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,660
Brother Security Guard,

284
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,380
look at this.

285
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,960
Miss, it's all right.

286
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,240
Don't be sad. I'm sure you can recover.

287
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,900
Don't worry, we will protect your wish!

288
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,340
That's right.

289
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,400
How did you think of saying that? You're very smart!

290
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,020
I just had quick wits out of desperation, but we were also lucky to meet good people.

291
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,540
By the way, what's with that medicine you pulled out?

292
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,020
Isn't it normal for a young girl who likes to stay healthy like me to carry medicine around?

293
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,320
I had really good acting just now, right?

294
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,040
It was all right. Go on then.

295
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,260
- You're not going? 
 - I'm not going.

296
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,440
Why?

297
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,260
T-This is for children.

298
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Don't tell me... you are afraid of heights?

299
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,300
Who's afraid of heights? Do I look like I'm afraid of heights?

300
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,480
Yes! You're afraid of heights!

301
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,300
Stop pretending. I saw through you again. It's too late for you to do anything about it.

302
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,500
What's too late?

303
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,040
Let's go.

304
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Why are you looking at me?

305
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,880
Are you all right?

306
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm fine.

307
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,540
Look, the night scene is so beautiful!

308
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,274
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

309
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:00,047
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

310
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,347
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

311
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,361
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

312
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:09,249
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

313
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,566
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

314
00:23:12,566 --> 00:23:16,534
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

315
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:20,820
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

316
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,569
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

317
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,960
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

318
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,094
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

319
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:34,028
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

320
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:38,581
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

321
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,300
Are you all right?

322
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,660
It's all your fault. You had to ride the Ferris wheel.

323
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,320
Did you just cry?

324
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
No.

325
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,680
The way your legs shook was so funny. I laughed so hard that I cried.

326
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm really happy today.

327
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,940
For all this time, I always thought I had bad luck.

328
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,760
I only realized tonight that all my good luck was for meeting you.

329
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,800
Thank you, God Nan.

330
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,320
You don't need to thank me. You should thank Bao Rui.

331
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm not just thanking you. I'm also thanking you on behalf of my dad.

332
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,520
If it weren't for your Â¥300,000, the workers working for Dad would have struggled to even get by and pay the bills.

333
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,060
What Â¥300,000?

334
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,980
You lent me Â¥300,000. Did you forget?

335
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,440
Give me more details.

336
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,780
My dad's restaurant had some trouble previously, so I asked Lord Bao to pay Â¥300,000 of my salary in advance.

337
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,180
Â¥300,000? Bao Rui lent you Â¥300,000?

338
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,180
So, you only signed this contract because of the money?

339
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,560
That's certainly not the only reason.

340
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,560
God Nan, I really want to help you.

341
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,260
Also, I will pay you back all the money.

342
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,420
It's not about the money.

343
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,320
There's definitely no problem on my side.

344
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,460
But don't you understand? I still have to take some time to convince Lao Jiang.

345
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,920
I have to go. Make sure to keep in touch.

346
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,700
Coming!

347
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,780
You... Didn't you and Xu Duo Cheng...

348
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,300
Did you give Xu Duo Cheng Â¥300,000?

349
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,100
You... you know everything.

350
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,740
Why did you keep it from me?

351
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,280
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you would get the wrong idea and not agree.

352
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,540
Yes, I did keep it from you.

353
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,540
I was wrong, but who did I do this for?

354
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,220
Didn't I do it for you?

355
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,440
At the very least, I helped out Xu Duo Cheng's family and you.

356
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,820
Isn't that a win-win?

357
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,120
Right now, without the scandal and gossip,

358
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,740
Xu Duo Cheng can still work as your assistant while you focus on producing your songs.

359
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,060
Isn't that good?

360
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,460
Our studio doesn't have any money. Where did you get the money?

361
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,560
Yes, the studio has no money. I used all the money I saved for marriage.

362
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,720
It's fine. You're going to support me in the future anyway.

363
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,140
Consider it as a loan. I'll pay you ten times the amount in the future.

364
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,480
You're crazy. I'm not a loan shark.

365
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,340
Let me tell you, as long as your life stays steady, I will be at ease.

366
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,920
You make me worry about you all the time.

367
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,840
Let me tell you, you must learn to control your anger.

368
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,160
By the way, Gu Jia Yi has a new song release press event in two days. We have to go.

369
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,080
I have to go too. Both of us will be on camera together?

370
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,810
Both of you sang the song together. You have to go.

371
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,940
Besides, you already signed the contract. Moreover...

372
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,960
Moreover what?

373
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,260
Moreover, there will certainly be a lot of reporters who will ask about your relationship with Xu Duo Cheng.

374
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,340
Why would Gu Jia Yi host a lousy press event now? She is doing it on purpose!

375
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,860
I think it's perfect.

376
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,100
We'll bring Xu Duo Cheng with us in two days and have Gu Jia Yi crush her own foot while trying to drop a rock on us.

377
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,200
- That doesn't sound good? 
 - I think it'll be fine.

378
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,980
Aren't we doing this to completely break free from Gu Jia Yi?

379
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,560
Then... why don't I go ask Xu Duo Cheng first?

380
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,180
If she agrees, we'll take her along.

381
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,160
Fine. However, you can't force her to go if she doesn't want to.

382
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,520
Why do you think a man who only cares about music and doesn't like media exposure

383
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,640
took a woman on dates all over the place?

384
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,840
Sister, I think these photos are fake.

385
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,560
You're right! He's doing this on purpose for me to see.

386
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,080
By doing this, it means I am still in his heart.

387
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,800
Xiao Mei, get two more orders of crayfish.

388
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,460
Sister, if you keep eating, it will affect your looks on camera tomorrow.

389
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,740
I'm happy today. I want to eat more.

390
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,160
All right.

391
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,760
Did Jiang Nan misunderstand me?

392
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,880
Does he think I'm a greedy person?

393
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,580
 I'll buy it if you like it.

394
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,660
 I saw this last time when buying a present for Ke Qin. That's why I paid a bit more attention to it.

395
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,640
 Hello, sir. May I help you with anything?

396
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,580
 - Can you wrap up these earrings for me? 
 - Yes.

397
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,300
 No, you really don't have to.

398
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,620
 You don't have to be too moved. You're my girlfriend now after all.

399
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,740
 You'll embarrass me if you look too shabby.

400
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,980
Can I come in?

401
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,600
Yes!

402
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,160
Thank you, Mom.

403
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,960
It's not hot.

404
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,220
I bought you a bottle of vitamins.

405
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Vitamins?

406
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,720
I saw that you're taking it when I was cleaning your room the other day.

407
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,260
I shook it and there wasn't much left, so I bought you a new bottle.

408
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,620
Your dad said these are good for your health, but he thinks you can't solely depend on vitamins for good health.

409
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,100
You also have to exercise more.

410
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,760
You two don't have to worry about me.

411
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,680
You're my daughter. How can I not worry?

412
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,900
I'm not a child. I'm all grown up now.

413
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,060
- In the eyes of your parents, you'll always be our child. 
 - Got it.

414
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,360
Tell us if you need anything in the future. We'll buy it for you.

415
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,480
When things lighten up, we will go out to have fun as a family.

416
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,820
Okay.

417
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,520
Go to bed soon.

418
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,040

419
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,880
Cheng Cheng, I know that Gu Jia Yi's press release came up in the very last minute.

420
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,720
She must not believe that the two of you are a real couple,

421
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,240
so she created this event to embarrass us.

422
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,820
Lao Jiang didn't want to go,

423
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,240
but from my standpoint, I certainly want him to go.

424
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,000
After all, they sang that song together.

425
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,300
That's why I really hope you can come along too.

426
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,960
That would increase Lao Jiang's confidence as well.

427
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,360
Of course, I want to go and help Jiang Nan,

428
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,980
but I'm just an ordinary person.

429
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,820
I've never been to an event like that.

430
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,480
I'll have to face a lot of questions from all those reporters.

431
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,500
If I say something wrong,

432
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,120
wouldn't that make things worse for Jiang Nan?

433
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,380
You're not an ordinary person anymore.

434
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,180
You have me, Lord Bao, and Jiang Nan.

435
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,040
With my silver tongue, I can handle all the reporters.

436
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,800
Trust me. Just go.

437
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,520
  : Brother, Qin Shan took the job.

438
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,100
 It'll be at 4 p.m. tomorrow at the Crown Plaza.

439
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,800
Secretary Ding, don't book anything for me after 4 p.m. tomorrow.

440
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
 Yes.

441
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,700
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule

442
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,840
to come to my new song release.

443
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,140
This is the first time I've stepped foot into the music industry.

444
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,100
Since I'm not a professional singer,

445
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,940
I ask everyone to be more forgiving

446
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,040
and give some more support and encouragement.

447
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,140
Thank you.

448
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,260
There have been rumors spreading online about you two.

449
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,680
I hope to receive a direct response during today's occasion.

450
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,640
The online rumors are all unfounded.

451
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,260
I have a girlfriend.

452
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,160
I hope that everyone can focus on my work and not my personal life.

453
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,040
Gu Jia Yi is your ex-girlfriend.

454
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,320
Have you considered your current girlfriend's feelings

455
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,500
when collaborating with her on a romantic love song?

456
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,620
Gu Jia Yi and I only have a working relationship.

457
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,380
Also, I am a professional musician.

458
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
My work and life are two separate things.

459
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,280
Since everyone cares so much about this question,

460
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,640
I've invited my girlfriend here today.

461
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,800
I'll officially introduce her to everyone. I ask everyone to wait for a moment.

462
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,560

463
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,700
Don't be scared.

464
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,620
Put your hands here.

465
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,220
Smile.

466
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,500
- They have come out! 
 - Hurry!

467
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
- Get pictures! 
 - Hurry and take pictures!

468
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Over here at this angle!

469
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,080
- Did you get it? 
 - Get a couple more photos!

470
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,580
How is it?

471
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,460
Everyone, this is my girlfriend, Xu Duo Cheng.

472
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,760
Jiang Nan, can you tell us how you met Miss Xu?

473
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,680
It was actually by accident.

474
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,580
Anyway, the first impression she left me was...

475
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,840
 Brother, can you lend me some tissues?

476
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,120
Very flavorful.

477
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,380
Gradually, the more I got to know her,

478
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,900
I discovered that she was a very cheerful girl.

479
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,700
I've never expected someone like her to appear in my life.

480
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,900
She brings me surprises every time she appears.

481
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,600
Miss Xu, what do you think about the close interactions between Gu Jia Yi and Jiang Nan?

482
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,380
I...

483
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,140
I don't have any thoughts about it.

484
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,700
Are you not jealous as Jiang Nan's girlfriend?

485
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,440
This is a private matter between us.

486
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,620
Since you are at the press release and brought Miss Xu here,

487
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,420
why won't you let her speak?

488
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,780
I'm not jealous.

489
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,780
I support Jiang Nan in all his work matters.

490
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,159
Since you're not jealous,

491
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,379
I don't think Miss Xu requested to participate in this press release, right?

492
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:20,280
As far as I know, Miss Xu has just graduated from college.

493
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,820
As your boyfriend and a singer who has more experience dealing with media,

494
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,980
why didn't he choose to clarify matters and protect you?

495
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,080
Not exposing you to the media would be the least disruptive

496
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,339
and the manlier way to handle it, right?

497
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,199
Chief Editor Qin, you can ask questions.

498
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,179
There's no need for personal attacks.

499
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,419
It's my own choice to come.

500
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:42,800
You don't work in the entertainment industry.

501
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,900
By disclosing your identity to the public like this,

502
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,760
aren't you afraid there will be great effects on your personal life?

503
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,960
If your photos weren't exposed,

504
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,000
would you still choose to make it public?

505
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,539
Chief Editor Qin, as you said, Miss Xu doesn't work in the industry.

506
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:58,720
Besides, she's very young.

507
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
She can't handle all your questions.

508
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,120
Lord Bao, there's no need to be so nervous.

509
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,060
I just don't understand why Jiang Nan, someone who is very low profile,

510
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,360
would agree to bring his girlfriend, an industry outsider, to a press release.

511
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,880
I can't help but wonder,

512
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,160
is it to create hype for his comeback or is it just a smoke bomb?

513
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,120
Today, Miss Xu and Jiang Nan came to meet everyone with sincerity

514
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,220
to clarify misunderstandings from last time.

515
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,940
So, I wish Chief Editor Qin would stop playing her detective game.

516
00:35:34,354 --> 00:35:35,960
To clarify any misunderstandings?

517
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,240
So, your main purpose for coming here today is still for crisis PR,

518
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,220
then I have to suspect the authenticity of you two.

519
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,240
By appearing together today,

520
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,180
you want to make things real,

521
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,580
so everyone will believe you are a real couple.

522
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,900
Am I right, Lord Bao?

523
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,360
 What should we do?

524
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,920
 Hurry and think of something!

525
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,820
 What can I think of?

526
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,220
 How would I know?

527
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,400
 Just do something!

528
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,460
 What can we do to make everyone believe we're really a couple?

529
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,200
That's so direct.

530
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
So, it's true!

531
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,400
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

532
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,180
â™«   I walk slowly with you, hand in hand   â™«

533
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,540
â™«   If I can travel across the entire universe   â™«

534
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,680
â™«   And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

535
00:36:50,030 --> 00:37:00,010

536
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:09,101
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

537
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:15,715
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

538
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:23,412
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

539
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:28,999
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

540
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,245
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

541
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:36,725
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

542
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:42,978
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

543
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:46,538
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

544
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:48,411
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

545
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:50,711
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

546
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:53,525
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

547
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:57,513
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

548
00:37:57,513 --> 00:38:00,830
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

549
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,798
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

550
00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:09,184
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

551
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:11,933
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

552
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:15,224
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

553
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:19,358
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

554
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:22,192
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

555
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:26,191
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

556
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:29,534
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

557
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:33,596
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

558
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:37,811
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

559
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:44,359
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

560
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,212
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

561
00:39:02,212 --> 00:39:06,192
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

562
00:39:06,192 --> 00:39:12,739
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

563
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:16,030
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

564
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,164
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

565

â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

566
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:27,097
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

567
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:30,340
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

568
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,402
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

569
00:39:34,402 --> 00:39:38,617
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

570
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:45,006
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
