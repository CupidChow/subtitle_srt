1
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,600
Jiang Nan.

2
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,640
If.

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,560
If I... Forget

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,000
it,

5
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,760
What are you trying to say?

6
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,440
Are you really okay?

7
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,600
It's okay. Don't you know

8
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,520
that

9
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,680
half of the conversation is very appetizing?

10
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,000
Nannan,

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
my sister-in-law is missing,

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,200
Help me look for it.

13
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,720
Caiyun, Caiyun,

14
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,040
sister-in-law,

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,440
Caiyun,

16
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Caiyun,

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
Sister-in-law,

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,760
Auntie,

19
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,480
Excuse me,

20
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,360
did you see a cardigan in gray,

21
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,520
The woman with hair here,

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,680
no

23
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,480
I don't think I saw Caiyun

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,440
Thank you, sister-in-law,

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
Caiyun,

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,760
Aunt,

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,600
Did my mom say anything to you before she left?

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
Nothing?

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,240
As soon as I turned around, Mrs. Gong disappeared.

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,880
Jiang Nan,

31
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,480
go to the place where Auntie often goes. Auntie

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,160
and I will look for it along the street nearby.

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,160
Chengcheng,

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,000
you don't know the way.

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,480
Be careful.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,920
Okay,

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,360
Caiyun,

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,480
Caiyun,

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,160
Sister-in-law,

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
Caiyun,

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
Caiyun,

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,000
Caiyun,

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
Caiyun,

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Caiyun.

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Sister-in-law.

46
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
Have you seen my husband?

47
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
I … My husband is about this

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,360
tall, wearing a tool,

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,519
No.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,400
No.

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,280
What a good dog.

52
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,160
Caiyun.

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
Chengcheng,

54
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to see a movie.

55
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,160
The movies Jiang Hai used to

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,080
take me to,

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,040
Old cinema,

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,160
Caiyun.

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
According to the patient's description,

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
she used to be in her hometown,

61
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,920
Living and dating with her husband.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
I remember it very clearly,

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,880
the cinema.

64
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,760
I want to ask,

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
where is this place?

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
Lide Road,

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,200
Lide Road,

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,200
Shouldn't there be

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
a Red Star Cinema on Lide Road?

70
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
Why is the cinema missing?

71
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,680
Red Star Cinema,

72
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,120
it was torn down years ago.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,320
Tear it down.

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
The cinema

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,920
is torn down.

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,360
It's that woman.

77
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,120
Mom,

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,120
It's all our fault.

79
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
It's all because of us that Shu Qian died.

80
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,440
It's because she can't get over it,

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
don't think so.

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,520
No,

83
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
I really didn't expect

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,920
things to turn out like this.

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
I'm going to kill you!

86
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,960
I'll kill you.

87
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,920
Caiyun,

88
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,480
are you okay?

89
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,480
Many oranges,

90
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
are you dying for this woman?

91
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
Zhan Zhilin, what were you doing just now?

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,200
Come with me.

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,040
Who are you?

94
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,600
Why?

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,200
Why did you take Chengcheng away? Go away.

96
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,520
Let go of me!

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,240
Where are you taking me?

98
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,520
Let go of me!

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,720
If you don't want them to know about your illness,

100
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
just come with me.

101
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Get in the car.

102
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,400
Zhan Zhilin.

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,320
Jiang Nan.

104
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,920
-Caiyun. -Caiyun, it's

105
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,280
me. -It's my sister-in-law. I'm

106
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
Jiang

107
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Hai.

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm Jiang Hai,

109
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,040
Caiyun,

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,120
Are you okay?

111
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,720
Jiang Hai,

112
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
Jiang Hai,

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,840
Auntie,

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,040
take my mom home first.

115
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
I'll get Chengcheng back.

116
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,920
Okay,

117
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,680
Your mom has me.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,360
Go ahead.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,240
Drive safely.

120
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,000
Got it.

121
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,880
What are you trying to do?

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,960
Why did you take it out on me for what happened between you and Jiang Nan?

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,040
She's just a patient.

124
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
She's innocent.

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,640
She's innocent.

126
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,440
Stop the car.

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,880
Where are you taking me?

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,880
What are you doing?

129
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,880
I want to save your life.

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,200
I can't stand by and watch you die.

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,360
I know

132
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
what's wrong with me.

133
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
It's not your turn to interfere with me.

134
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
Stop the car!

135
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Stop the car!

136
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,160
Are you crazy?

137
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,679
Come on,

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,919
come on,

139
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,880
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,159
How did you become like this?

141
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,039
It's all because he worships you.

142
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,600
And from your crazy mother.

143
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,080
Say it again.

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,720
Jiang Nan.

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,720
If it happens again,

146
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,000
I won't let you go.

147
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
Don't move.

148
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
It's okay.

149
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
This small injury is nothing.

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,560
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,960
You're bleeding and you said you were fine.

152
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,160
You were scared today too.

153
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,320
Go to bed early.

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,480
You don't have to

155
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,400
worry about my mom.

156
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,680
My aunt will stay with her.

157
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,040
Why do you think Zhan Zhilin

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,840
is so mean to me?

159
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
What happened between you two?

160
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,160
Don't ask.

161
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
And why Zhan Zhilin said

162
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,280
it was all thanks to Auntie.

163
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,600
I told you not to ask.

164
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,360
Sorry,

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm in a bad mood.

166
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,760
Go to bed early.

167
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
Why are you still up?

168
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,600
But

169
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
it doesn't matter,

170
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,360
Sooner or later,

171
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,080
all of you,

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,160
will leave me.

173
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,080
I really want to go back to the past,

174
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
at that time,

175
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,000
My dad is still here.

176
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,280
Zhan Zhilin and I can

177
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,280
play music without any worries,

178
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
I can't go back.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
I can't go back.

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,480
It's gone.

181
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040
There's nothing left.

182
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,240
Jiang Nan, stop drinking.

183
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,640
Stop drinking.

184
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Many oranges.

185
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
Please don't

186
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
leave me.

187
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
Please

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,520
stay by my side all the time.

189
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,280
Okay?

190
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,600
What did you do last night?

191
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,320
What did you do last night?

192
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,960
Many oranges. Many oranges.

193
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,520
You didn't drink.

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,760
Why are you so confused?

195
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
Sorry

196
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,920
to wake you up.

197
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,120
I lost my earring.

198
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,360
I'm looking for earrings.

199
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
You lost your earring.

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
Let me find it for you.

201
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,400
Last night,

202
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,720
right?

203
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,520
What?

204
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,440
No.

205
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,720
I haven't said what it is yet?

206
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,520
You don't have anything?

207
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,920
You,

208
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
You didn't rinse

209
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,840
your mouth. Your alcohol is

210
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,360
too strong.

211
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,920
Did nothing really happen

212
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,520
between us last night?

213
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,040
By the way,

214
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,000
clean it up later.

215
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,920
I'll go back first.

216
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,040
Why are you going back so soon?

217
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,560
Zhan Zhilin was able to find this place yesterday.

218
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,960
I'm sure the media can do the same.

219
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,480
If I stay here,

220
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,560
it'll disturb my mom's peace.

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,080
After we leave,

222
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
Auntie will move my mom to her house.

223
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,560
So that they won't be found out.

224
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,960
Okay.

225
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Where is it?

226
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,480
Nang,

227
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,240
Come on.

228
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,680
Your mom is fine.

229
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,440
You recognized me just now.

230
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,920
I'll take care of her.

231
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,319
In the meantime,

232
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,839
please take care of my mom.

233
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,640
Call me if you have any questions.

234
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,599
Don't worry.

235
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,560
Be careful on your way.

236
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,839
We'll get going then.

237
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,120
Get some sleep.

238
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,200
I'll call you when we get there.

239
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,240
No, thanks.

240
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,360
I'm not sleepy.

241
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,040
By the way, Chengcheng,

242
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,560
I suddenly remembered something,

243
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Let's go and buy Doudou a birthday present.

244
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,080
How do you know Doudou's birthday?

245
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Doudou's birthday.

246
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,600
But you invited me

247
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,720
so many times.

248
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,880
How should I choose?

249
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,400
Kids nowadays are so happy.

250
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,760
So many toys

251
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,840
are too picky.

252
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Why don't we buy more?

253
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,280
I don't have to be bored in the hospital

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
to cover up my current condition,

255
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
He can't even play with these complicated toys.

256
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,720
That's right.

257
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,720
gradual freezing is such a torturous disease.

258
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,520
The later the stage, the more you need the support of your family.

259
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,040
I really don't know

260
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,200
how Doudou's mom survived?

261
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,000
Hello,

262
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,000
how old are you showing toys to?

263
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,880
Eight years old.

264
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
We are

265
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,720
so young parents.

266
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,960
Let's make our own choice.

267
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,520
Thank you.

268
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,280
It's okay,

269
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,280
Chengcheng

270
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,520
Did Doudou mention it to you?

271
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,200
Is there anything he really wants?

272
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,960
These puppies that I really want

273
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,120
are so cute.

274
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,480
It has sprouted

275
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,680
a lot of oranges,

276
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Restrain yourself.

277
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,760
We're here to pick a gift for Doudou.

278
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Then.

279
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,000
Let's buy this Shiba Inu.

280
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
He has a very good personality.

281
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
Although Shiba Inu is small now,

282
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,720
When it grows up,

283
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,720
it will be naughty.

284
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,360
It's not suitable for pockets.

285
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,920
Then buy Schnauzer.

286
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,640
When Schnauzer grows up,

287
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,040
his eyelashes are super long,

288
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,000
It's very cute,

289
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,320
but Schnauzer's words are too delicate.

290
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
Doudou's family couldn't take care of Doudou.

291
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,040
How can I take care of it?

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,520
How about this?

293
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,720
Let's buy Bomei,

294
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,440
Look at Bomei,

295
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
she doesn't eat much either,

296
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,360
It doesn't shed hair,

297
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
and it's cute and clingy.

298
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,720
It's perfect for Doudou.

299
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,840
That's it.

300
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,880
Okay.

301
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:51,960
Hey,

302
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,880
I found something.

303
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,240
What did I find out?

304
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,640
Gu Jiayi revealed the address of the nursing home that day.

305
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,080
It's really her.

306
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,120
Don't rush

307
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,080
out. What happened?

308
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
Something came up,

309
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,920
so you should leave now.

310
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,440
It's okay.

311
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,400
I'll walk you up first.

312
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,280
Come on,

313
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,520
Go back to your work.

314
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,600
I'll take care of

315
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,720
Chengcheng,

316
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,880
Take care of the dog at home,

317
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,200
and wait for me to come back.

318
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
Why are you blushing?

319
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
How am I blushing?

320
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,520
It's too hot.

321
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,760
I'm here to be an assistant.

322
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,160
I'm not here

323
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
to be a nanny,

324
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,480
Coke chicken wings,

325
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,000
the same as last time.

326
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,280
I'm going to keep you from getting up and down on the treadmill.

327
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,080
A lot of oranges.

328
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,320
What's this smell?

329
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,480
Where's my moxa fever?

330
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
It promotes blood circulation,

331
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,760
warms the body and the palace.

332
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,720
Just because you're handsome,

333
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,160
you're disturbing the people. Do you know

334
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,800
that playing games in your own house,

335
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,960
I didn't sing K

336
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,880
again.

337
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,720
Who am I disturbing? I've been here all morning,

338
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,440
With so many words,

339
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,440
are you going to let me rest?

340
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,360
I'm not singing K at home.

341
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,720
Who are you disturbing?

342
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,200
Are you satisfied?

343
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
I wrote a new song.

344
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,120
Do you want to hear it?

345
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,200
Please don't

346
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,520
leave me.

347
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,920
Jiang Nan,

348
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm sorry,

349
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,520
I broke my promise.

350
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,920
I can't be with you anymore.

351
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
My existence

352
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,360
will only make your life more troublesome.

353
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm here.

354
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,600
Brother Nan,

355
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,680
Brother Nan,

356
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,720
Nan,

357
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,320
did you tell us

358
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,520
the address of Gu Jiayi Sanatorium?

359
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
Sanatorium,

360
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
is something wrong?

361
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,160
Auntie, are you okay?

362
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,360
You don't have to work so hard

363
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
now that you're better than acting.

364
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,920
Are you suspecting me?

365
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,480
Why don't you suspect a lot of oranges?

366
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,320
She's the one

367
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,720
who goes to the nursing home every day,

368
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,840
Many oranges can't be.

369
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,760
She can't be.

370
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,600
I did all the bad things.

371
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,240
Every time something goes wrong,

372
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,160
why do you always suspect me in the first place,

373
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,080
I don't care if it has anything to do with you.

374
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,880
Anyway,

375
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
don't bother my mom again.

376
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,960
She's a patient.

377
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,360
He needs quiet treatment.

378
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,280
Also,

379
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
no matter what means you use,

380
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,120
Many oranges and I

381
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,440
can't be separated.

382
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,920
Nan.

383
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,120
The puppy is fed

384
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,600
50 grams of dry food twice a day,

385
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,880
Take a walk sooner or later.

386
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
I was afraid that you would leave quietly.

387
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,360
I even bought a puppy.

388
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
I want to find a reason to keep you.

389
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,840
But you left anyway.

390
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,560
Why?

391
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,640
Why are you so determined?

392
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,160
You're not answering your phone.

393
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,320
It's not a good idea.

394
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,120
If you say goodbye,

395
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
I don't want to say it again.

396
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I don't understand.

397
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,520
Why do you have to leave?

398
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,600
I can see that

399
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,080
Jiang Nan is sincere to you,

400
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,560
You like him too.

401
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,840
Then why can't two people be together?

402
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,200
I just want to go back to my normal life,

403
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,760
to be with him,

404
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,440
It's just a contract,

405
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,440
but it won't end well if you make a fake play.

406
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,400
When you went back to your hometown with Jiang Nan,

407
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,680
did something happen?

408
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,920
Nothing happened.

409
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
It's just that I've figured it out,

410
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Keqin,

411
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,080
As my best friend,

412
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,960
I hope you can support me.

413
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
Have you figured it out?

414
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,760
No regrets.

415
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,160
No regrets.

416
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,560
Okay,

417
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,640
No matter what decision you make,

418
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,440
I'll always be on your side.

419
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
I don't know what's going on between you two,

420
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,800
and Orange won't tell me,

421
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Why don't you stop looking for her for a few days.

422
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,800
Let her stay at my house for a few days.

423
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,560
Maybe it will be fine in a few days.

424
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay,

425
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,760
Just do as you say.

426
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,520
Okay,

427
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,440
I got it.

428
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,040
That's it.

429
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,160
Same old rules,

430
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,640
Why are you frowning?

431
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,400
Come on,

432
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,080
Cheers.

433
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,200
In order to celebrate our first collaboration,

434
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
we have achieved a staged victory.

435
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,160
I didn't expect that the famous Mr. Liang

436
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,000
only knows this trick.

437
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,760
I know what you mean.

438
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,840
But we can't rush it.

439
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,640
As you said,

440
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,400
hit a snake and hit seven inches.

441
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,280
If we hurt Jiang Nan,

442
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,160
we have to hurt his weakness.

443
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I think you're right.

444
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,160
What is Jiang Nan's weakness?

445
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,840
It's his mother.

446
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,680
Of course,

447
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
now we have a lot of oranges,

448
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,000
Mr. Liang,

449
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,040
if you tell me the truth,

450
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,440
don't touch many oranges

451
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,600
in front of her.

452
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
We are enemies.

453
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,360
I didn't expect that Mr. Zhan

454
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
is such a lover.

455
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,720
Just do as we said before,

456
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,800
get what you want.

457
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,720
I want my Gu Jiayi,

458
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,600
the many oranges I have for you,

459
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,560
Not interested.

460
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,400
Are you going to hide from him for the rest of your life?

461
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,280
I don't know

462
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,160
how long I can hide.

463
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,800
Okay,

464
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,080
I'll go to work now.

465
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,320
Go ahead.

466
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,240
Keqin,

467
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,120
how is Chengcheng?

468
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,160
She eats well and sleeps well.

469
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,320
I just don't want to see you.

470
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,160
Why?

471
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,520
You two should know better than I do.

472
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,800
Me,

473
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,880
You can't get anything from me.

474
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,280
Jiang Nan,

475
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,680
friends and wives can't be bullied.

476
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,720
Keqin has me.

477
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,440
Zhu Xiaopang,

478
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,560
who is your wife?

479
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Well,

480
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,360
That's what I meant.

481
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,360
Jiang Nan understands me.

482
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,120
What are you thinking?

483
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm here to see Chubby

484
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,640
from Chengcheng,

485
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,280
Are you here to pick me up?

486
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,200
That's right.

487
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
I'm going to be late.

488
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,280
Let's go now.

489
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,960
I'm leaving now.

490
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Why are you acting weird today?

491
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,760
I really don't want to be forced by

492
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,080
Jiang Nan. Go! Go! Go!

493
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
He recovered well after the surgery.

494
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,520
That's good.

495
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,880
Happy birthday to you!

496
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,960
Hurry up!

497
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,240
The birthday party is about to begin.

498
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,080
You said I

499
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,480
… You forgot to bring the gift.

500
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,200
Let's go.

501
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,560
Happy birthday to you!

502
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
-Happy birthday! -Happy birthday!

503
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,440
Okay. Take a picture.

504
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,600
Three, two, one.

505
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,400
Stop,

506
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,040
Chengcheng,

507
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,640
come and take a photo.

508
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,600
Come here! Come here!

509
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
We're taking pictures.

510
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,000
-Come on. -It's good. This way. Three,

511
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,440
two,

512
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,480
one.

513
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,520
Eggplant!

514
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm sorry that

515
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
Sister Doudou is late for something.

516
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,600
What's wrong?

517
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,880
And you're mad at me.

518
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,160
He got up early today,

519
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,560
waiting for you and Jiang Nan.

520
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,360
Now you two are his best friends.

521
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,240
My good friend,

522
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,080
what gift did I bring you?

523
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,920
Why are they dog food and dog toys?

524
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,920
I don't have a dog at home.

525
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,600
You'll have it soon.

526
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,280
Chengcheng,

527
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,960
have some of this.

528
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,960
Doudou,

529
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,880
Brother Jiang Nan,

530
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,880
Happy birthday!

531
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,360
Thank you, Jiang Nan.

532
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,240
Do you like it?

533
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,120
Yes,

534
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,280
by the way,

535
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,160
Jiang Nan,

536
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,440
you came at the right time.

537
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,160
Chengcheng just left.

538
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,760
Chengcheng came just now.

539
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,480
She went that way.

540
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,360
Thank you, young man.

541
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,160
Many oranges.

542
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,760
Don't worry.

543
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,120
Okay, okay.

544
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,920
Understood.

545
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,560
Why are you running in such a hurry?

546
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Let's go!

547
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,480
Thank you.

548
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,320
Why are you hiding from Jiang Nan?

549
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,840
Did he

550
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
find out that you're sick,

551
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,360
No.

552
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,120
Don't ask.

553
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,880
If you want to cry,

554
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,960
I can lend you my shoulder.

555
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,600
I'm sorry

556
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,639
to drag you into this again.

557
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,720
I'm sorry,

558
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,400
but I can be your shield.

559
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Jiang Nan will be pissed off again.

560
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,640
Why not?

561
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,640
What happened

562
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,800
between you and Jiang Nan?

563
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,440
That day at Jiangnan's hometown,

564
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,880
you were like possessed,

565
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,600
It's nothing like Zhan Zhilin I knew before,

566
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,520
unlike me,

567
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
That's the real me.

568
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,480
How much do you know about me?

569
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,160
Maybe I don't know you that well.

570
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
But I know,

571
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,200
what you did that day was impulsive.

572
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,680
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

573
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,320
That day at Jiangnan's hometown,

574
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,800
you were like possessed,

575
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
It's nothing like Zhan Zhilin I knew before.

576
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
My dad gave you money.

577
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,120
I saw it.

578
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,200
Jiang Nan,

579
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,520
did you already know all this?

580
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,440
Then why didn't you tell me?

581
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,600
If you tell me,

582
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,720
I can still save my mom.

583
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,440
My mom wouldn't have died.

584
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,520
The grudges of the previous generation,

585
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,080
have nothing to do with us.

586
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,600
Jiang Nan,

587
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,280
are you talking in human language?

588
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,480
You're clearly protecting your mom.

589
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,720
No wonder

590
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,960
you want to break up the group?

591
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,000
Because you don't have the face to see me.

592
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,640
Are you done scolding me?

593
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,800
I'll leave if you're done scolding me.

594
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
I won't let you and your mom end well.

595
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,040
I'm here.

596
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,120
Where are you now?

597
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,760
Did you tell the truth about the nursing home?

598
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,480
From what standpoint do you ask this?

599
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,480
Why should I answer you?

600
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,840
Jiang Nan is indiscriminate,

601
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,800
so he came to ask me if I did it?

602
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,520
Who else could it be besides you?

603
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
I'm not the only one

604
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
who wants to mess with Jiang Nan.

605
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,760
It's Liang Zhe.

606
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,280
Let me tell you one more thing.

607
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,520
Many oranges have moved out of Jiangnan's house.

608
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,400
So don't waste your energy

609
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,800
on her.

610
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,680
Xiao Mei,

611
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,840
pick up the show for me last time.

612
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,520
I want Jiang Nan to see the shining me again.
