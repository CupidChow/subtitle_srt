1
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Why am I in bed?

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
You sleepwalked yesterday,

3
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,760
and you lost

4
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,320
all the medicine you climbed up.

5
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,440
Go and go through the formalities.

6
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,400
Thank you, nurse.

7
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,200
You're welcome.

8
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,800
You're weird, too.

9
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,440
He kept the hotel's two-meter bed and didn't sleep with me.

10
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,040
Why do you have to squeeze

11
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,480
such a small single bed with me in this hospital?

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,560
Are you feeling better?

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,400
Much better.

14
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,080
Let's go.

15
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
Brother Nan,

16
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,840
the hotel said you didn't come back all night.

17
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Mr. Bao can't reach you either.

18
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm so worried.

19
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm sorry,

20
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,760
We went to Huxin Island to play.

21
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
And Jiang Nan

22
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,440
is such a big man.

23
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,480
What's there to worry about?

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
We're going to check out.

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,360
If we spend a night together on the island,

26
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
Nan can play,

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,040
I have to report to Mr. Bao now.

28
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,480
For me?

29
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
Didn't you lose your phone?

30
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,640
It's for you.

31
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,320
No need.

32
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
I have a spare phone at home.

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,400
Take it.

34
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
This one

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's employee welfare.

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Everyone in the company has it,

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,320
No, I didn't.

38
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Take it as a thank-you gift from MV.

39
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,680
I really don't need it.

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,080
That's what I should do.

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
Besides,

42
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,120
I think this phone is quite expensive.

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,200
I really can't accept it.

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
Take it if it's for you.

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,040
also

46
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,680
Go home and locate the binding.

47
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't let me lose you again.

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Nan,

49
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,560
shall we go back directly to the company or to your home?

50
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,320
Send a lot of Orange Round Family Fun first.

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,960
Then you can send me to the nursing home.

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Okay.

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,200
Sister-in-law,

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,160
Nan prepared this for you

55
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,200
Bro,

56
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,920
Who is this?

57
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,200
Let me go in with you.

58
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,760
I haven't seen my father-in-law for a long time.

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,720
Don't be ridiculous.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,240
Aren't you afraid that my dad will drink with you?

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,280
All right,

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
you should go back now.

63
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
I have an appointment for dinner.

64
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,280
You can stay at home and eat with your parents before you go home.

65
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,880
Okay,

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,160
Hurry up and go.

67
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,320
-Bye. -Bye.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,240
The guests at noon will be busy when they arrive.

69
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Mom and dad

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
are back.

71
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm back from a business trip.

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,560
Chengcheng is back.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Let me hug you.

74
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,960
You're tanned.

75
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,480
You're tanned,

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,480
I inherited it, didn't I?

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
You've lost weight. Why didn't you

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,040
sit down? Hurry up.

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,360
Jiang Nan brought this to you.

80
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
Local specialty snacks.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,280
This kid is really thoughtful.

82
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,520
Thank him for us.

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,680
Okay,

84
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,520
That's so thoughtful of you.

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,040
Look,

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
This is your favorite,

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,840
my favorite mung bean cake,

88
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,280
Brother Ye,

89
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,360
thank you so much.

90
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Uncle Liu gave it to you.

91
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,640
Thank you.

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,600
Dalin,

93
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,480
Yours,

94
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,360
I don't eat sweet food.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,120
Lin,

96
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
you took the gun medicine,

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,720
Master,

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,800
don't tell me,

99
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,880
You son-in-law-to-be,

100
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
you really put a lot of effort into it.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,640
All right,

102
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
son-in-law-to-be,

103
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
We need to observe and observe again.

104
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,080
Nonsense,

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,080
if you ask me,

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,040
Master is right.

107
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
We have to observe,

108
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
and be really nice to Orange.

109
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,680
What's the use of

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,880
whistling in the flower?

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,600
Come on, Lin.

112
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
Cut it out.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,080
Are you done?

114
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
All right, let's move.

115
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,680
I received a big order at noon.

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,360
There are a lot of people,

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,200
Hurry up.

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,520
Let's go.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,480
Hello, Miss Yang. Nana

120
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,800
is here.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,240
Mr. Xu is waiting for you inside.

122
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,880
Go in.

123
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
Bye.

124
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,880
Study hard.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
Mr. Xu

126
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,480
is here.

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,800
Have you played the music arranged by the teacher last week?

128
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,720
Play it again.

129
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Okay.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
You're so intoxicated.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,840
It makes me want to fall in love.

132
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,560
Send it to Chen Dong.

133
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,400
Send it to Chen Dong.

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Send it to him as a token of gratitude.

135
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,280
If he likes it,

136
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll take it as a thank-you gift.

137
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,080
It's hopeless.

138
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,800
Did you?

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm staying at Keqin's house tonight.

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,360
I'm not going home.

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,040
Find yourself something to eat.

142
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,040
Quasi-leave,

143
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,960
make it up to you with a coke chicken wings.

144
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,760
That's great.

145
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,600
Seriously,

146
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
have dinner with me tonight,

147
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,760
Many oranges went to her bestie's house,

148
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,760
can I say no?

149
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,000
I want to be in a relationship,

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,920
too. You,

151
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,400
Let's listen to the music.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,040
When reversing,

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,120
operate the steering wheel with one hand,

154
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,120
Put your other hand on the back of the passenger seat.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,480
Turn your head to the back.

156
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,720
Take the initiative to help the girl in the co-pilot fasten her seat belt.

157
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,760
It's also a chance to get close to each other.

158
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,720
When the distance between a man and a woman is less than 50 centimeters

159
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,200
and they look at each other for more than one second,

160
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,760
Heart rate is 70%.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
What are you doing?

162
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,760
Nothing.

163
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll wait for my girlfriend to get off work.

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,600
Drive away.

165
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,520
You can't park here.

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Look,

167
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm coming.

168
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,560
I'm coming.

169
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,960
Zhu Xiaopang,

170
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,960
did you put a locator on me?

171
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,840
How did you know I came to work today?

172
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,960
No.

173
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,760
My sister told me that you have a regular meeting today,

174
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
so why are you here?

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm here to pick you up from work.

176
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,360
No need.

177
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,480
I can take a taxi myself.

178
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,680
Let me give you a ride.

179
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,760
Look at online car dating now,

180
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,120
there are so many unsafe examples.

181
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
You hurt your hand.

182
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,640
I'm worried.

183
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,800
Then let me follow you.

184
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,720
Anyway,

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
you can't leave my sight.

186
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,520
What are you doing?

187
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,680
I … I'll help you fasten your seat belt.

188
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm not paralyzed.

189
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,360
I'm sorry,

191
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,560
Chubby,

192
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm sorry,

193
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,480
it's not that

194
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,280
I'm amiable,

195
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
I really didn't mean it.

196
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
Go back now.

197
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,600
Orange will come to me later,

198
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
you just said you were hungry,

199
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll go upstairs and cook dinner for you.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,520
Have I offended you before?

201
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,120
That's why you're messing with me now.

202
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,280
I apologized to you.

204
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,360
Not amiable.

205
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,480
Don't be like this.

206
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,360
Then why did you

207
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,560
insist on chasing me?

208
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,880
We didn't have any history when we were in school.

209
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
You misunderstood.

210
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm not here for revenge.

211
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm here to repay you.

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,160
repay one's kindness

213
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,080
Okay,

214
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,000
let's change the way.

215
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,880
Let's be sworn brothers.

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,640
I'll be your sister.

217
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,440
No, no,

218
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
no. I can be your sister.

219
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,560
No, no, no.

220
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
I don't want to be your sister.

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,520
I want to be your boyfriend.

222
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,520
I'm begging you.

223
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
Please let me go.

224
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
Don't you think I'm miserable enough now?

225
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm begging you too.

226
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,520
Being with you has been my wish for many years.

227
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,280
You're not my type,

228
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,160
I'm destined to let you get hurt.

229
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm begging you.

230
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
I kowtowed to you. Chubby,

231
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,760
how do you know if you don't try?

232
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,120
Please give me a chance.

233
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,120
Stop pestering me, please!

234
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm begging you.

235
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,960
Please, are you

236
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,800
in mourning?

237
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,000
No, no, no

238
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,840
misunderstanding.

239
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,600
Orange,

240
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,360
let's go upstairs.

241
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,480
Many oranges are going to have dinner with us.

242
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,520
Now,

243
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,240
right away,

244
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,840
Right away.

245
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,440
Get lost

246
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Jiang Nan,

247
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,960
your daughter-in-law abducted my daughter-in-law,

248
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,520
I don't have dinner left.

249
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,160
Your daughter-in-law,

250
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,880
why are you so thick-skinned now?

251
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,680
Cut the crap!

252
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Where are you now?

253
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,920
Home,

254
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,280
Just wait and see.

255
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,280
I'm here to have dinner

256
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,480
with you!

257
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm starting.

258
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,880
Come on.

259
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,640
Delicious

260
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,160
Keqin,

261
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,760
if you ask me,

262
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,320
Zhu Xiaopang is really nice to you.

263
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,280
Or,

264
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,360
you can just follow him.

265
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,880
How can you tell that he's nice to me?

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,160
Tell me

267
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,640
what happened between you two in Jingcheng.

268
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,200
I heard that

269
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,840
you are the heroine of MV.

270
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
What's going on?

271
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,360
Actually, I don't know much

272
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,640
about the details.

273
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,720
The actors at that time suddenly couldn't go.

274
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
So he asked me to save him.

275
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,200
If you ask me,

276
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,880
I think this is Jiang Nan's plan.

277
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
He doesn't really like you.

278
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,480
It's a special surprise for you.

279
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,000
It's impossible.

280
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,040
It was an accident.

281
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,680
But it's really thrilling. Okay,

282
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
don't keep the suspense.

283
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,480
Tell me now.

284
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
That day,

285
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,320
it was because

286
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,320
you came in later.

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,360
Remember to ring the doorbell. I don't know

288
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,760
if I'm not alone at home anymore.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,360
Why do you treat me the same way?

290
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,280
Am I that annoying?

291
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,680
I got dumped.

292
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,080
I've done everything I can.

293
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,720
She still refuses to be my girlfriend.

294
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,680
Why are you laughing?

295
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,760
Someone who can help you is here.

296
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,160
Zhu Linfeng,

297
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,880
Mr. Bao,

298
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
Long time no see,

299
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,320
you two reminded me.

300
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,880
It's time to change the password.

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
You're so angry.

302
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,840
What's wrong with him?

303
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,680
You lost

304
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,960
your mind,

305
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,080
I'm not sure.

306
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Mr. Bao,

307
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,760
my goddess doesn't like me.

308
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,120
You asked me to leave.

309
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,120
He even asked me to roll towards the Pacific Ocean.

310
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,760
I really don't want to live anymore.

311
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,680
I don't have any experience either,

312
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,280
Mr. Bao,

313
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,320
No, you can leave if she asks you to.

314
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,080
Can we

315
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,080
stand up first?

316
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,200
Stand up first.

317
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm telling you,

318
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Then stay away from her.

319
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,960
Leave her alone for a while.

320
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,840
Don't contact me.

321
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,240
After a long time,

322
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,040
she'll find out,

323
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,480
I seem to have lost more than one man.

324
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,640
It's a whole spiritual support.

325
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,720
Really?

326
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
Of course,

327
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
now that you're like this,

328
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
Why don't you fight back?

329
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,599
That makes sense.

330
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,319
Of course.

331
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:08,960
Wait,

332
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,359
haven't you always been single?

333
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,960
How come you have this kind of experience?

334
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
If you watch two more idol dramas,

335
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
everything will come out.

336
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,440
Am I right?

337
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,680
Which one?

338
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,839
Which one

339
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,240
What happened?

340
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,920
That's about it.

341
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,359
What happened to you in the past few days,

342
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,440
there's a lot of information.

343
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Another hero saving the beauty,

344
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,200
another romantic outing?

345
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
We share weal and woe again.

346
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,080
Tell me honestly.

347
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
When you were filming MV,

348
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,000
there was no kissing scene.

349
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,840
That means I have it.

350
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,600
Gosh,

351
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
what exactly is this MV like?

352
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm so looking forward to it.

353
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
Jiang Nan and I are just acting.

354
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
And that's a play-in-play. It

355
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,680
can't be taken seriously.

356
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,080
The form is not important,

357
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,520
what matters is the feeling,

358
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,840
When Jiang Nan kissed you,

359
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,520
was there anything different

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
about you

361
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,480
feeling

362
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,280
I can't tell.

363
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,040
I've never kissed anyone before.

364
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,520
Gosh,

365
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,840
why am I surrounded by pure feelings?

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
I can't take it with me.

367
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,560
You have experience

368
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
in this field.

369
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,360
Can you tell me

370
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,120
what an emotional kiss looks like?

371
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,120
Of course,

372
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,960
it's not suitable

373
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
for children to skip.

374
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
This dish is too salty.

375
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,680
If you don't eat it,

376
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,200
I'll eat it. It's delicious.

377
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm starving.

378
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,440
This tofu

379
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,960
is not as good as many oranges.

380
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
I think it's okay.

381
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,120
Ignore him.

382
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,480
I'm telling you, with his mouth,

383
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
he was fed by many oranges.

384
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm here to ask for comfort.

385
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm not here to be abused.

386
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,360
By the way, Jiang,

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,960
when are you going to confess your love to many oranges?

388
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,960
Confess your love. You took care of a lot of oranges

389
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,240
before you confessed your love.

390
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,440
Brother,

391
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,560
what ears are you talking about?

392
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,240
I'm talking about the proposal.

393
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,120
Proposal?

394
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,320
You're moving too fast.

395
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,320
Teach me next time.

396
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,080
No,

397
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,640
Brother,

398
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,440
Hurry up and eat.

399
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,840
We'll go home after eating.

400
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,320
Don't.

401
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,640
I don't want to be alone.

402
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
Aren't you going back alone?

403
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,280
Let's continue watching the horror films we haven't finished watching.

404
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,040
Good for you.

405
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,640
You guys talk first.

406
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,400
I have to go to the nursing home today.

407
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm leaving.

408
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,720
You.

409
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,520
Why are you here again?

410
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,840
I'm here to see you.

411
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,920
Don't you have something to do every day?

412
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,360
Let me treat you to a meal at noon.

413
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,080
Think of it as a celebration of your official return to work.

414
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
No need, Chubby.

415
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
You're still young,

416
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,760
Can you find something serious to do?

417
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,600
Don't waste your time on me.

418
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,320
That's it.

419
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,520
I know you hate me.

420
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,240
I won't come to you again. Please don't.

421
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,680
What did you just say?

422
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
Did I hear it wrong?

423
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,120
Sorry,

424
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,560
happiness comes so suddenly.

425
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,880
I didn't realize it.

426
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,040
Did you hear it right?

427
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
I came here today,

428
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,360
just to end it face to face with you.

429
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,480
I know I'm stupid

430
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,120
and dumb,

431
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm not good enough for you.

432
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,640
But I still want to try my best to do better.

433
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,960
Yes.

434
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,640
Everyone has the right to like someone.

435
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,000
Now I'm handing this right to you.

436
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,320
I don't want to do this,

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
but as long as it's what you want,

438
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
I'll do everything.

439
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,080
I hope you can meet someone you like.

440
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,600
That person

441
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,360
likes you as much as I do.

442
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,960
Take care

443
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,400
Mr. Bao, I hope this will work.

444
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,960
Jiang,

445
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,840
you're not going to confess your love, are you?

446
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,400
I'm telling you,

447
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,080
my current job is hurting me.

448
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,200
And sad.

449
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
When I woke up early in the morning,

450
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,960
I was dragged by you to be a third wheel.

451
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,680
Do you know that?

452
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,880
Being single should be protected.

453
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,200
It's really cruel to be fed dog food.

454
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,400
And we are getting busier and busier now.

455
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,720
I have to go to see the post-production later,

456
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,400
I'm old enough,

457
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,720
Can you be considerate of me?

458
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,360
Why are you here?

459
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm here to see you.

460
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,280
What do you think?

461
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,640
It's okay.

462
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
You didn't reply to my WeChat messages.

463
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,240
I lost my phone a while ago.

464
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
I lost my phone,

465
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,400
You made me worry.

466
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,160
You know what?

467
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
What should I worry about?

468
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
What can I do with Jiang Nan here?

469
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,480
Let's go.

470
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,280
I'll send you back.

471
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,520
Lin Yaoyin,

472
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,000
that's right.

473
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,080
As compensation,

474
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,040
this,

475
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,320
Give it to me.

476
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,680
It took me a lot of effort to get it.

477
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,520
In that case, giving it to me

478
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,400
will be of commemorative significance.

479
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,080
You can't, right?

480
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,760
Thank you for the gift.

481
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,600
Give it to me.

482
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,440
Stop

483
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,760
messing around. Give it to me.

484
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,920
Give it to me.

485
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,160
Lin Yaoyin.

486
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,560
You really like Lin Yaoyin so much,

487
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,840
of course,

488
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,240
I never expected

489
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,280
to meet this out-of-print CD here,

490
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm so lucky.

491
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,680
Give it to me.

492
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,640
Give it to me.

493
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,880
Jiang,

494
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,040
the post-MV is coming out,

495
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,960
Do you have a problem with that?

496
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,160
Make up your mind.

497
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,200
It's okay for me to give you my opinion.

498
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,720
Don't change it again.

499
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,400
I won't change it.

500
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,840
Why do you look

501
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,520
a bit old lately?

502
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,480
Touching.

503
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,000
The meaning of pending.

504
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,200
Can you stop being so boring all day?

505
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,880
During the few days when you filmed the MV,

506
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,040
Du Ke told me everything.

507
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
What did he say to you?

508
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,040
He told me,

509
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,040
you stayed in a hotel with a lot of oranges,

510
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,600
Sweet shooting,

511
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,960
swimming together,

512
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,960
Why are you still on the island

513
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,800
in the middle of the lake?

514
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,160
Night outing,

515
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
staying out all night,

516
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,680
Yes,

517
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,960
I said Bao Rui,

518
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,080
Can you wash your brain?

519
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,880
Then tell me,

520
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,680
you just saw

521
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,000
a lot of oranges with Zhan Zhilin,

522
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,640
Why are you so angry that you're fighting a cockfight?

523
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I was afraid that many oranges would suffer.

524
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,920
She has never been in a relationship and has no experience,

525
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,960
can she withstand Zhan Zhilin's tricks?

526
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,680
Yes,

527
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,160
even if many oranges are seduced by Zhan Zhilin,

528
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,400
What does it have to do with us?

529
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,760
You're not a real couple anyway.

530
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,040
I can't

531
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,080
do that morally,

532
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,480
Jiang,

533
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,400
why don't you admit that you're jealous?

534
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,560
Me,

535
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,640
Not only are you jealous,

536
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
but you're also afraid of me.

537
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,480
What are you afraid of?

538
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,240
Fine, fine, fine,

539
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,960
Listen

540
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
to me now,

541
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,080
Go all out and take the initiative,

542
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,200
otherwise many oranges will be chased away by Zhan Zhilin.

543
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,360
If you regret it, go ahead.

544
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,720
Brother,

545
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,880
long time no see.

546
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,800
Many oranges are a good girl.

547
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,880
Don't involve her in this.

548
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,800
Also,

549
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
I forbid you to hurt her again.

550
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,840
A good girl should be loved by everyone,

551
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,160
so you can love her.

552
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,120
You won't let me like you.

553
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,720
I'm warning you,

554
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,600
don't mess with many oranges again.

555
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,040
What do you have to complain about?

556
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,200
Come at me!

557
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,440
Just let your mom mess with my dad

558
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,360
and don't let me mess with many oranges.

559
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,640
Okay.

560
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,040
It's good.

561
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,640
I haven't exercised my muscles for a long time.

562
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,320
Come on.

563
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,120
Stop it, you two!

564
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,360
Stop it! Stop it!

565
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,680
Are you okay, Jiang Nan?

566
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,200
What are you doing?

567
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,440
I don't have a father like you.

568
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,680
Jiang,

569
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,960
what's wrong with you?

570
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,800
We're artists.

571
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,960
This is our business card.

572
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,880
Let me have a look.

573
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,680
Let me see what's going on.

574
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,480
I'll stay at your place tonight.

575
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,360
I said I'll stay at your house tonight.

576
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,920
Also,

577
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
tell many oranges,

578
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm going on a business trip for a week.

579
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,400
Are you sure?

580
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,120
I'm sure.

581
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I'll get you some medicine.

582
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,400
Jiang Nan is going on a business trip.

583
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,360
He'll be back in a few days.

584
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,320
You can do

585
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
whatever you want with peace of mind,

586
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,160
Business trip.

587
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,360
Why don't you say anything?

588
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,320
What should I say?

589
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,920
Just half a day later,

590
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,400
you lost your phone.

591
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,280
You even drenched yourself.

592
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,040
You're such a pain in the ass.

593
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,000
Stop talking about me.

594
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,600
I'm miserable enough.

595
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,920
Listen

596
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,320
to me now,

597
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,000
Go all out and take the initiative,

598
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,160
otherwise many oranges will be chased away by Zhan Zhilin.

599
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,360
If you regret it,

600
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,560
go home at night,

601
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,680
I want to eat the cola chicken wings you made.

602
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,520
Aren't you on a business trip?

603
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,080
I'll be back

604
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,040
soon after I'm done.

605
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,440
Excuse me, do you have any members?

606
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,240
Yes,

607
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,800
151-6089。

608
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,680
Hey,

609
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,880
Many oranges,

610
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,680
where are you?

611
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,240
I'm shopping at the supermarket. Is it

612
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,320
a supermarket near my home?

613
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,520
That's right.

614
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,440
Wait for me there.

615
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,240
I'll pick you up.

616
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,440
What's wrong with your mouth?

617
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,800
I told you,

618
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,920
Qiang hit me.

619
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,160
What happened to your mouth?

620
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,720
Is it really Xiaoqiang?

621
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Qiang.

622
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Why is he acting so weird today?

623
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Don't be so busy.

624
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,600
It's okay. I'll do it.

625
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,400
Let me do it.

626
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,080
Let me do it.

627
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,680
Get out of here.

628
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,000
Why are you blushing?

629
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,640
I … How am I blushing?

630
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,640
It's too hot.

631
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,320
Then.

632
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
Get out of here. I'll do it myself.

633
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
No way.

634
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
If you do anything,

635
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,040
wouldn't I be a lamb to be slaughtered?

636
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,480
You can do whatever you want.

637
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,840
What can I do?

638
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,200
What are you thinking?

639
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,600
Maybe

640
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,760
if you don't go out,

641
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,280
there will be no food to eat.

642
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,440
Okay,

643
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,920
How about stewing chicken wings?

644
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,360
Your cooking standards

645
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,760
have declined recently.

646
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,639
You have to cook more often in the future.

647
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
People say,

648
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,159
a woman has a needle in her heart,

649
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,040
In my family,

650
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,840
I think your mind is the hardest to guess.

651
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,760
Later, he disliked me for cooking,

652
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,239
saying that I cooked like a moonlit meal,

653
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,440
And then you gobble it up here,

654
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,120
what did you just say?

655
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,560
Moon meal,

656
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,920
not this

657
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
to gobble it up,

658
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,920
When you said "our house" just now,

659
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,040
you used the word "our house" just right.

660
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,840
It's worthy of praise.

661
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,120
Let me tell you,

662
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,960
your cooking is too salty.

663
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,680
You need to practice more in the future.

664
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,200
Chengcheng,

665
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,960
it's me, your dad.

666
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,000
Open the door.

667
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,960
What's wrong?

668
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,120
My dad is here.
