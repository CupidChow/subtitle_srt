1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440

2
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:13,730
♫  I've walked around in a big circle  ♫

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,970
♫  To finally meet you  ♫

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,270
♫  How can my love be restrained?  ♫

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,445
♫  My love for you is too obvious  ♫

6
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:30,303
♫  I guess you must have already discovered it  ♫

7
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:33,117
♫  On that clear evening  ♫

8
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,522
♫  It was romantic meeting you  ♫

9
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:38,904
♫  An unforgettable memory  ♫

10
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,703
♫  I heard that passionate love  ♫

11
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:44,417
♫  Can dissolve glaciers  ♫

12
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:48,404
♫  I say good night to you every night  ♫

13
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:51,131
♫  If you get used to it as well  ♫

14
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,844
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

15
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:55,391
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

16
00:00:55,391 --> 00:00:58,758
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you   ♫

17
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,573
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

18
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:05,814
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

19
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:10,761
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

20
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,515
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

21
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,249
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

22
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:18,356
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

23
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:21,069
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

24
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,728
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

25
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:31,247
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

26
00:01:40,472 --> 00:01:45,200
    🎈

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,919

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
 Jiang Nan is here!

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,120
 Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan!

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,320
 Jiang Nan, what do you think about the voice recording?

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,120
 Did your driver really leak your new song?

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,900
 Can you respond to the question, Jiang Nan?

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,560
 Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan!

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,780
 Jiang Nan, is that voice recording real? Can you answer us?

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,840
 - Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan! Jiang Nan! 
 - Please, respond.

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,940
I should give everyone an answer about what happened on Cool Singer-Songwriters.

37
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,880
Just like what my girlfriend said,

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,640
if it's the truth, we should just say it out loud for everyone to hear.

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,020
My girlfriend is the most courageous and optimistic girl I've ever met.

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,880
For the past few months, she helped and taught me a lot.

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,700
She taught me how to express myself.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,180
She also made me understand love.

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:56,920
♫  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  ♫

44
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,700
♫  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  ♫

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,080
Therefore, today's performance is my gift to you.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,200
Xu Duo Yu, Xu Duo Li, 
  (T/N: Literally "a lot of fish, a lot of strength")

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,460
Xu Duo Chun, Xu Duo Ai, 
  (T/N: Literally "a lot of foolishness, a lot of love")

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,080
Xu Duo Cheng, thank you for coming into my life. 
  (T/N: Her name literally means "a lot of oranges")

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,300
I love you.

50
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,970
♫  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  ♫

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,080
♫  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  ♫

52
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,790
♫  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  ♫

53
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,190
♫  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  ♫

54
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,280
♫  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  ♫

55
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,390
♫  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  ♫

56
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,320
Oh, my God.

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,360
His song release instantly became a confession of love.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,260
Jiang Nan is so romantic!

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,700
 Zhi Lin, you should have a nice dinner.

60
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,940
 I saved you some soup. Remember to drink it when you come home.

61
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,120
 Zhi Lin, did you leave the office yet?

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,440
 When will you be home?

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,590
 Are you tired from your rehearsals today?

64
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,079
 Zhi Lin, I heard your new song.

65
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,040
 I'm so happy for you.

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,380
 It's not easy for you and Jiang Nan to make your debut.

67
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,660
 You two will be well.

68
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,200
 You two must be well.

69
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,000
 Mom, you always wished Jiang Nan and I will focus on our music careers,

70
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,320
 but I screwed up everything.

71
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,580
For the next song, I was planning to invite a friend of mine to sing it with me.

72
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,860
That's also my girlfriend's wish.

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,180
We used to be best friends.

74
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,580
We started singing together on this stage before our debut.

75
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,080
He's talking about Zhan Zhi Lin, right?

76
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,080
It's too bad that 2BeOne disbanded.

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,980
Exactly. They were really popular at the time,

78
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,520
but I think Lao Jiang will  be even more popular if we cooperate.

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
I just want to say,

80
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,180
no matter what happened in the past,

81
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,140
I really miss...

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,220
I really miss the days when I performed with him on this stage.

83
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,560
 Zhan Zhi Lin is here!

84
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:30,060
Take a look at the latest rankings.

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,120
Lao Jiang's ranking skyrocketed.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,520
Look at Jian Xing, he took a nose dive by 12 places.

87
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,000
Let me tell you, our team can finally be proud and elated.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,940
Wait, I have to send a message to Qin Shan and ask her to strike while the iron is hot,

89
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,540
and write a few more articles for you.

90
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,340
You're contacting Sister Shan more often than you contact me.

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,680
I'm just doing it for you. I have to kiss up to her.

92
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,400
You keep mentioning Sister Shan all the time.

93
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,000
If you miss her so much,

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,540
I'll invite her to the celebratory dinner we're hosting at home tomorrow.

95
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,840
How about hot pot?

96
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,160
Not bad, Cheng Cheng.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,640
You're acting more like the lady of the house now.

98
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,960
How's this?

99
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,540
From now on, you'll be in charge in the house.

100
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,520
If you want to have hot pot, we'll have hot pot.

101
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,480
Let's invite Zhan Zhi Lin, too.

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,620
I'll ask him but I don't think he'll come.

103
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,480
Well, too bad for him then.

104
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,020
A lot of people are coming tomorrow.

105
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,100
You need to go shopping with me.

106
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,600
As you wish.

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,460
- We're going back now. 
 - Bye, Lord Bao.

108
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,520
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye.

109
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,060
Hello, Sister Shan.

110
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,070

111
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,280
Hello. My name is Zheng Feng.

112
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,320
I'm the creator of this painting.

113
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,780
What's the name of this painting?

114
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,860
"Silhouette."

115
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,160
It's the silhouette of a lover.

116
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,260
Seems like you're really fond of painting women's silhouettes.

117
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,980
Thank you.

118
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,900
You seem to be interested in my paintings too.

119
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,900
I'm very honored that I collected one of them many years ago.

120
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,680
Why would you have this painting?

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,679
Liang Shu Qian, do you still remember her?

122
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,359
You are... her son？

123
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:40,760
Liang Shu Qian committed suicide because of you.

124
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:44,019
Because of me?

125
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,679
Your dad asked you to look for me, right?

126
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,140
It's been so many years.

127
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,160
It's about time to clear up this misunderstanding.

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
Misunderstanding?

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,340
What misunderstanding?

130
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,860
Your mom and I were just like-minded on an artistic level.

131
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,420
It wasn't what your dad thought it was.

132
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,920
Don't start with me.

133
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Why? Don't you dare admit it?

134
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,380
Your mom only came here to learn how to paint and kill time.

135
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,060
Do you see these paintings of mine?

136
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,260
They are very similar, right?

137
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,560
That's right.

138
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,700
They are all paintings of your mom.

139
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,420
But,

140
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,660
your dad was the subject of all your mom's paintings.

141
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,660
If what you said is true,

142
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,300
why did my dad tell me she committed suicide because you abandoned her?

143
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,420
She didn't even love me!

144
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,920
Why would she commit suicide for me?

145
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,860
That's just your dad's speculation, okay?

146
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,620
Your mom contacted me before she passed away.

147
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,760
She saw the texts your dad sent to Tian Cai Yun

148
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,040
and couldn't accept the reality.

149
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,860

150
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,720
He also lied and claimed your mom had an affair.

151
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,780
These are the texts

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,440
your mom sent before she died.

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,540
Without these things,

154
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,740
the two of us will be misunderstood forever.

155
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,340
Before my mom passed away,

156
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,560
 did you text Tian Cai Yun and tell her you'll take care of her and her son?

157
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,480
How do you know?

158
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,740
There was nothing between Mom and Zheng Feng.

159
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,780
What exactly did Zheng Feng tell you?

160
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,780
Your mom didn't love me anymore.

161
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,460
She was the one who asked me for a divorce.

162
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,000
 That's because she couldn't accept the fact that you were going to take care of Tian Cai Yun.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,260
Every time she went to learn to paint from Zheng Feng,

164
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,960
she painted you every time.

165
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,060
She never got over you.

166
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,940
 If you didn't love her, why didn't you tell her earlier?

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Why did you cause her so much pain?

168
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,860
 It's fine if you felt sorry for Tian Cai Yun and took care of her and her son.

169
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,920
 But why did you have to say

170
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,840
 you'd rather get a divorce to take care of Tian Cai Yun for the rest of your life?

171
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,380
 Over the years, you've been treating her with a lukewarm attitude.

172
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,500
You would rather spend the night in the office than come home.

173
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,100
I saw it all with my own eyes.

174
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,840
Mom kept saying kind things about you.

175
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,880
 How can you slander her of having an affair with Zheng Feng first?

176
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,740
It was my fault.

177
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,700
I didn't expect that.

178
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,460
I thought your mom fell in love with someone else.

179
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,540
 I really didn't expect things to turn out like this.

180
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,260
 Shu Qian. I have something—

181
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,600
 I want a divorce.

182
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
 What?

183
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,360
 I want a divorce.

184
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,860
 Why?

185
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,620
 Because I fell in love with someone I shouldn't fall in love with.

186
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
 As for you,

187
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,310
 you did the same thing.

188
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,020
 I was the one she was talking about.

189
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,920

190
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,040
Lift your feet.

191
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,080
I checked it. That place is packed today.

192
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,500
Ever since an internet-trendy restaurant opened across the street,

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,160
all our customers are gone.

194
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,700
What's so good about it?

195
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,360
It's just flashy and pretentious.

196
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,760
I deliberately went in there once.

197
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,580
They put a rose in front of you and shatter it with one strike.

198
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,600
Are they there to eat or to watch a magic show?

199
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,560
When it comes to the taste, it's extremely mediocre.

200
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,900
Boss, are you open for business today?

201
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,960
- We are open! 
 - We are open.

202
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
Let's not eat here. They have magic shows across the street.

203
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,040
Let's go.

204
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,340
What's wrong with youngsters these days?

205
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,580
You call that a restaurant?

206
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,400
It's famous on the internet.

207
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,740
It's the age of internet influence.

208
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,040
If they hire a star to endorse them, they'll have more customers.

209
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,300
Who cares about the quality of your product?

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,100
Don't even think about it!

211
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,020
Things like roses or magic will never enter my Happy Family.

212
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,500
I will never do that.

213
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,160
I will never do that. Never.

214
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,660
I'm telling you, Happy Family will win by our taste.

215
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,420
Well, we have a star.

216
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,300
A star?

217
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,120
- You mean Jiang Nan? 
 - That's right.

218
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,900
That's right.

219
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Would that be okay?

220
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,820
We're almost family. Why wouldn't it be okay?

221
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,280
- Call him. 
 - Okay.

222
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,560
You can't catch me.

223
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,600
- Cheng Cheng, a video call from your dad. 
 - Answer it for me.

224
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
Uncle, Auntie.

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Jiang Nan. Where's Cheng Cheng?

226
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,780
 Dad, I'm here.

227
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,160
Cheng Cheng, have you eaten yet?

228
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
I just finished. What's going on?

229
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,100
Here's the thing.

230
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,900
A restaurant opened across the street from us.

231
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,640
 Big Lin said it's some kind of internet-trendy restaurant.

232
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,920
 They stole all our business.

233
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,100
Dad, internet-trendy restaurants rely on the advertisement.

234
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,180
If we only judge it by the taste of their food, they probably can't compare to our place.

235
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,380
We can do some advertisements later too.

236
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,840
 That's right, Uncle.

237
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,880
Didn't you update the menu and add a lot of specialty dishes?

238
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,840
We can promote all of that at the same time.

239
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,680
 Well, there's no need for that. I don't want to bother you.

240
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,640
Uncle, no need to be polite with me.

241
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,620
It's our family business. There's no trouble at all.

242
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,360
That's what I'm supposed to do.

243
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,160
Thank you.

244
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,760
You, young people, have more creative ideas.

245
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,460
 Mom, don't worry about it.

246
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,860
Well, that's it then. We're hanging up now.

247
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,660
We're hanging up.

248
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,140
It's done!

249
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,900
Should I do a live streaming at the restaurant?

250
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,780
I have over 100,000 fans on my health awareness channel.

251
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,200
I think that counts as a fan base too, right?

252
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,620
I have a ready-made fan base, okay?

253
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,520
It doesn't suit you.

254
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,700
You've always had a cool and aloof public persona.

255
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,020
How many times did I go against my persona in front of you?

256
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,240
Besides, one more time wouldn't hurt.

257
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,980
Plus, Happy Family is the real deal.

258
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,580
I would feel reassured endorsing it too.

259
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,920
Well, let's do live streaming together.

260
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,400
Sure.

261
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,300
Come on, let's continue.

262
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,580
I'll surely defeat you.

263
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,600
I'm about to surpass you!

264
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,680
Aren't you pretty tough, Chief Editor Qin?

265
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,620
We came to challenge you and see how tough you are.

266
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,140
We heard you love to help someone in need.

267
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,540
I wonder if anyone would come to your rescue when you're in trouble today.

268
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,100
What are you doing? Who are you?

269
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,639
- Go! 
 - Let go of me!

270
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,800
Let go of me!

271
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,420
Do you want canned chicken, canned beef,

272
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,440
or canned pork today?

273
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,119
Tell me. Father will satisfy your needs.

274
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,480
 Help!

275
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,380
Let go of me!

276
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,019
Let go of me! What are you doing?

277
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,019
Who are you?

278
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,100
Call the police.

279
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,400
Don't move!

280
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,340
I dare you to move!

281
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
Stay away!

282
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
Stop! Stop!

283
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,380
I already called the police. They'll be here soon!

284
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't you think about running away?

285
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,700
You can't escape.

286
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,160
Run!

287
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,380
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

288
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,660
Didn't I tell you to call the police? Why did you come back?

289
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,540
I dropped my phone and couldn't find it.

290
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,060
How could I call the police? I was in a hurry to save you.

291
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,020
Why were you acting tough in that situation?

292
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,700
When you really encounter something like that, men and women's strengths aren't even on the same level.

293
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,040
The further you run away, the more help you are to me.

294
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,960
I can protect you.

295
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
You'll protect me?

296
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,940
Look at your fragile frame.

297
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,400
Are you looking down upon me?

298
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,220
This is what people call "hiding one's muscles under clothes".

299
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,740
I don't just fish normally. I work out too.

300
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,940
Is that so?

301
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,840
Who are they?

302
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,313
They must be hired by Liang Zhe.

303
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:34,720
Think about it, if I hadn't shown up just now,

304
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
what would have happened if they really took you away?

305
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,940
Train a dog for a thousand days to be used at the time of crisis.

306
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,340
Why does that sound so strange?

307
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,640
No, I can't let them escape like that. I have to call the police.

308
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,540
Ma'am, stop being stubborn.

309
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,340
Do you have proof?

310
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,700
- No. 
 - Well, exactly.

311
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,240
From now on, I'll drive you to wherever you need to go.

312
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,420
You'll drive me?

313
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,500
Something like this already happened. Who else would do it besides me?

314
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,120
Besides, we live in the same neighborhood.

315
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,600
Shut up.

316
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,400
Don't refute.

317
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,580
Let's go home.

318
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,200
Why didn't you wear a mask?

319
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
What if someone recognizes you?

320
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
It's all right.

321
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,120
Why do you buy so much orange juice?

322
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,840
To drink at home.

323
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,620
What brand do you like?

324
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,940
Excuse me, are you Jiang Nan?

325
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,700
Yes.

326
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,860
- That's great! 
 - That's great.

327
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,060
Can I take a picture with you?

328
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,360
This is my private time with my girlfriend.

329
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,300
I won't take pictures or give out signatures.

330
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,820
We'll just take one picture. It'll be very quick. Just one.

331
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,180
That's right. We'll just take one picture.

332
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,760
- Please, just one. 
 - Is that okay?

333
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,120
Just take one then.

334
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,420
All right.

335
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,160
Three, two, one.

336
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,960
Beef. Beef.

337
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,140
- This one. 
 - No, no.

338
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,640
Let's not buy that. Buy the kind that's grass-fed.

339
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,140
This one.

340
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,100
- This one? 
 - Yes, that one.

341
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,900
Lao Jiang loves beef. Let's get another carton.

342
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,160
And then what? We'll go to the vegetable section and buy some onions and green pepper.

343
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,900
That's about it. What else do we need?

344
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,820
Chicken wings. That's right, chicken wings.

345
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,020
He loves cola chicken wings.

346
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,240
All you think about is Jiang Nan.

347
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,800
You're the most competent agent.

348
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,100
I'm used to it.

349
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,920
Do you like spareribs?

350
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,020
I make the best spareribs.

351
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,760
It gives me acne. I can't eat it.

352
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,520
Your acne will clear up after you eat the spareribs I make.

353
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,320
Come here.

354
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,640
The spareribs are awesome.

355
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,860
You're not going to answer your phone?

356
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,040
No.

357
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,420
Those people from Cool Singer-Songwriters didn't want Lao Jiang to be on the show anymore at the time.

358
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,460
Now, they won't stop bugging me to apologize.

359
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,640
I can't let them off the hook that easily, right?

360
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,080
Cut that out. Don't take a good thing for granted.

361
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
You have no idea how unoccupied we used to be.

362
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
Now that things are finally getting better, I have to show off a little.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,040
Actually, I'm really annoyed now.

364
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,000
So many people are lining up with all kinds of projects for Lao Jiang

365
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,920
that I don't even know how to arrange his schedule.

366
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,720
Let's analyze it together to see how to manage his time.

367
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,480
You're showing off now.

368
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
- Of course. 
  - Look at how perfect they are for each other.

369
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,620
 Younger men and older women make the sweetest couples these days.

370
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,400
As long as you keep yourself looking young, your future boyfriend will still be in high school.

371
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,680
Let's buy some onions.

372
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
You're coming to try the new piano?

373
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,820
Xu Duo Cheng hasn't been coming to teach lately?

374
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,460
Not very often.

375
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,920
She canceled her lessons with a lot of students. Maybe she's busy with something else.

376
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
I'm going back to work.

377
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,720
Xu Duo Cheng is a blessing for Jiang Nan.

378
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,900
Tell me about it. However, Lao Jiang couldn't get this far without your help either.

379
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,320
Thank you.

380
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,920
Not at all.

381
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,800
I'll do it.

382
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,880
- Can you manage? 
 - Yes, I can.

383
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,820
- I really didn't expect... 
 - It's easy.

384
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,080
Lord Bao can even become friends with my cousin.

385
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,480
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

386
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,680
You're such a dummy.

387
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Well, Jiang Nan, I bought something else.

388
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Come get it with me.

389
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,640
All right, Sister Shan.

390
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,440
I'll go get that first.

391
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,100
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

392
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,620
My cousin smiled at you?

393
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,480
I've never seen her like that.

394
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,340
Teach me a few tricks.

395
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,420
Help me pursue Ke Qin.

396
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,720
What's going on with them?

397
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,040
I... No, it's a unique situation with your cousin and me. That's another story.

398
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,140
Besides, you didn't use the tricks I taught you before.

399
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,900
I can't play hard to get with Ke Qin.

400
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,400
Ke Qin is like a magnet, and I'm like an iron nail.

401
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,300
How can I keep a distance from her?

402
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,520
If you can't keep a distance, just cater to her wishes.

403
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,320
Jiang Nan is so good to you.

404
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,160
You have someone who's good to you unconditionally too.

405
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,440
Everyone is here tonight.

406
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Shall we have a few drinks? I'll go buy some liquor.

407
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,520
You don't have to.

408
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,400
- I have some in the basement. I'll go get it. 
 - Okay.

409
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,800
But I know everything about what she likes to eat and do.

410
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,240
Who asked you that?

411
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,080
I'm asking if you know what kind of men Ke Qin likes.

412
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,680
Do you know?

413
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,720
She likes cool guys.

414
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,660
Well, be cool.

415
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,960
Aren't I a cool guy?

416
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,140
I'm very popular in the U.S., okay?

417
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,600
I just can't be cool in front of Ke Qin.

418
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,820
Maybe my fat and wimpy image left too much of an impression on her.

419
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,780
Well, pretend to be a stranger,

420
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,880
make her forget her previous impression of you and get to know you again.

421
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,240
How?

422
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,740
Plastic surgery?

423
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,140
Do you have an alternative account?

424
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,800
I do have an alternative Weibo account that Ke Qin doesn't know about.

425
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,520
- Well, use it. 
 - Use it.

426
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,700
- Use it. 
 - Use it.

427
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,900
- Use it. 
 - Use...

428
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,800
Sister Shan, why did you buy so much?

429
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,580
Of course. We rarely have a gathering.

430
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,380
We have to eat something nice.

431
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Ke Qin, where's Cheng Cheng?

432
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,100
She went downstairs to get liquor.

433
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,780
Cheng Cheng, don't move. I'll get it for you.

434
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,540
It's okay. I already got them.

435
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,020
What happened to your hand?

436
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,640
It's all right. I just pulled a muscle.

437
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,020
- I'm fine now. 
 - I can't believe scenes of female leads falling into the arms of male leads in various ways

438
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,700
would actually happen in real life.

439
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,040
They fell together but didn't kiss.

440
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,580
That won't do. Do that take again.

441
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,000
There's enough free PDA for everyone.

442
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,560
Cut that out. Are you jealous?

443
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,860
Are we having hot pot or not?

444
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,360
Let's eat.

445
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,400
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

446
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,260
Stop being so mushy. Get some food for Orange.

447
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,760
She can't reach it.

448
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,180
Why does this wine taste sweeter than usual?

449
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,920
Yep, I think so too. I think it's tastier with a scoop of PDA.

450
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,680
You two should get married soon.

451
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,960
I want to be the most beautiful bridesmaid.

452
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,340
You shouldn't be a singer anymore.

453
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,700
You should act in idol dramas.

454
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,340
What are you guys talking about?

455
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,840
Eat your food.

456
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,940
Cheng Cheng, you should eat more.

457
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,000
This is too much. I can't finish.

458
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,613
No, you have to replenish yourself with nourishment now.

459
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,700
Does your hand hurt?

460
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,340
I'll give you a band-aid. Come on.

461
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,380
Here.

462
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,880
- I want to eat. 
 - Here.

463
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,620
- Be more careful next time. 
 - Okay.

464
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,720
What are you looking at? Eat your food.

465
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,480
I'm fine.

466
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,020
 Brother Rui, Ke Qin responded to my alternative account.

467
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,860
 Play it down.

468
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,060

469
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,960
Harder.

470
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,760
Do it harder.

471
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,900
I'm already doing it very hard.

472
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,140
Seems like you're losing the muscle on your left hand beside your calves.

473
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,900
Actually, since you are losing your arm muscles way too fast,

474
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,600
it will cause you to lose your strength and fall down.

475
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,300
These scrapes and bruises are not that serious. You'll recover in a few days.

476
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,600
The important thing is muscle loss.

477
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,520
If we let this situation continue to develop,

478
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,420
your hands might turn into the shape of chicken feet.

479
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,620
Chicken feet hands?

480
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,020
That's right.

481
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,880
You have to massage it more often.

482
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,420
It may be able to delay the process.

483
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,820
Okay, thank you, Doctor Sui.

484
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,300
 Chicken feet hand?

485
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,933
 How can I keep my hands a secret from everyone?

486
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,720
Why is the patient in Bed 3 having another episode?

487
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,940
I don't know why.

488
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,740
Let's go.

489
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,630

490
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,740

491
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,660
 Jiang Nan, the key is that Iberico.

492
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,140
 The Iberico, right?

493
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,220
 The spareribs.

494
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,920
Cheng Cheng is here.

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,840
You prepared so much food.

496
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,540
- Of course. 
 - These are all my father's specialty dishes.

497
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,920
- That's for sure. 
 - Specialty dishes.

498
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Wait.

499
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,400
Cheng Cheng, what happened to your hand?

500
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,920
I accidentally fell and twisted my wrist. I pulled a muscle.

501
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,320
- This child. 
 - Silly child, how old are you now?

502
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,480
Why are you still so clumsy?

503
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,960
I don't know about anyone else.

504
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,840
If she were my girlfriend, I would never let her get hurt.

505
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Big Lin, why is the light so dark?

506
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,500
- Did you do it wrong? 
 - That's how this light is.

507
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,980
Look, he didn't do it wrongly.

508
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,520
Why didn't you ask me to go to the hospital with you?

509
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,840
I'm fine. Don't worry.

510
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,680
Does it still hurt?

511
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,220
A little.

512
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,180
Stop dilly-dallying. Let's go.

513
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,820
Ready. Go!

514
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Hello, everyone.

515
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm the host of Live Till 99, Duo Duo.

516
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,120
Today, we have a handsome and special guest joining our live streaming.

517
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,220
He's Jiang Nan.

518
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,520
Hello, everyone. I'm Jiang Nan.

519
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,660
It's my first time doing a gourmet food live streaming. Please, give us more "likes".

520
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,140
We've asked Jiang Nan to come to our channel

521
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,180
to introduce a very unique restaurant to everyone.

522
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,960
 As you know, I'm a very health conscious youth.

523
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,120
 That's why I usually cook for myself,

524
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,440
 but this restaurant uses fresh and unique ingredients.

525
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,800
 That's right.

526
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,500
Look at this.

527
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Jiang Nan, you're even willing to do something like this for Xu Duo Cheng?

528
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,660
Sister, let's not watch the live stream anymore.

529
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,900
Why not?

530
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,760
I want to see how great Jiang Nan and Xu Duo Cheng can make "Happy Family" sound.

531
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,320
If you have time, you must come and try the food at Happy Family.

532
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,240
The food here really tastes like home cooking.

533
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,300
The internet-trendy restaurant across the street won't have more business than us now.

534
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,980
Happy Family will be waiting for you!

535
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,680
Secretary Ding, let's have our company dinners at Happy Family from now on.

536
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,480
I'll reimburse you later.

537
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,360
Sister, why did you click "like"?

538
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,840
Cancel it now.

539
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,960
I clicked it by accident.

540
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
It's still not too late to cancel it, right?

541
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,600

542
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,740
I will show you the dishes of the Happy Family Restaurant.

543
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,120
 - It's my first time here.  
 - Please, come again.

544
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,920
I heard the food is delicious. Look at this dish.

545
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
Master Liu,

546
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,420
are there any special discounts at the restaurant lately?

547
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,360
All dishes will be 20% off! 20% off!

548
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,400
20% off!

549
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,100
Fans of the channel, everything will be 25% off!

550
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,120
I will make up for the price difference myself!

551
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,280
We welcome you and your family to our restaurant. Welcome to the restaurant.

552
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,400
Good. Let's take a look at the dishes.

553
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,540
Master Liu, the dishes here are delicious.

554
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,360
Can we reserve a private room next time?

555
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,160
No problem. You're all old customers.

556
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,840
Eat and drink well.

557
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,740
Please, don't be reserved.

558
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,180
Xiao Zhang, you're here.

559
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,380
Well, the food here is delicious.

560
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,560
Let me tell you, I recommended this place to my friend

561
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,880
and told his father to host his 70th birthday party here. Don't mess it up.

562
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,780
Don't worry. We will surely make it a lively party.

563
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,560
- Cheng Cheng. 
 - Uncle Liu, business is blooming.

564
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,480
- It sure is. 
 - I'll help you.

565
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
There's no need.

566
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,580
If you have the time, you should go on a date with Jiang Nan instead.

567
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,100
Jiang Nan is busy writing songs every day.

568
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,080
 Waiter, we need to order!

569
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,460
- Coming! 
 - Uncle Liu, let me do it.

570
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,520
Gu Jia Yi?

571
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,220
- Gu Jia Yi is here. 
 - It's really Gu Jia Yi.

572
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,300
I wanted to keep a low profile

573
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,520
but you still recognized me.

574
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,040
I came because I was drawn to the food at Happy Family too.

575
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,240
I hope everyone can take me as an ordinary person.

576
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,800
Please, enjoy your meal.

577
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,520
Gu Jia Yi is Jiang Nan's ex-girlfriend.

578
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,200
Why is she here?

579
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,520
Besides, she even endorsed Happy Family for us.

580
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,060
Miss, all the tables are full.

581
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
That's okay. I can share a table.

582
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,699
Why? I'm not welcome here?

583
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,000
You are welcome.

584
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,639
What would you like?

585
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,000
Order a few specialty dishes for me.

586
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,300
Do you have any allergies or abstinence?

587
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm allergic to peanuts.

588
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,740
Thank you for the trouble.

589
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,680
Big Lin, do not put crushed peanuts on the spinach salad later.

590
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,460
- The customer is allergic. 
 - Got it.

591
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,120
Cheng Cheng, go take a break.

592
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,400
Don't wear yourself out.

593
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
Got it, Dad.

594
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,040
Don't forget. Don't mix it up.

595
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,640
Don't worry.

596
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,060
Excuse me.

597
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,760
Your dishes are served.

598
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,880
Cheng Cheng, the food here is really delicious.

599
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
- They are nice and sanitary. 
 - That's right.

600
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,560
Even Miss Gu complimented you. Your business will surely prosper.

601
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,060
Thank you.

602
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,760
Go ahead and eat, Miss Gu.

603
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,960
You should start eating too.

604
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,100
Cheng Cheng, I can serve the dishes.

605
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,420
Why did you go?

606
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,200
It's all right. The restaurant is so busy and we're short-handed.

607
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,140
Plus, we should always save ourselves from trouble

608
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,720
when we're running a restaurant, right?

609
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,220
It's fine.

610
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,320
Miss Gu!

611
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,480
Someone come help her!

612
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,800
Miss Gu, what's wrong?

613
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
- Miss Gu, what happened? 
 - What's wrong?

614
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,200
What's going on?

615
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,240
It might be an allergic reaction.

616
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
Uncle Liu, call an ambulance!

617
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,980
- Okay. 
 - Miss Gu!

618
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,120
Don't crowd around here.

619
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,940
Master! Master!

620
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,460
Why are you making a fuss?

621
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,980
A customer had an allergic reaction after she ate our food!

622
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,060
- What? 
 - Allergic?

623
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,240
Allergic?

624
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,160
Yes, it seems pretty serious and an ambulance was called.

625
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
You called an ambulance?

626
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:27,980

627
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:40,246
♫  I walked past many side roads before you met me  ♫

628

629

00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:43,078
♫  I don't want to wait any longer  ♫

643
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:46,469
♫  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  ♫

644

651
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:33,257

652
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:37,437
♫  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind   ♫

653
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:43,884
♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

654
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:47,275
