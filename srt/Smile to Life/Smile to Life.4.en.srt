1
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Aunt,

2
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,000
don't sit here.

3
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,920
It's too dangerous.

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,240
Uncle Jiang will be here soon.

5
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
Come back with me.

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,480
Auntie,

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
it's too dangerous here.

8
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,880
Why isn't he here yet?

9
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,560
Jiang Nan.

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Jianghai,

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,640
why are you here?

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Aren't you busy?

13
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,040
If I don't come,

14
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,080
I'm afraid you'll really jump.

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
I won't.

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
You have your career,

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
you have clients to entertain,

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,000
You don't have time for me.

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,600
Stop messing around.

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,640
I really have

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
a lot of work to do recently.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,240
I understand.

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
Work is the most important thing.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,080
Caiyun,

25
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,520
that's not true.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
In my heart,

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,720
you are the most important one.

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,280
You seem to be

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,960
in a stable mood now.

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
That's weird.

31
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,560
Why did Mr. Bao let me come to the nursing home?

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,080
Send the key to God Nan.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,680
I can't believe there's Strauss's antique violin

34
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
room number. That's right.

35
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
God Nan.

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
Do you still remember?

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,280
This is where we had our first date.

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,320
At that time, you told me,

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,520
Caiyun,

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,040
Our future life will be better and better.

41
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,160
After that, our life

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
really got better and better.

43
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,400
But you spend less and less time

44
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,440
with me.

45
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,000
Chae Yun,

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,440
I'm sorry,

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
It's okay.

48
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,680
But from now on,

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,520
I can't let you take care of my son.

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,200
I can't go home after learning from you.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,280
Can't my daughter-in-law be wronged to death?

52
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,120
I just hope,

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,040
my son,

54
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
You'll be a man of

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,800
indomitable spirit in the future.

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,240
Yes.

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,680
He won't let you down.

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,840
Why are you here?

59
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,480
Why is Jiang Nan wearing this?

60
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
Why are you playing my husband's piano?

61
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,760
I really like this piano.

62
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
So I couldn't hold it back,

63
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
Jiang Hai,

64
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,720
Jianghai, do you know her?

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
Mr. Bao asked me to deliver the key.

66
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,840
Take it.

67
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
Sorry

68
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,400
to bother you.

69
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,800
Caiyun,

70
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,120
this is my new assistant.

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
It's getting late.

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Let's go in and have a rest.

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,600
Don't worry.

74
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
The new song is being written.

75
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Don't worry,

76
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,680
It won't affect us.

77
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,640
Don't worry.

78
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,480
I'll take care of it.

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,240
That's it.

80
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,320
Where are you going?

81
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
I'll help you get away with it.

82
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,560
By the way,

83
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,080
it's serious.

84
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Write a new song.

85
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,280
If you can't write it, you have to write it.

86
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Got it.

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,720
And then,

88
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,400
when you're okay,

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,040
You spend more time with many oranges to eat

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
and go on dates,

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,640
Why do you

92
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
still ask why?

93
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,080
You don't have any gossip now,

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,880
he helped you so much.

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
Don't you know how to thank him?

96
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
Experience life by the way.

97
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
Get some inspiration for the new song.

98
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
Every day when you're with me,

99
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
you're living like a monk.

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,320
If you can write a new song,

101
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,640
it will be fresh. If I were a monk,

102
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,200
It's also because here,

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,560
it's so much like a temple.

104
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,440
It's not a temple.

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,080
Let's go.

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Leave the temple.

107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
These are all your favorites.

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,120
Let's eat.

109
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,760
What?

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Caiyun has something on her mind.

111
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,520
Honey,

112
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,480
today

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,440
Nobody plays the piano?

114
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,520
I'll play a song for you.

115
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,360
What do you want to hear?

116
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,800
I think,

117
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,320
the girl who came to give you the car keys last time,

118
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,080
She plays very well.

119
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
You like her?

120
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,040
I haven't heard

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,120
such a nice piano sound for a long time.

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,000
Mr. Jiang,

123
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
come to my office.

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,040
I'll go first.

125
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,160
Enjoy your meal.

126
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,760
Your mom's condition is very unstable these two days,

127
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,960
so it's hard to guarantee that it won't be the same as the previous days.

128
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,680
My mom has been taking medicine lately,

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,680
but why is she repeating it more?

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,880
Mental illness

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,160
is a psychological and physiological factor.

132
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
Common disease drugs

133
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,240
are only adjuvant treatments,

134
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,800
We need to reassess her condition.

135
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
Maybe,

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
the sound of that girl's piano,

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
It can ease her emotions.

138
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,440
Doctor,

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,840
you're professionals,

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
I can't let a little girl

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,960
treat my mom now.

142
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,200
Mr. Jiang,

143
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,000
the treatment of mental illness is not static.

144
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,200
What works?

145
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,360
Sometimes it's beyond our expectation.

146
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,880
As you can see before,

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
even though that little girl

148
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,960
didn't know your mother,

149
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,560
But the sound of her piano can really

150
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,360
calm your mother's emotions.

151
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,680
I thought,

152
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,160
maybe the little girl's piano,

153
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,360
Your mother has some special feelings.

154
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,720
I see what you mean.

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,320
Let me think about it.

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,000
My mom is not in a good state of mind.

157
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
As you can see,

158
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,280
she always thought she was in her early twenties,

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
You even think of me as my dad.

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
Well

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,200
Should I call her aunt or sister?

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,960
Forget it.

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I'm here to play the piano.

164
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,560
I'll play the piano.

165
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
It's you.

166
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Do you remember me?

167
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,240
Last time I came here to play the zither,

168
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,280
you said you liked it,

169
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,880
Mr. Jiang hired me to play the piano for you

170
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,000
every week.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,640
It's so nice.

172
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Your nails are so beautiful.

173
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,480
Liang Liang,

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,720
this is nail polish,

175
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,480
Nail polish.

176
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
I've only used impatiens.

177
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,160
It's okay.

178
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
What if you like it?

179
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:11,960
Mrs. Jiang,

180
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,240
I'll cook for you when I come next time.

181
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Really?

182
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,240
You don't have to call me Mrs. Jiang.

183
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,160
My name is Chae Yun,

184
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay,

185
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,760
Caiyun,

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,440
just call me Chengcheng.

187
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,160
Chengcheng,

188
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,320
I like you.

189
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,560
I like you too.

190
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,560
What are you doing?

191
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Girls'secrets, I

192
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,200
won't tell you.

193
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,520
You get along well with my mom.

194
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,840
Of course.

195
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,560
I've always been friendly.

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
She's adorable.

197
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,040
Can't you tell?

198
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Let me compliment

199
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
you. You're really not modest.

200
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,320
The truth

201
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
is right.

202
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,960
You're very likable.

203
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,000
She's considerate,

204
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,680
and she's good at sharing the worries of her rumored boyfriend.

205
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
Who wants to share your worries?

206
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,320
Many oranges,

207
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
do you have anything to do later?

208
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Nothing special.

209
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,080
What's wrong?

210
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
If there's nothing else,

211
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,360
I'll grant you a wish,

212
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,920
I'll be with you whatever I want to do.

213
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,160
Wish?

214
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,280
It's still early to watch a movie.

215
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,480
Let's go shopping for a while.

216
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,120
All right.

217
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,480
You have a big head.

218
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm smart.

219
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Look at this pot.

220
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,720
It's very suitable for beating people.

221
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,240
I think

222
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
you really feel like

223
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,160
you're in a relationship.

224
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,080
But this is an illusion.

225
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,760
It's fake.

226
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,640
Although love is fake,

227
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,520
the dating trilogy is still perfect.

228
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
God Nan,

229
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,960
thank you for helping me fulfill my second wish.

230
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,160
I'll treat you to dinner.

231
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,160
You pick the place

232
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm very familiar with the owner of this Sichuan restaurant,

233
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,120
Their Sichuan cuisine is very authentic,

234
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,000
especially this spicy chicken.

235
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,520
Crispy and tasty.

236
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,360
Try it.

237
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,120
I don't eat spicy food like this.

238
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,840
Is there something wrong

239
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,920
with you?

240
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,840
You have hemorrhoids?

241
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,680
No, I didn't.

242
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm just living a healthier life.

243
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,200
How about a healthy girl?

244
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,840
Then what should we do?

245
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,240
Boss,

246
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,160
can you cook something that's not spicy?

247
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,600
I don't know how to

248
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,000
cook anything that's not spicy.

249
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,520
My pot is full of spicy food,

250
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,040
Boss,

251
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,920
Can I make a dish myself?

252
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,000
What?

253
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,440
Are you a good cook?

254
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,680
Of course.

255
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,080
I wanted to show you something.

256
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,120
It's a big deal,

257
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,680
boss.

258
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,560
Do me a favor

259
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,560
and let her give it a try.

260
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,160
Since you're a regular customer,

261
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
you can only make one dish.

262
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,680
Okay,

263
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Thank you, boss.

264
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,280
Many of Orange's signature dishes are here.

265
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,800
Coke chicken wings?

266
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,520
Yes.

267
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,320
It looks ordinary.

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
Try it first.

269
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,960
What do you think?

270
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,640
It's okay.

271
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,160
When I was a kid,

272
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,080
My mom used to make me coke chicken wings,

273
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,440
and then she got sick,

274
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I've never eaten it again.

275
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,960
If it tastes good to you,

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll make more for you next time.

277
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Where's my dad?

278
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,400
But, Chef,

279
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,600
my skills are just superficial.

280
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,240
What about next time?

281
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,800
Let me show you my dad's cooking.

282
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,160
Thank you,

283
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,000
Goddess Nan.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,839
For what?

285
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,400
I've always

286
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,079
dreamed of having a date like this,

287
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,599
It's not real,

288
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
but,

289
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Thank you so much.

290
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,319
I'm happy.

291
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,599
It's not real.

292
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,640
Am I AI?

293
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,119
It's because it's too real.

294
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,640
It's as real as a dream.

295
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,360
God Nan,

296
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
can you dream with me for a little longer?

297
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,800
For the sake of this plate of chicken wings,

298
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,080
I reluctantly agree with you.

299
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
How did you know you could enter through the east gate?

300
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,440
I used to come here a lot.

301
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,400
Of course I know.

302
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
I used to fantasize about

303
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,080
taking a Ferris wheel when I could go on a date.

304
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,760
Looking at the starry sky from a distance,

305
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,080
can you take it

306
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
as satisfying my little selfishness?

307
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,560
Many oranges,

308
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,600
in fact, the plane is closer than the Ferris wheel,

309
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,240
But I can't go up now.

310
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,040
It doesn't matter. It's good

311
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,560
to look at it like this.

312
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,360
What are you doing?

313
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,080
Let's go.

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,880
Keep running.

315
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,200
Keep running.

316
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,200
Why didn't you run away?

317
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,240
Tell me,

318
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,440
how did you get in here?

319
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,360
What are you doing?

320
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,120
Otherwise

321
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,680
So I called the police.

322
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,880
No, no, no.

323
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,120
Well,

324
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,040
we don't look like bad guys.

325
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,120
What are you looking at?

326
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,840
If you don't write the word "bad guy" on your face, you won't be a bad guy.

327
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,560
How about this?

328
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,680
I'll give you money,

329
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,040
Please make a merciful exception.

330
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,440
Don't mess with useless things.

331
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,960
Today,

332
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
even if you're the boss's son,

333
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,520
You have to make it clear to me.

334
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,480
Security guard,

335
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
we really want to take the Ferris wheel.

336
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,520
It's just that we didn't estimate the time.

337
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,520
Eight out of ten people

338
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,680
who sneaked in said so.

339
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,880
What should I do?

340
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,040
Security guard,

341
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,040
originally this matter,

342
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,040
I didn't want to tell anyone.

343
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,120
But there's nothing I can do.

344
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,520
She's my girlfriend.

345
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,880
I can see that.

346
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,960
Tell me something I don't know.

347
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,440
She

348
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,440
He's terminally ill.

349
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,440
She doesn't have

350
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,120
much time left.

351
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,880
My last wish

352
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,480
is to get back on the Ferris wheel.

353
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,120
There's nothing we can do.

354
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,640
It's understandable.

355
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,440
Then you can't come tomorrow during the day,

356
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,440
but at this time,

357
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
That makes sense.

358
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,520
day

359
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,000
I need surgery.

360
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,880
It doesn't seem like a lie.

361
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,680
Really?

362
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,760
It should be true.

363
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,320
Who can joke about this?

364
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
Such a young

365
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,760
security guard,

366
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
Look at this.

367
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,600
It's okay, Miss.

368
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Don't be sad.

369
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm sure you'll recover.

370
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,960
Don't worry,

371
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,800
your wish,

372
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
My brothers are guarding it,

373
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Yes.

374
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,760
How did you come up with this?

375
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
You're so smart.

376
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,800
We were quick-witted. Luckily,

377
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,560
we met a kind-hearted person.

378
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,520
By the way,

379
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,640
what happened to your medicine just now?

380
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,400
Isn't it normal for a health-preserving girl

381
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
like me to carry medicine with her?

382
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,200
Didn't my acting just now sound good?

383
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,440
It's okay.

384
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,240
Go ahead.

385
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
Aren't you going?

386
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm not going.

387
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Why?

388
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,360
This kid is playing,

389
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,760
are you afraid of heights?

390
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,480
Who's afraid of heights?

391
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,080
Do I look like someone who's afraid of heights?

392
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,960
Like

393
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,600
You're afraid of heights.

394
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,480
Stop pretending.

395
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,720
I can see it again.

396
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,880
It's too late.

397
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,600
What's too late?

398
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,200
Let's go.

399
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,240
Why are you looking at me?

400
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,280
Are you okay?

401
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm fine.

402
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,240
Look,

403
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,640
the night view outside is so beautiful.

404
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,400
Are you okay?

405
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
You have to

406
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,760
take the Ferris wheel.

407
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,320
Did you cry

408
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,480
just now.

409
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
Your legs were shaking so funny.

410
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,760
I even laughed and cried.

411
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,400
I'm really happy today.

412
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,960
For a long time,

413
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,800
I've always felt that I'm not lucky,

414
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,720
It wasn't until tonight that I realized

415
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,400
that all my good luck,

416
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,920
It's all because I met you.

417
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,600
Thank you.

418
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,600
God Nan,

419
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
you don't have to thank me.

420
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,040
Xie Baorui.

421
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
Not only for myself,

422
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
I also want to thank you on behalf of my dad.

423
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,480
If it weren't for your 300 thousand,

424
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,760
the man under my dad.

425
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,400
It might even be a problem for me to make a living.

426
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,600
What 300 thousand?

427
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,600
You lent me 300 houses?

428
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,440
Have you forgotten?

429
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,000
To be clear,

430
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,960
my dad's restaurant was in trouble,

431
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,000
Mr. Bao and I

432
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,800
advanced 300 thousand's salary in advance.

433
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,840
300 thousand

434
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,840
Bao Rui lent you 300 thousand.

435
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,000
So you signed this contract

436
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,400
because of 300 houses,

437
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,160
Of course, it's not just because of this.

438
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,520
God Nan,

439
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,120
I really want to help you.

440
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,800
And I'll pay you back.

441
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,520
It's not because of the money.

442
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it.

443
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,280
But don't you get it?

444
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,800
I have to convince Jiang slowly.

445
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,680
Right?

446
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,280
Let's not talk about it.

447
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll keep in touch

448
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Coming

449
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,560
You … You … You … Aren't you with many oranges, are you giving many

450
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
oranges 300 thousand?

451
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
You … You know everything.

452
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,000
Why did you hide it from me?

453
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,200
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to get the wrong idea.

454
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,360
I don't agree.

455
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,520
Yes.

456
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,240
I did hide it from you.

457
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,520
It's my fault.

458
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

459
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,800
Isn't it still for you?

460
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,600
At the very least, I've helped Cheng's family

461
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,880
and you.

462
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,560
Isn't it the best of both worlds?

463
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,840
Now,

464
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,080
there's no gossip,

465
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,080
Without the lace,

466
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
many oranges still work part-time as your assistant.

467
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,760
Isn't it good for you

468
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
to focus on your work?

469
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,480
The studio has no money, right?

470
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,400
Where did you get the money?

471
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
You don't have money?

472
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I took out my wife's notebook.

473
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,080
It doesn't matter.

474
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,240
You'll support me from now on,

475
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,920
I owe you the money.

476
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,160
I'll pay you back ten times later.

477
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,960
You're crazy.

478
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm not a loan shark.

479
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,160
I'm telling you,

480
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,400
as long as you're down-to-earth.

481
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I feel at ease.

482
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,320
You've been making me worry about you all day.

483
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,600
Let me tell you,

484
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,760
when it comes to emotions,

485
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,000
You have to control it.

486
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,320
By the way,

487
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,920
Gu Jiayi's new song launch the day after tomorrow,

488
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
We have to go.

489
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,200
I want to go too.

490
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm in the same frame

491
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,800
with her. Did you two sing this song?

492
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,920
You have to go.

493
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,760
Besides,

494
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,840
it's signed in the contract,

495
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,720
Besides,

496
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
what did you say?

497
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,840
Besides,

498
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,720
there will be a bunch of reporters tomorrow,

499
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,040
It's all about your love affair with many oranges.

500
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,480
What stupid press conference is Gu Jiayi holding at this time?

501
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,800
She must have done it on purpose.

502
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,880
I think it's perfect.

503
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,880
The day after tomorrow, we'll take a lot of oranges with us,

504
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,560
and let Gu Jiayi lift a rock and hit himself in the foot.

505
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,800
I don't think so.

506
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,800
I think it works.

507
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,160
We just want to

508
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,120
get rid of Gu Jiayi, right?

509
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,200
Then.

510
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,120
Why don't I ask many oranges first,

511
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,680
and if she agrees,

512
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Let's take her with us.

513
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay,

514
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,680
But,

515
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,240
don't force yourself if you don't agree.

516
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,640
Tell me,

517
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,240
one only has music in his heart,

518
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,480
A man who never wants to be exposed to the media,

519
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,000
for what reason?

520
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,440
All over the world,

521
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,240
going on a date with a woman,

522
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,240
Sis,

523
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,920
I think this photo

524
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,920
is fake, right?

525
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,640
You got it right.

526
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,960
He

527
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,680
made it for me on purpose.

528
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,320
If he does this,

529
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,280
it means that he still has me in his heart.

530
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,760
Xiao Mei,

531
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,680
two more crayfish,

532
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,400
Sis,

533
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,080
If you keep eating, it'll affect your photogenic performance tomorrow.

534
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,520
Have fun today.

535
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,560
Eat more,

536
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,240
Okay.

537
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,200
Did Jiang Nan misunderstand me?

538
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,200
He might think that

539
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,880
I'm a greedy person.

540
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Buy it if you like it,

541
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,240
I saw it last time when I bought a gift for Keqin,

542
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
So I took one more look.

543
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,440
Hello, sir.

544
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,560
What can I do for you?

545
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,360
Please wrap this earring for me.

546
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,920
Okay,

547
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,040
No,

548
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,280
I really don't need it.

549
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,560
You don't have to be too moved.

550
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,360
At least you are my girlfriend now,

551
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,840
if you are too shabby, I will be ashamed to go out

552
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,080
Can you come in?

553
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Sure.

554
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,640
Thank you, Mom.

555
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,040
It's not hot.

556
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,320
I bought you a bottle of vitamins.

557
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,680
Vitamin,

558
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,440
I was cleaning at your place two days ago,

559
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,640
I saw you eating it,

560
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,760
so I shook it.

561
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,880
I don't think there are many left.

562
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,400
So I bought you a new bottle.

563
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,200
Your dad said it's for health preservation,

564
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,480
but what does he think?

565
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,480
Health should not only rely on vitamins,

566
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,000
but also strengthen exercise.

567
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
Don't worry about me, you two.

568
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,040
You are my daughter.

569
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,640
How can I not worry about it?

570
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
I'm not a kid.

571
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,920
I've grown up.

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,080
In the eyes of my parents,

573
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm still a child at an age.

574
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,960
Got it.

575
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,240
Let us know if you need anything in the future.

576
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,280
We'll buy it for you.

577
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,520
After this,

578
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,160
the three of us will go out and relax.

579
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay,

580
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,600
Go to bed early.

581
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,200
Chengcheng,

582
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,400
I know Gu Jiayi's press conference

583
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,560
is very sudden,

584
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm sure she won't believe it.

585
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,800
You two are a real couple,

586
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,000
so you set up such a trap.

587
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
He wanted to embarrass us,

588
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,600
but Jiang didn't want to go.

589
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,000
But you said that as me,

590
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,200
I would definitely like him to go.

591
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,960
After all,

592
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,600
they sang the song together?

593
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,800
So actually, I really hope

594
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,120
you can come with us, okay?

595
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,440
This will also increase Jiang's confidence.

596
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,040
Of course I want to help Jiang Nan.

597
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
But as an ordinary person,

598
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,800
I've never been to such an occasion.

599
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,400
When the time comes, with so many reporters

600
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,440
and questions,

601
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,160
If I say something wrong,

602
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,520
isn't it doing Jiang Nan a disservice?

603
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,360
You're not an ordinary person now.

604
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,280
You have my bag, sir.

605
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,040
And Jiang Nan,

606
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,760
with my glib tongue,

607
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,080
I can handle all the reporters without any problem.

608
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,720
Trust me,

609
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,280
Go.

610
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,200
Brother,

611
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,360
Qin Shan picked it up.

612
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,400
Tomorrow at 4: 00 p. m. on Crowne Plaza.

613
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Secretary Ding,

614
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,840
after four o'clock tomorrow afternoon,

615
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,760
Don't arrange things for me.

616
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,440
Okay.

617
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,680
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule

618
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,680
to come to the launch of my new song.

619
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,960
This is my first time in the music field,

620
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,080
since I am not a professional singer,

621
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,920
Please forgive me.

622
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,920
Give me more support and encouragement.

623
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,680
Thank you.

624
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,280
Rumors about you two have been circulating on the Internet recently,

625
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
I hope I can take this opportunity

626
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,560
to get a positive response from you two today.

627
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,520
The rumors on the internet are all false.

628
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,080
I have a girlfriend now.

629
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,480
I hope you can pay more attention to my work.

630
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,200
It's not a private life.

631
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,920
Gu Jiayi, as your ex-girlfriend,

632
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,000
sings love songs with you on her new album,

633
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,520
Don't you think about your girlfriend's feelings?

634
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Gu Jiayi and I are just partners,

635
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,120
and I'm a professional musician,

636
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Work is work,

637
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,680
life is life,

638
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,000
Since everyone is so concerned about this issue,

639
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,160
I invited my girlfriend here today.

640
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,040
Let me officially introduce to you.

641
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,120
Please wait a moment.

642
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,800
Don't be afraid.

643
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,720
Yes.

644
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,240
Smile

645
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
It's coming out.

646
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,520
Hurry up.

647
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,000
Take two more photos.

648
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
Come here, come here. Did you

649
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,000
get this angle?

650
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,640
How about two more photos?

651
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,880
Everyone,

652
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,720
this is my girlfriend,

653
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Many oranges,

654
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,200
Jiangnan,

655
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,160
Can you tell us,

656
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,960
how did you and Miss Xu meet?

657
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,320
In fact, it was a bit of a mistake,

658
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,080
Anyway, my first impression of her is that

659
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,400
she is very brotherly,

660
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,440
Can you lend me some paper?

661
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,160
Very tasty.

662
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,240
Gradually, I got to know her better and better.

663
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
When I found out she was a very cheerful girl,

664
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
I never thought about it.

665
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
There will be such a person in my life.

666
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,000
Every time she shows up,

667
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,080
she brings me surprises and surprises.

668
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,680
Miss Xu,

669
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,560
about the close interaction between Gu Jiayi and Jiang Nan,

670
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,760
Any ideas?

671
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,400
Me,

672
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,040
I don't have any idea.

673
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,000
As Jiang Nan's girlfriend,

674
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,280
you're not jealous at all,

675
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,360
This is a personal matter between us.

676
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
Since you're attending the press conference today,

677
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,640
you invited Miss Xu here.

678
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,040
Why don't you let her talk?

679
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,600
I'm not jealous,

680
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,000
as long as it's about Jiang Nan's work schedule,

681
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,320
I support him.

682
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,040
Since you're not jealous,

683
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,520
today's press conference,

684
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,760
Miss Xu didn't ask for it, did she?

685
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,360
As far as I know,

686
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,040
Miss Xu just graduated from college,

687
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,960
Jiang Nan, as your boyfriend,

688
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,880
is more capable than you,

689
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,560
As an artist who is skilled in dealing with the media,

690
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
why didn't he choose to clarify?

691
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,040
To protect you.

692
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,239
If I don't let you appear in public,

693
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,120
I'll minimize the impact.

694
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,719
And more manly.

695
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,639
Chief Qin,

696
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,120
let's just ask questions,

697
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,360
There's no need for personal attacks.

698
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,719
I came voluntarily.

699
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,719
As an outsider,

700
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,960
in this way today,

701
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,920
to reveal his identity to the public.

702
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,239
Aren't you afraid that it will have a big impact on yourself?

703
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,719
If your photos hadn't been taken,

704
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
would you still choose to make them public?

705
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Chief Qin,

706
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,520
as you said,

707
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,280
Miss Xu is not from this circle,

708
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,680
and she is very young,

709
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,120
I can't stand your torture,

710
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
Lord Bao, you don't have to be so nervous.

711
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,400
I just can't figure it out.

712
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,080
Jiang Nan, who has always kept a low profile,

713
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,640
agreed to bring his out-of-circle girlfriend to the press conference.

714
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,800
I can't help but make people guess.

715
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,920
Are you trying to make a comeback hype?

716
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,560
Or a smoke bomb?

717
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Miss Xu and Jiang Nan

718
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,960
will be honest with you today.

719
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,880
Just to clear up the misunderstanding last time.

720
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,360
So I also hope that Chief Qin

721
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,400
won't play detective games all the time, okay?

722
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,480
To clear up the misunderstanding,

723
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,600
so,

724
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Today's main purpose is crisis PR,

725
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,120
so I have to doubt your authenticity.

726
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,960
Both of you can show up at the same time today.

727
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,880
I just want to make a play

728
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
so that everyone can believe it,

729
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,080
You are real boyfriend and girlfriend,

730
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,200
am I right? What about

731
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,200
Mr. Bao?

732
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,600
Do something about it.

733
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,560
What can I do?

734
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,160
How would I know?

735
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,800
What can you do?

736
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,000
We can't convince everyone that

737
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,280
we're really boyfriend and girlfriend.

738
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,120
So direct.

739
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,760
So it's true.
