00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,786 --> 00:00:13,758
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:15,898
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:19,198
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,198 --> 00:00:24,473
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:30,331
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,045
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,550
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,932
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:41,631
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:44,445
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:48,432
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:51,159
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,772
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,619
â™«  The years become gentle as the wind  â™«

16
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,786
â™«  gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:01,501
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,842
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:10,689
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,543
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:16,177
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,284
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,097
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:25,756
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:31,175
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,181
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:49,056

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,300
Orange, I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,380
I really had too much to drink last night.

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,540
I remember I sent it to you.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,612
I only have two top contacts on my WeChat, you and the She-Devil.

32
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:01,140
You two are too close to each other.

33
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,120
My finger must've slipped and sent it to the She-Devil.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,200
I tried to persuade our chief editor not to release it,

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,960
but I really couldn't stop her.

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,980
You know me. I would never use your scoop to claim the credit.

37
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,660
It's not a problem for me. It's mainly Jiang Nan.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,340
Did Jiang Nan make it difficult for you?

39
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,880
Not really, but he's really troubled by this.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,160
Of course.

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
If you ask me, it's all because of that Gu Jia Yi.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
If she hadn't been caught in the same frame as Jiang Nan,

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,080
our chief editor wouldn't go out of her way to get his scoop.

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,760
Today, Jiang Nan told me to act as his girlfriend in front of Gu Jia Yi.

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,880
Did you agree to it?

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,360
No.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
That's good.

48
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,680
You're just an ordinary person.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,160
You won't have peace once you get involved with a celebrity's affairs.

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,920
If your parents or your family and friends know,

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,120
your life will be totally exposed in broad daylight.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,720
- Then... 
 - Stop.

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,180
Lao Li, it's me, Lao Xu.

54
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,240
It's been a long time since I contacted you.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,000
I just want to know how you're doing. Is everything all right?

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,200
What?

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,100
Something so serious happened?

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,140
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,340
Who is Dad calling?

60
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,520
Your dad wants to buy the Happy Family Restaurant.

61
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,620
He's just making calls to borrow Â¥300,000.

62
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,700
Where can we borrow Â¥300,000?

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,627
He probably wasn't able to borrow it.

64
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,960
All right, Lao Li. Don't be anxious.

65
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,740
I will go visit you and Sister-in-law another day.

66
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,220
Okay, okay. That's it, then.

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,100
You weren't able to borrow money again, right?

68
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,120
Every family has its own problems. Money is hard to earn.

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,000
If you ask me, it's not your destiny to own a restaurant.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,340
Honey, it's not that important whether I own a restaurant.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm just worried about my buddies and my apprentices.

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,040
All you care about are your buddies and your apprentices.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,440
Why don't you think about whether you're capable of doing that?

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,120
Fine. Even if you can borrow Â¥300,000, let me ask you,

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
how will you pay it back?

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Fine.

77
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,380
Mom and Dad, don't you have a debit card in my name?

78
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,600
- We can't use that money! 
 - We can't use that money!

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,140
That Â¥100,000 is saved up for your dowry.

80
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,740
- We can't use that money. 
 - Wait, Dad. I think...

81
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,680
Dear girl, you shouldn't worry about this.

82
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,560
Are you hungry?

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,520
I'll go make you something to eat.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,360
It's all right. You stay out of it.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 Is anyone interested in getting some extra income in their spare time?

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,160
 The schedule is flexible. No need to work in an office.

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,580
 I can do it.

88
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,260
Sister Jia Yi, that Jiang Nan is so unappreciative.

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,000
Who are you to criticize Jiang Nan?

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,520
My bad.

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,260
That's not possible.

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,740
He always keeps a distance from his fans.

93
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,860
Hello, President Liang.

94
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,660
Jia Yi.

95
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,900
Jia Yi, these are your favorite roses.

96
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,780
I bought them, especially for you.

97
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,420
Thank you.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,020
President Liang, leave that to me.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,900
Jia Yi, I already showed you enough respect.

100
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,700
You've made a fuss. Just stop where you should.

101
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,240
I'm not making a fuss with you.

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,960
I know you're upset.

103
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,740
I know you're upset that I was just flirting with that model.

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,180
You're a celebrity.

105
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,780
Why must you stoop to the same level as them?

106
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,360
Don't make a fuss about it.

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,560
Fine, fine, I promise. I'll ignore them, okay?

108
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,960
I think you probably got the wrong idea.

109
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,680
I don't mean that at all.

110
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,980
Do you think

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,280
you can escape me after I've made a star out of you?

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,860
No way, unless I claim that you're no longer mine someday.

113
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,980
Over the years, have you acknowledged that I am your girlfriend?

114
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,980
Have I acknowledged that you are my boyfriend?

115
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,080
It's just a simple flirtation for both of us.

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,360
Why must you take it seriously?

117
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,480
Gu Jia Yi, aren't you thinking too highly of yourself?

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,260
President Liang, the show that you and I put on is over.

119
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,820
Let's say our goodbyes.

120
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,380
I'm telling you, I just love that stubbornness on you.

121
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,820
You...

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Gu Jia Yi, let me tell you, don't push your luck!

123
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,180
I can make you a star and I can destroy you, just the same!

124
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,120
You should think it through!

125
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,800
Are you happy now?

126
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
No, I'm annoyed.

127
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,120
If you ask me, just don't think about it.

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,480
Go home and sleep.

129
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Brother, wait. Look at our situation.

130
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
How can you still think about sleep?

131
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,920
If you ask me, that Xu Duo Cheng is really stubborn

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,380
or maybe you're not charming enough.

133
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I'm not charming enough?

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,920
If you're so charming, you do it then.

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,300
Fine, I'll do it.

136
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
I hope you succeed!

137
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:02,225

138
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,020
Quit the entertainment business?

139
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,440
 Is it that serious?

140
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,660
 Let me look at Jiang Nan's Weibo.

141
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,930

142
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,420
That's...

143
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,240
She probably already saw the post, right?

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,160
If you ask me, this is a bad idea.

145
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,820
Hello, Ms. Xu, I'm Bao Rui.

146
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,640
Okay, okay. No problem.

147
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,200
I'll send you the location.

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,560
Okay. See you later.

149
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,360
She agreed?

150
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
Well, it's me in action.

151
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,820
Fine. You're the best.

152
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,620
If you ask me,

153
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,960
she's really worried about me.

154
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,060
You should clean up nicely first, right?

155
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,720
She really paid a big price for this.

156
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,620
Why do I feel like I'm sacrificing more?

157
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,560
You don't say, I really think this girl can bring you good luck.

158
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,060
He's getting older after all.

159
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,300
He's even starting to be superstitious.

160
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,900
What did you say?

161
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
You're the best.

162
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,020
Lord Bao, I'm really sorry.

163
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,520
I was stuck in traffic.

164
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,020
It's fine. Take a seat.

165
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,740
I should thank you for helping Jiang Nan.

166
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,680
Thank you.

167
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,940
You know Jiang Nan.

168
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,600
He just wants to make a comeback in his own right,

169
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,840
but this incident happened to you two.

170
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,360
It's so much trouble.

171
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,140
Did Jiang Nan really quit the entertainment business?

172
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,500
Well, we don't have a choice.

173
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,200
If you are willing to help, Ms. Xu,

174
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,240
Jiang Nan can make a comeback at any minute.

175
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,660
If I'm willing to help, what do I need to do?

176
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,560
Actually, what you need to do is very easy.

177
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,900
You just have to stay with him at all times and participate in events with him.

178
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,980
It's better if you can stay by his side all the time.

179
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,760
I need to stay with Jiang Nan all the time?

180
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,260
It is like this, Ms. Xu.

181
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,900
We wish you can be Jiang Nan's personal assistant.

182
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,060
If you want me to be his assistant, that's not a problem.

183
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,400
I can deal with all the errands,

184
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,800
but didn't you ask me to pretend to be his girlfriend?

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,740
What's going on now?

186
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,880
We proposed that to counter Gu Jia Yi.

187
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
You don't have to go through the trouble of disguising yourself as his girlfriend now.

188
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,160
As long as you are his assistant,

189
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,980
we can explain the intimate photos.

190
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,200
We can also keep a distance from Gu Jia Yi,

191
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,760
in case she keeps bugging Jiang Nan to get on the hot search

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,360
and affect his mood for creativity.

193
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,960
As for Jiang Nan, we all believe

194
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,160
he can come back on top, with his own abilities.

195
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's look through the contract. Come on.

196
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,420
The contract?

197
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,060
That's right. It's the formal process.

198
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,980
Take a look. Tell me if you have any questions about it.

199
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,380
Cooperate with Party A, artist Jiang Nan's work arrangements,

200
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,380
and handle affairs of work and life.

201
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,620
Be available at any time. Be available at any time?

202
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,360
As for that, I need to explain it to you,

203
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,620
since there are a lot of uncertainties in the work schedule of an artist.

204
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,560
If you put it that way, I understand, Lord Bao.

205
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,340
Of course, we will pay you a salary according to the salary range within the industry.

206
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,520
It will definitely not be less than that.

207
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,260
Fine. I agree.

208
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,430

209
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,100
Lord Bao, I'd like to ask you,

210
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,900
can I get paid in advance?

211
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,660
Of course. I can fulfill all your needs, Ms. Xu.

212
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,860
Lord Bao, I...

213
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,320
I want to ask for an advance salary of Â¥300,000.

214
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,280
How much?

215
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,180
Lord Bao, don't be nervous. I'm not trying to extort money from you.

216
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,500
Something really came up in my family.

217
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,140
You can deduct the money from my monthly salary.

218
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,080
I will also do a few more odd jobs.

219
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm sure I can pay you back in time.

220
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,460
That's not a big deal.

221
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,160
No problem.

222
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,440
Thank you, Lord Bao!

223
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
Does it hurt?

224
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,020
Yes.

225
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,940
You're welcome.

226
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,860
Well, Lord Bao, I also have another favor to ask.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
If I suddenly have a lot of money in my account,

228
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,520
my parents will surely be suspicious.

229
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,830
What do you need me to do?

230
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,532

231
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,440
Welcome.

232
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,480
Please, come in. How many are in your party?

233
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,920
Just one.

234
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,120
Please, sit here. Come on.

235
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,460
Is there a problem?

236
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,040
There's no problem.

237
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,540
This is our menu. Please, take a look.

238
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,540
What would you like?

239
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,860
- Duck blood and tripe in chili broth... 
 - One duck blood and tripe in chili broth.

240
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,780
- Steamed fish head with peppers... 
 - Steamed fish head with peppers.

241
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,800
- Shrimp with crab meat... 
 - Shrimp with crab meat.

242
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,040
What? He really knows how to order.

243
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,200
The customer is a foodie.

244
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,500
- Put it here! 
 - All right.

245
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,580
Waiter!

246
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,180
Coming.

247
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,840
Sir, is there a problem?

248
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,460
Get your head chef here.

249
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,660
You can just tell me.

250
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,040
Lao Lin, that knife... How many times have I told you?

251
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,640
Lao Xu, the customer out there asked to see the Head Chef.

252
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,920
- Which table? 
 - Table three.

253
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,460
That shouldn't be. Those are my specialty dishes.

254
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,260
Could there be... a hair fell in there?

255
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,980
The ingredients are fresh too.

256
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,880
They're not spoiled.

257
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,720
- Exactly. 
 - Master,

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,500
I think he probably came to look for trouble.

259
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,120
Let me handle it.

260
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,720
Stop right there!

261
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,160
Go back!

262
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,720
Are you trying to show off?

263
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,540
Let you handle it...

264
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,360
I'll go.

265
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,540
He's right there!

266
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,840
Over there.

267
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,079
Hello, I'm the Head Chef here.

268
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,639
Is there a problem with the food?

269
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,680
Yes, there is.

270
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,660
Your dishes are...

271
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,220
What's wrong?

272
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,340
They are absolutely delicious.

273
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,980
Say that again?

274
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,220
They are absolutely delicious.

275
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,860
Get in there! Go, go, go!

276
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,320
Go, go, go! Hurry up!

277
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,180
Take a seat!

278
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,080
Thank you.

279
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,440
Let me tell you, these are my specialty dishes!

280
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,580
How did you know about it? Your friend recommended this to you?

281
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,200
I was attracted by the reputation. Yes, attracted by the reputation.

282
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,220
Attracted by the reputation?

283
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,460
To be honest with you, I am well-learned in this style of cuisine.

284
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,940
-  Let's discuss it. 
 - Discuss it!

285
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,940
- The steamed fish with peppers is tender and flavorful. 
 -  Flavorful!

286
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,300
The shrimp with crab meat is chewy and refreshing.

287
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,280
Refreshing!

288
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,040
- The duck blood and tripe in chili broth are aromatic and spicy. 
 - Spicy!

289
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,060
The chicken soup with mushrooms is savory.

290
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,480
You're a connoisseur!

291
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,560
You flatter me.

292
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,460
To be honest, I came specially to taste your cooking.

293
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,240
You came just for this?

294
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,960
Is there anything else?

295
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,920
Here's the thing. I've always wanted to open a restaurant.

296
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,260
However, those restaurants out there are all show and no skills.

297
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,120
What do you think?

298
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,920
I only want you.

299
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,260
Do you want to quit and open your own restaurant?

300
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
Are you insulting me?

301
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,240
Am I a disloyal person like that?

302
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,820
I just want to buy the Happy Family Restaurant

303
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,040
and I don't have enough money.

304
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,480
I'll invest in you.

305
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,800
It's perfect. We don't have to open another restaurant.

306
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll invest in you.

307
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,120
Can you say that again?

308
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,200
I'll invest in you.

309
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,780
Oh, God! Am I dreaming?

310
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,680
Take it easy.

311
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,520
It's a pity you aren't an actor.

312
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,080
Lord Bao, I was so nervous earlier,

313
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,700
but you're a really good actor.

314
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,620
My dad didn't suspect it at all.

315
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
Let me tell you, it's not because of my acting.

316
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,920
Uncle is really a good cook.

317
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Well, come eat at Happy Family more often in the future,

318
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,560
but don't spill the beans.

319
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,020
By the way, Ms. Xu, you see, I did you such a big favor.

320
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,180
Shouldn't you do one for me?

321
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,220
Ms. Xu, today's task is actually very simple.

322
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,500
You just have to take a couple's photo with Jiang Nan, just in case,

323
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,840
because Gu Jia Yi doesn't play by the rules.

324
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,140
Okay. Just tell me what you want me to do.

325
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,720
- Take a selfie. 
 - I don't take selfies. It's too pretentious.

326
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,600
You're right. How about this?

327
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,560
Let's be more natural and true to life.

328
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,400
Let's take one of you two

329
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,920
holding hands and walking in the sunset.

330
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,660
How romantic would that be, right?

331
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,280
That's not necessary.

332
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,980
Bro, let's just walk normally, okay?

333
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,480
Split your legs and take it one step at a time.

334
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,280
Is that okay?

335
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,520
- No. 
 - All right, stop talking!

336
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,380
Ms. Xu, is it okay with you?

337
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,700
-  I... 
 - If you don't say anything, I'll take that as a yes.

338
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,120
A group photo is not necessary. I posted it on WeChat Moments already.

339
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,060
Someone will naturally connect the dots.

340
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,220
Brother, will Gu Jia Yi understand what your post means with this?

341
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,540
Stop fighting it.

342
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,640
I'm your agent. You have to listen to me.

343
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,700
Ms. Xu, let's go together.

344
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,920
What's that expression on your face?

345
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Are you two enemies?

346
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,040
The brave one will win when you meet on a narrow path? 
  (T/N: Quote from Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian)

347
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
Smile!

348
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,040
Listen to me, smile.

349
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,280
Walk forward!

350
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,920
Take a few steps, come on.

351
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,040
Lao Jiang, smile!

352
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,520
Get closer.

353
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,760
Good, good.

354
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:14,697
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

355
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:18,831
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

356
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:21,865
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

357
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:25,664
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

358
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:29,007
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

359
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:32,969
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

360
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:37,184
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

361
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:42,473
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

362
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,620
Vitamins.

363
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,420
Why is that child taking vitamins?

364
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,480

365
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Your food is served. Please, enjoy.

366
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,540
Do you really want to quit your job?

367
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,871
Maybe I can't meet your cousin's requirements.

368
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:30,840
Did she bully you again?

369
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,080
No, she's right,

370
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,480
but I can't do it.

371
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,020
Either way, I have nothing to do with True Image anymore.

372
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
As for you, you should just work for True Image.

373
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,940
No, no.

374
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,760
It's already hard for me that my cousin controls my life.

375
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,460
I don't want to work under her as well.

376
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,320
Then, why do you always go to True Image?

377
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,020
I was there for our relationship.

378
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,720
What relationship?

379
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,360
We are childhood sweethearts.

380
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,040
Who's your childhood sweetheart?

381
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,120
I was planning to tell you on a more formal occasion,

382
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,600
but there's no time like the present.

383
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,520
Everyone used to make fun of me for being fat in high school, except you.

384
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
At the time, only you would stand up for me.

385
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,960
Since then, my heart only belongs to you.

386
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
Doesn't that count as childhood sweethearts?

387
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,160
I already told you many times.

388
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,400
I was just upholding justice and helping someone in need.

389
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,680
You really don't have to take it to heart.

390
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,780
Besides, you're not fat anymore.

391
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,160
You're pretty handsome. There is bound to be girls pursuing you.

392
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,460
But I only care about you.

393
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,920
Stop. I won't be in a relationship with my buddy.

394
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,080
Then I'll wait until you change your mind.

395
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
All right, enough with the nonsense. Are you going to eat it or not?

396
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,980
- Give me yours if you're not going to eat it. Come on. 
 - I'll eat.

397
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,400
Is Jiang Nan going public about his relationship?

398
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Jiang Nan? With who?

399
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
With some girl named Xu.

400
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,560
Look, there's even a photo of them here.

401
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,260
You're right.

402
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
I know Jiang Nan really well.

403
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,620
- We used to... 
 - Don't interrupt me!

404
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,880
What happened?

405
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,380
No, I can't quit anymore.

406
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,800
Your cousin has been following Gu Jia Yi and Jiang Nan's relationship.

407
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,340
Orange will certainly be implicated.

408
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,460
She needs someone on the inside.

409
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,960
Stop eating. Go to the office with me.

410
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,420
I'm not finished yet.

411
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,440
Aren't you afraid of getting fat again if you eat so much?

412
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,020
I put a letter of resignation on your cousin's desk before I got off work.

413
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,360
She'll find it if we don't get there quickly. Let's go now!

414
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,080
Let's go now!

415
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,590

416
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,140
Didn't we agree to take this just in case?

417
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,400
Did you post it online?

418
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I didn't post it.

419
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,880
Even if I wanted to, I'll need your approval first.

420
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,000
What are you mumbling about?

421
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,560
What I mean is...

422
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,840
I really just wanted to publicize it a little.

423
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,400
Who knew this would happen?

424
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,080
But I think it's a good thing.

425
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,540
We don't have to take part in this and the rumor collapsed on its own.

426
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,520
No, I disagree.

427
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,760
There's nothing we can do even if you disagree. What's on the internet is all true.

428
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,120
- What can you do? 
 - You...

429
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,380
Actually, I think Lord Bao is right.

430
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,840
The gossip started because of me.

431
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,480
At least, people won't discuss your scandal with a fan.

432
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,360
I hope this matter can be taken care of completely,

433
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,740
and you won't be troubled anymore.

434
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,880
Cheng Cheng.

435
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,960
It's all right! He's still a boy who gets shy easily.

436
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,160
Don't take it to heart. You'll get used to it.

437
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,100
You did the right thing. Here's a thumbs up for you.

438
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,400
Thank goodness it's still here.

439
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,600
Let's go then. They are about to lock the entrance downstairs.

440
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Let's go.

441
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
What are you guys doing?

442
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,600
Brother Security Guard, I was working overtime.

443
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,160
My boyfriend came to pick me up.

444
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,500
That's right. I'm here to pick up my girlfriend from work.

445
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,280
You're working overtime with the lights off?

446
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,940
Do you have an employee card?

447
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,960
I was just trying to help the company save on electricity.

448
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,360
You wanted to save money, right?

449
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,240
We'll be very quick. We'll leave right now.

450
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,940
The company is not a hotel. Go home after you're done with work.

451
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,520
Ke Qin, you just said...

452
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,480
I was just playing it by ear.

453
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,560
You better have selective amnesia about what happened tonight.

454
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,900
If you dare to tell anyone, you'll be finished!

455
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,840
Okay, I won't say anything.

456
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,640
I'll just keep it in my heart.

457
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,640
The male lead is so handsome.

458
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
Focus on your career.

459
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,600
People who abuse their wives...

460
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,720
 Career women are the most charming.

461
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,320
...will end up paying a huge price.

462
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,920

463
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,014

464
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:42,377
My dowry is Â¥100,000. We still need Â¥200,000.

465
00:28:42,377 --> 00:28:44,477
Piano lessons pay Â¥300 per session.

466
00:28:44,477 --> 00:28:46,777
Four sessions per week.

467
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:55,364
Hello, Ke Qin.

468
00:28:55,364 --> 00:28:56,570
  You're really something.

469
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,360
 Why didn't you tell me about something so important?

470
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:00,244
Do you still think of me as your best friend?

471
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:01,504
Ke Qin, calm down.

472
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:04,644
There was an unforeseen change in the situation. I haven't had time to tell you yet.

473
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:06,904
Don't try and make excuses. I saw your picture.

474
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:08,404
Your face was so red.

475
00:29:08,404 --> 00:29:10,504
 I don't believe you.

476
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:13,044
By the way, do Auntie and Uncle know yet?

477
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:15,424
I don't know how to tell them yet.

478
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:17,344
You should tell them earlier.

479
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,524
Now that it's getting out of hand,

480
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,344
if they find out about this,

481
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,384
you'll get a beating from both of them.

482
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:23,884
 They don't usually surf the internet anyway.

483
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:26,244
Besides, Happy Family is so busy.

484
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,464
They won't find out in a short while.

485
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:30,964
I already gave you my advice anyway.

486
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:33,844
By the way, you're no longer an ordinary person anymore.

487
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:38,584
There will be a drastic change in your life.

488
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:40,284
You have to protect yourself.

489
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:44,004
Don't turn an act into the real thing

490
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:45,804
and turn pretense into reality.

491
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:48,624
Stop making fun of me. It's not possible between us.

492
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,404
That's not necessarily true.

493
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:52,244
All right, I'm not talking to you anymore. I need to go to sleep.

494
00:29:52,244 --> 00:29:54,804
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

495
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:00,924
Â¥1,200.

496
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,710

497
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,364
- Hello. 
 - Hello, my name is Xu Duo Cheng.

498
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:17,964
I'm here for the piano teacher job.

499
00:30:17,964 --> 00:30:21,224
Hello. I'm the manager of this place. My surname is Yang.

500
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:23,064
Do you have any teaching experience before?

501
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:24,904
No, I don't have any teaching experience.

502
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:27,684
Since you don't have any teaching experience, I might need you to play a segment for us.

503
00:30:27,684 --> 00:30:30,164
- That way, I can make an assessment. 
 - No problem.

504
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,744
 I always mess up at a critical moment.

505
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:09,004
Ms. Xu, based on our assessment standards for the piano teachers...

506
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:14,224
I know. I'm sorry for my disturbance.

507
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,484
However, you seem pretty affable.

508
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,644
Your entire performance is very nice too.

509
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,164
It was only a small mistake.

510
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:23,204
I believe you'll be very careful during work in the future.

511
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:27,664
You mean... I'm hired?

512
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:29,004
Yes. Congratulations.

513
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:31,244
It just so happens that our boss is here.

514
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:34,404
I just heard you play. Not bad.

515
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:37,464
Ms. Xu, you look very familiar to me.

516
00:32:37,464 --> 00:32:39,704
Are you Jiang Nan's girlfriend?

517
00:32:40,924 --> 00:32:42,524
Yes.

518
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:48,444
When did you two get together?

519
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:50,244
Just recently.

520
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:54,864
Would he mind if you work here?

521
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:55,964
No.

522
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:58,584
Why would he mind?

523
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,224
What I mean is... he's a public figure after all.

524
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:05,124
He might not want his girlfriend to show herself in public.

525
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:06,884
I'm not in the entertainment business.

526
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,004
I have to work too.

527
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:10,684
All right then.

528
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,084
Starting tomorrow, you'll be a teacher in our music instrument store.

529
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:16,104
Your salary will be Â¥600 per hour and three sessions a week. How's that?

530
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:17,984
Â¥600?

531
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:22,004
The recruitment notice said Â¥300.

532
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:25,024
Not a lot of job applicants would think they're overpaid.

533
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:26,684
No, no. Of course not.

534
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:28,264
I will do my best.

535
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,764
I'm leaving now.

536
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:31,164
Bye-bye.

537
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,724
Are you taking a fancy to Jiang Nan's girlfriend again?

538
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:43,584
She might not necessarily be his girlfriend yet.

539
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:59,920

540
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:11,581
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

541
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:18,195
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

542
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:26,092
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight  â™«

543
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:31,779
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

544
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:35,025
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

545
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:39,505
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

546
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:45,858
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

547
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:49,318
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

548
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:51,191
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

549
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,491
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

550
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,405
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

551
00:34:56,405 --> 00:35:00,293
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

552
00:35:00,293 --> 00:35:03,610
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

553
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:07,578
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

554
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:11,864
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

555
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:14,613
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

556
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,004
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

557
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:22,038
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

558
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,972
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

559
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:28,971
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

560
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:32,314
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

561
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:36,376
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

562
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:40,591
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

563
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:47,039
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

564
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:04,992
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

565
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,972
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

566
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:15,419
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

567
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:18,810
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

568
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,944

00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:41,297
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«
