1
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,960
Ms. Ding,

2
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
regarding the image ambassador and the endorsement,

3
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,040
I hope you can give me a chance.

4
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,840
Explain it,

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,480
All right,

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,600
Hey,

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,680
Hello, Ms. Ding.

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,960
Qin Shan,

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,960
I didn't ask you to come here myself, did I?

10
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,680
Mr. Bao,

11
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,920
is it convenient?

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,280
It's not convenient. Aren't you here too?

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I just want to ask you,

14
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,640
what do you have

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,800
against Jiang Nan?

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,120
I didn't send that manuscript.

17
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
Truth has been acquired.

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Right?

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,680
Are you in a hurry?

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,160
But why did I hear that

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,880
the truth is a double trial system now?

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Or are you trying to tell me

23
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,200
the truth that you've been hacked.

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
Liang Zhe only trusts Kiki now.

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,280
I was completely overhead.

26
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,480
And then?

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,120
As for the impact of this article on Jiang Nan,

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,520
I will personally try my best

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,480
to make up for the truth. I won't go back recently.

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,000
The truth is all you have.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,840
It's my life. I'll earn it back myself.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,080
But you guys,

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,720
I came here to tell you,

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,560
Jianxing will be live soon.

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,200
Hello,

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm Jianxing,

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,840
who recently joined "Cool Sing Producers",

38
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,160
I want to tell you the truth

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,120
that I suspended the recording of the show,

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,120
Three days ago,

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
when I was preparing to record the first episode of the show,

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
Jiang Nan suddenly came to me,

43
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
saying that I came to this stage

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,040
through the back door,

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
He said I'm not qualified to stand on the stage.

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Although I'm a kicker,

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
I did it through my own efforts,

48
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,000
I got this qualification,

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
and my team, for this show,

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
I've put in too much effort,

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,960
and I really want to explain it to him.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,080
He started hitting me before he could.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
This is my diagnosis report.

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,360
The doctor said

55
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,280
I had a mild concussion.

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,160
There are many bruises on the corners of the mouth and arms.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Three years ago,

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,520
he also sent me to the hospital,

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Jiang Nan,

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,320
this diagnosis certificate,

61
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
I'll keep it for you forever.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,920
It's getting cold.

63
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,160
You're still pretending to be pitiful.

64
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,600
You're so persistent.

65
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,760
Jianxing, it's quite troublesome.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,320
I guess you have a lot of work to do.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,399
But I checked

68
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Jianxing's appointment with Shengyu this year,

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,840
It seems to have just expired.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,960
I don't know what he's up to this time.

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
Did he climb up to Liang Zhe?

72
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,840
Or,

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,400
Liang Zhe wants to use it to throw stones down a well,

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,840
But I've always been curious,

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,720
why did Jiang Nan play Jianxing back then?

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,680
He offended the media because of him.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,280
I almost ruined my career.

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
What Jiang Nan said to the reporters back then,

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,680
I still remember it clearly.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
Shan has such a good memory,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,480
do you still remember it after so many years?

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm in that group of reporters.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,160
Mr. Jiang,

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
can you tell me what you think?

85
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,080
Why did you hit him?

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Did you do it because you want to compete with Jianxing for resources?

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,800
Mr. Jiang,

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
did you terminate your contract with Shengyu

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
because of the beating incident?

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
Is it true or not?

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
It's always up to you,

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
so what I say is useful?

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,440
you guys

94
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,240
is the leader of the truth.

95
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm warning you.

96
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
Stop following me like a fly.

97
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,920
Mr. Jiang,

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,680
don't go yet.

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,520
Can you answer me?

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,040
Mr. Jiang,

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Mr. Jiang,

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Answer me.

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,240
I was running the news

104
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,040
with the leader.

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Why do you care so much about Jiang Nan?

106
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,040
So you're holding grudges.

107
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
Are you Scorpio?

108
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
You're wrong.

109
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm not holding grudges.

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,840
It was Jiang Nan's words that inspired me,

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
which is why

112
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,840
my original intention of doing the truth on my own

113
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
has such a long history.

114
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
As a journalist, I must remind you,

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,240
the current public opinion is very unfavorable to Jiang Nan.

116
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,800
You have to figure out how to deal with it.

117
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,840
I know some of the media,

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,960
and if there's a need,

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,720
Call me anytime.

120
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Shan,

121
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,320
what about me?

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,360
For my rudeness just now.

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,760
Apologize to you.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,600
What about you?

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
In my heart,

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,680
I've always been

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,440
an iron lady,

128
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,560
But

129
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,880
I just found out now,

130
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
You're so warm-hearted.

131
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm not an iron lady.

132
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,720
Me,

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm iron.

134
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
Are you in my heart?

135
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
You've always been warm-hearted,

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
getting hot, getting hot,

137
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Get back to your work.

138
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
I have to post something, too.

139
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Things are getting so serious now,

140
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,280
and there are different opinions in the live broadcast room.

141
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,880
Some stand in Jianxing,

142
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,120
some stand in Jiangnan,

143
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,680
What did our show say?

144
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,000
Just say that the program group doesn't know,

145
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
until this matter is investigated clearly,

146
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
Both of them stopped recording.

147
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Alex,

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,200
Miss Gu is here.

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
I brought you a bottle of red wine.

150
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Burgundy has its own vineyard.

151
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,200
Try it.

152
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,880
Sit down

153
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,280
You're here because of Jiang Nan, right?

154
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,760
Then I won't beat around the bush.

155
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
Now all the public opinion is against Jiang Nan.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,360
If the show is really banned at this time,

157
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,560
it will prove it.

158
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
He hit someone for no reason.

159
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
Don't worry.

160
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,560
Everything has two sides.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,760
It's not necessarily a bad thing this time.

162
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,640
Think about it.

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,160
This show just aired for the first time,

164
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
The topic Du Li is coming soon.

165
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,840
Now,

166
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,800
I can get them suspended

167
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
for a while,

168
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,920
I can let them have a rematch.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,760
However,

170
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
we can't sacrifice Jiang Nan

171
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,320
for the sake of topic.

172
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Jiayi.

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Jiang Nan is not the only one who has been banned,

174
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,080
but also Jian Xing?

175
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,760
If you think about it from another angle,

176
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,320
if Jiang Nan is really innocent,

177
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,360
The truth will come out eventually.

178
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,800
When the situation gets better,

179
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll let Jiang Nan play the rematch. Isn't he the one

180
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,640
who will make the biggest profit in the end?

181
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,680
To be honest with you,

182
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,560
Jianxing and Jiang Nan have an old grudge,

183
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,960
Besides,

184
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,400
Liang Zhe arranged for him to go in,

185
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,640
If they were together,

186
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,600
how could Jiang Nan find out the truth?

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,880
How do you know?

188
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,800
Liang Zhe arranged for Jianxing.

189
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,120
I have a suitable candidate.

190
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,840
No one is more suitable than him.

191
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,040
Then I don't get it.

192
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
Since you know it,

193
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
why didn't you remind Jiang Nan in advance?

194
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,120
Something happened to him.

195
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
You're in such a hurry again.

196
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,280
Do you want him to become famous or not?

197
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
I don't know either.

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm afraid that after he becomes famous,

199
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,160
I won't even have the chance to help him.

200
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,800
However,

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,360
seeing him being framed and wronged,

202
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,400
I'm sad again.

203
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,240
Nan,

204
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,640
why are you here?

205
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Your wedding is very happy.

206
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
Let me take a look.

207
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
You didn't introduce me.

208
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
Look at my memory.

209
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,920
Nan,

210
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,680
this is my daughter-in-law,

211
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,280
Honey,

212
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,440
this is Brother Nan that I've been telling you about.

213
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,080
My boss,

214
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,120
I know him,

215
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,400
I see it on TV

216
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
all the time. Don't mention it.

217
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
About what happened in the past two days,

218
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
you must have known it, right?

219
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,240
They're all talking nonsense.

220
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,440
Jian Xing copied your song.

221
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
And the wicked complain first?

222
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
I heard it from the gossip news,

223
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,600
It seems that because of plagiarism,

224
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,600
you two started fighting.

225
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
But Nan can't plagiarize it.

226
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
It's that Jianxing. I didn't know

227
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
Nan was coming.

228
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,440
If I had known to buy more dishes,

229
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,280
there's no need to bother.

230
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
I just came to have a look.

231
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
You were supposed to come on your wedding day.

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
But I couldn't make it because of work.

233
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
This is … We … Sorry.

234
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,520
She's pregnant,

235
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
and then she's in a hurry to get married.

236
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,040
It's a good thing.

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,800
A double blessing has descended upon the house.

238
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Congratulations.

239
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,960
Call me to book a restaurant,

240
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
let's treat Nan to a meal,

241
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes, I really don't need it.

242
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,600
This is

243
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,480
a small gift for the baby.

244
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,520
Wish you a happy wedding!

245
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,760
Nan,

246
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,320
I'll get going then.

247
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,440
Watches are expensive enough.

248
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
We can't take this anymore.

249
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,920
Du,

250
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,520
what about you?

251
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,480
After working with me for so many years,

252
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,960
at the most difficult time for the company,

253
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
You never left.

254
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,280
I don't care much about it.

255
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,280
Just accept it.

256
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,480
Indeed,

257
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
there's no way I can give you more.

258
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,440
However,

259
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,960
feelings can't be measured by money,

260
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,680
Am I right?

261
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,520
Live a good life.

262
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,560
I'm leaving.

263
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,640
Thank you, Nan.

264
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,160
Bye, Nan.

265
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,280
Honey,

266
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,840
tell me the truth.

267
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,120
What happened to your boss? Does it

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
have anything to do with you?

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,840
No.

270
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,600
I really didn't.

271
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,360
I really didn't.

272
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,720
He would come all the way here,

273
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,760
and leave without eating.

274
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,360
You.

275
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,320
If there were,

276
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,840
would they still give us such a big red envelope?

277
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,320
Right?

278
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,200
Take it.

279
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go home first.

280
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,160
You'd better miss my stage.

281
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,040
When Zhilin came,

282
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,760
he always looked up there in a daze,

283
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,520
It's exactly the same as your face now.

284
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,640
Has Zhan Zhilin been here too?

285
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,320
He often comes here.

286
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,040
He's more diligent than this kid.

287
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,360
Brother Cheng,

288
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,280
when Zhan Zhilin comes next time,

289
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,000
Can you tell me?

290
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,760
What are you doing?

291
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,040
What am I going to do?

292
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,760
Just do Jiang Nan a favor.

293
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,200
Zhan Zhilin.

294
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,160
I'll just say a few words,

295
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,120
and then I'll leave.

296
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,400
Do you know why Jiang Nan

297
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,880
disbanded 2BeOne?

298
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,960
Didn't you like roasted waist the most before?

299
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,520
Come on,

300
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,240
Eat more.

301
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,560
Who else can eat now?

302
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,440
The truth is now an Asura Field.

303
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,880
Kiki

304
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,040
is a smiling tiger.

305
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
Now, all the people in the company who stand for Shan,

306
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,880
she wears small shoes one by one.

307
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
I think

308
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,040
it will be my turn soon.

309
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,280
When you were unhappy before,

310
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,800
you only had to eat something delicious,

311
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,240
You'll be happy soon.

312
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,760
That was me in high school,

313
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
who can always be like when I was a child,

314
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
You're heartless.

315
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,240
What's going on lately?

316
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,880
The truth has gone haywire,

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,840
and Jiangnan is all over the place,

318
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,920
This Jianxing was suddenly livestreamed,

319
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,360
and what happened five years ago was found out again,

320
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,200
Now that everyone is scolding Jiang Nan,

321
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,800
Orange must be worried sick.

322
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,280
So annoying.

323
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,520
Everything is not going well.

324
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,280
Well,

325
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
don't go to work.

326
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,440
How can I do that?

327
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
If you leave the truth now,

328
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,520
isn't that defection?

329
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,520
The people in our company who support Sis Shan,

330
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
have made a deal in private,

331
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,840
You have to advance and retreat with Shan.

332
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
No matter how hard it is, I won't resign.

333
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,360
Let Kiki be the polished commander.

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

335
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
You're still the same as before.

336
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,040
It hasn't changed at all.

337
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,720
Shan fought back.

338
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,080
She just issued a statement.

339
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,960
What she did to tell the truth now,

340
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
it doesn't represent her attitude.

341
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,960
She will continue to write the story on her private account.

342
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
That's great.

343
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm calling on you to support Jiang Nan in the Nangaew Group.

344
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,240
Nangaew people are still very powerful.

345
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,560
Once this live broadcast comes out,

346
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,240
Kiki will definitely hold back her big moves.

347
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,400
Sister Shan has issued a statement,

348
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,480
and she has written several articles in her own name,

349
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,280
In this case,

350
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,160
I can arrange some interviews for Jiang. Have you seen

351
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
the live broadcast of the short interview?

352
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,800
Brother,

353
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,800
you're finally back.

354
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,160
We're in a lot of trouble.

355
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
Do you have any ideas?

356
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,040
After thinking about it,

357
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,840
I plan to hold a live performance in Black.

358
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,680
I can use this opportunity

359
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,760
to arrange an interview,

360
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,280
Get rid of

361
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,680
all these clowns at once.

362
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,520
And then?

363
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,840
Now that we know the truth,

364
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
we have to tell it out loud.

365
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm going to make that

366
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,560
recording public.

367
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,320
I think it's quite good.

368
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,440
Jiang,

369
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,000
you can hold your concert in a down-to-earth manner,

370
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,680
Orange and I will clarify the matter,

371
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,200
Okay,

372
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,080
Okay,

373
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,080
It's settled.

374
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,960
Let's go home.

375
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,760
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

376
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,560
I'm leaving.

377
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,800
I think

378
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Jianxing didn't dare to offend you at that time,

379
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,640
That's why he didn't tell the truth.

380
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,160
Besides, if Jiang Nan hit him,

381
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,400
he can really gain a lot of popularity.

382
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,600
Just like now.

383
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,280
That's enough.

384
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,200
Do you think

385
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I'll believe you?

386
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,160
Jiang Nan has no reason to lie to me.

387
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,280
So?

388
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,760
So you're telling me this now?

389
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Do you want me

390
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,160
to feel like an idiot

391
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,040
who doesn't know how to be grateful?

392
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,880
That's not what I meant.

393
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,800
So you want me to speak for Jiang Nan?

394
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,680
Me,

395
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,360
That's enough.

396
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,080
Even if what you said is true,

397
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,160
I don't need Jiang Nan to take the blame for me.

398
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,520
Also,

399
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
stop him from being self-righteous.

400
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,680
He doesn't even have the basic trust

401
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,960
to tell me the truth.

402
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,680
Why are you pretending to be lofty?

403
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,280
And you,

404
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,760
Just mind your own business.

405
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,680
Don't you know how to knock when you come in?

406
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,280
Did you do the plagiarism of Jiang Nan?

407
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,280
You're questioning your own son

408
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,840
on behalf of someone else's son,

409
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
This is called

410
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,320
Love me,

411
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
love me. I used to make small fights,

412
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,320
I just turned a blind eye and passed away.

413
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,040
But if you plagiarize such a big thing,

414
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,680
it will ruin Jiang Nan's future.

415
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,599
Do you know that?

416
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,480
Future?

417
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
What about my future?

418
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,520
If it weren't for what happened between you and Tian Caiyun,

419
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,560
those who are standing on the stage now,

420
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,319
There will be me, too.

421
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,839
With your personality,

422
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,319
you're not suitable to develop in the entertainment industry.

423
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

424
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,599
Look at you,

425
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,079
giving up on yourself.

426
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,280
Now you still do such a bad thing.

427
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,000
If your mom were in the sky,

428
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,240
don't mention my mom.

429
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,160
If it weren't for you and Tian Caiyun,

430
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,800
would I be like this?

431
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,200
I could have been Jiang Nan's best friend

432
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,840
for the rest of my life.

433
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Blame him

434
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,360
for being jerk.

435
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
How can I not hate him?

436
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
If you hate me,

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
you hate me alone,

438
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,680
I fell in love with your aunt Tian unilaterally,

439
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,760
but she never accepted me.

440
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,000
We've never done anything

441
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
out of line,

442
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Do you think I'll believe it?

443
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,640
If she didn't,

444
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
how could she feel guilty?

445
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
How could she go crazy?

446
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,400
How could my mom kill herself?

447
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
Because your mom was the one who cheated on me,

448
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
and she asked me for a divorce first.

449
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,840
My mom is dead.

450
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
You poured such dirty water on her

451
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,680
and slandered her with such a thing, right?

452
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,480
I never slandered her.

453
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,640
This is the man's name.

454
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
If it weren't for the fact that you can't accept it,

455
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,160
I would have burned this painting long ago.

456
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,520
Later, I don't know why,

457
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
but that man abandoned your mom.

458
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
Maybe she can't take the blow.

459
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,360
Maybe she jumped off the building

460
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,200
because she couldn't face you.

461
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Stop it.

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
I won't believe every word you say.

463
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,320
Help me investigate a man

464
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,680
who is a painter,

465
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,680
His signature

466
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
is ZF.

467
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,360
It's so hot.

468
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,000
Behave yourself.

469
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
I've told you everything

470
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,720
I know. I'm telling the truth.

471
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,040
And I know the situation very well,

472
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,920
are you the son of Kang Lin Group?

473
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,120
I can't afford to provoke you.

474
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,400
But Jiang Nan,

475
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,560
Yun gave all the resources of Shengyu

476
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,440
to Jiang Nan.

477
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,040
If I want to climb up the Saint Entertainment,

478
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,520
I have to squeeze Jiang Nan out first,

479
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,880
So,

480
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
since public opinion believes that,

481
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,800
Jiang Nan was the one who hit me.

482
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,320
Then I might as well

483
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,000
push the boat with the current.

484
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,560
Go on,

485
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,800
Jiang Nan. Before Liang Zhe attacks him,

486
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,000
So I told you to go solo.

487
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,040
Then Liang Zhe released the copywriting that hacked him.

488
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,360
Plus my video,

489
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,480
Jiang Nan sold a few houses

490
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,320
to pay the penalty of Shengyu.

491
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,600
And then,

492
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,000
and then I started a studio with Bao Rui,

493
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,320
It won't be popular anymore.

494
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,920
You mean he sold the house?

495
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,080
Take this card.

496
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,280
How do you know so clearly?

497
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
At that time,

498
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,000
the agent who helped Jiang Nan sell the house was my friend.

499
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
And the house price was high at that time,

500
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,800
so I just paid the liquidated damages of Shengyu.

501
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
I've told you everything

502
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,040
I know. Let me go.

503
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,120
When I heard that Sis Shan used her private account to post the manuscript,

504
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Mr. Liang was quite angry.

505
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,360
Really?

506
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,280
It can't be fake. I heard

507
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,560
that Mr. Liang is looking for Kiki,

508
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,600
Well,

509
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,200
Mr. Liang didn't fire the chief editor, did he?

510
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,080
That's not

511
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,000
amiable,

512
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,840
What do you think of this?

513
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
Although Sister Shan did a great job,

514
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,280
Liang Zhe has a big say in the company,

515
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,520
Besides,

516
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
our sister Kiki Shan

517
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,000
must still be under a lot of pressure.

518
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,480
That's true.

519
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,280
Look at what you wrote.

520
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,080
Sister Shan read this manuscript before

521
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,400
and said it would be fine,

522
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I've approved it,

523
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,480
and the conclusion and title are revised according to what I want.

524
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,520
Didn't you hear me?

525
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,920
But what you wrote is totally contrary to the truth.

526
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
I can't turn black and white upside down and deceive the public.

527
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,400
That's right,

528
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,560
Kiki. If we change everything according to your wishes,

529
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Then who will bear the burden if something goes wrong, right?

530
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:46,600
That's right.

531
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,840
Shan is strict,

532
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,840
but she actually

533
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,440
respects our point of view.

534
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Editor-in-chief,

535
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,240
I don't think I should write that manuscript.

536
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
Change it according to what you want.

537
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,840
I'm afraid

538
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,600
that others will sue me.

539
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
Are you going to rebel?

540
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,640
Okay,

541
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,880
I'll tell Mr. Liang,

542
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,800
I'll fire all of you.

543
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,840
I recruited all of them.

544
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,360
You want to fire me?

545
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,400
You have to ask my opinion first.

546
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,480
Or do you think

547
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,160
Liang Zhe will meddle in your crap.

548
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,280
Okay,

549
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,160
We'll wait and see.

550
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,080
How to solve this problem?

551
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,280
Everyone,

552
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
I'm sure you've all seen my statement.

553
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,080
After a period of time,

554
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,880
I'll use my personal account,

555
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,840
Writing a separate report,

556
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,120
temporarily

557
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,680
I can't work with you.

558
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,880
In the past period of time,

559
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,560
when I was able to work with you,

560
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,240
It's my pleasure.

561
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,760
I know.

562
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm very strict with you,

563
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,520
and I know you call me Devil in private.

564
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,480
Anyway, is there anything I'm sorry about?

565
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm here to say sorry to everyone.

566
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,840
Sis Shan,

567
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,840
Sis Shan,

568
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,000
You don't care about us anymore.

569
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,320
Shan,

570
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
what should we do if you leave?

571
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,880
That's right.

572
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,560
I'm just leaving for now.

573
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,280
I believe there will be another chance in the future.

574
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,680
I'll work with you guys.

575
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,120
Okay,

576
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
You can work at ease.

577
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,000
I've read the next proposal you submitted.

578
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,440
Excellent.

579
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
We can proceed now.

580
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,440
This one

581
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,840
It's my work experience over the years,

582
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,520
I hope I can help you.

583
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,960
Sis Shan,

584
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,760
Well,

585
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,160
Take good care of it,

586
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,200
Shan.

587
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
What's your next plan?

588
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,520
I will write some manuscripts that I want to write,

589
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,000
and of course I will continue to follow them up.

590
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,880
About the news between Jiang Nan and Jianxing,

591
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
I can help you.

592
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,240
Do what you have to do first.

593
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,200
Stay here.

594
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,520
is to help me.

595
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,960
But Sis Shan.

596
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,160
Come on!

597
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
Kang Lin Group's big charity event.

598
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,680
Let's call it a day.

599
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,800
What's wrong?

600
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,240
Let me ask you,

601
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,680
five years ago,

602
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,960
Did Jiang Nan take your money?

603
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,000
That's why I paid the liquidated damages of Shengyu.

604
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,720
Why do you suddenly ask this?

605
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,520
Leave me alone.

606
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
You just need to tell me,

607
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,080
yes or no?

608
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,480
Why are you talking to me?

609
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,440
About you and Tian Caiyun,

610
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,160
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

611
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,120
I just want to know,

612
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,000
did you give Jiang Nan a hush money?

613
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,480
What hush money?

614
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,880
Talk to me when you calm down.

615
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,520
I'll calm down.

616
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,080
How can I calm down?

617
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,160
Jiang Nan is my best friend,

618
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,720
even if we can't perform on the same stage,

619
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,760
It wouldn't be like this,

620
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
it's all because of you.

621
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,960
I lost my friend.

622
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,880
I lost my dream.

623
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,560
Please calm me down now.

624
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,360
How can I calm down?

625
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,480
In the past few years,

626
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,800
you've been stuck in your own thoughts,

627
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,320
But some things don't exist

628
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,480
if you choose not to look at them.

629
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
If your mom dies,

630
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,800
you have to find someone to blame you

631
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,720
to accept it.

632
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,120
Then I'm willing to be this person.

633
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
But it has nothing to do

634
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,520
with Jiang Nan.

635
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,680
It's okay.

636
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,320
I saw you give him the card.

637
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
It's not hush money.

638
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,080
What is it?

639
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,000
I want to give Jiang Nan some money.

640
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
But he confiscated it.

641
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,440
I didn't confiscate it.

642
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
I gave him money,

643
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,840
Because I knew he was going to sell the house.

644
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
Jiang Nan is a good kid.

645
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,160
I can't bear to see his father not around.

646
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,880
But he still confiscated it.

647
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,360
And he doesn't want me

648
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
to tell you about it.

649
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,040
Zhilin,

650
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,160
there are many things you don't know.

651
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,760
In fact, there are a lot of people

652
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,440
who protect you without you knowing it.

653
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,600
Brother Cheng,

654
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,040
thank you.

655
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,160
You're welcome.

656
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,640
Have you noticed this dark bar?

657
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,120
It's been a long time since it was so lively.

658
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,440
Who said that?

659
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,120
My business is doing well here.

660
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,680
Yes, yes, yes.

661
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,200
Here,

662
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,320
reset it when it's used up.

663
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,280
Okay, okay, okay.

664
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,240
Dude,

665
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,920
go over there and fix that speaker.

666
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,440
Okay.

667
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,000
Mr. Bao,

668
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,720
have you seen Jiang Nan?

669
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,000
No.

670
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Aren't you two together?

671
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,760
He went out early in the morning.

672
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,320
I haven't seen him all day.

673
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,080
No,

674
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,520
he's going to hold this concert.

675
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
Are you going to drop the chain for me again?

676
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,120
He was preparing for the performance

677
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
last night. He will definitely come.

678
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,240
I'm telling you,

679
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,400
half of them are journalists,

680
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,800
The other half is for fun,

681
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,360
but no one really comes to the concert.

682
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,200
Let me tell you this,

683
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
we must win this battle.

684
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I'll call him again.

685
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,760
What can I do for you?

686
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,480
I have a favor

687
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,040
to ask of you.

688
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,400
I have a live performance in Black tonight.

689
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
Can you sing one song at a time

690
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,440
on the same stage with me,

691
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,520
This is also the wish of many oranges.

692
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,120
You and many oranges are quite interesting.

693
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,520
Take turns playing the love card, right?

694
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,240
She came to see you.

695
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,000
You have to ask her.

696
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,680
Jiang Nan,

697
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
let me ask you one more time.

698
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,360
Back then,

699
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
why did you break up our group?

700
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,880
I was the one who beat him that night, wasn't I?

701
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,720
Yes.

702
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,160
Uncle Zhan didn't support you to make music back then,

703
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,680
if something happened to you back then,

704
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,200
He can't let you go on.

705
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,840
With Liang Zhe's skill at that time,

706
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,920
he couldn't have let us go easily.

707
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,960
If I don't break up the group,

708
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,320
you'll be dragged down, too.

709
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,880
Not as far as I know, right?

710
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,080
After you found out about

711
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,080
the relationship between my father and your mother,

712
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,280
You're ashamed to see me.

713
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,720
That's why it was disbanded.

714
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,360
About what happened between them,

715
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,080
I didn't know before,

716
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,600
I don't know.

717
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,320
My mom looked for you

718
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
before jumping off the building.

719
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,760
Aunt Liang came to me at that time,

720
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,440
because of the termination of the contract.

721
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Jiang Nan,

722
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,560
is there no turning back

723
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,120
for the dissolution of Zhilin and you?

724
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,040
Auntie,

725
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,840
there's really no turning back this matter.

726
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,520
I've thought it through.

727
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,560
Jiang Nan,

728
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,760
I want to tell you,

729
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,400
Zhilin has always attached great importance to you.

730
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,680
I trust you very much.

731
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,160
In his heart,

732
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,880
you're his best friend.

733
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,960
I really don't want to,

734
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,800
because of what happened between Zhilin's father and your mother,

735
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,520
It affected your relationship.

736
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,680
Auntie,

737
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,120
you mean let me finish.

738
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
I came to see you today.

739
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,040
I have to make a big decision.

740
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I know your father is still alive

741
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Lin's father did this,

742
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,760
It's hard for you to accept it.

743
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,200
But I want to tell you,

744
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,680
Zhilin really doesn't know,

745
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,160
He's innocent.

746
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,080
What worries me the most is Zhilin,

747
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,760
who has been unhappy since he was a child.

748
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,120
He has changed a lot since he met you.

749
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,640
So you really mean a lot to him.

750
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,680
Forget it.

751
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,400
You're innocent, too.

752
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,360
It's all the sins of the previous generation.

753
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,760
Just pretend that I didn't come to see you.

754
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,040
I'll get going.

755
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,440
As for what happened between our parents,

756
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,040
she also told me at that time.

757
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,760
I've thought about making it clear to you.

758
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,120
But I was shocked at that time.

759
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,160
I also need time to digest these things.

760
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,880
But I didn't expect that

761
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
after Aunt Liang went back, she would.

762
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,080
So she jumped off the building.

763
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,880
You were in such a bad state at that time,

764
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,360
I really didn't know how to tell you.

765
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,640
After that,

766
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,400
Uncle Zhan came to me,

767
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,440
He said he would pay liquidated damages for me.

768
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,320
But I refused.

769
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,640
Thank you for hiding it

770
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,000
from Uncle Zhan Zhilin for me.

771
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,440
From now on,

772
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,080
I see.

773
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,280
From now on,

774
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,120
you don't need to talk about it.

775
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,520
I won't take the money

776
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,880
if you take it.

777
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,320
Zhan Zhilin hit him because of me,

778
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,679
so it's my duty to take responsibility for him.

779
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,440
As for the penalty,

780
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,520
I'll deal with it myself.

781
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,280
You don't have to worry about me.

782
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,880
I always thought,

783
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,080
you owe me.

784
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,719
Unexpectedly,

785
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,560
it turns out that you are the one who wants to protect me the most.

786
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,760
I'm the biggest idiot

787
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,679
in the world.

788
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,719
Zhan Zhilin.

789
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,960
Haven't you got in touch with Jiang Nan?

790
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:23,760
That's right.

791
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,160
He said he went to pick up the mysterious guest

792
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,280
but he hasn't arrived yet,

793
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,760
There's really a mysterious guest.

794
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,640
Jiang Nan really thinks of this place as a show.

795
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,480
Boss,

796
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,840
when will it start?

797
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,680
When will it start?

798
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,520
Almost there.

799
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,800
When will it start?

800
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,160
It hasn't started yet.

801
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,480
I'll go.

802
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,600
Thanks to all of you here today,

803
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,720
I'm Jiang Nan's agent,

804
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,440
Bao Rui,

805
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,640
before the show starts,

806
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,520
I'd like to take this opportunity,

807
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,720
to give you a detailed explanation

808
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,200
about the recent news of Jiangnan.

809
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,960
Reporters and friends know,

810
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,600
after the show,

811
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,800
There will be an interview.

812
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
But since our guest is still on the way,

813
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,960
what about?

814
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
I can only take out this gossip,

815
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,800
to warm you up.

816
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,960
That day,

817
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,280
backstage at "Cool Sing Producers",

818
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,600
Jiang Nan did hit someone,

819
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,120
but,

820
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
It was after he found out that

821
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,920
his work had been plagiarized

822
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
by the airborne guest Jian Xing.

823
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,400
It's not right to hit people,

824
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,840
so Jiang Nan

825
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,520
will definitely come to the scene later.

826
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,160
I personally apologize to everyone.

827
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,800
Why did you come down?

828
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,800
Didn't you say I'm here to do all the housework?

829
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,760
Honey,

830
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,640
if you still want to live with me,

831
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,440
You have to tell me the truth today.

832
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,360
What is it?

833
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,480
I've been observing you for days.

834
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,120
When will I check your phone?

835
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,680
It's all about your boss.

836
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,680
I'm with you

837
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,200
because you're kind-hearted,

838
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,600
When you suddenly told me that you have money to get married,

839
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,880
I was happy,

840
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,800
But if the money comes with no conscience,

841
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,800
no matter how good the house is,

842
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,200
Can I live in peace?

843
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,280
Me,

844
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,280
Since your boss came here last time,

845
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,560
he already knew you had a problem.

846
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,360
For the sake of me and the child,

847
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,360
I didn't tell you the truth.

848
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,440
How can you get over it?

849
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,560
I was wrong.

850
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,200
I did it for you and the baby.

851
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,640
At that time,

852
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,440
for the sake of the child,

853
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,440
You should set an example for your child,

854
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,200
I can't accept the father of my child.

855
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,480
He's a perfidious person.

856
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,720
What's the use of worrying about it?

857
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,640
It's not too late for you to make up for it.

858
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,560
But I think you might as well think about it,

859
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,080
if you create your own work,

860
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,280
Someone else plagiarized it.

861
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,840
Are you angry?

862
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,840
She must be angry.

863
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,080
But what is the most important point?

864
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,400
It was Jianxing who started it,

865
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,360
when our team

866
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,200
went to confront him about it,

867
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,400
Instead, I was beaten.

868
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,560
Is there any evidence for what you said?

869
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,520
Of course,

870
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,120
before our team confronted him,

871
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,840
At the same time, the recording is turned on. Listen,

872
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,160
everyone,

873
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,480
Jianxing,

874
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,280
what are you doing?

875
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,320
Why did you copy Jiang Nan's song?

876
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,400
What's wrong with you?

877
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,840
Don't go.

878
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
You were modifying the music in the background,

879
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,880
I heard everything.

880
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,320
Your song is exactly the same as Jiang Nan's.

881
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,960
What's wrong with you?

882
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
Didn't Jiang Nan change the song?

883
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,120
I've never heard of it.

884
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,520
Jiang Nan wrote the original version of this song,

885
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,560
and every adaptation,

886
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,360
We all have records.

887
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,360
We can confront each other,

888
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,320
and see who plagiarized who.

889
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,760
If you don't make it clear,

890
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,600
I'll expose you to the media.

891
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,400
If you expose it to the media,

892
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,080
I dare to show this song today.

893
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,520
Do you think I'm unprepared?

894
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,360
So you admit that you plagiarized.

895
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,760
Listen,

896
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,320
watch your mouth.

897
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,080
Jiang Nan will die sooner or later.

898
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,560
Don't overreach yourself.

899
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
The recording can be edited or forged,

900
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,960
but it doesn't tell the truth.

901
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,680
Do you have any more concrete proof?

902
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,720
That is to say,

903
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,560
you admit that Jiang Nan hit people is a fact.

904
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,480
How do you explain Jiang Nan's violence

905
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,840
against Jian Xing five years ago?

906
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Check Weibo.

907
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,480
Jiang Nan is on trend again.

908
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,960
Du Hua admitted that he secretly photographed Jiang Nan's manuscript.

909
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,560
Hey,

910
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,280
Hey,

911
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,800
The real-name evidence is out now.

912
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,080
The netizens overwhelmingly support Jiangnan Jianxing.

913
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,760
This chess piece can no longer be used.

914
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,520
I got it.

915
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,680
I'll arrange for the program group to announce that

916
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Jianxing must withdraw from the competition.

917
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,240
Well,

918
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,120
I have to think about it,

919
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,840
How should I play the trump card of Many Orange?
