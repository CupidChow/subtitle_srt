1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,727
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,967
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:19,167
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:24,442
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:30,300
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,014
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:35,519
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,901
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,600
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,414
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:48,401
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,128
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,841
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:55,388
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,755
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,470
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,711
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:10,558
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:13,512
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,146
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:18,353
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,066
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:25,725
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:31,244
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:45,105
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,073

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,280
 What can we do to make everyone believe we're really a couple?

29
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,480
â™«  I like your...  â™«

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
- Look. 
 - Wow.

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,178
It must be true.

32
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:12,389
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

33
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,610
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,810
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

35
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,520
Actually, a relationship is just between two people.

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,140
We really don't need to explain or prove anything to you,

37
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:42,040
but since I have someone I like and someone who cares about me,

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,520
I've decided to publicly announce my relationship today.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,540
I wish to have everyone's understanding and blessing.

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,520
I also wish everyone can give us some privacy.

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Thank you, everyone.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,400
None of you said anything at the time.

43
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
Someone had to step out, right?

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,400
That's why I...

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,540
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,480
That was my... first kiss.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,040
Congratulations.

48
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,280
You are really beautiful today. This is for you.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
Thank you.

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,600
Come at me if you have a problem.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
Don't get anyone else involved.

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,560
I came for you today.

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,680
Isn't this Xiao Zhan?

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,720
We haven't seen each other in forever.

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,960
Let's go have a chat.

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,640
Let's go. Let's go.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,620
What did Zhan Zhi Lin mean by that?

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,800
Nothing.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,920
He's bullying you because you seem foolish.

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,520
What exactly happened between you two?

61
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,040
You two were so close back then.

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,360
How come now...

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,160
None of your business. We should go now.

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,920
Why aren't you leaving? Are you waiting for the reporters to block you in?

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,354
Oh.

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,740
 God Nan, can you dream with me a little more?

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,080
 That was my... first kiss.

68
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:53,140

69
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,980

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,120
There's no problem with your hand position,

71
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
but your wrists and shoulders are too stiff.

72
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,060
Put your hands on my shoulders and feel it.

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,300
Did you feel that?

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,840
But as I play, I always start to get stiff.

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,680
My mom said I'm too stupid to learn it.

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
How is that possible?

77
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
As long as you practice every day,

78
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,720
you'll surpass me soon.

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,480
Besides, you're my first student.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,400
I'll be happy to see any little progress you make every day.

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
Let's do it again.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,480
Hello, darlings!

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,520
I am at the most famous high-end piano store in the city.

84
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,320
Do you want to see what I look like playing these couple of million yuan pianos?

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,960
Quick, darlings, guess who I see.

86
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,820
Isn't that Xu Duo Cheng, the girlfriend of

87
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,160
Gu Jia Yi's ex-boyfriend, Jiang Nan just publicly revealed?

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,880
Please, don't disrupt our class.

89
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,500
This piano store is a place of business.

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,740
Can't I come in and take a look?

91
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,720
You can film me, but please, don't film my student.

92
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,080
I heard you graduated from a music school.

93
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,800
Please, don't affect my work.

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,520
Darlings, look, there's a handsome man playing guitar over there.

95
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,040
Do you want to see how handsome he is?

96
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,640
Hello, I'm live-streaming right now.

97
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,080
Can I film you playing a song?

98
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,880
Yes, no problem.

99
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,580
Why is Zhan Zhi Lin at the piano store where Xu Duo Cheng teaches?

100
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,680
You care about her quite a bit now.

101
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,760
I don't.

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,800
Besides, she's only being harassed because of me.

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,660
You have a conscience after all.

104
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,220
Brother Rui, go find this live streamer.

105
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,060
Tell her not to harass Xu Duo Cheng again.

106
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,660
Okay.

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,020
Where are you going? Don't tell me, you're going to pick her up?

108
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,180
Am I that crazy to go pick her up?

109
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,840
Then, where are you going?

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm going to the nursing home.

111
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,640
Are all the idol dramas like this nowadays?

112
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,340
My goodness...

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
Long time no see.

114
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
What are you doing, Jiang Nan? Let go of me!

115
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,460
Jiang Nan, let go of me.

116
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,760
A lot of people watched that live-stream.

117
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
More and more people will come to harass you in the future.

118
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
I didn't do anything wrong.

119
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
Why should I care about them?

120
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,940
Xu Duo Cheng, don't forget about our current relationship.

121
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,260
I know,

122
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,160
but I can't stop working just because of this.

123
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,300
Then, quit your job right now.

124
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,160
I signed a contract with the manager.

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
I need to take responsibility.

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,500
You and I also...

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,880
You're my girlfriend.

128
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,940
You have to take responsibility for me.

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,560
Can't you see she doesn't want to leave?

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,740
She's my girlfriend. What does it have to do with you?

131
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,960
You should treat girls with tenderness.

132
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,660
Why did you fall for him?

133
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,660
I just so happen to be missing a girlfriend.

134
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,120
Would you like to consider me?

135
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,220
Zhan Zhi Lin, are you done messing around yet?

136
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,600
Why don't you have any confidence in front of a girl?

137
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,320
That's right. You're no longer a popular singer anymore.

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,020
You are just trying to use gossip to get people's attention.

139
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,500
How can you say that about Jiang Nan?

140
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Don't think you know everything.

141
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
 Interesting.

142
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,960
Lending you Â¥300,000 wasn't enough?

143
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,280
How much is the piano store paying you each month?

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,100
I borrowed that Â¥300,000 for emergency use.

145
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,560
I need to pay it back.

146
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,320
I'll pay the Â¥300,000 back to Bao Rui.

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
How long will you need to save up by teaching here?

148
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
The most important characteristic of a person is trustworthiness.

149
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,540
I borrowed the money.

150
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,360
Why should I let you pay him back?

151
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,600
Besides, I'm just your girlfriend in name.

152
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
In the contract we signed,

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,160
there's no restriction against me being a teacher at the piano store.

154
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,120
My students are still waiting for me to teach them.

155
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,580
They are all blooming flowers of our motherland,

156
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,320
hope for the future, hungry souls.

157
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,800
Hurry and let me get off the car.

158
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,240
Stop using your glib tongue on me.

159
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,520
Look at the car behind us.

160
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,640
It's been following us since we left the piano store.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
If you want them to know where you live,

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
you can get off the car now.

163
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Then...

164
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,080
Then where are we going?

165
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,960
My place.

166
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,220
Your place?

167
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,740
 Oh, no.

168
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,320
 We left in a hurry and I forgot to ask my boss for time off.

169
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,380
 Will I lose my job at the piano store?

170
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,180
 I should still try to fix this.

171
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,960
 Dear boss, I'm so sorry about today.

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,160
 I left in a hurry and forgot to ask for time off.

173
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,920
 I'll go through the required process with the manager later.

174
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,100
 I'm really sorry.

175
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,140
What are you doing?

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,880
Nothing.

177
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,000
Why are you just standing there? Come in.

178
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,760
Feel free to sit anywhere.

179
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,160

180
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,460
Aren't you just relying on your handsome looks?

181
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,320
You have this too?

182
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,400
This is custom-made by our Pumpkin Fan Club.

183
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,140
Everyone in the Pumpkin Fan Club has one.

184
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,920
I remember this hat.

185
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,240
You wore this for your first concert, right?

186
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,200
I remember you even kissed the stage at the end of that concert.

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,760
God Nan, I don't mean to scold you.

188
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,680
As an idol, you're too sloppy.

189
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,520
So what if I'm an idol?

190
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,140
Idols need to eat and go to the bathroâ€”

191
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,060
 Women-Women's bathroom?

192
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,680
You saw the kitchen, right?

193
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,180
Go cook.

194
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm here to be your assistant and not your housekeeper!

195
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,920
It's the same thing.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
By the way,

197
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,040
Cola Chicken Wings.

198
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,960
It has to taste the same as last time.

199
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,880
I want to eat in half an hour.

200
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,360
 Do I owe you?

201
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,520
 Fine, I'll cook.

202
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,780
Sister Jia Yi, there will surely be a lot of reporters in front of Jiang Nan's house right now.

203
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,680
Are you sure you want to go?

204
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,980
But Jiang Nan already announced he has a girlfriend.

205
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,760
Didn't you see Xu Duo Cheng was the one taking the initiative the whole time?

206
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,800
She even kissed him in public.

207
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,080
Jiang Nan is only doing this to make me upset.

208
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,600
He took the first step.

209
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,960
Obviously, I should be the one to take the second step.

210
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,200
He changed a lot indeed,

211
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
but that's all right.

212
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,880
He announced his girlfriend in public yesterday.

213
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,360
He can just announce that he's single tomorrow.

214
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,860
That's not a big deal.

215
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,980
Then what about the paparazzi?

216
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,900
I just so happen to need them.

217
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,440
Why are you here?

218
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,160
I can't come to see you without a reason?

219
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,860
Well, you saw me.

220
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,680
You're not going to invite me in?

221
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,420
I don't think that's necessary.

222
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,560
I need to talk to you.

223
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,360
Who is it?

224
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,140
Gu Jia Yi?

225
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,600
- Is the food ready? 
 - I'm in the process.

226
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,140
You're living together?

227
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,700
Jiang Nan, you really changed a lot.

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,220
People always say that I've changed. No one has ever asked me why.

229
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,160
You saw it too. I don't want my girlfriend to misunderstand.

230
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
Please, leave now.

231
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,320
Why did you two break up?

232
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,880
You two were a perfect couple back then.

233
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,160
The Yi-Nan couple was hard for us Pumpkins to get over.

234
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,720
Yi-Nan?

235
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
Is that an incurable disease?

236
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,220
Hurry back to cooking.

237
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm so angry. So angry!

238
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,120
Let's go.

239
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,920
Okay, Sister.

240
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,280
This is a good photo.

241
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,760
- Are you busy? 
 - Lord Bao, what a coincidence.

242
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
Such a coincidence.

243
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,660
We're about to get off work. Let's go.

244
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,640
Sit down! Sit with me for a while!

245
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,680
I even slacked off to come to talk to you.

246
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,280
Does this seem fit?

247
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,560
You see, Lord Bao, stop making fun of us.

248
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,200
How am I making fun of you?

249
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,760
We are all working men. Life is hard for all of us.

250
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,920
Let me tell you, I understand and respect you, right?

251
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,340
You can't come for nothing. I'll give you a little scoop so you can report back to your boss.

252
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,779
You made all these dishes?

253
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,960
I had all these ingredients in my fridge?

254
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,240
You have a lot of ingredients in your fridge.

255
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,240
You told me to cook and you're not eating.

256
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Don't I need to think about my figure.

257
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,000
You made so much food.

258
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Didn't you say you're working out and don't need to diet?

259
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,080
Well, I still have to run it off on the treadmill.

260
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,240
Don't eat it then.

261
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll just run for a bit longer later.

262
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,720
 There's only one left.

263
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,500
 I'm determined to get it.

264
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,720
 Last round. Ready? Go!

265
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,080
There are a total of 12 chicken wings and you ate most of them!

266
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,480
I only ate three!

267
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,080
If every bite counts, you wasted all three of them!

268
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,200
You're an idol.

269
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,600
You have to watch what you eat or you'll gain weight!

270
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,680
Chicken wing is my inspiration. I can only write songs after I eat them.

271
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,700
Sorry,

272
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,960
wipe it first.

273
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,440
It's all because you made it so delicious.

274
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
You didn't make enough this time.

275
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
Make more of them next time.

276
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,680
Never mind, I won't argue with you.

277
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,240
You're full now. It's time for me to go home too.

278
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,840
Wait!

279
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,680
What now?

280
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,700
Xu Duo Cheng, use your brain to think.

281
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,420
You know how hard it is to deal with paparazzi, right?

282
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,520
There is definitely a lot of paparazzi out there right now.

283
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,020
Gu Jia Yi just left and you want to leave now.

284
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,780
If you're not afraid of them knowing where you live, go ahead.

285
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,160
Well, I can't not go home either.

286
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,980
Anyway, if anything happens, the contract will be terminated,

287
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,900
and you have to pay me back the Â¥300,000.

288
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,640
You...

289
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,220
Stop wiping. I'll find you some new clothes later.

290
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,160
Hello, dad.

291
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm sleeping at Ke Qin's place tonight and won't be going home.

292
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
No, no no. You don't have to tell Mom to come to the phone.

293
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,520
You two should rest early.

294
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,400
I'm hanging up now. Bye-bye.

295
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,360
Don't you blush when you lie?

296
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,520
Where am I sleeping tonight?

297
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,300
Find me a place.

298
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,760
My room.

299
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,760
What do you want to do?

300
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,240
I mean there's a tent in my room.

301
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,040
Go get it yourself.

302
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,880
Who sleeps in a tent indoors?

303
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,480
 What's with the scary noises at night?

304
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,660
 What is she doing?

305
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,940
What are you doing? You scared me.

306
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,380
What are you doing? You are the one who scared me.

307
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm cultivating.

308
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,800
The Eight-Part Vajra Qigong. 
  (T/N: Type of mental and physical cultivation)

309
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,820
What kind of crooked practice is that?

310
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,240
This is a real type of training for your health.

311
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,860
It's not good to interrupt me like this.

312
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,660
Will you be misguided and go crazy?

313
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,920
I mean, just practice if you need to.

314
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,940
Why are your eyes closed?

315
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,880
Because of your towel.

316
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,620
It's fine. What about it?

317
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,640
Usually, at this time,

318
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,740
the towel falls down.

319
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,540
Is your brain filled with oranges?

320
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,640
Don't watch so many stupid dramas.

321
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
Bad TVs get their inspiration from life too.

322
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Xu Duo Cheng, how much longer is there?

323
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,800
A long time.

324
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,680
Just take your time and watch.

325
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,380
It's only 11 minutes and 56 seconds into the movie.

326
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,900
There's about to be a surprise.

327
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
What's wrong?

328
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,240
Are you afraid?

329
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Only grandsons are afraid. 
  (T/N: "Grandson" is used sarcastically, coward)

330
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,940
Why are you hiding behind the blanket if you're not afraid?

331
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,700
Who's hiding behind the blanket?

332
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
You're not hiding.

333
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,480
Here's another surprise.

334
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,920
Xu Duo Cheng, why are you so familiar with this movie?

335
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,440
I've watched this movie many times.

336
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,780
I shouldn't have agreed to watch a horror film.

337
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,260
Let's discuss something.

338
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,960
What is it?

339
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,500
It's about me working at the piano store.

340
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,540
As for why I'm working there part-time, one, I have to pay the money back.

341
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,120
Two, I like to work in music-related jobs.

342
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,480
Don't worry. I will not delay my assistant work here.

343
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
If there are any delays, you can deduct my pay.

344
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,840
No, I won't agree with that.

345
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,460
Fine, I agree!

346
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,680
Are you happy now?

347
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,340
Fine, it's a deal then.

348
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
Why aren't you going upstairs to sleep?

349
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,320
This...

350
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,800
This is my place.

351
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,000
I can sleep wherever I want.

352
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,500
Fine.

353
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
Time to sleep.

354
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,480
Xu Duo Cheng, I'm telling you.

355
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,440
I want a sandwich and milk tomorrow morning and nothing less.

356
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,480
Xu Duo Cheng, did you hear what I said?

357
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,920
Xu Duo Cheng!

358
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,240
You fell asleep?

359
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
Are you a pig?

360
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,980
How can you fall asleep so fast?

361
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,500
Jiang Nan, where is everyone in the room?

362
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,180
Xu Duo Cheng!

363
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,236
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

364
00:25:16,236 --> 00:25:18,422
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

365
00:25:18,422 --> 00:25:21,692
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

366
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:26,916
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

367
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,806
â™«  I guess you must have already  â™«

368
00:25:28,806 --> 00:25:31,736
â™«  discovered it, already discovered it  â™«

369
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,880
I'll make you stay on the treadmill forever.

370
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,220
What are you doing?

371
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
Nothing.

372
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
You're awake?

373
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,180
Hurry and eat breakfast.

374
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
What...

375
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,280
What is this?

376
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,960
A sandwich.

377
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,840
Sandwiches... look like this?

378
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
I made it per your request.

379
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,220
You're not scared out of your wits from the horror film last night, are you?

380
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,280
Am I?

381
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,820
No.

382
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,460
You made this?

383
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,840
From now on, just make this.

384
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,540
It tastes pretty good.

385
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,940
Lao Jiang!

386
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,280
Hello, Sister-in-law.

387
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't leave. Don't leaâ€”

388
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,900
Wait, why didn't you explain it?

389
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,980
Who is he calling Sister-in-law?

390
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,720
What's wrong?

391
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,420
My stomach hurts!

392
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,670
 Is it because I added too much sauce?

393
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,940

394
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,040
Brother, you have to stop Big Lin if he rushes out later.

395
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,400
I can't stop him.

396
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,240
Let's stop him together.

397
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,500
I can't handle him on my own.

398
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,720
Did you see that picture?

399
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,400
The one with that handsome young boy.

400
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,840
Look, he's holding Cheng Cheng in his arms like that?  How outrageous.

401
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,760
Th-That's so explicit.

402
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,920
Master would be so angry if he sees it.

403
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,520
If he really sees it, he'll probably be angrier than Big Lin.

404
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,380
Xu Duo Cheng?

405
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,680
- Lao Xu, you're back? 
 - Give me the phone.

406
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,480
- No. When you're free later... 
 - Give me the phone!

407
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,600
Wait, I know that boy.

408
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,540
Isn't that the singer, that-that Jiang Nan?

409
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,500
All right, you little bast*rd, I'll chop you into pieces. Just you wait!

410
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,520
- Master! Master! 
 - LaoXu!

411
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,080
You can't get worked up!

412
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,280
- Masterâ€” 
 - Let me do it.

413
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,860
What does he mean?

414
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,160
He's going to chop him?

415
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,860
Into pieces?

416
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,380
Big Lin, don't be impulsive!

417
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,640
- Think it through! 
 - Lao Xu!

418
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,220
Xu Duo Cheng, what did you put in there?

419
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,320
I just put a little...

420
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,020
Wait a minute.

421
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,640
Hello, Dad.

422
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,400
 Who are you calling Dad? You're my dad!

423
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,620
Where are you? Come back right now!

424
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
The attitude was pretty good, right?

425
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,140
It was fine.

426
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
Don't touch!

427
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,980
What's wrong?

428
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,680
I don't know. My dad told me to hurry back home.

429
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,280
Hold on, hold on.

430
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,080
I'm going to the office with Bao Rui.

431
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,360
Have Xiao Du take you home first.

432
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
Fine, I'll go get changed now.

433
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,160
Should I go upstairs or downstairs?

434
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,960
I'll go upstairs.

435
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,840
- Tell us, when did this start? 
 - Tell us!

436
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,720
- Why didn't you tell us? 
 - Why didn't you tell us?

437
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,360
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you'd be mad.

438
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,080
You little brat, how can I not be mad?

439
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,380
- Look at you, are we against you dating? 
 - Exactly.

440
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,300
Even if you didn't tell us right away.

441
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,380
- Didn't we still accept it? 
 - We did.

442
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,420
- What kind of man did you find? 
 - What kind?

443
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,960
You found a singer.

444
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
What kind of people are they?

445
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,300
- They are players. 
 - That's right.

446
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,540
- They're irresponsible. 
 - That's right.

447
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,680
Players definitely don't want to get married.

448
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,460
Is singing a steady job?

449
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,120
Without a steady job, he definitely doesn't have a steady income.

450
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,680
If you date him for a few years, wouldn't that be a waste of your youth?

451
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,640
He's nothing!

452
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,000
No, Mom. You don't understand the situation.

453
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
God Nan won't be like that.

454
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
- What? 
 - God Nan?

455
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,920
She's calling him "God Nan".

456
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,860
- I can tell he's just trying to deceive ignorant girls like you! 
 - Sc*mbag!

457
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,440
- Break up with him immediately! 
 - Break up!

458
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,100
Jiang Nan isn't that type of person.

459
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,920
What kind of person is he then?

460
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,960
Tell us. Tell us, tell us, tell us.

461
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,400
He goes to bed early and gets up early,

462
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
and he doesn't have any bad habits.

463
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,265
Goes to bed early and gets up early? I do that too.

464
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,965
He goes to bed early...

465
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,920
How do you know he goes to bed early and gets up early?

466
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,280
Exactly.

467
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,480
I'm his girlfriend.

468
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,880
Of course I know that.

469
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,980
You little brat!

470
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,320
Look at her!

471
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,800
Look at your daughter!

472
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,480
She's siding with an outsider now!

473
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
- Did I raise you for nothing? 
 - Mom.

474
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,760
- I raised you for nothing? 
 - What are you doing?

475
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,800
- Mom! 
 - What are you doing?

476
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,320
Don't get physical! Have you gone mad?

477
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,300
Wait, listen to me. I think...

478
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,480
I don't care about what you think! I only care about what I think right now!

479
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,480
I think you've spoiled her rotten!

480
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
Mom, Mom!

481
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,600
I made a mistake! I made a mistake!

482
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,880
Enough! She already said she made a mistake.

483
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
What are you doing?

484
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,600
Now you know to admist your mistake?

485
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,640
You're already on TV!

486
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,560
What will the neighbors think?

487
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,600
I was wondering why I kept feeling like people were staring

488
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
behind my back when I went to the market these days.

489
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,920
It was because of you!

490
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,840
It's because you're...

491
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,840
- a flawless beauty who still retains your graceful bearing. 
 - That's right. Graceful...

492
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,040
Wouldn't you be the focus when you step foot in the market?

493
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
The focus.

494
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,660
You're still speaking nonsense?

495
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,040
How dare you speak nonsense! Say that again!

496
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,400
Calm down. Calm down. Listen to me.

497
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,120
Since it has already come to this point.

498
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,260
It's better if you ask that Jiang...

499
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,400
Jiang Nan!

500
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,840
That's right. Call Jiang Nan over.

501
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,900
Let your mom and I meet him and evaluate him.

502
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,280
You're finally saying human words.

503
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,785
- Don't... 
 - What were you doing earlier?

504
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:05,485
Stop poking me.

505
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,240
Isn't this too soon?

506
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,460
Besides, he might not come either.

507
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,060
What are you saying?

508
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,960
Lao Jiang, this is our upcoming schedule.

509
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,760
Take a look.

510
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,080
There might be a few interviews.

511
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,760
You should be mentally prepared because Gu Jia Yi might take some action too.

512
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,720
I have Xu Duo Cheng now anyway.

513
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,160
I would like to see what else she can do.

514
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,320
You already have Xu Duo Cheng?

515
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,380
You say it so naturally now.

516
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,360
Look, speaking of the devil.

517
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,100
Is she calling you? That's her, right?

518
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,000
- What's wrong? 
   - Is it Xiao Jiang?

519
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,260
 I'm Xu Duo Cheng's father.

520
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,540
Uncle, do you need something? 
  (T/N: "Uncle" is a respectful title for an older generation male)

521
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,960
Are you free tomorrow?

522
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,080
Tomorrow?

523
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,120
 Here's the thing.

524
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,040
We want to meet with you and have dinner together.

525
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,520
  Seven o'clock at the Happy Family Restaurant,

526
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,840
be there or be square.

527
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,240
Uncle, tomorrow I-I-I...

528
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,880
What's wrong? You look unwell.

529
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,840
Xu Duo Cheng's dad invited me to dinner tomorrow.

530
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,400
Go. That's great.

531
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,100
Do some preparation.

532
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,560
No need to prepare. I'm not going.

533
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,080
Why?

534
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,880
It's not real between us anyway.

535
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,800
Things will get more complicated if I meet her parents.

536
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,440
Let me tell you, this is where you're wrong.

537
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,680
You should've been mentally prepared when we came up with this idea.

538
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,500
Besides, that girl exposed herself to the public just for you.

539
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,840
She's having a hard time dealing with her parents.

540
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,720
She doesn't owe you anything.

541
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,120
Can't you just help each other out?

542
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,620
Think about it.

543
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
How can you use that lip color?

544
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,840
You have such fair skin.

545
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Shouldn't you use No. 7?

546
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,880
I just checked out the lighting on set. The lighting is a bit harsh.

547
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,220
No. 19 will make you look haggard.

548
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,280
- What happened to your mouth? 
 - It's inflamed from being angry about the release event.

549
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,560
Xiao Mei, go get me an ointment.

550
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
Okay.

551
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,300
Director Zhan, you are pretty knowledgeable.

552
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,639
Seems like you have a lot of close lady friends.

553
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,080
You didn't come specially for me today, right?

554
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,400
Which girl do you fancy this time?

555
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,080
I didn't like any of them.

556
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,580
I came specially to congratulate you today

557
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,339
on reconciling with an old friend.

558
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,080
Are you trying to upset me on purpose?

559
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,440
I'm pretty curious.

560
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,780
Why are you still hung up on Jiang Nan?

561
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,000
Isn't it the same for you?

562
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,440
Jiang Nan has been living below everyone's expectations these past few years.

563
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,080
All thanks to you.

564
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,980
He's having writer's block.

565
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,239
What does it have to do with me?

566
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,940
But if you put him down, that's my business.

567
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,400
But I really don't understand.

568
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,680
You two were such good friends, why did things

569
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,320
turn out like this?

570
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,640
 Flying solo from a boy band is an inevitable trend.

571
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,360
 We can develop on our own.

572
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,860
 Take this card.

573
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,140
If you have spare time to worry about me,

574
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,040
you should worry about yourself.

575
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,400
Jiang Nan has a new fling now.

576
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,180
I don't think you are the one he showed public affection for, right?

577
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,600
It's right if I'm annoyed with his new fling.

578
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,420
Why are you so concerned?

579
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,200
What do you mean?

580
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,540
What a coincidence, right?

581
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,460
I just happened to see that.

582
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,440
But I really don't understand what's so good about that girl

583
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,120
that makes both of you interested in her.

584
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,280
I'm interested in anything

585
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,980
Jiang Nan is interested in.

586
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
That girl is pretty cute.

587
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,840
She's very likable.

588
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,120
Well, perfect. Let's cooperate.

589
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,580
You'll steal Xu Duo Cheng

590
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,240
and I'll get Jiang Nan.

591
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,880
How's that?

592
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,140
Sister, your ointment.

593
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,760
I know very well what I want.

594
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,220
As for whether you can seize the chance, that's up to you.

595
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,040
Someone will probably stop you, right?

596
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,720
No one can stop me.

597
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,320
I think No. 19 suits you better.

598
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,440
Jiang Nan, I know you're in a tough position.

599
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,080
Why don't you just meet my parents?

600
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,460
Otherwise, they won't let me hear the end of it.

601
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,000
Then beg me.

602
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm begging you.

603
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,600
That's not sincere at all.

604
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,740
Oppa, please. 
  (T/N: Speaking in Korean, "oppa" is used to address an older male)

605
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,360
Please? 
  (T/N: Speaking in Japanese)

606
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm begging you, please. 
  (T/N: Speaking in Thai)

607
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,920
Brother Jiang Nan.

608
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,420
That's enough!

609
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,900
Let me think about it.

610
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,040
- Is that a yes? 
 - I didn't agree.

611
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,540
It's my first time doing something as important as meeting the parents. I'm nervous.

612
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,820
Jiang Nan, it's the first time for both of us.

613
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,760
I'm not going anyway.

614
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,360
Stop right there.

615
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,220
- What are you doing? 
 - If you don't go with me,

616
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,020
I'll tell the media about your embarrassing stories.

617
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,920
What embarrassing stories?

618
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,240
I'll tell them your place is like a pig sty

619
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,760
and the women's bathroom incident from before.

620
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,960
You...

621
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,820
Xu Duo Cheng, you promised me you wouldn't tell anyone about that.

622
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,771
If you dare to tell anyone, just wait...

623
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,456
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

624
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:21,223
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

625
00:38:21,223 --> 00:38:23,364
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

626
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:26,076
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

627
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:30,327
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

628
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:36,297
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

629
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:54,960

630
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:05,611
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

631
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:12,325
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

632
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:20,022
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

633
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:25,609
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

634
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:29,155
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

635
00:39:29,155 --> 00:39:33,235
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

636
00:39:33,235 --> 00:39:39,588
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

637
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:43,043
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

638
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:44,921
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

639
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:47,221
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

640
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:50,235
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

641
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:54,123
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

642
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:57,440
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

643
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,508
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

644
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:05,794
