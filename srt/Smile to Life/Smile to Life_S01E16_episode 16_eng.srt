â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,480
What are you doing here?

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,020
I came because you needed me.

30
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,120
I'm sending charcoal in snowy weather. 
  (T/N: Idiom meaning providing timely help)

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,680
Did Xu Duo Cheng really leave?

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,020
Orange!

33
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,020
Why would I lie to you about that?

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,540
Let me tell you, don't be anxious.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,160
You are currently too closely involved to see it objectively.

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,240
Let me analyze it for you as an outsider.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,940
The one thing that I don't understand is

38
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,220
I can clearly sense that Xu Duo Cheng really likes me.

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,780
Why does she keep rejecting me?

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,120
- Right? 
 - Yes.

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,140
Although she says she has rejected me, when something happened with my mom

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,420
she spent so much time and energy on my mom.

43
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,120
She's not doing that for me at all?

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,440
Exactly.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Even if she really doesn't like me,

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,840
she doesn't have to go so far and move out that quickly, right?

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,720
Exactly. She shouldn't have.

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,380
Are you here to be a straight man? 
  (T/N: A supporting role in comic crosstalk)

49
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,440
Give me some ideas about what to do.

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,020
- Actually, I think this is a good thing. 
 - A good thing?

51
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,900
Think about it, if she really doesn't want to be your girlfriend and to be with you,

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,360
she would just tell you directly? Why would she go so far?

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
There's only one possibility.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,620
She's avoiding it.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Avoiding what?

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Avoiding her feelings for you.

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,320
However, you have to ask her the specific reason in person.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
If you are going to fail, then you have to at least know why.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,660
I want to ask her in person.

60
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,840
But to avoid me, she hasn't been going to music lessons.

61
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,940
She just stays at Yu Ke Qin's home all the time.

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,520
I finally had a chance to see her today at Dou Dou's birthday party.

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,560
Now, I've even missed that opportunity.

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,020
I don't even know where to find her anymore.

65
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,920
What about your father-in-law's place?

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,661
She has to go back to the Happy Family Restaurant eventually.

67
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,520
Your words have awakened a person in their dreams. 
  (T/N: Helping someone come to their senses)

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,960
Of course.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,000
I told you that you couldn't see things objectively being so closely involved.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,780
Go over to your father-in-law acting cute to beg him.

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,660
Orange will come and see you sooner or later.

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,080
You're quite good!

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,600
The older ginger is spicier than the new one. 
  (T/N: The older, the wiser)

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,780
What's wrong with you?

75
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,400
It's intelligence, understand?

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,940
Hurry and eat.

77
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,580
You'll have the strength to fight after eating.

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,079
Mincing meat requires a sense of propriety and proper force.

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,260
Say it, then. How did you bully Cheng Cheng?

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,880
Own up to it.

81
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,880
You're not allowed to lie.

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,540
Uncle, I've always been living alone for many years already.

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,300
I've only felt the warmth of family again

84
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,920
when I met you and Cheng Cheng.

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,080
Are you trying to arouse my sympathy for you?

86
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,540
Talk about you and Cheng Cheng!

87
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,200
Uncle, I really like Cheng Cheng.

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,080
Why would I bully her?

89
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,060
But she has been a bit angry recently

90
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,460
and has been ignoring me.

91
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,180
Of course, I must have done something wrong,

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,900
so I came to see you today to ask if you could bring her out to see me.

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,500
Then I will make a whole table full of her favorite dishes.

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,360
Do you think that's okay?

95
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,340
You, boy, are somewhat responsible.

96
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,760
Go ahead.

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,260
What will you make?

98
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,560
Well... I don't really know how.

99
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,180
That's why I came to learn from you today.

100
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,160
You're learning to cook from me in that outfit?

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,740
It is a bit inappropriate.

102
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,080
By the way, are the roses by the front door from you?

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,280
It's pretty expensive, right?

104
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,240
Are you going to propose to Cheng Cheng?

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm telling you, Cheng Cheng is still young.

106
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,600
I still want to keep her around for a few more years.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,880
It's definitely not a proposal.

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,240
- It's just an apology. 
  - Da Lin!

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,840
Giving her flowers is just part of my apology ritual.

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,960
If it's a proposal, how could it be so simple, right?

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,880
So, I want to ask if you can help put in a few good words for me.

112
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,540
Look into my eyes.

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,580
Is everything you said true?

114
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,980
What should we make then?

115
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,380
Cheng Cheng likes eating sea bass the most.

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,520
Let's make tinfoil-baked sea bass.

117
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,460
No, we can't.

118
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,420
All the sea bass has been reserved for lunch.

119
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,760
The new stock is coming in later this afternoon.

120
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
Why don't we make something else?

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,540
We can't do that.

122
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,480
We have to make Cheng Cheng's most favorite dish.

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll go buy sea bass now. Wait for me.

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
No...

125
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,860
Da Lin, why are you picking at the roses instead of the vegetables?

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,040
It won't be good if Jiang Nan comes back and sees you.

127
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,240
I don't care about him.

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,040
He's all dressed up with all these flowers

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,120
and said he wants to propose.

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,180
A proposal is a good thing.

131
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,820
What's so good about it?

132
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,100
What if Cheng Cheng doesn't think things through and agrees?

133
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,500
- Cheng Cheng. 
 - Da Lin.

134
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,960
What were you talking about?

135
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,640
Cheng Cheng, don't listen to his nonsense.

136
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,380
Just dress up nicely on that day.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,320
Cheng Cheng!

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,200
Look at you. You've ruined the surprise.

139
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,680
You're such a big mouth!

140
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,760
Seems like it's a scare instead of a surprise.

141
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,200
Cheng Cheng isn't willing, right?

142
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
President Wang, I have one final question.

143
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,460
As a famous investor, do you have any advice for young people?

144
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,400
As long as you earnestly work hard...

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,560
 I'll just watch her from a distance and not disturb her.

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,720
 Ke Qin is so charming when she's working.

147
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,640
President Wang, you really are worthy of your title.

148
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,180
I've learned a lot about investment after our interview.

149
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,840
Thank you for taking the time to accept an interview from True Image.

150
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,760
You flatter me, Miss Yu.

151
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,080
This is a small token of my appreciation.

152
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,479
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

153
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,780
Actually, you are your best investment capital.

154
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,220
I'm sure you understand, Miss Yu.

155
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,260
I want to get to know you better.

156
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,380
President Wang, I'm afraid there's a misunderstanding.

157
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,480
I really like simple and pure girls who just graduated from college like you.

158
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,920
Miss Yu...

159
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,260
Who do you take Ke Qin for?

160
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,700
Who are you? Let go!

161
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,480
- You little bastard, you're asking for a beating! 
 - Wang Wei!

162
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Ke Qin, you should sit down.

163
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,720
You simply are so amazing!

164
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,620
I...

165
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,820
I've been fine without you these days.

166
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,680
Why do you cause trouble for me every time you show up?

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,180
Let me ask you, can you win over him in a fight?

168
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,480
Can he win over me?

169
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
Why did you try showing off then?

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
Why do I see you everywhere I go?

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,020
I find it really strange!

172
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
Well, he was putting his hands on you.

173
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,400
How can I just sit and watch?

174
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,840
As a man, how can I watch the woman I love get bullied?

175
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,800
I only did that for you.

176
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,540
Who did I do it for then?

177
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,500
If he didn't beat you up, I wouldn't have kicked him so hard.

178
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,160
So, you did that to save me?

179
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,620
Come to think of it, that kick of yours was really cool!

180
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,100
Honestly, when I think about how I am going to be heavily scolded by your cousin,

181
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,080
I want to kick you too!

182
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,580
Cousin?

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Cousin, this matter wasn't our fault.

184
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
That Wang Wei is a stinky pervert!

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,180
Is what he is saying true?

186
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,040
Even if it was like that, you shouldn't have beaten him so badly that he has to be hospitalized!

187
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
- I... 
 - Yu Ke Qin, don't you know how to reject him?

188
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
A reporter beat up her interviewee so badly that they have to be hospitalized.

189
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,520
Do you want to be in the headlines?

190
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,700
Cousin, I was one the who hit him first.

191
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,000
Just blame me.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,900
Your kick made me lose over 1 million in advertising fees!

193
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,780
What's the use of blaming you?

194
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,180
Sister Shan...

195
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,100
Half of your month's salary will be deducted to cover President Wang's medical expenses!

196
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
Don't let me see the two of you again!

197
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Ke Qin, don't be upset.

198
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,700
My cousin just has a really sharp tongue.

199
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,480
What do you know?

200
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm sad about my salary.

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,220
Qin Shan, how are you managing your subordinates?

202
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,320
I was giving you face by accepting this interview.

203
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,100
And what did you do? Look at me.

204
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,860
Look at this. I'm severely injured by them.

205
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,840
President Wang, your brain was probably damaged by the kick, right?

206
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,340
Don't you remember why you were beaten?

207
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,140
What do you mean?

208
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,660
Let me remind you.

209
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,080
You were beaten up for sexually harassing Yu Ke Qin.

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,960
Qin Shan, let me tell you, you can eat whatever you want

211
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,800
but you can't say whatever you want!

212
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,960
We always have our interviews at the coffee shop.

213
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,820
If you've forgotten, I can get the surveillance footage.

214
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,760
I can promise you that everything will be on there.

215
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,640
During the news release, we'll add screenshots of the footage.

216
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,780
It'll be hard for you not to get all the attention.

217
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,460
I already came up with a headline...

218
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,860
"A Famous Investor Beaten and Hospitalized After Sexually Harassing a Female Journalist."

219
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,300
It's simple and direct.

220
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,360
I just came to warn you.

221
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,960
This matter should end now.

222
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,340

223
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,420
Foolish boy, you were ripped off by the fish merchant.

224
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,960
Fresh fish have a tightly shut mouth and clear eyes.

225
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,160
Look at what you bought.

226
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,880
You can't even pick a good fish.

227
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,660
You are good-looking, but not useful in any way.

228
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,120
That's true for people too.

229
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,880
You are a flower pot. Cheng Cheng won't like you. 
  (T/N: Attractive but with no substance)

230
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
Da Lin, what are you saying?

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,560
Master, I'm telling the truth.

232
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,600
Cheng Cheng won't agree to marry him.

233
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Who said it's a proposal?

234
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
I heard it from the kitchen.

235
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,680
Cheng Cheng came over and left after hearing about the proposal.

236
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,580
Cheng Cheng was just here?

237
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,760
How did Cheng Cheng hear about it?

238
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,060
I...

239
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,520
Da Lin, they are currently dating.

240
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,200
Why are you meddling in their relationship?

241
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,480
Master, I'm doing it to help Cheng Cheng.

242
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
  : Let's meet tonight at 8 in the amusement park.

243
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
 I need to talk with you.

244
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
Uncle, Cheng Cheng just contacted me.

245
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
I have to get ready. I'm off.

246
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,440
Da Lin, you're worse than this fish.

247
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,820
  : Can you do me a favor?

248
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,300
Cheng Cheng, you're here!

249
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,560
Jiang Nan, I've asked you to come here to tell you

250
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,400
not to look for me anymore.

251
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,640
Please, stop bothering Ke Qin and going to the Happy Family Restaurant.

252
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,060
Our relationship was a mistake from the start.

253
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,300
We were forced to be together.

254
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,720
Isn't it nice to just end it peacefully and quietly?

255
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,280
But I can feel that I'm in your heart.

256
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,340
Jiang Nan,

257
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,580
if how I cared about you before caused you to misunderstand, I will apologize for that.

258
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,920
It's not possible for us to be together.

259
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,280
What exactly are you worried about?

260
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,420
Just tell me what's wrong.

261
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,700
We can face and solve it together!

262
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,920
What must I do to make you understand?

263
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,980
I like someone else.

264
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't believe you.

265
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,900
You're doing this on purpose, right?

266
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,380
I don't want to hurt you like this,

267
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,980
but that's the truth.

268
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,100
Do you know what you're talking about?

269
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,160
She already said she doesn't want to see you.

270
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
What does that have to do with you?

271
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,700
You're going to hit me since she doesn't want to see you anymore?

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,100
Xu Duo Cheng, even if you can fool everyone else,

273
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,640
can you fool yourself?

274
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,020
I don't like you!

275
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,520
What must I say to make you understand?

276
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,520
Xu Duo Cheng, I don't believe you!

277
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
All of that is fake!

278
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,700
Do you believe it now?

279
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,680
Thank you for taking me home.

280
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,280
Xu Duo Cheng,

281
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,940
do you think you can act like nothing has happened after kissing me?

282
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,333
Zhan Zhi Lin, thank you for helping me just now,

283
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,600
but I really didn't think you would do that.

284
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,920
Are you really planning to ignore Jiang Nan?

285
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Will you regret it in the future?

286
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,040
You saw what happened tonight.

287
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Jiang Nan and I...

288
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,120
don't have a future.

289
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
All right, then.

290
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,680
You should head up.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll come take you to the hospital tomorrow morning.

292
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,620
No need. I can go myself.

293
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,300
See you at 9 a.m.

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,130

295
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,170

296
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,800
You didn't get any sleep last night?

297
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,980
Where's Orange?

298
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,580
If you ask me, you should try to make up for what you lost in love through your career.

299
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,560
For you, the best medicine is work.

300
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,740
I'm telling you, I already made an appointment with Alex.

301
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,100
We'll go see him this afternoon.

302
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,720
I really think we can take on this project.

303
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,340
It took a lot of effort for me to make an appointment with him.

304
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,600
You must not say you won't go. Let me tell you...

305
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,360
Okay, I'll go.

306
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,540
Are you sure?

307
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,180
I will go the hospital to visit Dou Dou first.

308
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,980
I promised him that I would go.

309
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
I'll call you later today.

310
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,860
Wash your face first.

311
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,310

312
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,220
I'll carry it myself.

313
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,920
Thank you.

314
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,660
Besides saying "thank you" to me,

315
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,760
can't you say anything else?

316
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,580
Actually, you didn't have to come with me.

317
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,860
I'm already used to coming for checkups and getting my prescription.

318
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,060
If you won't be responsible for me, can't I be responsible for you?

319
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,760
Zhan Zhi Lin.

320
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,320
I'm just joking with you.

321
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,960
You take everything I say so seriously.

322
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,040
Where are you going?

323
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,500
Back to Ke Qin's home.

324
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,920
- I can send you. 
 - No need.

325
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,640
If Jiang Nan is waiting downstairs for you,

326
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,320
I can help you out, right?

327
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,820
Let's go.

328
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,600

329
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Dou Dou, this is the book you talked about last time.

330
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,100
I brought it just for you. Do you like it?

331
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,900
Yes, I do. Thank you, Brother Jiang Nan.

332
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,040
By the way, Pudding ate all the dog food you brought.

333
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,860
The one you bought really does taste better.

334
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,260
Pudding? You came up with that name?

335
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,200
- It sounds very nice. 
 - Of course.

336
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,180
Brother Jiang Nan, didn't you say you would come together with Sister Cheng Cheng?

337
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,960
What happened to Sister Cheng Cheng?

338
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,260
She's all right. She has just been a bit busy recently.

339
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,820
Next time... I'll bring her to see you, all right?

340
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,740
Dou Dou, time to take your medicine.

341
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,340
Don't keep bothering your Brother Jiang Nan.

342
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,300
Mom, I don't want to.

343
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
- Be good. 
 - No!

344
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,800
Let me.

345
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,220
Sorry to trouble you.

346
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,820
Just one.

347
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,180
Come on.

348
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,660

349
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,160
I can't use a single one of these ten proposal plans!

350
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,260
They are either idol gossip or rumors about celebrities' illegitimate child.

351
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,620
Please, get it straight.

352
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,360
True Image is a news media,

353
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
not a paparazzi marketing account!

354
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,000
Internet users nowadays like to read this kind of news.

355
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,540
How will we get over 100,000 views if we don't have something shocking?

356
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,180
Is there any validity to these news articles?

357
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,360
How can you publish it without being fully certain?

358
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,380
You didn't even blur out the minors in the photos you took without their knowledge.

359
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,520
You have no professional integrity.

360
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,120
People only read sensational news nowadays.

361
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,360
Besides, I wrote "suspected" on there.

362
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
We won't be held responsible anyway.

363
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,160
Let me reiterate one last time.

364
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,420
If I see these gossip clickbait articles again,

365
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,400
don't ever see me again!

366
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,920
She always lashes out at me!

367
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,880
She just has a position one level higher than me.

368
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
All right, don't be angry.

369
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,680
The company is going through a financial crisis.

370
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,220
It's inevitable that she has a bad temper.

371
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,680
Teacher Alex, you've heard Jiang Nan's new song.

372
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,040
His song is being recieved very well.

373
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,660
It has also generated a high amount of revenue on paid websites.

374
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,740
- Also... 
 - I don't have a lot of time.

375
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,140
- Let's cut to the chase. 
 - Okay.

376
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,240
You should know the first season of the show has gone viral.

377
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
So, for this season, there are plenty of singers who want to come on this show.

378
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
Yes.

379
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,480
Although someone strongly recommended you to me

380
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,520
and I approve of your abilities,

381
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,140
we are looking for other things,

382
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,700
besides your label of competent singer-songwriter

383
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,420
to satisfy the expectations of our audience this time.

384
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,440
You mean...

385
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,040
I heard you have a girlfriend.

386
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,540
She was trending recently,

387
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,940
and she was the female lead in your MV.

388
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,580
Here's the thing, Teacher Alex,

389
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,360
the girl was out of our expectations.

390
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,740
She's not in the entertainment industry, so she doesn't understand how the industry works...

391
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,140
That's all right.

392
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,020
You just need to agree on what kind of status

393
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,000
Jiang Nan's life and relationship will be during the show's broadcast.

394
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,220
That way you can cooperate with our show for promotions.

395
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,860
We can continue negotiations after you settle on that.

396
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,720
- About that... 
 - What do you mean?

397
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,180
It's very simple.

398
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,060
It's just a persona during the show's broadcast.

399
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,140
You can discuss it with your girlfriend.

400
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,040
As a trending singer,

401
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,200
including your previous experience,

402
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,820
you can go very far on this show

403
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,500
and become more popular than before.

404
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
Yes.

405
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,060
I'm sorry.

406
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,440
My personal life isn't a variety show.

407
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,320
There's no need to show everyone my personal life.

408
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,240
I just want to focus on singing.

409
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,720
No matter how good your song is,

410
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,740
- it's useless if no one knows about it. 
 - That's right.

411
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,540
You need to get people's attention before they can notice your songs.

412
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,140
Then I can only say

413
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,740
we have different beliefs.

414
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,340
Sorry for bothering you.

415
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,400
Teacher Alex, please, don't mind him.

416
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,820
Musicians are usually very straightforward.

417
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,080
How about this? I'll go back and convince him.

418
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,460
Let's keep in touch. I'll convince him.

419
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,080
Sorry for the trouble.

420
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,640
Lao Jiang! Lao Jiang!

421
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,700
You are that quick? I thought you would stay in there for a long time.

422
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm already used to you walking off all the time, all right?

423
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,180
Why would I stay there and get scolded for you?

424
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,180
Brother Rui, I'm sorry.

425
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,440
I was a bit too headstrong in the past.

426
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,780
What's wrong with you today? Did you take some wrong medicine or is it because of Orange?

427
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,980
I think you two need to calm down first.

428
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,320
Talk to her after some time, right?

429
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,220
She's just trying to hide from me now.

430
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,340
Then we can focus on your career.

431
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,960
Actually, what Alex said makes sense.

432
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,380
We can release our songs first, right? After...

433
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,660
We'll talk later. I need to get going.

434
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,920
I knew it.

435
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Lao Jiang, listen to my advice.

436
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,860
It's the perfect time to release a few new songs.

437
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,540
I'm not in the mood to think about that now.

438
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,401
You should make up for what you lost in love through your career.

439
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,300
Make-up person, I'm about to shoot my scene.

440
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,240
Come touch up my makeup first.

441
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,720
Please, wait for a moment, Teacher Gu.

442
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,520
I'll be done soon.

443
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,180
Is her scene more important than mine?

444
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,080
I'm sorry, Teacher Gu.

445
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,660
They changed the call sheet at the last minute.

446
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,760
Sister, I can help you.

447
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,800
By the way, Jiang Nan is meeting with Alex today.

448
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,007
Although I already talked to him in advance,

449
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,447
it's hard to say with Jiang Nan's temper.

450
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:55,760
Go and see if you can get any news about it.

451
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,520
Xiao Fu.

452
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,820
You're here, President Liang.

453
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,020
How is it? Is everything going well?

454
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,620
Yes, it's been going well.

455
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,000
These are your favorite flowers.

456
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,700
It's for you.

457
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,940
Thank you, President Liang.

458
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,700
Thank you, President Liang.

459
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Go and film then.

460
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,260
- You can do it. 
 - Bye-bye!

461
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,060
I heard President Liang gave her a role by investing in this show.

462
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,020
I was wondering who you were.

463
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,280
Turns out President Liang arranged for you to be here.

464
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,960
But when it comes to acting,

465
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,380
the camera doesn't care about who you are.

466
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,440
Of course, the older ginger is spicier than the younger one.

467
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,860
I'm still young.

468
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:10,100
Please, give me acting advice in the future, Sister Jia Yi.

469
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,240
All right, I'll see you when acting.

470
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,960
 Jia Cheng, let's have lunch together later.

471
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,360
 All right.

472
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,340
 Isn't that my senior?

473
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,660
Senior,

474
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,640
I can't believe I won the Best TV Host award this time.

475
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,320
Senior, you have to host the late-night news now.

476
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,140
I'm really sorry.

477
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,220
Congratulations.

478
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Senior, don't worry.

479
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,940
I will do a good job in your place

480
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,840
and work with Jia Cheng.

481
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,340
Jia Cheng!

482
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,880
I once thought you and reporting the truth were everything I had,

483
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,620
but I don't know when we started

484
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,780
to take two entirely different paths in life.

485
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,860
 Inside here are my feelings,

486
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,840
 my youth, and my dreams.

487
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm giving it back to you now.

488
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,640
Xiao Shi, let me explain. I...

489
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,300
I will always remember the beautiful memories we once had.

490
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,840
Good. Pass!

491
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,080
Jia Yi.

492
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,960
Director.

493
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
You did great today!

494
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,740
Thank you, Director.

495
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,920
- It was very good. 
 - Director!

496
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,540
Xiao Fu, look at you.

497
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,460
Jia Yi was very in character,

498
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,160
but what about you?

499
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,960
You acted the last scene very well.

500
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,740
Did you bring in your feelings from our relationship?

501
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,980
You're overthinking it.

502
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,040
That's just professionalism.

503
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,240
You can make anyone you want popular,

504
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,360
there's no need to purposefully do it in front of me.

505
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,640
Are you jealous?

506
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,240
As long as you'll do what I say,

507
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,800
you'll always be the best actress in my heart.

508
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
But in my heart, you're even a nominee.

509
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,100
My best actor is coming back to me soon.

510
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,200
But Jiang Nan and Xu Duo Cheng...

511
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,946
I already told you,

512
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:02,600
Xu Duo Cheng is no match for me.

513
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:05,183
Jiang Nan only belongs to me.

514
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,620
- Jia Yi. 
 - Sister Jia Yi,

515
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,493
I've heard back from Alex.

516
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:26,740
His assistant said their negotiation with Jiang Nan fell through.

517
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,860
He didn't tell me the specific reason.

518
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,360
I understand.

519
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,320
 Jiang Nan.

520
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,840
I understand. All right.

521
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,480
President Liang, I've asked about True Image.

522
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,480
They are in a financial crisis and are considering a transfer of shares.

523
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
Keep an eye on them.

524
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,480
Buy the shares for a good price.

525
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,980
We're not in the media business. Why would we buy those shares?

526
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,040
Why do you think I've been keeping Qi Qi around?

527
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,140
What I value is the impact that True Image has.

528
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,360
I know we will need it sooner or later.

529
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,220
Train an army for a thousand days. 
  (T/N: Extensive preparation eventually pays off)

530
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,160
I'll contact her later.

531
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:14,360
By the way, make an appointment with Alex for me.

532
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,040
Tell him that I want to talk about an investment.

533
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,080
- Yes. 
 - Go on.

534
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,239
 Can you lend me some tissues?

535
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,880
 How about this?

536
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,140
 I'll trade with this ticket.

537
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,960
 This is a ticket to see Jiang Nan.

538
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,420
 At the very least, it's worth a pack of tissues.

539
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,400
- Hello, Auntie. 
 - Let me tell you,

540
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,639
I found an earring when I was cleaning the living room.

541
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,480
 Is it Cheng Cheng's?

542
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,860
Auntie, you scared me.

543
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,920
I thought something happened to my mom.

544
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,960
She's all right. Cai Yun is doing great.

545
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,420
Don't worry.

546
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,900
Thank you, Auntie. You have worked hard.

547
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,180
Don't mention it.

548
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,240
Why are you being so polite with me?

549
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,540
 I won't keep disturbing you. I'll send you a picture of the earring.

550
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,600
 What are you doing here?

551
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,360
 I lost my earring. I'm looking for it.

552
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,440
 Can you stay by my side forever?

553
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,120
 Is that okay?

554
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,600
She does like me.

555
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,620
Auntie, that's Cheng Cheng's earring.

556
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,460
I'll ask Xiao Du to pick it up.

557
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,060
 Okay. I'll wait at home.

558
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,760
Xu Duo Cheng, we have to do an impromptu performance again.

559
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,760
Hurry and turn around.

560
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,040
Turn around?

561
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,080
Where are we going?

562
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,460
Anywhere is fine.

563
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,600
I can't see him again.

564
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,100
I'll take you to a place then.

565
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,600
 Zhan Zhi Lin's car?

566
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,430

567
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,960

568
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,230

569
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,050

570
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,560
You can sleep if you are tired.

571
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,360
The place is quite far.

572
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,440
Thank you.

573
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,740
I've caused trouble for you again.

574
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,400
Xu Duo Cheng,

575
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,080
if you really want to thank me,

576
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,980
don't always say "thank you" or "sorry" to me all the time, all right?

577
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:26,920

578
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:38,669
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

579
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:45,083
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

580
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:52,980
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

581
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:58,667
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

582
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:02,413
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

583
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:06,393
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

584
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:12,846
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

585
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:16,206
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

586
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:18,079
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

587
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,379
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

588
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:23,393
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

589
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:27,181
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

590
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:30,498
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

591
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:34,466
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

592
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:38,852
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

593
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:41,501
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

594
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:44,892
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

595
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:49,026
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

596
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:52,060
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

597
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,859
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

598
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:59,202
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

599
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:03,264
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

600
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:07,479
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

601
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:14,127
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

602
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:31,880
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«
