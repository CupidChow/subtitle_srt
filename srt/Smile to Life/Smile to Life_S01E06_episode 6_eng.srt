00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,827
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,867
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:19,167
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:24,442
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:30,300
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,114
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:35,519
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,901
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,700
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,414
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:48,401
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,128
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,841
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,588
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,755
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,470
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,811
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:10,658
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,512
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,146
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:18,353
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:21,166
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:25,725
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:31,644
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:45,205
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,073

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,900
Xu Duo Cheng, you promised me you wouldn't tell anyone about that.

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,080
If you dare to tell anyone, just wait...

30
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:31,054
Lao Jiang, why are you still playing around?

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,160
I asked you to buy nutrition supplements. That's all you bought?

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,740
What's wrong with your eyes?

33
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,800
These supplements can last a year. Are you eating them as meals?

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,620
Xu Duo Cheng values her health.

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,280
She might just eat them as meals.

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,920
What are you looking at?

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm picking an outfit for you.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,980
Picking an outfit? You don't have anything to wear?

39
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,340
It's for you when you go meet her parents.

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,180
I'm telling you, they all like to see men who look prudent and dignified.

41
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,240
Your fashion sense doesn't work with them.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,020
This is your first time meeting. You must take it seriously.

43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,560
Aren't you single?

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,060
Why do you have so much experience?

45
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,420
You sound so logical.

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,560
Let me tell you, I'm really good at things like this.

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,280
First of all, think about it, all parents want to have a son-in-law

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
who's well-matched and has a steady job, right?

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,080
They want him to be good to their daughter,

50
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,720
has a nice personality, and not be fickle in love.

51
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
But think about it yourself,

52
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,060
you have a dismal job

53
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,900
and you're not gentle to girls.

54
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,960
Although you're not fickle, your temper is...

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,420
Brother Rui, are you serious?

56
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,780
Am I really that bad?

57
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm not that serious.

58
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,900
However, it's still up to you on how you present yourself.

59
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,360
You have to get her parents' approval first.

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,920
How would you do that?

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,980
First of all, go in this outfit.

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,140
Secondly, I'll tell you a few tricks.

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,080
Just keep complimenting her mom

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,020
and make her seem out of this world.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,060
As the old saying goes, the more a mother-in-law looks at her son-in-law, the more she likes him.

66
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,760
Continue.

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,700
Do not lose your pride!

68
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,640
All right, I got it.

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
- I'm telling you... 
 - I know, I know.

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,360
- You have to take the first visit very seriously. 
 - Got it. Bye.

71
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,480
 Unstable job and bad temper... Am I that bad?

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,900
What's next on the schedule?

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,940
That's it.

74
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,180
Don't we have an ad to shoot?

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,640
That was canceled.

76
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,980
Canceled? When did that happen?

77
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,280
They just notified us.

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,660
They said they are using a new talent from the company instead.

79
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,740
Besides, it's President Liang's idea.

80
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:57,723
Hello? You're finally calling me now?

81
00:04:57,723 --> 00:05:01,000
Why? You're angry, President Liang?

82
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,140
If I'm angry, it won't be just an ad, you know?

83
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,820
Seems like Boss Liang is trying to cut off my livelihood?

84
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm begging you...

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
Is Ms. Gu begging me now?

86
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm begging you to go take a look online.

87
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,326
I've been busy for so long.

88
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:25,680
It's time to give myself a vacation to enjoy my life and romance.

89
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,045
 Giving myself a break and rest for a while.

90
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,080
 You can go with whoever you want.

91
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,980
 I'm not going anyway.

92
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,560
 How will I explain it to Mom and Dad?

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,980
Cheng Cheng, your boyfriend is here.

94
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,180
The mood seems to be a bit off.

95
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,980
My boyfriend?

96
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,300
How old are you?

97
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm 27, Uncle.

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
- What's your year of birth? 
 - The year of Chicken.

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,900
- What's your blood type? 
 - Type O.

100
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,400
- What's your horoscope? 
 - Virgo.

101
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
How many relationships were you in?

102
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,364
Just... Just once when I was in college.

103
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:56,933
What did I tell you?

104
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,940
They all say just once. No one says twice.

105
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,820
He's so fake. Do you believe that?

106
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,480
That's enough. Go prepare the dishes.

107
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:24,480
What do you like about Cheng Cheng?

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,442
I like Cheng Cheng's passion for helping others,

109
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:30,220
her warmheartedness, kindness,

110
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,640
and not asking for anything in return.

111
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,900
Yes, that's right.

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,120
We've been teaching her to do that.

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
What's the most important thing for a person?

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,840
You must be kind and tolerant,

115
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,600
and help others without wanting anything in return.

116
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,500
Our daughter is very pure.

117
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,900
Are you saying it or am I?

118
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,170
Go ahead.

119
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,240
That's too phony.

120
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,360
Jiang Nan, you have more social experience than her.

121
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,688
Unlike Cheng Cheng, who's in a relationship for the first time.

122
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:08,420
She's still a baby when it comes to a romantic relationship.

123
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,980
We only have one darling daughter.

124
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,360
We don't want her to suffer at all.

125
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,920
Don't worry about that, Uncle and Auntie.

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,420
I will surely take good care of Cheng Cheng.

127
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,860
How will you guarantee that?

128
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,460
That's right.

129
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:38,160
Our specialty appetizer, Glib Tongue.

130
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Our griddle specialty,

131
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,159
Philandering Stir Fry.

132
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,040
Our specialty hot dish, Big Pig Trotters. 
  (T/N: A metaphor for "sc*mbag")

133
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,162
Our nutritious supplementary dish,

134
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:53,420
Tortoise Soup. 
  (T/N: A metaphor for "b*stard")

135
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,620
I'll let you try my specialty dish.

136
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,700
Heart, Liver, Spleen, and Lung.

137
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,700
Tell us, how can you guarantee that?

138
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,300
 - Really? 
 - Of course.

139
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,920
Auntie, if you didn't say otherwise, I really thought you were a dancer.

140
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm just an accountant.

141
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,560
- Come on, Auntie. 
 - Come on, let's drink.

142
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,460
Let's drink!

143
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,080
Uncle.

144
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:49,442
â™«  I want to accompany you until the end of the dream  â™«

145
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:53,548
â™«  Piecing together our tacit agreements  â™«

146
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:57,765
â™«  Until the mottled world becomes transparent  â™«

147
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:01,933
â™«  Pure as a dreamscape  â™«

148
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:12,360
 How nice would it be if this were all true?

149
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,340
Comrade, can you keep control of your smile?

150
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,500
How did it go? Was my trick really useful?

151
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,160
I saw Father and Mother Xu smiling with their eyes when they walked you out.

152
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,100
- Not bad. 
 - I think I got their approval.

153
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,660
But let me tell you,

154
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,500
Xu Duo Cheng's parents aren't what I expected.

155
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,580
How so?

156
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,660
Judging by what you're saying,

157
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,940
you seem to like Xu Duo Cheng and her family very much.

158
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,980
Why do you say that?

159
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,880
Because I haven't seen you smile so happily in a long time.

160
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,140
You haven't stopped smiling since you got in the car.

161
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,380
It's good.

162
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,140
I'm just tipsy.

163
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,560
It's normal after I drink.

164
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,140
I'm exercising my facial muscles.

165
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,120
All right, then. Keep being tipsy.

166
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,327
Just focus on driving.

167
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,980
 Life is like a box of chocolates indeed.

168
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,252
 You never know what you're going to get.

169
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:26,380
â™«  Until the mottled world becomes transparent  â™«

170
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,615
â™«  Pure as a dreamscape  â™«

171
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:32,890
â™«  I want to accompany you until the end of the dream  â™«

172
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,027
â™«  Touching those new sceneries  â™«

173
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:41,114
â™«  Until the noise fades to silence  â™«

174
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:45,977
â™«  Talk to me, I will listen carefully  â™«

175
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,780
 I did pretty well today, right?

176
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,720
 Can you go with me to the nursing home to visit my mom tomorrow?

177
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,380
 Sure.

178
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,440
 I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.

179
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,760
Let's go.

180
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,800
Slow down.

181
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,180
I'm sorry. Don't be afraid. It won't bite.

182
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,760
It's all right. I'm not afraid of dogs.

183
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,900
That's strange.

184
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
He's normally really scared to see strangers.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,700
I don't know why he's so excited to see you.

186
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,240
Maybe your dog just really likes me.

187
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,420
I like dogs too. What's his name?

188
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,080
His name is Prada. He's actually not my dog.

189
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm from Sweetheart Pet Shop.

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,020
His owner is pretty busy normally,

191
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,660
so we've been fostering him.

192
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,100
I don't really have time for him normally.

193
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,800
He's quite pitiful.

194
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,520
He's not your dog?

195
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,585
I know your pet store. It's right by my place.

196
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,420
This kind of dog really needs a lot of exercise.

197
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,940
I have a habit of jogging in the morning. You can leave me a phone number later.

198
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,283
I'll take him with me when I go jogging in the morning.

199
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,665
Well, thank you very much.

200
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:53,630
Prada, I will be your foster daddy from now on, okay?

201
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,020
Brother Rui!

202
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:57,980
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

203
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Come on, let's go.

204
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,180
Why are you here?

205
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,200
I always jog around here.

206
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,670
Really? Actresses are so devoted these days. They jog for at least 10 km?

207
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,100
Brother Rui, you like dogs too?

208
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,900
What a coincidence. So do I.

209
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,560
Since it's such a coincidence, let's have coffee together.

210
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,685
Sure. Otherwise, you would've come for nothing, right? Let's go.

211
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,460
You didn't just come to see me so early in the morning for coffee, right?

212
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,570
I broke up with Liang Zhe.

213
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,220
I know. That happened a while ago, right?

214
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,240
But, I really don't know whether I should congratulate you or comfort you.

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,660
Brother Rui, stop making fun of me.

216
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,080
Did you come to see me because of Jiang Nan?

217
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,800
I want to ask you to help me convince Jiang Nan to stop making a fuss.

218
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,560
Actually, I can tell that he still cares about me.

219
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,945
He's only doing these things to make me jealous.

220
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,560
Girl, I think your train of thought is quite particular.

221
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,740
Why would you think your ex-boyfriend still has feelings for you after you broke up?

222
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,020
It was my fault for what happened before,

223
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,780
but I'm all grown up now.

224
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,980
Besides, I know Jiang Nan takes you as his own brother.

225
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,960
That's true.

226
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,520
So, if you're willing to mediate between us, he will certainly come back to me.

227
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,140
Let me tell you, you've really overestimated me on that issue.

228
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,140
I'm just a single man who knows nothing about love now.

229
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,285
Besides, you know he has a girlfriend now, don't you?

230
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:34,260
You know her too. They are having a nice time together.

231
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,340
Brother Rui, let me tell you,

232
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,800
you cannot be fooled by the innocent and sweet faÃ§ade of that girl.

233
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,140
She's a master manipulator.

234
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,582
Jia Yi, we've known each other for a long time.

235
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:54,226
I must give you a piece of advice.

236
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,040
You can earn more money if you're broke.

237
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,415
You can do plastic surgery if you're not pretty.

238
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:04,420
But if you're mean-spirited, nothing can cure that.

239
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,260
I'll give you one more piece of advice.

240
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,740
You should let go when it's time to let go.

241
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,580
There are other fish in the sea.

242
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,085
Why must you force yourself and put everyone in an awkward position?

243
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,960
But why should I let go? He was mine from the start.

244
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,660
At the time, Jiang Nan was having a difficult time,

245
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,060
but I was only a nobody in the entertainment business.

246
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,620
What could I do for him?

247
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,320
If I didn't take that step, we would still be at a dead end now.

248
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,020
But look at the situation now.

249
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,880
I have resources. I can help him now.

250
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,660
Why can't we get back together?

251
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,880
Anyway, I won't give up on Jiang Nan.

252
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,300
Besides, I must let him know who loves him the most.

253
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,813
Go in first. I'll go park the car.

254
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,413
Okay.

255
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,320
Xu Duo Cheng.

256
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,880
You look very pretty today.

257
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:29,834
What are these?

258
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:33,020
This is the acrylic nail polish I told you about.

259
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,860
This is a UV manicure machine.

260
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,620
After I use this on you, your nails will look just like mine.

261
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,540
It won't fade even if I wash my hands?

262
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,311
Of course not.

263
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:46,600
Look, what color do you like?

264
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,313
I like all of them.

265
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:53,700
If you like all of them, I'll do multi-colored nails for you.

266
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,980
Choose this first.

267
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,700
Cai Yun, are you doing your nails?

268
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
Does it look nice?

269
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,273
Yes.

270
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,601
I haven't heard you play piano in a long time.

271
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,389
Can you play a song for me?

272
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,760
Sure. What do you want to hear?

273
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,521
I want to hear you play "Island".

274
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,840
Listen to Cheng Cheng.

275
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,585
I didn't expect to see a celebrity up close.

276
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:24,860
I always thought celebrities are all arrogant and aloof.

277
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,060
- I didn't expect him to be so approachable. 
 - That's right.

278
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,340
You just met him once.

279
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,180
You just met him once and you're already siding with him.

280
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,677
What are you thinking?

281
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:35,740
- Enough. 
 - Stop wasting time.

282
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,580
- Sister-in-law. 
 - You haven't finished yet?

283
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,940
All right, come on.

284
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,060
You didn't bring the scallions either.

285
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,840
Sister-in-law, I have to congratulate you this time.

286
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,780
Your son-in-law seems pretty nice.

287
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,580
Doesn't he?

288
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,320
That Jiang Nan is polite and talented.

289
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,500
I'm really happy with him.

290
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,480
- Teacher's Wife. 
 - What?

291
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,100
Don't be too happy.

292
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,880
Didn't Jiang Nan say he only had one ex-girlfriend during dinner last night?

293
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,540
She's that superstar Gu Jia Yi.

294
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,680
Gu Jia Yi still wants to get back together with Jiang Nan.

295
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,140
Don't make things up.

296
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,760
I'm not making it up. It's all over the internet.

297
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,420
I'm not the only onlooker.

298
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,480
Teacher's Wife, here.

299
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,180
Thank you for today.

300
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,660
I haven't seen my mom this happy in a long time.

301
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,020
I'll think about other fun things to do next time.

302
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,660

303
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,655
Why would my mom call you?

304
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,855
We'll know when we pick it up.

305
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,880
- Auntie. 
  - Hello, Jiang Nan.

306
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,820
 Do you have time to come to Happy Family today?

307
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,580
Mom, didn't you just see him yesterday?

308
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,180
Jiang Nan is really busy.

309
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,280
He can't come to see you every day.

310
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,520
Just come as we ask!

311
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,540
So what if you just fell in love? I'm not important enough to invite you?

312
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,600
Uncle, I didn't...

313
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,780
What are you doing? Why can't you speak nicely?

314
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,800
Don't scare such a nice son-in-law away.

315
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,260
Stop, we won't know if he's a good son-in-law for a long while.

316
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,340

317
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,920
Dad, Mom, why did you suddenly ask to see Jiang Nan?

318
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,340
It's nothing serious.

319
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,220
It's about dinner time, right?

320
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,780
We just don't want you to eat take-out.

321
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,140
That's why we've asked you to have dinner at the restaurant.

322
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,930
Taste it. Come on, eat it.

323
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,630
Thank you, Auntie.

324
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,800
Jiang Nan, you and Cheng Cheng haven't been in a relationship very long,

325
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,980
which means it's still the honeymoon period.

326
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,120
But as time goes by,

327
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,960
you'll discover each other's shortcomings and bad habits.

328
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,245
After that, you'll have small conflicts.

329
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,500
Should that day ever come,

330
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,820
I hope you can bear with Cheng Cheng and be more tolerant of her.

331
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,660
She's our only child.

332
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,800
We've been spoiling her a bit too much.

333
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,300
Auntie and Uncle, please be reassured.

334
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,320
I will certainly get along with Cheng Cheng.

335
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
Okay, okay.

336
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,660
The topic is getting a bit heavy.

337
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:18,860
Jiang Nan, you've already met me, right?

338
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,220
Back in the day, I was handsome and stylish in my prime too.

339
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,880
They gave me the nickname Smooth Womanizer.

340
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,720
The girls who pursued me could line up from here

341
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,440
to turn past the red light up ahead!

342
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,220
However, ever since I met your auntie,

343
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,340
I declined all of those girls and stopped contacting them!

344
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,300
What about Xiao Li?

345
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,620
What Xiao Li?

346
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,440
How many times did I tell you? She was just the neighbor.

347
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,800
There's nothing between us. Why do you keep mentioning Xiao Li all the time?

348
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,655
I'm just kidding. Why are you taking it seriously?

349
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,000
- I'm just kidding. 
 - Kidding about what? 
 - Look.

350
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,680
- How can you kid about that? 
 - He just got angry like that.

351
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,040
My goodness.

352
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,140
It's my fault.

353
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
This is a matter of principle.

354
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,440
Who would you save if Gu Jia Yi and Cheng Cheng fell into a lake?

355
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,040
Who would you save?

356
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,460
Dad.

357
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,820
Auntie, Uncle, I now know why you asked to see me today.

358
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,220
Don't worry.

359
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,857
Gu Jia Yi and I broke up a long time ago.

360
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm with Cheng Cheng now.

361
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,700
I will surely be loyal to Cheng Cheng.

362
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:22,994
It's a matter of principle.

363
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,580
- Let's eat! 
 - Come on, let's eat.

364
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,380
 They seem to forget they are only a couple in name.

365
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,480
 At this moment, they are the closest family

366
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,760
 during each exchange of small household affairs

367
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,020
 and every clink of their glasses.

368
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,360
Sorry to put you through that.

369
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,160
My parents aren't usually like this.

370
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,520
It's okay. I think they are pretty adorable.

371
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,040
I can tell they have a great relationship.

372
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,260
They are only like this because they care too much about me.

373
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,100
Where are you planning to go next?

374
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,440
I...

375
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,820
Hello? It's okay. Go ahead.

376
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,520
Is it serious?

377
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,680
Okay, got it.

378
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,760
What's wrong?

379
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,885
A friend of mine is in the hospital.

380
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,740
Can you take me to the Costal Hospital?

381
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,040
Sure.

382
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,273
Sister Cheng Cheng, you're here.

383
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,720
How did this happen? Does it hurt?

384
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,000
No.

385
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,180
I fell when I played with my friends

386
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,060
while I was pushing the walker.

387
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,600
The doctor said I need to stay here for a few days.

388
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,825
When you're discharged from the hospital,

389
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,985
I'll take you to the theme park.

390
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:31,720
Really?

391
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,380
The doctor said I can't use the walker anymore.

392
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,100
I can't use my legs anymore.

393
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,600
I have to sit in a wheelchair,

394
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,500
but the doctor said there are wheels on the wheelchair like a car.

395
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,720
It'll be faster than walking.

396
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,780
That way, we can go to places that are further away.

397
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,000
I also want to go to the aquarium and the Museum of Science and Technology.

398
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,440
I'll take you to wherever you want to go.

399
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,400
Let's pinky swear.

400
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,580
Pinky swear.

401
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,660
Sister Cheng Cheng, who's this brother?

402
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,440
- He's my... 
 - Is he your boyfriend?

403
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,840
Dou Dou.

404
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,380
Sister Cheng Cheng, come here.

405
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,040
If he makes you upset, just tell me.

406
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,560
I'll grow up soon.

407
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,660
I'll protect you when I grow up.

408
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,960
Okay.

409
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,880
You little brat.

410
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,400
Hey, little kid, how old are you?

411
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,260
I'm older than you!

412
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,240
I saw Dou Dou's condition on the website of the ALS Association a while ago.

413
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,540
He was still able to walk at the time,

414
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,420
only with a bit of a limp.

415
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,820
He's really vivacious.

416
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,520
He's still very optimistic after learning about his condition.

417
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,500
He told me he wanted to raise a puppy the last time I visited him.

418
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,480
However, he knows his mom already works hard to take care of him every day,

419
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,000
so he didn't make that request.

420
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,577
ALS is such a terrible disease.

421
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,080
Don't be too upset.

422
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,580
The only thing we can do is to make him happy in the limited time of his life.

423
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,680
It's getting late.

424
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,820
Don't you have to prepare for your public announcement tomorrow?

425
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,200
You should go home first.

426
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,229
I'll go ask the doctor about Dou Dou's condition.

427
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,520
Well, go home earlier tonight.

428
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,284
You're really not planning to tell your family?

429
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,304
Your medical bills are Â¥4,000 per month.

430
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:05,140
Besides, if your condition worsens,

431
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,840
it will surely affect your normal life.

432
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,380
It's too difficult for you to handle that amount of pressure.

433
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,240
Thank you, Doctor Sui.

434
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,220
I don't plan on telling them.

435
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,280
I really don't want them to worry about me.

436
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,680
You can't hide it forever.

437
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,320
 That's right.

438
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,516
 I'm an ALS patient just like Dou Dou.

439
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,280
 Sooner or later I will experience the pain and torture

440
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,040
 that Dou Dou is suffering.

441
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,820
 Xu Duo Cheng?

443
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,700
Doctor Sui, you're attending to numerous important matters every day.

444
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,000
Director Zhan, you have more of an imposing manner each time.

445
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,280
What kind of high-end equipment did you bring us this time?

446
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,898
The equipment is certainly the most high-end and advanced.

447
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:14,880
There's no excuse for you not to order a number of them given our relationship.

448
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,000
Why?

449
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,240
Did your dad downgrade you to the primary level and gave you a sales quota to meet?

450
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,340
You know me very well.

451
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,720
By the way, Doctor Sui, that girl who just left is your patient too?

452
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,960
Yes.

453
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,080
What do you mean by that?

454
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,640
I'm telling you, don't get any bad ideas.

455
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,140
I'm just asking.

456
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,820
Doctor Sui, the patient from Bed No.8 asked to see you.

457
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,960
Tell him I'll be right there.

458
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,300
- Okay. 
 - Wait right here for me.

459
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,700
Let's have lunch at the cafeteria downstairs later.

460
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:55,170

461
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,960
 Xu Duo Cheng, ALS...

462
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,540
 Hello, Uncle.

463
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,140
Jiang Nan, is Cheng Cheng with you?

464
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,720
Uncle, she's not with me.

465
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,800
She's not home yet?

466
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,300
No. I can't get through to her either.

467
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,140
We just can't stop worrying about her.

468
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,540
 Uncle, don't be anxious.

469
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
 We visited Cheng Cheng's friend at the hospital this afternoon.

470
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,100
 She's probably still at the hospital.

471
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,580
I'll go take a look at the hospital now.

472
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,000
 - Don't worry.  
 - Okay, okay.

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,640
Thank you for the trouble.

474
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,040
Why are you here?

475
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,760
I just happened to come to handle some affairs at the hospital.

476
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,940
I saw you come out of Doctor Sui's office.

477
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,040
A young friend of mine is sick.

478
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,820
I went to ask Doctor Sui about his situation.

479
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:22,918
But I saw "Xu Duo Cheng" written on there.

480
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:30,789
Why did you peek at someone's diagnosis?

481
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:32,984
I apologize.

482
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,300
- I'm sorry. 
 - What's the point of apologizing?

483
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,800
Don't cry.

484
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,540
I'm not crying.

485
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,120
I just don't understand.

486
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,040
I can eat two bowls of rice per meal.

487
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,380
Even my dad thinks I eat a lot.

488
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,940
I always came in first

489
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,842
for the 1,000-meter course at the school's sports meet.

490
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:56,840
No one could run faster than me.

491
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,200
I was the best at playing the piano in my class.

492
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,980
I just graduated from college.

493
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,820
My future has just begun!

494
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,919
 Xu Duo Cheng and Zhan Zhi Lin?

495
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,120
 No wonder she asked me to leave first.

496
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
I'm sorry.

497
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,140
When did you find out?

498
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,920
Three months ago.

499
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,220
Well...

500
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,680
You don't have to come up with words to comfort me.

501
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,620
I've actually already accepted it.

502
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:58,320
If my parents can calmly accept the fact that I'm leaving,

503
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,000
I think I will feel better.

504
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,840
You didn't tell them?

505
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,060
What about Jiang Nan?

506
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,080
I don't plan on telling them,

507
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,880
so can you keep this secret for me?

508
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,720
Okay.

509
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,900
There's a condition for me to keep this secret.

510
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,316
Come with me.

511
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,356
What do you mean?

512
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:26,520
I'm hungry.

513
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,200
Let's have dinner together.

514
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,180
 What day is that? Friday.

515
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,305
Okay.

516
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:33,520
Friday. How about this?

517
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,080
Tell me the exact time later, okay?

518
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,785
Okay. Bye.

519
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,800
Lao Jiang, let me tell you, we are obviously getting more phone calls since last time's event.

520
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:52,165
Huachen Beauty, what a great chance.

521
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:56,040
Can you be more enthusiastic and happy?

522
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,460
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

523
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,160
Tired again?

524
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,860
What's going on?

525
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,340
Is our steel tree finally blooming? 
  (T/N: Is he finally falling in love?)

526
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:24,229
Thank you for today.

527
00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:30,020
Thank you for listening to me, I've been carrying this in my heart for a long time.

528
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,880
Now that I finally said it, I feel much better.

529
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,140
It's so late and you're still not home.

530
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,660
Your family must be worried about you.

531
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,160
That's right.

532
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:45,320
My phone is out of power.

533
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,405
I'm the only one in the world who knows about your condition,

534
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:51,960
so if you're not happy about anything,

535
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,680
just call me.

536
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,520
Go home.

537
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,920
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

538
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,400
You're home?

539
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,740
- Why did you come home so late?  
 - Yes, why did you come home so late?

540
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,440
Why did you stay in the hospital for so long?

541
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,500
My friend is in the hospital. I stayed a little longer with him.

542
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,437
What's going on with you lately? You don't answer your phone or return our messages.

543
00:33:32,437 --> 00:33:35,860
- What do you want to do? 
 - My phone is out of power.

544
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,660
- Your phone is out of power? It's good that she's back. That's enough. 
 - Listen to her.

545
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,260
Go in and get some rest.

546
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,500
Well, Mom and Dad, I'm going to take a shower.

547
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,860
That little brat.

548
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:57,750
â™«  I dreamt of sailing alone  â™«

549
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,090
â™«  Every day and night, under the starry sky  â™«

550
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,216
â™«  I dream of drifting in the vast ocean alone  â™«

551
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:10,713
â™«  My eyes become bloodshot and my lips are parched; I can see your reflection  â™«

552
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:16,436
 Sorry, the subscriber you've called is not available. Please, dial again later.

553
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:22,625
Sorry, my phone was out of power. I'm home now.

554
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,810
â™«  Stormy waves rush against the shore, the ocean encircles me  â™«

555
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:32,099
 Sorry, my phone was out of power. I'm home now.

556
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:35,721
â™«  Covered by flowers and its fragrance  â™«

557
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:39,485
 That silly girl, can't she tell that Zhan Zhi Lin is just playing with her feelings?

558
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,679
 How could she throw herself on him?

559
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:53,904
â™«  I see an island, I sail toward you  â™«

560
00:34:53,904 --> 00:35:02,384
â™«  I see an island, I swim toward you  â™«

561
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:09,795
â™«  I run to you; I see you  â™«

562
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,420

563
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,830

564
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:29,318
 The day I found out about my condition,

565
00:35:29,318 --> 00:35:31,811
 I felt like the sky had fallen.

566
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,040
 I received a death notice

567
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,160
 before I even graduated from college.

568
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,780
 At the time, I wished it was just a dream

569
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,931
 every time I opened my eyes in the morning,

570
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,800
 but reality gave me a good slap in the face.

571
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:55,390
 Now, I've come around to the idea.

572
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,970
 Since I can't change anything,

573
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,480
 I'll just cherish every day and do things I want to do in the future.

574
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,380
 Do you really think so?

575
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,580
 What else can I do?

576
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,560
 Maybe, misery is a necessary experience in life.

577
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,560
 Actually, come to think of it, it's nice that you think this way.

578
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,020
 At least you don't have to worry about your savings,

579
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,460
 educating your children in the future,

580
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,300
 getting old someday, or watching your loved ones

581
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,860
 leave you one after another.

582
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,720
 You have a unique way of comforting someone.

583
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,020
 Actually, it's not bad to be the one who leaves early.

584
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,080
 At least you don't have to bear

585
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,660
 with the pain of being abandoned.

586
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,080
 Mom, I really don't understand

587
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,245
 why you chose to abandon me and commited suicide,

588
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:15,180
 while that girl is still so young and she's still trying her best to survive.

589
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,600
 He hasn't returned my messages.

590
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,800
 What's going on?

591
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,361
 What's wrong with Jiang Nan?

592
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,761
 He hung up on me?

593
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,060

594
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,820
 Have another drink with me.

595
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,180
 Just one drink.

596
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:16,000

597
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:26,809
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

598
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:33,523
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

599
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:41,220
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

600
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,807
â™«  You shine a light to all my lonliness  â™«

601
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:50,453
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

602
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:54,533
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

603
00:39:54,533 --> 00:40:00,786
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

604
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:04,341
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

605
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:06,140
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

606
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,419
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

607
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:11,550
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

608
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,330
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

609
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:18,660
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

610
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,738
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

611
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:26,892
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

612
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,641
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

613
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:32,923
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

614
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:37,157
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

615
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:40,180
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

616
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,990
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

617
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,333
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

618
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,395
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

619
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:55,610
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

620
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:02,358
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

621
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:19,811
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«
