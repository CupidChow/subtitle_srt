28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,180
Where's the scar on your arm?

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,540
What scar?

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,880
I burnt myself.

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,980
Jiang Nan,

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,960
what are you doing?

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,600
Gu Jiayi,

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,580
I've underestimated you.

35
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,420
You're not just merciless to yourself.

36
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,580
You are even worse to those around you.

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,340
Jiang Nan, stop right there.

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,060
How can you accuse me without any proof?

39
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,240
You know exactly what you did.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
What's wrong with your arm?

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,100
Wasn't it cut by the glass?

42
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,040
How did it turn into a burn?

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,460
Jiayi,

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,540
Mr. Liang helped me do that.

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,740
He said this scar is very noticeable

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,680
and we must be prepared for all contingencies.

47
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,220
Jiayi, just accept your fate.

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,760
We will never be able to escape Mr. Liang.

49
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,080
Let me do it.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,820
You're home.

51
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
What's wrong?

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
You were so anxious when you left

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,020
and you're in such a bad mood when you're back.

54
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,760
I just went to see Gu Jiayi.

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,080
Are you suspecting that person isn't an anti-fan

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,300
but someone around Gu Jiayi?

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,500
Don't take me as an idiot.

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,640
When you asked me about
the special features of that person,

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,820
I knew you don't trust Gu Jiayi anymore.

60
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,880
You're right.

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,300
There's a scar like what you said

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,020
on Gu Jiayi's assistant Mei's arm.

63
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,140
But when I went to see her, the wound became a burn.

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,240
Even if I know it was Mei,

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,539
we don't have any evidence to accuse her.

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Misfortunes might be blessings in disguise.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,620
Although Happy Family had a close call,

68
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,040
this incident also further proves our quality.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Isn't that free publicity?

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
You're pretty optimistic.

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,940
Didn't you tell me to be optimistic?

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,840
Since there are things we can't change,

73
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,680
don't be too inflexible and unyielding.

74
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,060
We should learn to let go.

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,720
You're the boss.

76
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,920
Alright, get yourself together.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,340
We're going to Happy Family today.

78
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,940
Since we cleared our name today,

79
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,960
we should gather together and celebrate.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,240
Your contributions cannot go unnoticed.

81
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,980
I haven't made anything of myself in life

82
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,460
and I'm not good at anything else but cooking.

83
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,940
Therefore, I made a lot of dishes today.

84
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,320
Here's a toast to you all.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,480
- Cheers! 
 - Come on, let's do it together.

86
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,120
- Let's drink. 
 - Cheers! Come on. Cheers!

87
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,280
Well, I need to

88
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,520
make a toast to Jiang Nan and Zhan.

89
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,960
We must thank the two of you specially

90
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,780
for helping Happy Family get back on track.

91
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,460
I'll drink first out of respect.

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,380
Eat and drink to your content.

93
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,600
Okay, okay.

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,280
- Thank you, Mrs. Xu. 
 - Mrs. Xu,

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm never reserved when it comes to satisfying my tastebuds.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,580
Please don't be reserved.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,100
- Don't drink so much. 
 - Zhan is such a nice boy.

98
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,900
Let's eat.

99
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,160
I really regret it. We should've given Cheng a sister.

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,880
Look at the two of them.

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,640
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,340
Well... I want to make a toast to the two of you too.

103
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,680
Thank you for being a great help to us.

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,340
Besides, it's so good to see you two reconcile again.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,540
Jiang Nan,

106
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,720
you have to be good to Xu Duocheng.

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
Otherwise, I'll be here.

108
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,660
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.

109
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,200
What about me?

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,380
Lin,

111
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,900
I know you had feelings for Cheng.

112
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,020
I really appreciate it.

113
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,000
Over the years, you've been taking care of her.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
I'll be taking over in the future.

115
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,980
- Don't worry. 
 - How can you guarantee that?

116
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,180
What are you saying?

117
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,120
What are you doing?

118
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,420
I want to marry her.

119
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Although this came really suddenly,

120
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,353
I've actually imagined
how I'll do this many times.

121
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,340
But I think now is a good time.

122
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,840
It's simple and everyone is here.f

123
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Well, now that everyone is here,

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,140
I want to announce with sincerity that

125
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,940
I want to marry Cheng.

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,300
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu, please trust me

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,680
and give me a chance.

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,540
Please give me Cheng's hand in marriage.

129
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,400
I approve.

130
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:48,347
As long as Cheng is happy,

131
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:50,080
I approve too.

132
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,560
Congratulations!

133
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,040
Take a seat.

134
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,820
Jiang Nan,

135
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,740
thank you for doing that
to make my parents happy.

136
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,200
Who said I was just trying to make them happy?

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,460
I did it for my happiness for the rest of my life.

138
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,700
Besides,

139
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,740
your parents already agreed.

140
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,840
It's too late to regret your choice.

141
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,800
Jiang Nan,

142
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,820
have you really thought it through?

143
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm very sure.

144
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,820
And

145
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,080
I've thought it through over and over again.

146
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,680
But...

147
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,360
But I'll be a bride with chicken feet hands.

148
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,160
My condition will only get worse in time.

149
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,980
I'll be in a wheelchair.

150
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,760
In time,

151
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,700
I won't even be able to sit in a wheelchair

152
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,880
and be bedridden.

153
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,140
After that, I will...

154
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,640
Not be able to move at all?

155
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,200
I know all about that.

156
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,920
I'm willing to accept it.

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,680
I want to be by your side forever.

158
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,140
Now,

159
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
I want to know your answer.

160
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,840
How did you find it?

161
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,560
Even if you throw it away a hundred times,

162
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,580
a thousand times,

163
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,700
I'll always find it.

164
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,440
Just like how I'm destined to find you,

165
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
the most important person in my life.

166
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,920
Ms. Xu Duocheng,

167
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,540
will you marry me?

168
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,620
I...

169
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,950
<i>♫ One, two, three,
I'll be holding your hand forever ♫</i>

170
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,030
<i>♫ And never let you leave ♫</i>

171
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,870
<i>♫ I raise my head and look into your eyes ♫</i>

172
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,864
<i>♫ Sharing all my joys and sorrows with you ♫</i>

173
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,472
<i>♫ Don't be shy, I'll give you all my tenderness ♫</i>

174
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,932
<i>♫ And everything in the universe ♫</i>

175
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:16,740
It's too late to say anything now.

176
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,420
Do I look nice?

177
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,020
So ugly.

178
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,780
Cheng,

179
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,500
I want to thank you.

180
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,200
Thank you

181
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,420
for supporting me when I was a nobody.

182
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,060
Thank you

183
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,440
for believing in me

184
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
when I was down.

185
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,620
You're making it sound like an award speech.

186
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,700
That's right.

187
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,380
That's what I'll say when I'm the winner of

188
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,660
Cool Singer-Songwriters.

189
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,440
Are you serious?

190
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,260
Lord Bao would chew your ears off.

191
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,200
There's more,

192
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Auntie called me a few days ago.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,880
She said my mom is getting better now.

194
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
She can basically take care of herself.

195
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,660
In that case,

196
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,680
let's go visit her in the village

197
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
and tell her we're getting married.

198
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,940
Okay?

199
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

200
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,780
Honey.

201
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,120
Honey.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,640
<i>Keqin,</i>

203
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,120
<i>Jiang Nan and I are getting married.</i>

204
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,300
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

205
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,280
<i>Congratulations, Cheng!</i>

206
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,380
<i>Keqin,</i>

207
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,600
<i>these are the photos I took recently.</i>

208
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,740
He's a pretty good photographer.

209
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,780
He's quite a talented photographer.

210
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,420
Chubby Zhu,

211
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,360
you're playing a trick on me?

212
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,820
Just wait.

213
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,420
Which one do you like?

214
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,560
I like anything you pick out.

215
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,480
Can you show me this one?

216
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Sir, you have very good taste.

217
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,840
This is the featured item of our store this season.

218
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,660
It's two carats.

219
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,920
Miss, what's your ring size?

220
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,200
I can help you try it on.

221
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,640
I don't know either.

222
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,980
I've never bought a ring for my ring finger.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,240
You don't need to measure. Size 7.

224
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,980
Wrap it up.

225
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, one moment, please.

226
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,260
How do you know?

227
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,160
Don't worry. It won't be wrong.

228
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,920
I sneaked in and measured it

229
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,900
when you were sleeping one night.

230
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,000
<i>Will you</i><i>marry me?</i>

231
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
What took you so long?

232
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,860
Why did you ask to see me all of a sudden?

233
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,320
What's wrong?

234
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,100
Cheng is getting married soon.

235
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm in a good mood.

236
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
You seem different today.

237
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,480
How am I different?

238
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Your lips.

239
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,340
That's right.

240
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,040
It's a man-trap shade.

241
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,380
Does it look good?

242
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh, God.

243
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,080
Are you still the Yu Keqin I know?

244
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,700
Can't I make some changes?

245
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,080
I have a crush on someone now.

246
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,900
My prince charming and ideal type likes

247
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,340
gentle and meek girls.

248
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,240
When did I say...

249
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,560
Say what?

250
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,220
I mean, you've only known
each other for a few days.

251
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,320
How is he your prince charming?

252
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,680
Haven't you seen how

253
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,700
many ignorant girls fell into traps

254
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,220
set by their cyber lover?

255
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,600
You don't understand.

256
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,240
Have you met your soulmate?

257
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,880
It's someone who you never met

258
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,760
but somehow we're bound together

259
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
by the mysterious power called destiny.

260
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,580
<i>He still won't admit it?</i>

261
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,840
<i>I bet you'll expose yourself.</i>

262
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,700
He likes Modigliani's paintings,

263
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,580
William Russell,

264
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,720
and auroras.

265
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
I'll show you his photography works.

266
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,820
Look at his photography skills

267
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,100
and look at yours.

268
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,900
But these are my...

269
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,620
What did you say?

270
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,860
I said my photos are really good too.

271
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,920
But you never cared whenever

272
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,960
I showed them to you.

273
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,500
<i>I don't like Modigliani anymore.</i>

274
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,420
<i>I'm fond of Chagall now.</i>

275
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,060
<i>Dummy,</i><i>you think you can fool me?</i>

276
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
Caiyun.

277
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,440
Son.

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,720
Mom,

279
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,860
you can really recognize me now?

280
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,540
Caiyun, we bought these for you.

281
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,460
It's your favorite tea.

282
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,720
Thank you, Cheng.

283
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Cheng,

284
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,220
Cheng, although I like you,

285
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,640
it doesn't seem fit for you
to call me by my name, right?

286
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Sorry, Cai...

287
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jiang.

288
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,780
I got used to it.  It's hard to change instantly.

289
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,200
You don't have to call me Mrs. Jiang either.

290
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,600
You can just call me Mom.

291
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
<i>After many years of silence,</i>

292
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,640
<i>he's back in the spotlight.</i>

293
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,440
<i>On the stage,</i>

294
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,400
<i>- he's a singer who moved and brought...</i>
- Come on.

295
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,780
<i>- ...countless surprises to the audience.</i>
- Come take a seat.

296
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,420
<i>Jiang Nan!</i>

297
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,780
I watched every episode
of the Cool Singer-Songwriters show

298
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,920
since I've been staying in our hometown.

299
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,240
You're wonderful.

300
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
That's for sure.

301
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,980
Am I right?

302
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
<i>He's been gently staying by her side,</i>

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,460
<i>although his girlfriend's
got an incurable disease.</i>

304
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,500
<i>In his private life,</i>

305
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,880
<i>he's the affectionate Jiang Nan</i>

306
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,159
<i>who shows his girlfriend with ALS
the utmost solicitude...</i>

307
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,760
Wait, what does this mean?

308
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,480
What did they mean by an incurable disease?

309
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,460
Why did they say Cheng has an incurable disease?

310
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,960
Exactly.  They can't do that

311
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,220
even if they want ratings.

312
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,680
It's so irresponsible!
They are lying blatantly!

313
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,900
That's right. It's...

314
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,280
It's pure nonsense!

315
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,200
That's so out of line!

316
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,540
Shut it off.

317
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,660
Honey, should we call Cheng

318
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,120
and ask what's going on?

319
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,540
Are you confused from working too hard?

320
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,840
Didn't Cheng go with Jiang Nan
to visit his mom?

321
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,280
Is it a good time to call her?

322
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,400
That's right.

323
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,280
It's an important occasion.

324
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,100
Let's not disturb them.

325
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,580
Let's wait. 
Let's wait until she comes back.

326
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,660
We'll ask her when she comes back.

327
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,880
It's fine. I'm sure it'll be fine.

328
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,860
Cheng,

329
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,600
is that true?

330
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,900
Mom,

331
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,980
I've been aware of Cheng's condition all along.

332
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,580
That's exactly why

333
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,180
I'm determined to marry her.

334
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,340
I don't want to miss out on all the days
we have together.

335
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm sorry,

336
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,500
Mrs. Jiang.

337
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,340
Silly girl,

338
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,440
what are you saying?

339
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,780
I won't object to your relationship.

340
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,160
On the contrary, I support it more than anyone else.

341
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,960
Jiang Nan's father

342
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,260
didn't tell me when he was first diagnosed

343
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,100
with cancer either.

344
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,880
When I discovered it myself,

345
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,040
he was already at the terminal stage.

346
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,200
I wasn't able to

347
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,940
make the best use of my time with him

348
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,600
and take care of him.

349
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,120
That might be

350
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,880
the most painful memory
and the biggest regret of my life.

351
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,820
So, I wish you and Jiang Nan would be together.

352
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Otherwise,

353
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,260
he might

354
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,560
go down my old path.

355
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,940
This is a part of my dowry.

356
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,100
I've been wearing this for a long time.

357
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm giving it to you.

358
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,620
No matter how hard life will be,

359
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,720
no matter how long you'll live,

360
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,420
it's always happy to be with

361
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,560
the one you love.

362
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,740
Hello?

363
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,300
We'll talk about Cheng's condition later.

364
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,560
Go tell Alex I want to quit the competition.

365
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,960
Quit the competition? Jiang, don't be so agitated.

366
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,160
I already contacted the show. They said they'll pull down the video now.

367
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,660
What's the point of doing that now?

368
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,940
Cheng made so much effort to keep it a secret because she doesn't want everyone to worry.

369
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,660
Those vile people took advantage of her.

370
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,380
Yes, I already pulled all the strings I can to minimize the impact of this incident.

371
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,020
<i>The best solution is for me
to quit the competition!</i>

372
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,380
He planned this from the start.

373
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,580
He was waiting for the best chance to expose Cheng's condition.

374
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,460
<i>He wasn't convinced by Cheng to let me come on the show.</i>

375
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,620
It's because he thinks Cheng's condition will be a big selling point for the show.

376
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,160
I will not let a despicable person get his way.

377
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,180
That's right. I'm really pissed too.

378
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,800
But if you quit the competition now, all the efforts we made would be in vain.

379
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,980
Besides, the show might sue us
for violation of the contract.

380
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,000
They were the ones
to violate the contract first. Why should they sue us?

381
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,180
Someone like Alex is capable of doing anything.

382
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,660
I don't care what they'll do. Tell them to come to me.

383
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,720
I will never make any compromise to something that will hurt Cheng.

384
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,020
<i>I'll leave it to you to release a statement
about quitting the competition.</i>

385
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,180
If they want to sue me, I'll respond to it.

386
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,200
Don't worry.

387
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,520
Cheng, let me ask you.

388
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,080
What they said on TV, were they lying?

389
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,960
Cheng, tell me the truth.

390
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,520
Did you hurt your hand from a fall?

391
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't believe what they said on TV.

392
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,060
I want to hear it from you.

393
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,560
Cheng, tell me.

394
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,040
Tell us, darling.

395
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,200
What they said on TV is true.

396
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,760
I do have ALS.

397
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,460
Wait a minute.

398
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,520
What is ALS?

399
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,160
What is ALS?

400
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,620
Wait, you're making me confused.

401
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,820
How did you get ALS? Where did you get the diagnosis?

402
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,560
Jiang, it must be a misdiagnosis.

403
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,660
- It must be a misdiagnosis, right?  - It's a misdiagnosis.

404
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,420
- It must be a misdiagnosis.
- Here's what we should do. We should do an exam at another hospital.

405
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,020
It's alright. You'll be fine.

406
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,560
I've been getting treatments
at the hospital for six months.

407
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,800
Six months?

408
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,200
Six months?

409
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,020
Six months?

410
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,240
How is it six months?

411
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,980
You... You kept your condition from us for 6 months?

412
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,740
Why didn't you... Why didn't you tell us within these six months?

413
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,400
Have we done anything to offend you?

414
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Why won't you tell us? We don't even have the right to know? Why?

415
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,540
Dad, don't be like this.

416
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,040
Then what do you want me to do?

417
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,500
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu, Cheng just didn't want you to worry.

418
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,340
You are quiet for now.

419
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,000
No.

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,780
No, no, no.

421
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,300
How's this? Here's the thing.

422
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,160
- What's wrong? 
 - Let's go to the hospital now.

423
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Let's go to the hospital. Medical treatments are really advanced now.

424
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,220
We can surely cure your disease. We can surely cure you.

425
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,900
I'm willing to pay any price
to cure your disease.

426
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,080
Don't be afraid, darling. Don't be afraid. Come on, come with me.

427
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,700
- Come with me! Come with me 
- Mr. Xu! ! Mr. Xu, please calm down.

428
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,560
- Come with me! Let's go! 
- Mr. Xu! Mr. Xu. 
- Dad!

429
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,680
ALS is incurable.

430
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,060
It's incurable?

431
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,000
As your father,

432
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,980
it's been six months and I didn't know about it.

433
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,800
My daughter was suffering alone.

434
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,680
What kind of father am I?

435
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,780
It was negligent

436
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,320
and I wasn't any help at all.

437
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,780
- What am I?  What am I? What am I? 
 - Dad!

438
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,820
- What am I? What am I? 
- Mr. Xu!  Mr. Xu! 
 - Dad, don't do that!

439
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,060
Calm down, Mr. Xu!

440
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,520
What am I?

441
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,600
- Mr. Xu!  - Dad, don't be like this!

442
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
- Mr. Xu!
- I'm not a man!

443
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm not a man...

444
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,760
Don't cry.

445
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,300
I feel even worse

446
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,600
if you are like this.

447
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
You,

448
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,660
go pack your things and move back!

449
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,200
I promise you I'll move home.

450
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,000
I feel somewhat reluctant

451
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,000
to leave all of a sudden.

452
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,300
I'll save your room here for you forever.

453
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,600
You can come back to stay for a few days if you feel like you stayed
at home for too long.

454
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,460
Xu Duocheng!

455
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,760
Keqin?

456
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,640
Xu Duocheng!

457
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,040
Xu Duocheng, what do you take me for?

458
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,600
We're best friends. Must I know about
something like this from the news?

459
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,960
Why didn't you answer my calls? I was worried sick!

460
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,700
Keqin, I'm sorry

461
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,220
All the reporters started to hound me
once they heard the news.

462
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,140
I have no choice but to turn my phone off.

463
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,140
I wasn't deliberately trying to hide it from you.

464
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,920
When I first knew about my condition,

465
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,040
I was at a loss for what to do.

466
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,620
I don't want to leave you with the ugliest and most embarrassing impression of me.

467
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,060
Are you stupid?

468
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,660
How can you bear
with something like this alone?

469
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,340
Cheng,

470
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,320
I will be your arms and legs from now on.

471
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,980
Even if you can't walk or move anymore,

472
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,320
I will always be there for you.

473
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,200
Even if I have to carry you,

474
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,820
I'll carry you to go shopping
and watch a movie with me,

475
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,000
just like what we used to do.

476
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,760
Alright.

477
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,520
Keqin,

478
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,800
why don't we take Cheng home together?

479
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,820
You're moving back home?

480
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,980
My parents still don't know Jiang Nan and I are living together.

481
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,880
They think it's more convenient for them
to take care of me if I move home.

482
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,400
I want to spend more time with them as well.

483
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,240
Stop looking at it, honey.

484
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,160
Don't you know how much money we have?

485
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,720
Don't worry,

486
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll find a way

487
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,380
to get the money.

488
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,220
Honey,

489
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,700
don't be too worried.

490
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,920
We'll be doomed if you collapse.

491
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,040
Don't worry.

492
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,820
I won't let myself collapse.

493
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,240
Okay.

494
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm planning to

495
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,540
take our daughter to Beijing in a few days.

496
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,700
They have better medical conditions in Beijing.

497
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,380
Maybe there's still hope.

498
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,900
Besides, I looked it up on the internet.

499
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,620
There's a 1% chance of curing this disease.

500
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,060
I was thinking,

501
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,020
our daughter is so kind.

502
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,180
Maybe she's

503
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,700
within that 1%,

504
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,240
right?

505
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,320
Even if there's only a 0.01%,

506
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,640
we still have to try.

507
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,820
We'll go.

508
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,800
We'll go.

509
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,280
We must go.

510
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,780
We must go.

511
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,700
<i>Hello, Jiang,</i>

512
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,560
<i>I already released the statement
to quit the competition.</i>

513
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,660
<i>But Alex hasn't confirmed
to terminate the contract.</i>

514
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,040
<i>I believe he wants to drag it out</i>

515
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,300
<i>and see if there's any room to maneuver.</i>

516
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,460
Make it very clear to him.

517
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,580
This is non-negotiable.

518
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,280
If he dares to hurt Xu Duocheng again,

519
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,880
I won't spare him.

520
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,020
<i>Why was Xu Duocheng's condition exposed?</i>

521
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,720
<i>Did you have a countermeasure?</i>

522
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,520
<i>You should comfort Xu Duocheng's parents first.</i>

523
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,900
<i>Call me if you need help at any time.</i>

524
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,820
<i>Don't worry.</i>

525
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,180
<i>It's all been taken care of.</i>

526
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,560
<i>Thank you.</i>

527
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,120
<i>Are you alright?</i>

528
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,200
<i>She must've been confused and upset today.</i>

529
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,480
<i>What's the point of</i><i>such a polite greeting?</i>

530
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,120
<i>Maybe I shouldn't disturb her and her family.</i>

531
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,080
<i>Your condition</i>

532
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,580
<i>is no longer a secret between the three of us.</i>

533
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,140
<i>Will you still need me in the future?</i>

534
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,980
<i>Would I still be the first in line</i>

535
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,200
<i>to stay by your side and protect you?</i>

536
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm not upset.

537
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,040
I think it's a good thing.

538
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,580
Don't worry.

539
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,220
From now on, our family will never be apart.

540
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,860
Be good,

541
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,200
go to sleep.

542
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,620
Xu Duocheng has an incurable disease?

543
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,880
Then I still have one last hope.

544
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,119
Jiayi,

545
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,100
although Jiang Nan released a statement
to quit the competition.

546
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,700
But he didn't respond

547
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,440
to Xu Duocheng's condition at all.

548
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,720
I assume he's already mentally prepared.

549
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,980
As a girlfriend of a celebrity,

550
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,940
it's bad enough that she can't help him

551
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,799
in his life and his career.

552
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,139
Now, she even caused him
to quit the competition.

553
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,600
Even if we accept that,

554
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,800
would his fans accept it?

555
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,820
That's perfect.

556
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,680
We can use the power of media

557
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,540
to tell more of his fans about this.

558
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,680
Hello.

559
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,220
Manager Yang,

560
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,120
you probably read about
my condition on the internet.

561
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,080
I really can't continue to teach anymore.

562
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,760
You don't have to be hands-on,

563
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,520
just teach by speech.

564
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,780
You love to play the piano.

565
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,340
Are you just going to give up?

566
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,200
Exactly.

567
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,180
The students and parents really like you

568
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,600
and want you to continue teaching.

569
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,740
I know how difficult it is to learn the piano.

570
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,540
Therefore, I really can't waste their time.

571
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,560
I want to see them find a better teacher

572
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,380
and play a song fluently as soon as possible.

573
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Although I didn't want
to see Cheng teach here at first,

574
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,740
I want to thank you for taking care of her.

575
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,880
Don't mention it.

576
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,180
If it weren't for you,

577
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,240
I would've missed out on Xu Duocheng.

578
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,320
Let's go then.

579
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
You're all here.

580
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,220
What brought you here?

581
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm here to learn.

582
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,900
I haven't finished the lessons
I bought here yet.

583
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,120
I just quit today.

584
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,440
I can't teach you anymore.

585
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,880
Go find another teacher.

586
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,560
- Ms. Xu!
- Ms. Xu!

587
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,540
How does it affect you now that

588
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,020
you've been exposed as a patient with ALS?

589
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,700
Or, maybe the two of you deliberately
told the show about it.

590
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,960
Judging by the current conditions,

591
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,920
ALS is incurable.

592
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,180
Do you have anything to say

593
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,100
at the end of your life?

594
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,900
Are you crazy?

595
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,000
What kind of reporter are you?

596
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,280
How can you ask a patient a question like that?

597
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,300
By the way, netizens are really curious about your condition.

598
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,520
If you can't be cured,

599
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,240
will it be a burden to Jiang Nan?

600
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,280
Would your limbs become deformed

601
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,780
during the late stages of ALS?

602
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,400
Do you think you're a good match

603
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,760
for Jiang Nan?

604
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,540
Let me answer your questions.

605
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,820
I will not participate in the final round

606
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,200
of Cool Singer-Songwriters,

607
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,060
neither will Xu Duocheng.

608
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,300
There would be some changes during

609
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,420
the late stages of ALS.

610
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,780
But no matter what,

611
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,900
she will always be the most beautiful girl in my eyes.

612
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,000
Besides, this is a private matter between us.

613
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,360
It has nothing to do with you.

614
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,140
Although she has ALS,

615
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,120
as long as she cooperates with her treatments,

616
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,220
she can prolong her life.

617
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,360
There are diagnosed patients

618
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,160
who continue to live
for another ten to twenty years.

619
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,620
At last,

620
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,800
even if Xu Duocheng is gone in the future,

621
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,120
the memories we have

622
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,440
are enough for me to reminisce.

623
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,920
I will live on with these memories

624
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,040
on my own.

625

00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:33,839
<i>♫ As we walk, I reach out my hand ♫</i>

654
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,069

will no longer drift apart ♫</i>

655
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:58,255
<i>♫ I can only practice
my love confession in secret ♫</i>

656
00:39:58,255 --> 00:40:02,219
<i>♫ Fantasize hugging you from the back ♫</i>

657
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:08,703
<i>♫ I can only tell the wishing tree
about my secrets ♫</i>

658
00:40:08,703 --> 00:40:12,047
<i>♫ One, two, three
I'll be holding your hand forever ♫</i>

659
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:16,227
<i>♫ And never let you leave ♫</i>

660

661
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,961
<i>♫ Sharing all my joys and sorrows with you ♫</i>

662
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:26,374
