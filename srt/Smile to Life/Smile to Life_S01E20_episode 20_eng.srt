00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,270

2
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:13,736
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:15,976
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:19,276
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:24,451
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:30,309
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:33,123
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:35,528
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:38,910
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,709
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,423
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:48,410
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,137
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:53,850
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,497
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:58,764
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,764 --> 00:01:01,579
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,820
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,667
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:13,521
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:16,255
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,362
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:21,075
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:25,734
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:31,253
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:45,129
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,888

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,960
President Ding, regarding the image ambassador and endorsement,

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,080
I hope you can give me a chance to explain, okay?

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,400
Hello? Hello, President Ding?

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,960
Qin Shan, you came on your own before I went to you?

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,640
Lord Bao, is this a good time?

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,180
Even if it's not, you're already here.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,580
I just want to ask you, what's the grudge between you and Jiang Nan?

35
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,920
I didn't publish that article.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,380
True Image was acquired, right?

37
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Are you really anxious?

38
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,100
But why did I hear there's a joint editor-in-chief system at True Image now?

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,800
Or are you trying to tell me that True Image has been cancelled?

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,780
Liang Zhe only trusts Qi Qi now.

41
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm just a mere figurehead.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,420
So?

43
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,000
I will personally try my best to make up for the negative impact the article has had on Jiang Nan.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,920
I won't go back to True Image for a while.

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,980
True Image is your everything.

46
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,280
It's my life. I will earn it back myself.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,160
As for you, I came by to tell you that

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,480
Jian Xing will be live streaming soon.

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,180
 Hello, everyone. I'm Jian Xing who recently appeared on Cool Singer-Songwriters.

50
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,300
 I want to tell you the truth about why I temporarily stopped the recording of the show.

51
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,140
 Three days ago, when I was preparing to record the first episode of the show,

52
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,340
 Jiang Nan suddenly came to me and said I pulled strings to get on this show.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,120
 He said I had no right to be on the stage.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,960
 Although I'm a challenger,

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,340
 I earned my place through hard work.

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,540
 My team also put in so much effort for this show.

57
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,180
 I really wanted to explain this to him,

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,800
 but he started to hit me before I could do that.

59
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
 This is my diagnosis report.

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,760
 The doctor said I have a mild concussion

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,700
 and several bruises and cuts on the corner of my mouth and my arms.

62
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,113
Three years ago, he also beat me to the point that I was hospitalized.

63
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,520
Jiang Nan, I will keep this proof of diagnosis for you forever.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,520
He's about to be doomed, yet still pretending to be the victim.

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,300
How persistent.

66
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,160
Jian Xing's matter is pretty troublesome.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,260
I guess you'll be busy for a while,

68
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,720
but I looked it up.

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,460
Jian Xing's contract with Shengyu Entertainment just ended.

70
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,660
I don't know who he kissed up to this time.

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,940
Could it be Liang Zhe?

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,220
Or maybe Liang Zhe wants to use this opportunity to add insult to injury?

73
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,600
But I've always been curious about one thing.

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,200
Why did Jiang Nan hit Jian Xing back then?

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,960
He offended the media because of him and almost ruined his career.

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,900
I still remember what Jiang Nan said to the reporters like it happened yesterday.

77
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,540
You have quite a good memory, Sister Shan.

78
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,820
You still remember it after so many years.

79
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,910
I was one of those reporters.

80
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,060
 Mr. Jiang, can you tell us what you think?

81
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,140
 Why did you hit him? Did you do it because you were competing with Jian Xing for resources?

82
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,560
 Mr. Jiang, was your contract with Shengyu Entertainment terminated because of your act of violence?

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,720
 It's always up to you as to whether it's true.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
 Does it matter if I say anything?

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,660
 You people are the one who direct the truth.

86
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,240
 I'm warning you, stop following me around like flies.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
 - Mr. Jiang! Don't leave! 
 - Mr. Jiang!

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,060
 Please, answer the question! Mr. Jiang!

89
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,120
 Mr. Jiang! Please, answer the question!

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,040
I was gathering news with my supervisor at the time.

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,760
I was wondering why you pay so much attention to Jiang Nan.

92
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,320
Turns out you can really hold a grudge.

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Are you a Scorpio?

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,620
You're wrong. I'm not holding a grudge.

95
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,120
Jiang Nan's words enlightened me.

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,620
That was also my original intention for independently starting True Image.

97
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,460
I didn't know you two had a history like that.

98
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,100
As a journalist, I must warn you guys.

99
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,540
Now the public opinion is very unfavorable to Jiang Nan.

100
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,660
You need to think about how to deal with it.

101
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,060
I know some media platforms.

102
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,580
If you need anything, you can come find me at any time.

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:09,440
Sister Shan, I want to apologize for my rashness just now.

104
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,820
Actually, you have always been an iron lady in my mind

105
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,480
but I just realized that you are such a warmhearted person.

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Who's an iron lady?

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,400
Me. I'm iron, I'm iron.

108
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,580
You've always been warmhearted in my mind.

109
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,380
Very, very warm.

110
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,600
Hurry and get back to your work.

111
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,920
I also have to send something.

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,740
The situation is getting out of hand now.

113
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,580
Opinions vary in his live streaming channel.

114
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,440
Some people side with Jian Xing and some side with Jiang Nan.

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,920
What should our production team say?

116
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,160
Just tell them, the production team doesn't know anything.

117
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,280
Until this matter gets investigated, both of them are  taking a break from filming.

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,960
Alex, Ms. Gu is here.

119
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,240
I specifically brought you a bottle of red wine.

120
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,560
It's made by Chateau de Burgundy's own vineyard.

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,360
Try it.

122
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,700
Have a seat.

123
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,500
You came because of Jiang Nan, right?

124
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,760
I won't beat around the bush then.

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,920
All public opinion is unfavorable to Jiang Nan.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,660
If you really suspend him from the show right now,

127
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,460
doesn't that prove he attacked someone for no reason?

128
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,100
Don't be anxious.

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,000
There are two sides to everything.

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,920
It might not be a bad thing this time.

131
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,800
Think about it, the show just aired its first episode

132
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,120
and it's already a hot topic.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,160
Right now, I can suspend them from the show.

134
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,000
After some time, I can also let them come back.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,200
However, you can't sacrifice Jiang Nan to generate a hot topic.

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Jia Yi, Jiang Nan isn't the only one suspended from the show.

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,900
Jian Xing is suspended too.

138
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,640
Think about it from another perspective, if Jiang Nan really is innocent,

139
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,040
then the truth will come out sooner or later.

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,400
After the situation goes viral,

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I will let Jiang Nan return to the show.

142
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,340
In the end, wouldn't he still be the one benefitting the most?

143
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,580
I'll be honest with you,

144
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,200
Jian Xing and Jiang Nan have old scores to settle.

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,980
Besides, Liang Zhe is the one who put him on the show.

146
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,920
How do you think the truth will come out when they are in this together?

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,500
How do you know Liang Zhe put Jian Xing on the show?

148
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:35,020
 I have a perfect candidate.

149
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,740
 No one is better than him.

150
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,340
I just don't understand then.

151
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,040
Since you knew, why didn't you tell Jiang Nan in advance?

152
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,640
You're so worried now that he's in trouble.

153
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,580
Do you want him to make a comeback or not?

154
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,480
I don't know either.

155
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,140
I'm afraid I might not even have a chance to help him after he becomes popular again.

156
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,220
But... I'm also sad to see him

157
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,420
being wrongly accused now.

158
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,480
Brother Nan, why are you here?

159
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,680
You just got married. I came by for a visit.

160
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
You're not going to introduce her to me?

161
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,760
Look at my terrible memory. Brother Nan, this is my wife.

162
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,480
Honey, this is the Brother Nan I always mention. He's my boss.

163
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,740
I know. I always see you on TV.

164
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,840
Please, don't mention it.

165
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,860
You probably know about what happened in the past two days, right?

166
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,300
They're all spewing nonsense.

167
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,280
That Jian Xing plagiarized your song and then was the thief crying thief.

168
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,680
I heard about it from gossip news too.

169
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,820
I think you fought with him because of a plagiarism accusation.

170
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,180
But Brother Nan would never plagiarize.

171
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,020
It must be that Jian Xing.

172
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,160
I didn't know you would come.

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,640
If I knew, I would've bought more ingredients.

174
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,160
Don't bother. I just came to visit you.

175
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,000
I should've come on your wedding day,

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,620
but I couldn't make it because of work.

177
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,360
We should be embarrassed.

178
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,800
I got pregnant and we got married in a hurry.

179
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,860
It's a good thing. Double the happiness.

180
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,340
Congratulations.

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,180
Call and make a restaurant reservation. Let's treat Brother Nan to lunch.

182
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,720
- You're right. 
 - You really don't have to.

183
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,520
This is a small gift for the baby.

184
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,460
- I wish you a happy marriage. I'm leaving now. 
 - Brother Nan. The watch is precious enough.

185
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,200
We can't accept this.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Xiao Du, you've been working for me for so many years.

187
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,140
Even when our company was struggling the most, you never left.

188
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,800
This isn't much. Just take it.

189
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Indeed, I can't give you anything else.

190
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,720
However, you can't put a price on friendship, right?

191
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,880
Enjoy your life. I'm leaving.

192
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Thank you, Brother Nan.

193
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,020
Bye, Brother Nan.

194
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,200
Honey, tell me the truth.

195
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,120
Do you have anything to do with your boss's incident?

196
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,620
- No. 
 - Really?

197
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,920
Really.

198
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
He would just come all the way here and leave without having lunch?

199
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,740
You... If I really did, would he give us such a big red envelope?

200
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,320
Am I right? Take this.

201
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,020
Let's go home first.

202
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,960
 You still miss my little stage, right?

203
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,200
 When Zhi Lin comes by, he always stares at the stage with the same exact expression as you.

204
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,340
 Zhan Zhi Lin came by too?

205
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,820
 He always comes to visit, much more often than this guy.

206
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,760
 Brother Cheng, can you let me know when Zhan Zhi Lin comes by next time?

207
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,880
 What are you going to do?

208
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,060
 I'm not going to do anything.

209
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,680
 Just think of it as doing a favor for Jiang Nan.

210
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,830

211
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Zhan Zhi Lin.

212
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,340
I'll just say a few words and then I'll leave.

213
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,780
Do you know why Jiang Nan disbanded 2BeOne back then?

214
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,940
Didn't you love BBQ kidney before?

215
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,900
Here, have some more.

216
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,460
Who has an appetite now?

217
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,800
True Image is like Asura's fire-pit now.

218
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,960
That Qi Qi is like a smiling villain with evil intentions.

219
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,820
She's deliberately making it difficult for anyone who stands by Sister Shan at the office.

220
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,840
I think it'll be my turn soon.

221
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,120
When you were in a bad mood before, you'd immediately cheer up after eating something delicious.

222
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,660
That was when I was in high school.

223
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,280
Who remains as simple-minded as when they were young?

224
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,127
What exactly is going on lately?

225
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,020
True Image is a mess.

226
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,940
Jiang Nan is also in trouble.

227
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,460
That Jian Xing suddenly live streamed and brought out what happened five years ago.

228
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,280
Everyone is criticizing Jiang Nan.

229
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,570
Orange must be so worried.

230
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
So annoying!

231
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,600
Nothing is going smoothly.

232
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,160
Maybe you shouldn't go to work for now.

233
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,960
How can I do that?

234
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,580
If I leave True Imagine now, wouldn't I be defecting?

235
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,000
The few of us who support Sister Shan already made an agreement to stand by Sister Shan.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
We won't quit no matter how difficult the situation gets.

237
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,260
We'll make that Qi Qi a general without an army.

238
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

239
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,060
You're still the same as before.

240
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,900
You haven't changed at all.

241
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,820
Sister Shan fought back!

242
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,880
She just released a statement.

243
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,620
 She said everything True Image is doing right now is not representative of her attitude.

244
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,560
 She will independently use her personal account to continue writing reports.

245
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,600
- That's wonderful! 
 - That's wonderful!

246
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,840
I asked for everyone's support in the Pumpkin Fan Club  group.

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,940
His fans are still pretty impressive.

248
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,540
With the live stream out there, Qi Qi must be planning something.

249
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,240
Sister Shan already released a statement and published a few articles in her own name.

250
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,160
In this case, I can still book a few exclusive interviews for Lao Jiang.

251
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,200
Have you guys watched Jian Xing's live stream?

252
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,740
Brother, you're finally back.

253
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,140
We are exhausted from anxiety.

254
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,260
Do you have any ideas?

255
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,220
I've thought about it. I plan on doing a live performance at Dark Black.

256
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,840
We can seize this moment to arrange an interview and take care of all these trolls at once.

257
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,380
Then what?

258
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,600
Since we know the truth, we should share it confidently.

259
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,560
I plan to release that voice recording to the public.

260
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,680
I think that's pretty good.

261
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,086
How about this, Lao Jiang? You just worry about your concert.

262
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:18,720
Orange and I will take care of clearing your name.

263
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,200
- All right. 
 - All right, it's settled then.

264
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
Let's go home.

265
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,920
You've worked hard, Lord Bao.

266
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,520
We're leaving.

267
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,900
 I think Jian Xing didn't tell the truth at the time because he was afraid to offend you.

268
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,440
 Besides, if it was Jiang Nan who beat him up, he'll certainly gain a lot of publicity,

269
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,680
 just like what's happening now.

270
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,180
 Enough!

271
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,640
 Do you think I will believe you?

272
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,600
 Jiang Nan has no reason to lie to me.

273
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,940
 So what?

274
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,460
 So, you're telling me all this right now

275
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,320
  because you want me to feel like an ungrateful idiot, right?

276
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,980
 That's not what I mean.

277
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,280
 Then you want me to help defend Jiang Nan?

278
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,560
 - I... 
 - Enough!

279
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,000
 Even if you're telling the truth, I don't need Jiang Nan to take the fall for me.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,180
 Also, tell him to stop thinking so highly of himself.

281
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,720
 He doesn't even trust me enough to tell me the truth!

282
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,640
 Why is he pretending to be noble and virtuous?

283
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,520
 And you, just mind your own business.

284
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,760
You don't know how to knock before you enter?

285
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,080
Are you responsible for Jiang Nan's plagiarism incident?

286
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,140
Are you interrogating your own son for someone else's son?

287
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,800
Is this called "love me, love my dog"?

288
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,600
I used to turn a blind eye to your minor conflicts

289
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,660
but something as serious as plagiarism will ruin Jiang Nan's future. Do you understand?

290
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,320
His future?

291
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What about my future?

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,079
If the thing between you and Tian Cai Yun didn't happen,

293
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,560
I would also be standing on the stage right now.

294
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,639
With your personality, the entertainment business doesn't suit you.

295
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm doing this for your own good!

296
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,200
Look at you. You gave up on yourself,

297
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,880
and now, you did such a terrible thing!

298
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,080
- If your mom in heaven sees... 
 - Don't mention my mom!

299
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,960
If it weren't for you and Tian Cai Yun, would I be like this?

300
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,540
I could've been buddies with Jiang Nan for life.

301
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,380
Too bad he's the son of that b*tch!

302
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,940
How can I not hate him?

303
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,160
If you must hate someone, just hate me.

304
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,140
I fell in love with Ms. Tian unilaterally

305
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,980
but she never accepted me.

306
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,460
We never did anything that crossed the moral boundary.

307
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,560
Do you think I will believe you?

308
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,840
If she didn't do anything, why would she feel guilty?

309
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,740
Why would she go insane?

310
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,300
Why would my mom commit suicide?

311
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,320
Because your mom was the one who had an affair!

312
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,400
She was the one who asked me for a divorce first!

313
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,740
My mom already passed away, and you still putting the blame on her?

314
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,760
You're still using this to tarnish her reputation?

315
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,380
I never tarnished her reputation!

316
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,240
This is that man's name.

317
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,940
I would've burned this painting a long time ago if I wasn't afraid that you couldn't handle it!

318
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,600
I don't know why that man abandoned your mom later on.

319
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,980
Maybe she was too shocked or she couldn't face you.

320
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,280
That's why she committed suicide.

321
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,960
Stop talking.

322
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,540
I won't believe a single word you say!

323
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,520
Help me investigate someone.

324
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,780
This person is a painter.

325
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,080
His signature is ZF.

326
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,360
It's so hot.

327
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,920
Stay still!

328
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,540
I already told you everything I know.

329
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,220
I'm telling the truth.

330
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,480
Besides, I'm very aware of the situation at the time.

331
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,460
You're the successor of Conlin Group. I can't afford to offend you.

332
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,660
As for Jiang Nan, Sister Yun gave all of Shenyu Entertainment's resources to him.

333
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,140
If I wanted to climb higher in Shengyu Entertainment, I definitely had to get rid of Jiang Nan first.

334
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,180
So, since the public believed Jiang Nan was the one who hit me,

335
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,880
I thought I might as well take advantage of the situation.

336
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,740
Continue.

337
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,280
Jiang Nan proposed to disband your duo before Liang Zhe made a move.

338
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,120
After that, Liang Zhe published a slanderous article against him, and also my video.

339
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,600
Anyway, Jiang Nan sold a few properties to pay the penalty fee from Shengyu Entertainment.

340
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
After that...

341
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,940
After that, he established a studio with Bao Rui and lost his popularity.

342
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,920
You said he sold his properties?

343
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,980
 Take this card.

344
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,080
How do you know so much?

345
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,400
At the time, the agent who sold the houses for Jiang Nan was a friend of mine.

346
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,960
Plus, real estate prices were high at the time, so he had just enough to pay off Shengyu Entertainment's penalty fee.

347
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,880
I already told you everything I know. Please, let me go.

348
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100

349
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,180
I heard Sister Shan published articles on her personal account.

350
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,400
- President Liang is pretty angry. 
 - Really?

351
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,120
It has to be true. I heard President Liang talked to Qi Qi.

352
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,220
But, President Liang won't fire Editor-in-Chief Qin, will he?

353
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,420
He can't.

354
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,740
Ke Qin, what do you think about this?

355
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,940
Although Sister Shan's actions are very satisfying,

356
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,740
but right now Liang Zhe has more say in the company.

357
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,420
Besides, with that Qi Qi around,

358
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,300
Sister Shan must be under a lot of pressure.

359
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,480
That's true.

360
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,280
Look at what you wrote.

361
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,180
Sister Shan read this article before.

362
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,460
She said it was fine.

363
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,120
I made comments on it before.

364
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,500
You needed to revise the title and the conclusion according to my notes.

365
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,600
Didn't you hear me?

366
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,900
But what you wrote is the complete opposite of the truth.

367
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,380
I can't just invert the truth and lie to the public, right?

368
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,660
That's right, Qi Qi.

369
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,820
If we revise it to your liking,

370
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,580
- who will be responsible if anything happens, right? 
 - Exactly.

371
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,560
Although Sister Shan is strict, she actually really respects our point of view.

372
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,520
Editor-in-Chief, I don't think I should write the article I'm working on.

373
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,320
If I revise it to your liking, I'm afraid...

374
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm afraid I'll be sued.

375
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,960
Are you revolting?

376
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,520
Fine, I'll tell President Liang to fire all of you!

377
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,140
They were all hired by me.

378
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,260
If you want to fire them, you should at least ask me first.

379
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,180
Or do you think Liang Zhe will care about your trivial problems?

380
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,920
Fine, let's wait and see how this will end.

381
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,760
Everyone, I believe you all saw my statement.

382
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,760
For a while, I will be publishing articles through my personal account independently.

383
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,740
I won't be working with everyone for a while.

384
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,240
It was my honor to work with everyone all this time.

385
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,400
I know I was usually very strict with you all.

386
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,400
I also know you've been calling me the She-Devil in private.

387
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,880
Anyway, I want to apologize for all the mistakes I've made.

388
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,020
Sister Shan.

389
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,480
Sister Shan, you're leaving us behind?

390
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,300
Sister Shan, what will we do if you leave?

391
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
That's right.

392
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,860
I'm only leaving temporarily.

393
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,560
I believe I will still have the chance to work with everyone in the future.

394
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,420
All right, focus on your work.

395
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,460
I already read the proposal you turned in for next week.

396
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,860
It's excellent. You can carry it out now.

397
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,340
This is a summary of my work experience over the years.

398
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,380
I hope it can help you.

399
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,840
Sister Shan, this...

400
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,060
Keep it safe.

401
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,120
Sister Shan, then what are you planning to do next?

402
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,940
I will write the articles I want to write.

403
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,280
Of course, I will also follow up with news about Jiang Nan and Jian Xing.

404
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,520
I can help you.

405
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,220
Do your own work first.

406
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,600
You'll be helping me by staying here.

407
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,860
But Sister Shan...

408
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,080
Good luck.

409
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,140
Conlin Group's major public welfare charity event...

410
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,680
That's it for today.

411
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,600
What's wrong?

412
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,900
Let me ask you.

413
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,820
Five years ago, did Jiang Nan take your money to pay off Shengyu Entertainment's penalty fee?

414
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,700
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

415
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
You don't need to know.

416
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,180
You just have to tell me "Yes" or "No".

417
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,440
Is that how you speak to me?

418
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,840
I don't want to mention what happened between you and Tian Cai Yun anymore.

419
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,020
Right now, I just want to know

420
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,200
if you gave Jiang Nan any hush money.

421
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,080
What hush money?

422
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,880
Talk to me after you've calmed down.

423
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,520
When I'm calm?

424
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:07,753
How can I be calm?

425
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,060
Jiang Nan was my best friend.

426
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,600
Even if we can't be on the stage together, we wouldn't end up like this.

427
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,880
It's all your fault for making me lose my friend and my dreams.

428
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,520
You're asking me to stay calm.

429
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,360
How can I stay calm?

430
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,660
Over the years, you've been trapped in your own thoughts.

431
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,280
But some things exist even if you choose to ignore them!

432
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,840
If you must blame someone for your mom's death before you can accept it,

433
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,340
I'm willing to be the scapegoat.

434
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,580
However, this has nothing to do with Jiang Nan.

435
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,560
It has nothing to do with him?

436
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,020
I saw you give him a card.

437
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,360
If it wasn't hush money, what was it?

438
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,580
I did want to give Jiang Nan money, but he didn't take it.

439
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,340
He-He didn't take it?

440
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,720
I gave him money because I knew he was going to sell his house.

441
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,280
Jiang Nan is a nice boy.

442
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,080
He lost his father. I couldn't bear to see him do that.

443
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,340
But he still didn't take it.

444
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,680
Plus, he didn't want me to tell you about this.

445
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,500
Zhi Lin, there's a lot you don't know.

446
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,140
Actually, a lot of people have been protecting you without you knowing.

447
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,380
Brother Cheng, thank you so much.

448
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,500
Don't mention it.

449
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,200
Have you noticed it's been a long time since Dark Black Bar has been this lively?

450
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,500
Who said?

451
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,700
- My business is great. 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

452
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,260
Put everything back in place after you're done.

453
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,160
Okay, okay, okay.

454
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,140
- Brother, can you go set up the speaker over there? 
 - Sure.

455
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,220
Lord Bao, have you seen Jiang Nan?

456
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,760
No. Weren't you two together?

457
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,400
He went out in the morning. I haven't seen him all day.

458
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,620
Wait.

459
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,440
He was the one who wanted to do this concert.

460
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,340
Is he going to drop the ball last minute again?

461
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,440
He was still preparing for the concert last night. He will definitely come.

462
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,820
Let me tell you, half of these people are reporters and the other half are here to watch the spectacle.

463
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,340
No one is really here for the concert.

464
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,620
Let me put it this way. We have to win this battle.

465
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,720
I'll call him again.

466
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,780
Why did you want to see me?

467
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,120
I want to ask you for a favor.

468
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,900
I have a performance at Dark Black tonight.

469
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,080
Can you sing a song with me on stage again?

470
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,520
This is also Xu Duo Cheng's wish too.

471
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,720
You and Xu Duo Cheng are pretty interesting.

472
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,220
You're both taking turns playing the sentiment card, right?

473
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,620
She came to see you?

474
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,000
You need to go ask her.

475
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,460
Jiang Nan, let me ask you one more time.

476
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,760
Why did you disband our duo back then?

477
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,840
I was the one who beat him up that night, right?

478
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
Yes.

479
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Your Uncle Zhan didn't support your music career at the time.

480
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,580
If you got yourself into trouble,

481
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,480
he'd never let you continue.

482
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,520
With Liang Zhe's abilities, he also wouldn't spare us easily.

483
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,060
If I didn't disband the duo,

484
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,320
you'd be dragged under as well.

485
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,280
According to what I know, that's not what happened.

486
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,860
You were embarrassed to see me after knowing my dad's relationship with your mom.

487
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,640
That's why you chose to disband, right?

488
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,760
I didn't know about what happened between them back then either.

489
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,500
You didn't know?

490
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,150
My mom went to see you

491
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,380
before she committed suicide.

492
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,140
Auntie Liang came to see me about terminating the contract.

493
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,500
 Jiang Nan, regarding you and Zhi Lin disbanding,

494
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,380
 is there no other choice?

495
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,300
 Auntie, there's no other way around this.

496
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,560
 I've already made a decision.

497
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,660
 Jiang Nan, I want to tell you that

498
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,480
 Zhi Lin has always thought highly of you and really trusts you.

499
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,680
 In his mind, you're his best friend.

500
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,740
 I really don't want the relationship between his dad and your mom

501
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,420
 to affect your relationship with him.

502
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,180
 - Auntie, you mean... 
 - Let me finish.

503
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,980
 It also took a lot of determination for me to come see you today.

504
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,340
 I know it's hard for you to accept

505
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:47,640
 what Zhi Lin's father did soon after your father passed away.

506
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,960
 But I want to tell you that Zhi Lin really doesn't know anything.

507
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,860
 He's innocent.

508
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,980
 I worry the most about Zhi Lin.

509
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,960
 Since he was little, he hasn't been a happy child.

510
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,120
 He changed a lot since meeting you.

511
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,640
 That's why you're very important to him.

512
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Forget it.

513
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,700
 You're innocent too.

514
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,160
 It's all the older generation's sins.

515
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,020
 Just pretend I never came to see you.

516
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
 I'm leaving first.

517
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,300
She was the one who told me about our parents at that time.

518
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,580
I thought about telling you the truth

519
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,140
but I was in shock too.

520
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,160
I needed time to digest this information too,

521
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,260
but I didn't expect Auntie Liang to...

522
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,840
She committed suicide after she went home.

523
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,460
You were in such a terrible state.

524
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,160
I really didn't know how to tell you.

525
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:55,380
After that, Uncle Zhan found me and said he'd pay the penalty fee for me.

526
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,940
But I refused.

527
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,800
 Thank you for keeping it from Zhan Zhi Lin.

528
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,420
 - In the future... 
 -  I got it.

529
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,020
 You don't have to tell me what to do in the future.

530
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,440
 Take this.

531
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,580
 I won't take your money.

532
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,579
 Zhan Zhi Lin hit him up because of me,

533
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:19,179
 so it's only right that I take the responsibility for him.

534
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,100
 As for the penalty fee, I'll take care of it myself.

535
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,220
 You don't need to worry about it.

536
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,980
I always thought

537
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,980
you owed me.

538
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,680
I never thought

539
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,560
you're the one who wants to protect me the most.

540
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:47,579
I'm the biggest idiot in this world.

541
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,600
Zhan Zhi Lin!

542
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,140
You still haven't been able to contact Jiang Nan?

543
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,100
No. He said he was going to pick up a surprise guest

544
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,580
but they're still not here.

545
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,100
There really is a surprise guest?

546
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,760
Did Jiang Nan really take this as a real concert?

547
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,820
 Boss, when will it start?

548
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,680
 - When will it start? 
 - It'll start soon.

549
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,920
 Exactly, when will it start?

550
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,060
 It still hasn't started.

551
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,480
I'll go.

552
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,900
Thank you for coming, everyone.

553
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,940
I am Jiang Nan's agent, Bao Rui.

554
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,820
Before the show begins, I want to take this chance

555
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,800
to provide a clear explanation regarding the recent news about Jiang Nan.

556
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,020
As our reporter friends know, there was going to be an interview session after the concert.

557
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,340
But since our guest is still on the way here,

558
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,480
I have no choice but to warm up the audience with a little gossip.

559
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,880
That day at Cool Singer-Songwriters,

560
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,400
Jiang Nan indeed hit someone backstage.

561
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,860
However, it was because he discovered the challenger Jian Xing

562
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,980
plagiarized his song.

563
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,720
It's certainly not right to hit someone,

564
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,800
so Jiang Nan will surely arrive to make an apology in person.

565
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,020
Why did you come downstairs?

566
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,080
Didn't we agree that I'd be in charge of these chores?

567
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,660
Honey,

568
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,360
if you still want to be with me, you have to tell me the truth today.

569
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,860
What is it?

570
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,660
I've been observing you for days.

571
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,540
Every time I look at your phone, it's all about your boss.

572
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,600
I only chose to be with you because you're good-natured and kind.

573
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,900
I was happy that you suddenly told me you had money to get married.

574
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
But if you got this money through immoral means,

575
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,760
no matter how nice the house is, will I feel at ease living here?

576
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,060
I...

577
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,620
I knew something was wrong with you when your boss came last time.

578
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,380
I didn't expose your lies for our child's sake.

579
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,140
How can you live with yourself?

580
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,700
I made a mistake. I had a lapse in judgement thinking about you and our child.

581
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,660
If you want the best for our child, you should set a good example for him.

582
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,480
I can't accept that my child's father is someone who betrays others.

583
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,820
What's the point of feeling conflicted here?

584
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,760
You still have time to make up for your mistake.

585
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,580
But I believe you should think about this,

586
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,660
if someone plagiarized something you created,

587
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,740
would you be angry?

588
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,260
You would definitely be angry,

589
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,480
but what's the most important point?

590
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,000
It's that Jian Xing started the fight.

591
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,240
An employee from our team went to confront him about this

592
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,000
and ended up getting hit.

593
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,960
Do you have proof of that?

594
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,140
Of course. Our staff turned on her voice recorder before she confronted him.

595
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,740
Please, listen to this.

596
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,340
 Jian Xing!

597
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340
 What are you doing?

598
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,460
 Why did you plagiarize Jiang Nan's song?

599
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,940
 Are you crazy?

600
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,340
 Don't leave!

601
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,000
 I heard everything when you were changing your music track.

602
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,920
 Your song is exactly like Jiang Nan's song.

603
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,220
 Are you crazy? Didn't Jiang Nan change songs?

604
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,000
 I've never heard of it.

605
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,400
 We have records of the original score and revisions of Jiang Nan's song.

606
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,420
 We can confront each other and see who plagiarized the song!

607
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,140
 If you don't explain yourself, I'll expose you to the media!

608
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,500
 Go expose it to the media.

609
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,560
 Since I dare use this song today, why would I be unprepared?

610
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 So, you admit you plagiarized the song?

611
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,780
 Let me tell you, watch your mouth!

612
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,400
 Jiang Nan will be done for sooner or later.

613
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,000
 Don't overestimate yourself!

614
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,940
A sound recording can be edited or forged. It's not enough to tell the truth.

615
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,060
Do you have more specific proof?

616
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,620
That means you're admitting to Jiang Nan's assault.

617
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,600
Jiang Nan assaulted Jian Xing five years ago.

618
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,240
How do you explain that?

619
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,480
Hurry and check Weibo! Jiang Nan is a hot search again!

620
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,840
Du Hua admitted he took pictures of Jiang Nan's music scores.

621
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
 - Hello?  
 - Hello.

622
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,000
 Authenticated evidence has been exposed.

623
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,240
 An overwhelming majority of netizens are supporting Jiang Nan.

624
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,660
Jian Xing is useless to us now.

625
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,740
  I got it.

626
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,100
I'll ask the production team to release a statement.

627
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,200
Jian Xing must drop out of the competition.

628
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,340
Seems like I have to think about

629
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,740
how to use our trump card Xu Duo Cheng.

630
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:40,030

631
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:49,607
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

632
00:40:49,607 --> 00:40:56,270
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

633
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:04,018
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

634
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:09,705
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

635
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:13,151
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

636
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:17,331
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

637
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:23,584
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

638
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:27,144
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

639
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:29,017
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

640
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:31,317
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

641
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:34,131
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

642
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:38,119
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

643
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,436
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

644
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:45,404
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

645
00:41:45,404 --> 00:41:49,690
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

646
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,539
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

647
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:55,830
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

648
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,964
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

649
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:02,998
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

650
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:06,797
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

651
00:42:06,797 --> 00:42:10,140
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

652
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,202
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

653
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:18,417
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

654
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:25,265
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

655
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:42,618
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

656
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:46,798
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

658
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:56,636

660
