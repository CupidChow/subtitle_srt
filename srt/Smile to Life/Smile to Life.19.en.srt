1
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,360
At that time,

2
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
I haven't performed a song for a long time.

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
I've been out of form.

4
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,520
It's like all of a sudden,

5
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,320
I lost my inspiration for music.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,520
I don't even like the songs I made.

7
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
Let's write this song again.

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,320
I believe

9
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,800
you've found your feelings for music.

10
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,480
But we don't have much time now.

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm not sure.

12
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
Do you want to hear

13
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
the story of me and this half song.

14
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,440
On the day I was diagnosed with gradual freezing,

15
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,240
it was as if my whole world had collapsed.

16
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,560
No one can understand

17
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,760
my feelings at that time.

18
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
Hello, dad,

20
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,720
girl,

21
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,200
You always say you don't have the strength recently,

22
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,640
what did the doctor say?

23
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
The doctor said,

24
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,720
I just lack exercise.

25
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,400
Okay, okay.

26
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,280
Well,

27
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,960
tell dad if you need anything,

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
Come back if there's nothing else.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,200
I'm waiting for you to come back for dinner.

30
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,959
So I accidentally found this score.

31
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,680
I didn't expect

32
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,200
this song to be full of power.

33
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
as if

34
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,880
I have a feeling that I don't admit defeat in life.

35
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
So I used it as an etude,

36
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
and taught it to my students.

37
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,920
Unexpectedly,

38
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
my music has a teaching function,

39
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Do I have to ask you for the copyright fee?

40
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
Isn't it enough to take me in?

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,760
Enough.

42
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Do you remember when I told you,

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,240
if one day,

44
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,840
I was lucky enough to meet the owner of this score,

45
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,600
so I have to tell him myself.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
In this world,

47
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,000
not everyone has a chance to pursue their dreams.

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,800
If he does,

49
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
don't give up easily.

50
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,680
This sentence,

51
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm officially giving it to you now.

52
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,880
Two decibels down here.

53
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,600
Listen,

54
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
Is the harmony too loud?

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,080
Lower the harmony by three decibels.

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay.

57
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,760
You drank it so early

58
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,200
Jiang Nan

59
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,680
I'm going to join the "Cool Sing Producers" soon.

60
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,880
< Cool Sing Producer > This show is so popular, aren't you afraid Jiang Nan will be more popular

61
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
than before?

62
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
At that time,

63
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,600
no matter how you hook your finger,

64
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,200
Gu Jiayi won't even look at you.

65
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,840
I can't help it. I'm telling you,

66
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Alex is such a brain-dead man,

67
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,760
So he looked for Jiang Nan. What can I do?

68
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,960
So Alex chose Jiangnan.

69
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,799
You're right

70
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,400
if you don't have a choice.

71
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,799
Sometimes capital is not everything,

72
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,679
no, no, no, no,

73
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,080
I don't think so.

74
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,440
If anyone can't get away with money,

75
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
I still invested part of it.

76
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,400
Here's what I'm thinking.

77
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,880
Let the hook out first.

78
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
It's convenient when you want to fish.

79
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,880
Do you still have ideas?

80
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,640
That's why I'm here

81
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,400
to discuss it with you.

82
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
What are you going to do?

83
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
The higher he climbs,

84
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,840
the worse he falls.

85
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,080
I like that kind very much.

86
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,920
How can I put it?

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
It's like that kind of

88
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,520
climbing up bit by bit,

89
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,960
The pleasure of

90
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
climbing to the top and falling.

91
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,560
Here's what I'm thinking,

92
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,320
I'm going to be in "Cool Sing Producers",

93
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,640
Put a man of my own in there.

94
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,160
Bind up with Jiang Nan,

95
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,120
create a topic,

96
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,240
What do you think?

97
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
I have a suitable candidate.

98
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,200
No one is more suitable than him.

99
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,040
In other words,

100
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,200
we should get together more often

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,880
when we're free.

102
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,760
Cheers!

103
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,920
Rui,

104
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:36,920
Mr. Bao,

105
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Du is here too.

106
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,280
Brother Nan,

107
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
can you two

108
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
stop showing off your love all the time?

109
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
Can you consider my feelings?

110
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Mr. Bao,

111
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,200
are you envious?

112
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,920
When are you going to take off the deal?

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,920
We are waiting to eat your dog food.

114
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,560
Jiang,

115
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,400
listen to me,

116
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,240
You've ruined Chengcheng.

117
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,040
Now she has started to talk about

118
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
which pot she doesn't open.

119
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,240
Got it?

120
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,960
Let me tell you,

121
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,120
the happiest of us here,

122
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,160
This guy

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,560
is going back to his hometown to get married today.

124
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,640
Du,

125
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,480
what about this?

126
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,960
It's a gift from Chengcheng and me.

127
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,040
Go back to your hometown and get married and come back soon.

128
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Bring your sister-in-law with you.

129
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,960
I don't want to see you two separate.

130
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
Thank you, Nan and sister-in-law.

131
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,800
Me,

132
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
Mr. Bao,

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
where's your red envelope?

134
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Hurry up.

135
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,520
Take it out.

136
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,840
What are you two looking at?

137
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,880
Am I such a stingy person?

138
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
But to get down to business,

139
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
I'll take Du to the station later,

140
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
You'll be fine

141
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,600
with the scene tonight.

142
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
I think I asked Lonely,

143
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes.

144
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,680
You don't even need me now.

145
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
You're right.

146
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,880
But Jiang,

147
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,360
listen to me,

148
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,880
You've been away from the stage for a long time,

149
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,520
can you win this battle?

150
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,880
It depends on today.

151
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,560
Got it.

152
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Why are you still so long-winded?

153
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,040
Let's go.

154
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,200
Bye.

155
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,200
Du,

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
happy wedding!

157
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,280
What do you think?

158
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,520
How am I now?

159
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,040
Your hair isn't messy.

160
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,040
No.

161
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,920
Come on!

162
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm not afraid of anything when you're here.

163
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,800
Brother,

164
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
Everything is ready.

165
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,800
Jiang Nan is the last one to go on stage,

166
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
as soon as he opens his mouth,

167
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,560
Just wait and see.

168
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
The person arranged by Mr. Liang is awesome.

169
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,960
Brother,

170
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,280
Why don't we

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,600
go to the scene

172
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,560
to see the effect?

173
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,000
There's nothing to see.

174
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,720
Just sing.

175
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,000
He even talked about the original intention of pursuing music.

176
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,360
Brother,

177
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
I'll go back now.

178
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,520
What's wrong?

179
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
Are you nervous?

180
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm nervous

181
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,160
when you're here,

182
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,280
I'll confirm the accompaniment.

183
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,080
I'll be back later.

184
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,280
Jiang Nan,

185
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
I feel like when we come to this show,

186
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,560
I'm here to be your supporting role.

187
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
Everyone can see that Alex values you very much.

188
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,320
I haven't heard your songs,

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,000
and you don't know what I'm going to sing.

190
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
So the show didn't start.

191
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,680
None of us know.

192
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,640
Who will be the winner?

193
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
It doesn't really matter

194
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,040
if I want to see who wins or not.

195
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,440
Jiang Nan,

196
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,280
you know Jane, right?

197
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,680
Yes,

198
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,680
What's wrong?

199
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,320
He joined us all of a sudden before recording.

200
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,840
He said he's a kicker.

201
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,840
What do you think Alex means?

202
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
Are you out of your mind?

203
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
Jiang Nan, Jiang Nan, say something.

204
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,840
Jiang Nan,

205
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,520
please respond to Jianxing's complaint.

206
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,040
Jiang Nan,

207
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,400
is it true that you want to terminate your contract with Shengyu?

208
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,920
Jiang Nan,

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
would you please respond?

210
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,280
Can you give me a positive response?

211
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,760
Give us an explanation.

212
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
Because Jiang Nan violently beat Jian Xing after drinking,

213
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
and the 2BeOne team went solo.

214
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,600
Shengyu terminated his contract with Jiang Nan,

215
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,640
who is about to pay a high termination fee.

216
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,960
As a result, his music career basically fell through.

217
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,600
My accompaniment has been adjusted

218
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,400
and I want to replace it,

219
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,120
Okay,

220
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
Can you tell me which edition it is?

221
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,160
Well,

222
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,320
it sounds exactly the same as

223
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
Jiang Nan's new song.

224
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes.

225
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,880
That's it.

226
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,480
Okay. Have you confirmed it?

227
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,840
Thank you.

228
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,680
You're welcome.

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,400
Hello,

230
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,040
sound engineer,

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,520
Do you have the latest version of the appearance sequence table?

232
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Who are you?

233
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,280
I'm from Jiangnan Team.

234
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,320
Thank you.

235
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,480
Drink at night,

236
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,160
Okay.

237
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,800
Jiang Nan,

238
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,360
long time no see,

239
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,920
Come on.

240
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,880
It's been a long time,

241
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,440
but you haven't changed.

242
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,480
Tell me,

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,160
who can win the first place

244
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,480
in this competition?

245
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,080
Come out.

246
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,680
What's wrong?

247
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,680
I went to confirm the accompaniment just now.

248
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,760
I found that Jianxing's song

249
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,360
is almost the same as yours.

250
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,440
Are you sure?

251
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,880
The coincidence degree is too high.

252
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,280
He's an airborne guest.

253
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,000
No one has informed us of his arrival,

254
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,400
and his order of appearance

255
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,640
is ahead of yours.

256
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,440
I think

257
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,120
there must be something wrong with it.

258
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,480
What should we do?

259
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,840
Let's change the song. The show

260
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
is only a few hours away.

261
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,359
Can you make it?

262
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
If Jianxing is here for me,

263
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,560
then changing the song is our only choice.

264
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,760
You don't believe me?

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,079
Yes,

266
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
I'll check with the accompanist.

267
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
We need to change the song.

268
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,880
Hey, Alex,

269
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
there's been an accident.

270
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,520
I might want to change a song.

271
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Let me tell you,

272
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,800
Jiang Nan changed the song temporarily.

273
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,320
So?

274
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,320
Change the song temporarily.

275
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,520
You can still play like this.

276
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
Who told him to be powerful?

277
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,960
No,

278
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,600
he's stalling all of us.

279
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
You can't do this.

280
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,920
And I have another one.

281
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,320
Change the song temporarily.

282
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,360
What should we do?

283
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,880
I think I was just a little nervous just now,

284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,880
and my breath wasn't stable,

285
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,120
But the judges gave me encouragement,

286
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,480
which made me feel warm.

287
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,120
Lin,

288
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,640
what show is this?

289
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,360
Why haven't we seen Jiang Nan yet?

290
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
Jiang Nan is the last one.

291
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,560
Just wait and see.

292
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,200
It seems that the program doesn't pay much attention to it.

293
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,480
What do you know?

294
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,080
It's called the finale.

295
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,040
Big names are the finale.

296
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
This brain is useful.

297
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,880
You only know how to eat and eat in one day.

298
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,520
If you keep doing this in the future,

299
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,440
why did you take so long to get a device?

300
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,400
How can you follow me?

301
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,720
Later,

302
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,520
Jiang Nan's plagiarized material won't be filmed.

303
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,280
Mr. Liang,

304
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
there's a situation like this,

305
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,840
I used Jiang Nan's song,

306
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,840
but I didn't expect my grandson to change the song temporarily.

307
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm not sure what's going on.

308
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,600
Yes, yes.

309
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,520
Wait a minute.

310
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,640
What are you doing?

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,760
Why did you copy Jiang Nan's song?

312
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,720
What's wrong with you?

313
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,280
Don't go.

314
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,400
You were modifying the music in the background,

315
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,640
I heard everything.

316
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,040
Your song is exactly the same as Jiang Nan's.

317
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,800
What's wrong with you?

318
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,960
Didn't Jiang Nan change the song?

319
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,960
I've never heard of it.

320
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,920
You changed the song because you copied Jiang Nan.

321
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,840
We have a record of Jiang Nan's original composition of this song,

322
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
and every adaptation of it.

323
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,640
We can confront each other,

324
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,520
and see who plagiarized who.

325
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't want to talk nonsense with you.

326
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,360
Jianxing,

327
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,480
although you and Jiang Nan had a grudge before,

328
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,520
But Jiang Nan has already paid the price.

329
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
Now that you're playing this trick on the show,

330
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,120
what do you want?

331
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,680
If you don't make it clear,

332
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
I'll expose you to the media.

333
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,920
You know

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
what Jiang Nan did before, right?

335
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,720
I remember now.

336
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,560
You're his girlfriend, right?

337
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,920
If you expose it to the media,

338
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
I dare to show this song today.

339
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,040
Do you think I'm unprepared?

340
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,720
If you want to make it public,

341
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,560
I'll be there for you.

342
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
So you admit that you plagiarized.

343
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,600
Listen,

344
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,160
watch your mouth.

345
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
Jiang Nan will die sooner or later.

346
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,200
Don't overreach yourself.

347
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Jiang Nan, calm down.

348
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,880
Jiang Nan,

349
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,160
Jiang Nan, let go.

350
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,040
Jiang Nan,

351
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,760
let go of me!

352
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,720
Calm down, Jiang Nan!

353
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,920
Let go!

354
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,760
How can they say that?

355
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,520
It's not like this at all.

356
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,400
It tastes so good.

357
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,560
In the past,

358
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,120
I used to think that drinking health soup was like confinement,

359
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,320
But now,

360
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,720
your cooking is getting better and better.

361
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
It has won the true biography of my father-in-law.

362
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
What time is it now?

363
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,040
Are you still in the mood to say that?

364
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,440
Besides,

365
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,040
why does Jianxing have your score?

366
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,120
Why did you hit Jianxing back then?

367
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,640
It's all in the past.

368
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,080
As for why he has my score,

369
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,400
tomorrow,

370
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,960
I need to have a good talk with Mr. Bao.

371
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,520
Chengcheng,

372
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,680
I'm sorry,

373
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
I made you worry today.

374
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,480
Then you have to promise me one thing.

375
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,160
later

376
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,840
No matter what happens,

377
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,440
you can't hit anyone again.

378
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,840
I promise you.

379
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,240
This article is too much.

380
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
It's said between the lines that

381
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,600
Jiang Nan has a problem with his character,

382
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,640
Old-fashioned puns are even hyped up,

383
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,960
and when they come up, they mock us,

384
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,440
I was playing basketball with her a few days ago,

385
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,320
which really pissed me off.

386
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,920
Alright,

387
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,160
don't be so angry.

388
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,640
Mr. Bao,

389
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,120
the phone,

390
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,840
It must be because the reporter is not answering the phone now,

391
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
why is Jianxing so disgusting?

392
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
If it wasn't for Orange,

393
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,400
Jiang Nan would have plagiarized.

394
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
Where on earth did he get the score?

395
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,840
In fact, not many people know this song.

396
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,200
Besides the rest of us,

397
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,840
there's another thing,

398
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
Du.

399
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,160
Now I think,

400
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,200
who leaked the score,

401
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,360
Now is not the most important thing,

402
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,560
the most important thing is what Jianxing will do next?

403
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,160
He saved up such a big game

404
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,760
but failed.

405
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,960
Jiang Nan even beat me up.

406
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm sure he won't let it go.

407
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,080
Alex

408
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,200
Hands-free. Hands-free.

409
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,200
Jiang Nan,

410
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
you let me down.

411
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Alex,

412
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,760
I'm sorry

413
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,840
for making such a big deal.

414
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,680
I was impulsive.

415
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,520
Excuse me, Mr. Alex.

416
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,680
I'm Bao Rui.

417
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,640
Here's the thing.

418
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I want to ask you something,

419
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,920
Did Jianxing tell you?

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,480
Why did Jiang Nan hit him?

421
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,760
He said Jiang Nan was jealous that he was airborne.

422
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,760
I haven't said a few words yet.

423
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,680
They got into a fight.

424
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
How … How could he be so silly?

425
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,920
No matter what,

426
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,080
Jiang Nan started it first,

427
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,960
It's his fault,

428
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,520
Jiang Nan.

429
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
You must take care of this for me.

430
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,600
Otherwise, I won't give you another chance.

431
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,800
Alex,

432
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,560
if the show is affected

433
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,920
by this incident.

434
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,080
I'm so sorry.

435
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,920
But what I want to tell you is,

436
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,200
I called Jianxing for a reason,

437
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,720
I didn't do it on impulse.

438
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,920
If I don't get the "cool singer producer"

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,080
because of this,

440
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,840
I won't regret it.

441
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,040
Young man,

442
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,720
don't be so talkative

443
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,720
and things have become like this.

444
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,200
It's better to let Jiang Nan and Jian Xing quit the competition directly.

445
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,600
I don't care about Jianxing.

446
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,680
But Jiang Nan,

447
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,320
he does have strength,

448
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,160
Besides,

449
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,440
I didn't expect that,

450
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,600
There are so many materials on him to dig,

451
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,200
let's take a look first.

452
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,520
anyway

453
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,600
Now that the show has become popular,

454
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,040
it would be even better if Jiang Nan is fine.

455
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,880
Continue to participate in the show.

456
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,280
More topics,

457
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:04,960
Jiang,

458
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,280
Why don't you let me talk?

459
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,600
He won't believe anything we say now.

460
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
The main thing is that this show

461
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,880
is really important to you.

462
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
In my opinion,

463
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,520
Alex won't give up on me easily

464
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,240
at the moment. This show has been very popular recently,

465
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,600
Understood.

466
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,400
Well,

467
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,320
I'll find some familiar reporters first,

468
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,280
Let's find a way to suppress the public opinion first.

469
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,880
Is that okay?

470
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,240
No hurry.

471
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
Like you said,

472
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Jianxing must have come prepared.

473
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,280
We have no other good choice

474
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,800
but to wait.

475
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,320
If that's the case,

476
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,040
I'll bring Chengcheng round to dinner first.

477
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,920
I haven't been to my father-in-law's place for a long time.

478
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm leaving.

479
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,440
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

480
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,400
Me.

481
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,840
Editor-in-Chief Qin,

482
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,200
what can I do for you?

483
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,240
Jiang Nan's article was written by you,

484
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,040
and you sent it out without my permission.

485
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,800
What do you mean?

486
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,000
Now the truth is the double editor-in-chief,

487
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,680
Mr. Liang means that I have the right to publish independently,

488
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,160
If you have any questions,

489
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,320
you can ask him.

490
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,280
First,

491
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
the two editors supervise each other,

492
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,560
You didn't attend the meeting at all.

493
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,080
It doesn't conform to the procedure at all.

494
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,880
Second,

495
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,120
your article is subjective,

496
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,520
The nature of incitement is strong,

497
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,360
which is not the style of truth at all.

498
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,600
Even the headline party on the Internet,

499
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,800
can't write something like you.

500
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,880
Kiki,

501
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,080
at least I brought you out,

502
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,280
That's it?

503
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
It's all in the past.

504
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,120
You still remember it so clearly.

505
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,240
You have your own style.

506
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,360
I have my own style.

507
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,480
What I want is the number of clicks.

508
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:49,920
Stop!

509
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,240
I know you have a problem with Jiang Nan.

510
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,240
But you don't have to do this at all.

511
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,520
What do you mean?

512
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,600
You said I was carrying private goods,

513
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,360
both of us know that.

514
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
What do I know?

515
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,120
You just think that

516
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
I'm your editor-in-chief.

517
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,640
You don't feel well.

518
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,920
Okay.

519
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,160
Now I'll let you know,

520
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,600
who is the real editor-in-chief here?

521
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,840
Let's put aside the work at hand,

522
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,720
and I'll make it clear to you today,

523
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,040
Mr. Liang

524
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,920
used to think that truth is not a good business,

525
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,680
It's because everyone's

526
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,520
previous style of doing things was too old-fashioned,

527
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,280
I was just following orders.

528
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,800
I hope you can cooperate with me.

529
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,920
There will be an explosion every week in the future.

530
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,720
It's linked to everyone's performance.

531
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,920
From today on,

532
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,240
report all your work directly to me.

533
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,480
Do you understand?

534
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Kiki, listen to

535
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,640
the truth. Since its establishment,

536
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,880
It was never mine alone.

537
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,880
It can't be yours alone.

538
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,040
Does it matter?

539
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,960
Your jobs are more important, right?

540
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,840
I used to call you "Sister Shan",

541
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
but now I know,

542
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
Shan is the female King Kong,

543
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
and Kiki is the monster in human skin.

544
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,120
-Jiang Nan. -Don't just sit there and eat meat. Jiang

545
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,680
Nan,

546
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,640
I've been staring at the TV for a long time,

547
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,800
but I didn't see you coming out.

548
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,640
What's going on?

549
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,560
It's old-fashioned again. Your current popular shows

550
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,000
are divided into next and next issues,

551
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,160
Am I right, Jiang Nan?

552
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,880
Really?

553
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,840
Uncle,

554
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,680
Auntie,

555
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,760
Here's the thing. When

556
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,440
we were recording the show yesterday,

557
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,800
Someone is making trouble backstage,

558
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,800
so the show may have to stop for a while.

559
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,200
Make trouble,

560
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,760
and then what?

561
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,840
You did it?

562
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
This kid,

563
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,120
Well

564
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,880
You're such a big man. Why do you still do it?

565
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,280
I have to say something to you.

566
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,960
You have to think twice when you're in trouble.

567
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Now that you have Chengcheng,

568
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,560
you have to calm down when something happens to you,

569
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,440
No, dad, you can't

570
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,680
do that,

571
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,880
It was that man who pushed me,

572
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,440
Jiang Nan

573
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,760
He did it to protect me.

574
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,080
Did he push you?

575
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,440
Uncle Dad,

576
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,000
what are you doing?

577
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,000
-Let go. -Uncle.

578
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,960
Sit down.

579
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,680
Uncle, sit down first. Uncle.

580
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,040
You... He

581
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,680
pushed our daughter,

582
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,520
You want to talk about this

583
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,000
uncle,

584
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,040
What are you doing, uncle?

585
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,040
Calm down.

586
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,360
Calm down.

587
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Are you hurt?

588
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,560
No.

589
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,880
Uncle and aunt,

590
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,120
because you hit someone,

591
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,560
So maybe there will be a lot of news about this

592
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,280
in the next few days.

593
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
But you don't have to worry about me.

594
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,160
Because the truth is not what they say.

595
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,720
Yes.

596
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,440
My parents

597
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,080
and others just want to take the opportunity to make a hype.

598
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Don't worry, Jiang Nan.

599
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,080
No matter what it says on the news,

600
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,240
we only trust you.

601
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,640
Yes.

602
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,600
Your aunt is right.

603
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,000
We all trust you.

604
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,960
We support you.

605
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,280
Eat,

606
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,600
eat,

607
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,600
eat. After this kind of thing,

608
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,120
Call me.

609
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:24,960
Chengcheng,

610
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,000
thank you for always being there for me.

611
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,240
Jiang Nan,

612
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,080
you're acting weird today.

613
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,240
What's wrong?

614
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
After such a big accident,

615
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
you're really not worried at all.

616
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
What is this?

617
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,880
No matter how bad it is,

618
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I've been through it.

619
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,960
When we were on fire,

620
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,280
people came to me every day,

621
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
It's like their commercial performances

622
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,440
are all tailor-made for me.

623
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,600
Not without me.

624
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,880
He's the main character wherever he goes.

625
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,120
But later,

626
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,880
after the dissolution of 2BeOne,

627
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,720
All the people around you are gone at once.

628
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,960
It's like for a moment,

629
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,360
everyone forgot about you.

630
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
But after being with you,

631
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,480
I'm more sure what's worth cherishing.

632
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
It's like nothing else matters.

633
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,040
Why on earth did you disband back then?

634
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,880
Many oranges,

635
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,440
I'm showing my true feelings to you, okay?

636
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
Can you cooperate with me and move me?

637
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,840
You're my boyfriend.

638
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,280
I want to know your past and future.

639
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,960
You really want to know?

640
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Five years ago,

641
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,080
Sister Yun, the boss of Shengyu,

642
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,920
The manager of our band,

643
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,760
took Zhan Zhilin and I

644
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
to a party.

645
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,840
Don't worry.

646
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,760
I'll take care

647
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,680
of you.

648
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,760
President Yang,

649
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,560
it's up to you to handle Nan's matter.

650
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,640
Nan,

651
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,480
Clothes,

652
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
See you off,

653
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,160
Mr. Yang, slow down.

654
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,080
I'm drunk.

655
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,280
Mr. Yang,

656
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,080
Mr. Yang, take care.

657
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,680
Lin Zi,

658
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,000
Lin Zi,

659
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,800
I can't do it anymore.

660
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,640
Maybe there's something unclear

661
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
between him and Yun.

662
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,560
What did you say?

663
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,200
I mean,

664
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,240
Jiang Nan is just a gigolo.

665
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,240
A man who eats soft food

666
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,640
and sleeps with wine,

667
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,920
Come on.

668
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,400
Lin, have a drink.

669
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,719
Come on.

670
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,120
You mean,

671
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,760
Zhan Zhilin was the one who beat him back then,

672
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,360
Uncle Zhan didn't support Zhilin Zhan

673
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,080
playing music at that time,

674
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,000
If Jane exposed him,

675
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,320
he might not have a chance to sing again.

676
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,080
At that time, Liang Zhe, because of Gu Jiayi,

677
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,480
had been targeting me.

678
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,280
But I think,

679
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
Jane asked Zhan Zhilin out,

680
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,760
Liang Zhe should have ordered it too.

681
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,480
Jianxing is not that bold,

682
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,719
did you tell Zhan Zhilin?

683
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,080
Why didn't you tell him?

684
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,440
You should let him know.

685
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
He's targeting you,

686
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,680
because of this.

687
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,360
But later on,

688
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,760
he didn't sing anymore.

689
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,800
All right,

690
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,880
today's story time,

691
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,720
That's it.

692
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,800
Let's talk about it next time.

693
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,360
By the way,

694
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,920
before we debuted,

695
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,800
The bar that often performs is around here.

696
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,840
Do you want to go and have a look?

697
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,960
Before I debut,

698
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,240
I want to go,

699
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:26,960
Let's go.

700
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,760
Jiang Nan,

701
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,280
it's a rare visitor.

702
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,640
-Long time no

703
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,920
see. -Yes.

704
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,160
It's been two or three years.

705
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,480
What would you like to drink?

706
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,200
What about today?

707
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,040
We won't drink anymore.

708
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,880
I'll keep her company.

709
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,160
Just give us non-alcoholic drinks.

710
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,680
Well,

711
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,240
this is

712
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
Brother Cheng who is the boss here,

713
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,760
He is a very loyal man.

714
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,360
Hello,

715
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,760
at that time,

716
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,160
We have to perform until 3: 00 PM every time.

717
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,600
I'm tired and hungry.

718
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,400
Where's Brother Cheng?

719
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,800
Then I'll prepare a midnight snack.

720
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,480
He even took out his private collection.

721
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,080
Do you want to go back in time?

722
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,560
I can watch a 2BeOne show.

723
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,720
You play the guitar,

724
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,920
Zhan Zhilin plays the bass,

725
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,960
At that time, you two had a tacit understanding.

726
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,040
I really envy the audience at that time.

727
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,120
Here you are

728
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,560
Here comes the private collection.

729
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,520
Wahaha,

730
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,520
Come on,

731
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,200
Cheers! Cheers!

732
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,120
Jianxing will be broadcasting live tomorrow,

733
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,520
and I've invited some media,

734
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,200
In this way,

735
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,520
Jiang Nan will make a big deal out of beating people,

736
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,400
Jianxing is a bad person.

737
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,400
After all these years,

738
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,160
You even complained that

739
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,720
Jianxing is just a chess piece,

740
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,720
Mr. Zhan, don't take him seriously.

741
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,600
But what I really don't understand is,

742
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,200
look at you, Jianxing Jiang Nan,

743
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,720
You used to work in the same company.

744
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
He's also a very good friend.

745
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,440
Why did you

746
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,120
end up like this?

747
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,560
I'll get going after chatting.

748
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,880
I won't talk anymore.

749
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,120
I won't ask.

750
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,400
Is that okay?

751
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,360
Today is a day to celebrate.

752
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,920
Drink,
