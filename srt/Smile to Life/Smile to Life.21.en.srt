1
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,400
Jiang Nan is here.

2
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,080
Jiang Nan. Jiang Nan.

3
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,720
Jiang Nan,

4
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
what do you think of that recording?

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,080
Is it really your driver who leaked the song?

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,520
Can you respond to

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
God Jiang Nannan? God Nan,

8
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,200
Jiang Nan,

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,600
is that recording real or not?

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,400
Answer me,

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:13,040
God Nan. God Nan.

12
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,600
< Cool Sing Producer > As for

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
this matter, I really should give you an explanation.

14
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,200
Like my girlfriend said,

15
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,960
since it's true,

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
You have to say it out loud.

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,760
Let everyone hear it.

18
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
My girlfriend

19
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
is the bravest person I've ever met,

20
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,160
The most optimistic girl.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,960
Over the past few months,

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,480
she has helped me a lot.

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
He also taught me a lot.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
She taught me how to express myself.

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,600
You also taught me

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
what love is?

27
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,680
So for today's performance,

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,680
it's a gift from me.

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,840
A lot of fish,

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,400
a lot of power,

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,920
A lot of stupidity,

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,280
a lot of love,

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,280
Many oranges,

34
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,480
thank you for being in my life.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,440
I love you.

36
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,840
Gosh,

37
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,280
the press conference changed into a confession scene in seconds,

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Jiang Nan is so good at it.

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,880
Zhilin,

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,760
have a good dinner.

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
I left soup for you.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,240
Remember to drink it when you come back.

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,160
Zhilin,

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,040
have you left the company?

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,280
When will you be home?

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
Are you tired from singing today?

47
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,839
Zhilin,

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,800
I heard your new song.

49
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
I'm so happy for you.

50
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,960
It's not easy for you and Jiang Nan to make a successful debut.

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
You must be fine.

52
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
You must be fine.

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,080
Mom,

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,640
You've always hoped that

55
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
Jiang Nan and I can make music well,

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,520
But I messed everything up.

57
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,640
For the next song,

58
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,720
I was going to invite a friend of mine,

59
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Sing with me.

60
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,160
This is also my girlfriend's wish.

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,480
We used to be best brothers.

62
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,680
Before we made our debut,

63
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,960
we sang together on this stage.

64
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
He must be talking about Zhan Zhilin.

65
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
It's a pity that 2BeOne was disbanded.

66
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,800
Yeah,

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
they were really popular back then.

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,800
But I think,

69
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,760
from now on, if we work together,

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Jiang can be even hotter.

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
I just want to say,

72
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,280
No matter what happened in the past,

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
I really miss it.

74
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,120
I miss the days

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,520
when I performed with him on this stage.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,760
Zhan Zhilin is here.

77
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,000
Take a look at

78
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
the latest rankings.

79
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
Jiang's ranking has soared.

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,240
If you look at Jianxing,

81
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,560
who has plunged 12 places,

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,200
Let me tell you,

83
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,800
our team is finally proud.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,440
No way.

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,680
I have to send a message to Qin Shan,

86
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,960
and ask her to write two more articles for you

87
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
while the iron is hot.

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
Are you contacting Shan now?

89
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
You're more diligent than contacting me.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,880
It's all because of you.

91
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,120
I have to beg Sis Shan, you mouth … Sis

92
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,440
Shan,

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,840
Shut up, Shan Shan.

94
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,920
If you think of her that way,

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,360
Let's get her together tomorrow.

96
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
How about having a celebration party at home

97
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,520
with hot pot?

98
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Good for you, Chengcheng. You're becoming

99
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,080
more and more like a hostess now.

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,240
How about this?

101
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,840
From now on,

102
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,160
you're the only one in charge of family affairs.

103
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,760
You mean hot pot?

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Let's have hot pot.

105
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,880
Let's invite Zhan Zhilin too.

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,240
I'll ask him,

107
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,920
but I don't think he'll come.

108
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,880
That means he doesn't have good luck.

109
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
There will be a lot of people coming home tomorrow,

110
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
so you have to go shopping with me.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,840
I'll listen to you.

112
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,400
We're going back.

113
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,440
Goodbye, Mr. Bao.

114
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,000
Bye.

115
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Goodbye.

116
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,240
Hello, Shan.

117
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,080
Hello,

118
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,600
my name is Zheng Feng,

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,360
The author of this painting,

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,960
what's the name of this painting?

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
< back >, this is the back of

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,160
your lover,

123
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,840
It seems that

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Zheng likes to draw the back of a woman,

125
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,440
Thank you.

126
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,000
It seems that you are also interested in my paintings.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,680
It's an honor.

128
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Many years ago,

129
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,520
I collected one.

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Why do you have this painting?

131
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Liang Shuqian,

132
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,880
do you remember?

133
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,280
You are.

134
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Her son

135
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,960
Liang Shuqian committed suicide because of you.

136
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,720
Because your dad

137
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,640
asked you to look for me, right?

138
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
All these years,

139
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,040
this misunderstanding,

140
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,040
It's time to clear up

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,760
the misunderstanding,

142
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,560
What misunderstanding?

143
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,400
Your mom and I,

144
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
we are just like each other in art.

145
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
It's not like what your dad thinks.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't do this to me.

147
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,480
how

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,160
I dare to do it but I dare not admit it.

149
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,680
Your mother came to me back then.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
I'm just learning to draw

151
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
and pass the time.

152
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,160
Did you see these paintings I drew?

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
It's very similar, isn't it?

154
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,760
That's right.

155
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,000
These paintings are all about your mother.

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,520
And your mom?

157
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,800
Every time, it's all about your dad.

158
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,960
If it's really like what you said,

159
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,520
then my dad told me,

160
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
She abandoned her because of you.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
That's why she committed suicide by jumping off a building.

162
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
She doesn't love me.

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
How could he kill himself for me?

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,160
This is your dad's one-sided guess, okay?

165
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
Before your mom passed away,

166
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,480
she contacted me,

167
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,400
She saw the message your dad sent Tian Caiyun.

168
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
I can't accept the reality.

169
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
And you framed your mother.

170
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
She said she cheated on me.

171
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,000
These messages,

172
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,640
you are the last message I sent before I died.

173
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
Without these things,

174
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
she and I

175
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,800
will be misunderstood forever.

176
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
Before my mom jumped off the building,

177
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
did you send Tian Caiyun a message?

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,040
She said she would take care of their mother and son.

179
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,680
How did you know that?

180
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
There's nothing

181
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,440
between her and Zheng Feng.

182
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,280
What exactly did Zheng Feng tell you?

183
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,640
Your mom doesn't love me anymore.

184
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,040
She asked me for a divorce

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
because she couldn't accept it.

186
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
You have to take care of Tian Caiyun,

187
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,560
who came to Zheng Feng to learn painting,

188
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,360
You're the one I drew every time.

189
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,400
She never let go of you.

190
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
If you don't love her,

191
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,240
why didn't you tell her earlier?

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
Why did you

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,760
make her suffer so much,

194
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,240
You sympathize with Tian Caiyun?

195
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,720
Take care of her widows and orphans,

196
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,480
but you,

197
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,320
Why are you so obsessed,

198
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
saying that you'd rather get a divorce,

199
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
I have to take care of her for the rest of my life.

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,480
All these years,

201
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,600
you've been so lukewarm to her

202
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
that you'd rather sleep in the company on weekends,

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't want to go home.

204
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I can see all of this.

205
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,640
My mom has been putting in a good word for you.

206
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,800
Why did you falsely accuse

207
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,280
my mom and Zheng Feng of making a mistake first?

208
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
It's my fault.

209
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,800
I didn't expect that,

210
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
I always thought your mom had someone else in her heart,

211
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,840
I didn't expect things to turn out this way.

212
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,240
Shuqian,

213
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
there's one thing,

214
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
I want to divorce you.

215
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:22,920
What?

216
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,560
I want to divorce you.

217
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
For what?

218
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,800
Because I love someone I shouldn't love.

219
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
And you, too,

220
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,680
fell in love with someone you shouldn't love.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
The person she's talking about,

222
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,600
is actually me.

223
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,120
Lift your feet.

224
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,760
Yes.

225
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,080
It's full of people today,

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,320
ever since we opened this online celebrity shop across the street,

227
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,360
They took away all our customers.

228
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
What's so good about it?

229
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Fancy.

230
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,760
I went there once,

231
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,240
so I put a rose in front of you.

232
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,160
I slapped you to pieces.

233
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,680
Is this a meal

234
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,000
or a magic trick?

235
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,560
When it comes to the taste,

236
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,560
it's really mediocre.

237
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,080
Boss,

238
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,960
are you open today?

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,760
Business, business,

240
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,760
business. Don't eat here.

241
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,560
There's a magician on the other side.

242
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,160
Let's go.

243
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,560
What's wrong with this young man?

244
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
That restaurant can also be called a hotel

245
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,440
online celebrity.

246
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,040
Now it's the age of flow,

247
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,880
if we invite stars to bring goods,

248
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,800
There are more customers.

249
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,520
Who cares about your stuff?

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,920
Don't even think about it.

251
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,360
What rose?

252
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,240
What magic?

253
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
Don't get into my family fun.

254
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,240
I won't learn even if I beat him to death.

255
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,240
I won't learn,

256
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,040
I won't learn,

257
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,840
Let me tell you,

258
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,560
our happy family always wins by taste.

259
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,600
I said,

260
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,040
star,

261
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
We have

262
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,640
Star,

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,160
Jiang Nan,

264
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,840
Yes.

265
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,680
Yes.

266
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,320
Is it appropriate?

267
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,480
We're almost a family.

268
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
What's wrong with that?

269
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,800
Beat and beat,

270
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,640
Okay.

271
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,840
You can't catch up with me.

272
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Chengcheng,

273
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,720
help me

274
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,680
answer the video.

275
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,160
Uncle,

276
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,080
Auntie,

277
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,520
Jiang Nan,

278
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,600
where's Chengcheng?

279
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,640
Dad, I'm here.

280
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,520
Chengcheng,

281
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,080
have you eaten yet?

282
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,880
I just finished eating.

283
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,680
What's wrong?

284
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
Here's the thing.

285
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,360
We've been through this.

286
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,720
He opened a restaurant,

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Lin said,

288
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,280
What kind of online celebrity shop is it?

289
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,680
He took away all our business.

290
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,440
Dad,

291
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,120
This online celebrity shop relies on publicity,

292
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,120
if it can really

293
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
rely on the taste of food,

294
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,880
Maybe it's not as good as ours.

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,520
Later,

296
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
we can do some publicity as well.

297
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,200
That's right, uncle.

298
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,240
I thought we updated the menu,

299
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,800
and made a lot of special dishes.

300
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
We can also take this opportunity to publicize it.

301
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,800
Well,

302
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,240
don't bother.

303
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,560
Don't bother,

304
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,280
uncle.

305
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,480
Don't be polite to me.

306
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
What's so troublesome about your own business?

307
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,520
That's what I should do.

308
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
Thank you.

309
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
You youngsters have a lot of ideas.

310
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,240
Mom,

311
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,240
Don't worry.

312
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,320
All right,

313
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,240
there's nothing else.

314
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm hanging up.

315
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm hanging up.

316
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,440
It's done.

317
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,800
What do you think if I go to the store to broadcast live?

318
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Where's my health channel now?

319
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,720
There are more than 100, 000 fans,

320
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,560
which is a small amount of traffic.

321
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,480
I'm the one who has ready-made traffic, okay?

322
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,040
You don't fit in.

323
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,800
You've always been cold,

324
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,640
facing you,

325
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,520
I don't have many rollovers.

326
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,720
Besides,

327
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm not afraid of more than one more time.

328
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
And the family fun is genuine.

329
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,560
I can carry the goods with ease.

330
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,560
Let's do the live stream together.

331
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,520
Okay.

332
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,120
Go on.

333
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,560
If I want it, I don't believe

334
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
I can't beat you. I'm more than you. I want it.

335
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,280
Isn't Chief Qin awesome?

336
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,520
We just want to see

337
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
how amazing it is?

338
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,840
I heard that you really like to see injustice on the road,

339
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
but if something happens to you today,

340
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,520
Will someone come

341
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,079
to help you? Who are you?

342
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,599
Let's go.

343
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,400
Let go of me!

344
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,520
Let go of me!

345
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,760
Do you want canned chicken today?

346
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,440
Or do you want canned beef?

347
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,960
Or do you want to eat canned pork?

348
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,880
Tell me,

349
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,040
I'll satisfy you.

350
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,079
Help!

351
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,200
Let go of me!

352
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,839
Why are you letting go of me?

353
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,119
Who are you?

354
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,920
Call the police.

355
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,240
Don't move.

356
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,440
Try moving one more.

357
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,080
Don't come near me.

358
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,320
Stop! Stop!

359
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,360
I've called the police.

360
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,360
The police will be here soon.

361
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,520
None of you can escape.

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,880
You can't escape.

363
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,240
Let's go!

364
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,240
Are you okay?

365
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm fine.

366
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,640
Didn't I tell you to call the police?

367
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,640
Why are you back?

368
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,440
I can't even find my phone.

369
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
How can I call the police?

370
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,040
Why didn't I come to save you?

371
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,320
Why are you trying to be so strong at this moment?

372
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,920
When this happens,

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,640
men and women are not of the same order of magnitude at all.

374
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,760
You're getting farther and farther away.

375
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
is the greatest help to me.

376
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,360
I can protect you.

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,280
Protect me.

378
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,240
You look so skinny.

379
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,240
Why are you looking down on me?

380
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
This is called dressing slim and undressing with meat.

381
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,040
I'm not only fishing but also working out.

382
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,160
How about this?

383
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,960
Who are they?

384
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,640
It must be Liang Zhe's men.

385
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,120
Tell me,

386
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,720
if I didn't show up just now,

387
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,640
What if they really take you away?

388
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,720
Having a dog for a thousand days,

389
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,080
using a dog for a while,

390
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,240
Why is that so weird?

391
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,880
No way.

392
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,760
I can't let them run away like this.

393
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,640
I have to call the police.

394
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,280
Hunian,

395
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,520
stop messing around.

396
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Do you have any proof?

397
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,760
No.

398
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,640
That's it.

399
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,440
From now on, I'll pick you up

400
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
and pick me up on your trip,

401
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,600
This has happened.

402
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,320
If I don't pick up, who will?

403
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
And we live in the same neighborhood.

404
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,760
Shut up!

405
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,520
Don't argue.

406
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,600
go home

407
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,080
Why didn't you come out wearing a mask?

408
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,280
What if someone recognizes me?

409
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm fine.

410
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,520
Why did you buy so much orange juice?

411
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,440
Take it home and drink it.

412
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,920
Which brand do you like?

413
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,720
Are you Jiang Nan?

414
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,840
Yes

415
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,880
That's great.

416
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
Can I take a picture with you?

417
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
This is my personal time with my girlfriend.

418
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
I won't take photos or sign autographs.

419
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,360
Let's just take a picture.

420
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,040
It'll be one soon.

421
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,200
-Yes. -Let's just take one photo. Can

422
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,360
we just take one photo?

423
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,840
Let's take a picture then.

424
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,640
All right.

425
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,360
Three, two, one.

426
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Beef,

427
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,840
Beef,

428
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,320
No,

429
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,920
no,

430
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,640
no, no. I won't buy this.

431
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,520
It's grass-fed,

432
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,200
this kind,

433
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,080
That's right.

434
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,320
Jiang loves beef so much.

435
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,040
Give me another box.

436
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,200
And then?

437
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,480
Later, we'll go to the vegetable shop

438
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,320
to buy onions, green peppers

439
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,960
and so on.

440
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,040
What else?

441
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,520
Chicken wings. Yes,

442
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,480
chicken wings. Chicken wings,

443
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,320
He loves cola chicken wings very much,

444
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I found that you are full of Jiang Nan's

445
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,320
most competent agent and you must be the one.

446
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm used to it.

447
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,440
Do you like ribs?

448
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,320
I'm a great cook of ribs.

449
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,600
I have acne,

450
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,160
No,

451
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,240
I ate the ribs I made,

452
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,400
The acne

453
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,440
will go away. Come on.

454
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,840
The ribs are great.

455
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,840
Why didn't you answer the phone?

456
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,800
No answer

457
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,400
< Cool Sing Producers > Those guys, they didn't let Jiang continue to participate in the

458
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,480
show before,

459
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,480
Now he keeps chasing after me to apologize.

460
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,960
Then I have to put on airs.

461
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,680
Am I right?

462
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,200
All right,

463
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,960
don't take advantage of me and be a good girl.

464
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,560
You have no idea how free I was.

465
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
Now that you finally get up,

466
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,840
I have to humblebrag about it.

467
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,840
Actually, I'm really, really annoyed right now,

468
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,520
you said there are so many people every day,

469
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,040
They lined up to look for Jiang.

470
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,840
I don't even know how to arrange this schedule.

471
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,240
We need to analyze it together.

472
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,440
How do you plan this time reasonably?

473
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
You're doing it again.

474
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,080
That's right.

475
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,360
Look how perfect they are.

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,600
New Year's love is the sweetest now.

477
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,920
As long as the maintenance is done well,

478
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,400
my boyfriend is in the college entrance examination this year.

479
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,880
Let's go buy onions.

480
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,360
Boss, you're here to try the new zither.

481
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,680
Many oranges haven't come to class recently?

482
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,720
He seldom comes here.

483
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,600
She pushed a lot of students,

484
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
so she might not be able to teach them.

485
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I'll get back to work then.

486
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,440
Many oranges are really the lucky generals of Jiangnan.

487
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,360
Of course not.

488
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
But if Jiang can make it this far,

489
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,880
he needs your help.

490
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,600
Thank you.

491
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,120
You're welcome.

492
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,240
I'll do it.

493
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,440
You can do it.

494
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,360
I can do it.

495
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,680
I really can't see how simple it is.

496
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,280
Mr. Bao and my sister can still be friends,

497
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,760
Are you okay?

498
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,560
It's okay.

499
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,560
You're really stupid.

500
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Well,

501
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,000
Jiang Nan,

502
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,520
I bought some more things.

503
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Come with me to get them.

504
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,280
Okay, Sis Shan.

505
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,560
I'm going to get my stuff.

506
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,160
Are you okay?

507
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,160
It's okay.

508
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,320
My sister is smiling at you.

509
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,200
I've never seen her like this before.

510
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,640
Teach me a few tricks.

511
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,520
Help me make peace with Keqin.

512
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
What's going on between them?

513
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm not

514
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,920
… Your sister and I … That's a special case,

515
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,000
It's another matter.

516
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,160
Besides, you don't have to use the tricks I taught you before,

517
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,480
I can't play hard to get with my dear friends.

518
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
Keqin is like a magnet.

519
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,640
What about me?

520
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,120
Just like a small nail,

521
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,560
where should I go?

522
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,240
If you don't understand,

523
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,360
let's do what we want.

524
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,240
Jiang Nan is so nice to you.

525
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,560
You also have someone who treats you unconditionally.

526
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,400
Since everyone is here tonight,

527
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,360
do you want to have a drink?

528
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm going to buy

529
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,200
some wine. Don't go.

530
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,320
There's wine downstairs.

531
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,880
I'll get it.

532
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,480
Okay,

533
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,360
No.

534
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
What does she like to eat and play?

535
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I know that, too.

536
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Who asked you that?

537
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,880
Let me ask you.

538
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,040
What kind of man does Keqin like?

539
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,880
Do you understand?

540
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,680
If she likes cool guys,

541
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,960
then you'll be cool.

542
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,640
Am I not cool?

543
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,040
I'm very popular in America, okay?

544
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,000
I just can't be cool with Keqin.

545
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,240
Maybe I'm fat and weak.

546
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,960
It's deeply rooted in people's hearts.

547
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,560
Then pretend to be a stranger,

548
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,640
and let her get rid of her previous impression of you.

549
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,160
I'll get to know you again.

550
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,880
How can I pretend?

551
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,960
Plastic surgery.

552
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,960
Do you have a trumpet?

553
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,640
I really have a Weibo account that I don't know about,

554
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,920
so use it.

555
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,280
Use it.

556
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Use it.

557
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,800
Use it.

558
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,480
Use it.

559
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Use

560
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,920
Shan,

561
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,960
why did you buy so many things?

562
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,640
Of course.

563
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,600
It's not easy to get together for a meal,

564
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,600
but you can't eat something good.

565
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,760
amiable

566
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,720
Where's Chengcheng?

567
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,200
She went downstairs to get some wine.

568
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,440
Chengcheng,

569
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,000
don't move.

570
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,640
Let me get it for you.

571
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,600
It's okay.

572
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,760
I've already taken it.

573
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,040
What's wrong with your hand?

574
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,840
It's okay. I stretched it just now.

575
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,000
Okay,

576
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,040
in the idol drama,

577
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,560
The female lead falls into the male lead's arms in a fancy way.

578
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,800
I can't believe it's really happening in my life.

579
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,720
We fell together

580
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,560
but didn't kiss each other.

581
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
This one needs to be repeated.

582
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,200
Free dog food is enough.

583
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,160
All right,

584
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,440
envy and hate.

585
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,640
Do you want to eat hotpot?

586
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,840
Eat,

587
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,800
Cheers!

588
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,440
Don't get bored.

589
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,280
Get Orange some food.

590
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,040
She can't reach it.

591
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,160
Why is this wine sweeter than usual?

592
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,200
Yes, I think so, too.

593
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,200
Mix some dog food.

594
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,280
I think it tastes better.

595
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,560
You two should get married.

596
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,960
I want to be the prettiest bridesmaid.

597
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,120
Don't be a singer.

598
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,800
You can shoot an idol drama.

599
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,360
What are you talking about?

600
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,040
Hurry up and eat,

601
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,960
Chengcheng.

602
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,120
You have to eat more.

603
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
That's too much.

604
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,840
I can't eat it.

605
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,640
No.

606
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,800
You must get more nutrition now.

607
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,400
My hand hurts.

608
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,240
Let me put some stickers on it.

609
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,640
Okay.

610
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,800
I want to eat it.

611
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,920
Be careful next time.

612
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,960
What are you looking at? Eat it.

613
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,560
I'm fine.

614
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,000
Brother Rui,

615
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,800
I got a reply from my Weibo account Keqin.

616
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,920
Keep a low profile.

617
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,600
Push harder.

618
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Push harder. I'm already

619
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
pushing harder.

620
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,960
Now it seems that,

621
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,240
except for the calf,

622
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,600
The muscle in your left hand is also losing.

623
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,640
Actually, you fell down this time.

624
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,320
It's also because your arm muscles

625
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
are losing too fast.

626
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,760
That's why you're not strong enough.

627
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,080
These contusions don't really matter.

628
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,120
I'll be fine in a few days.

629
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,120
The key is muscle loss.

630
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,000
If this situation continues to develop,

631
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,400
the next step

632
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,440
is likely to be the chicken claw hand.

633
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
Chicken Claw Hand,

634
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,080
Yes.

635
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,080
If you massage more often,

636
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,520
the situation should be delayed.

637
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,160
Okay,

638
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,920
thank you, Dr. Sui.

639
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,600
Chicken Claw Hand,

640
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,240
how can my hand not be discovered?

641
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,600
Why did the patient in Bed No. 3 do it again?

642
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,920
I don't know what's going on.

643
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,760
Go, go, go!

644
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,200
Jiang Nan,

645
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,680
the point is that black-haired pig,

646
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,640
Black-haired pig, right?

647
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,200
With the ribs,

648
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,200
Chengcheng is here.

649
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,520
This is so well prepared.

650
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,320
It's...

651
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,560
It's all dad's specialty,

652
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
That's a must-have signature dish.

653
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,520
Wait.

654
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,600
Chengcheng, what's wrong with your hand?

655
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,640
I accidentally

656
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
fell down and sprained my hand.

657
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,760
How old

658
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,280
are you now that you're holding on to this child?

659
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,120
You're still so careless.

660
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,720
I don't know anyone else,

661
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,920
if it's my girlfriend,

662
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,600
I won't let her get hurt.

663
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Lin,

664
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,080
why do I feel the light is so dim?

665
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,120
You didn't finish it, right?

666
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
This lamp is like this.

667
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,000
Look,

668
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,280
he did the right thing.

669
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,920
Why didn't you ask me to go to the hospital with you?

670
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,320
It's okay.

671
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,120
Don't worry.

672
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,000
Does it still hurt?

673
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,440
A little bit.

674
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,680
Don't dawdle. Hurry up.

675
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,280
Ready to go.

676
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,520
Hello, I'm Duoduo,

677
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,760
the video host who lived to ninety-nine years old,

678
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,800
What about today?

679
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,640
We have a handsome and special guest

680
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,080
in our live streaming room.

681
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,720
That's Jiang Nan.

682
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,640
Hello,

683
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm Jiang Nan.

684
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,840
This is my first time on a live food stream,

685
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,120
please give me more likes.

686
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,600
Today we invite Jiang Nan

687
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,120
to our live streaming room,

688
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,840
I want to introduce you to

689
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,720
a very special restaurant,

690
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
As you all know,

691
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,840
I'm a healthy girl,

692
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,840
So I usually cook by myself,

693
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,520
but what about this restaurant?

694
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,440
Its ingredients are very fresh and distinctive,

695
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,040
that's right,

696
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,600
What about this?

697
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,600
Jiang Nan,

698
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
for the sake of many oranges,

699
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,200
I can't believe you're willing to do such a thing.

700
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,280
Sis,

701
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,320
Let's not watch this live video.

702
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,560
Why not?

703
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,880
I'd like to see

704
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,520
Jiangnan and many oranges,

705
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,360
How awesome it is to make the family happy.

706
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,440
Friends, if you have time,

707
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,080
you must come and have a taste.

708
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,120
You can really

709
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,120
feel like a monk in here.

710
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,720
The online celebrity store across the street,

711
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,640
is definitely not doing as well as ours.

712
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,280
Family fun is waiting for everyone to come.

713
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,520
Secretary Ding,

714
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,400
from now on, all the company dinners

715
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,560
will be arranged for family fun,

716
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,560
Report to me when you're done.

717
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,640
Sis,

718
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,960
Why did you give a thumbs-up?

719
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,200
It's about to be cancelled.

720
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
I accidentally slipped my hand.

721
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,440
It's not too late to cancel it now.

722
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,160
Today, Lao Wang will show you

723
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,520
this family-friendly dish.

724
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,960
This is Lao Wang's first time here. Welcome to come again.

725
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,640
It's said to be very delicious.

726
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,800
Take a look at this dish.

727
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,640
Mr. Liu,

728
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,440
are there any special offers

729
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,840
in our store lately?

730
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,160
The dishes are 20% off, 20% off,

731
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,880
20% off,

732
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Fans in the live stream,

733
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,040
25% off for the audience.

734
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,920
I, Lao Wang, will make up for the rest myself.

735
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,360
Welcome all my family and friends to join us.

736
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,080
Come and join us.

737
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,760
Okay,

738
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
Let's enjoy the dishes.

739
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,080
Mr. Liu,

740
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,480
our food is very delicious,

741
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,240
Can you book us a private room next time?

742
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,000
No problem.

743
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
We're all regular customers.

744
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,720
Enjoy yourselves.

745
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,720
Don't mention it.

746
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,120
Zhang is here.

747
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,400
Isn't your food delicious?

748
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,080
Let me tell you,

749
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,480
I recommended your place to my friend.

750
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,800
He asked his father to celebrate his 70th birthday with you.

751
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
Don't screw it up.

752
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,480
Don't worry,

753
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,080
I'm sure I'll make it lively for him.

754
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,720
Uncle Liu,

755
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,600
The business is so good.

756
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,320
Well,

757
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,160
let me help you.

758
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,960
No need.

759
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,560
If you have the time,

760
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,240
you might as well go on a date with Jiang Nan.

761
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,600
Jiang Nan is busy writing music every day.

762
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,760
The waiter

763
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,640
is here to order.

764
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,640
Uncle Liu, I'll go.

765
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,160
Gu Jiayi,

766
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,280
Gu Jiayi is here.

767
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,520
It's really Gu Jiayi.

768
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,080
I wanted to keep a low profile,

769
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,120
but I didn't expect everyone to recognize me.

770
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm here.

771
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,760
I'm also attracted by the family's dishes.

772
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,920
I hope you can treat me like a normal person.

773
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,360
Enjoy the food.

774
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,400
Gu Jiayi used to be Jiang Nan's ex-girlfriend,

775
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,800
why did she come here?

776
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,840
Besides,

777
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
she helped us promote

778
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,639
Miss Family Fun,

779
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,360
We don't have any seats left.

780
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,320
It's okay.

781
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,560
I can spell the table,

782
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,960
What?

783
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,960
Aren't you welcome?

784
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,360
Welcome.

785
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,159
What would you like to eat?

786
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,400
Help me order some of your signboards.

787
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,840
Do you have any taboos?

788
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
I'm allergic to peanuts.

789
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,600
Thank you.

790
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,239
Lin,

791
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,159
there will be a dish of cold spinach later.

792
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,639
Don't put peanuts in it.

793
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,679
Customers will be allergic

794
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,560
if they eat it. Okay.

795
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,400
Chengcheng,

796
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
get some rest.

797
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,199
Don't tire yourself out.

798
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,159
Got it, Dad.

799
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,560
Don't forget and make no mistake.

800
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,760
Don't worry.

801
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm sorry.

802
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,200
Your dishes are all served.

803
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,360
Chengcheng,

804
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,720
your food is really good.

805
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,600
It's clean and hygienic.

806
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,360
That's right.

807
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,360
Miss Gu praised me,

808
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,440
your family will be popular.

809
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,320
Thank you.

810
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,040
Miss Gu, eat.

811
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,320
You can eat too.

812
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,600
Chengcheng,

813
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,120
I'll take care of the dishes.

814
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,960
What are you going to do?

815
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,200
It's okay.

816
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,040
The shop is so busy,

817
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,040
and we don't have enough manpower.

818
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,000
Besides, when we run a shop and do business here,

819
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,640
it's better to have one more thing than one less thing.

820
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,320
Right?

821
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,400
It's okay,

822
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,760
Miss Gu.

823
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,240
Help!

824
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
What's wrong, Miss Gu?

825
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,280
Miss Gu, what's wrong with you?

826
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,600
What's going on?

827
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,000
Are you allergic?

828
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,800
Uncle Liu,

829
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,760
call an ambulance!

830
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
Okay, Miss Gu.

831
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,320
Don't crowd around here.

832
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,240
Master,

833
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,920
Master,

834
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,440
Why are you making such a fuss?

835
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,360
There's a guest outside,

836
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,960
who's allergic to our food.

837
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,560
What?

838
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,560
Allergic,

839
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,080
Allergic,

840
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,800
Yes.

841
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,440
I think it's serious.

842
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,600
I even called an ambulance.

843
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,360
Call an ambulance.
