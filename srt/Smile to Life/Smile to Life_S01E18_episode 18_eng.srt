00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,672
♫  I've walked around in a big circle  ♫

3
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,912
♫  To finally meet you  ♫

4
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:19,212
♫  How can my love be restrained?  ♫

5
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:24,487
♫  My love for you is too obvious  ♫

6
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:30,345
♫  I guess you must have already discovered it  ♫

7
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,059
♫  On that clear evening  ♫

8
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,564
♫  It was romantic meeting you  ♫

9
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:38,946
♫  An unforgettable memory  ♫

10
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,645
♫  I heard that passionate love  ♫

11
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,459
♫  Can dissolve glaciers  ♫

12
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:48,346
♫  I say good night to you every night  ♫

13
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:51,173
♫  If you get used to it as well  ♫

14
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:53,786
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

15
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,433
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

16
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,800
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you   ♫

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,515
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

18
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,856
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

19
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:10,703
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

20
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,457
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

21
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,291
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

22
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,298
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

23
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:21,111
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

24
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:25,670
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,189
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

26
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:45,160
    🎈

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,999

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
What are you doing?

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
You're awake?

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,760
I want to exercise with you from now on.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,160
By the way, I made a schedule.

32
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,100
I want to exercise with you every morning

33
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,120
and give you a massage every night.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,240
Also, I promise I will never miss out on all your future checkups.

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,140
What smells so good?

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,480
Come with me.

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,400
This smells so good.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,720
It's chicken soup with wild mushrooms.

39
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,000
I looked it up.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Turns out mushrooms have medicinal value too.

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,260
It can be compared to ginseng.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,280
Say that again.

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,260
Why?

44
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,340
I haven't posted any videos in a few days.

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,900
I lost a lot of fans. Come on.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,040
Morchella is rich in various amino acids and organic germanium that the human body needs.

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,500
Agrocybe can clear internal heat and it's good for the eyes.

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,760
It's nutritious but not greasy.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,940
Okay.

50
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,920
Have some soup first.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,100
Sometimes I think this all feels very unrealistic.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm here.

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll always be here.

54
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,733
Have a sip.

55
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
Here.

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,100
It's a latte made with rose tea and coffee.

57
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,520
Try it.

58
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
It's tasty.

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
It's good that you like it.

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,226
If you don't have any lessons at the music instrument store today,

61
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,080
do you want to come with me to the production studio?

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,680
Can I?

63
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,960
Although I wrote lyrics for someone before,

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,420
I have no idea how a complete song is created.

65
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,840
Your boyfriend has a music studio,

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,560
and you wrote lyrics for someone else?

67
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,980
Why haven't you told me about it?

68
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,280
I posted them on my side account.

69
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,360
I didn't expect anyone to really look at them.

70
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,880
I sold about three songs and earned over ¥30,000.

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,920
When you broke up with me and said you'd pay me over ¥200,000 back,

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,060
that was how you saved up for it?

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,800
Look at you, you're quite the earner.

74
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,380
Let's put your work aside, everyone.

75
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,320
I have an announcement to make.

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
To strive for a better future,

77
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,020
our corporate carried out an equity transfer to ensure an inflow of capital.

78
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,800
Based on President Liang's instructions,

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
True Image will implement a joint chief editor system.

80
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,480
From now on, Qi Qi will also be a chief editor in True Image.

81
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
Thank you, Chief Editor Qin.

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,560
I hope to have a pleasant cooperation with everyone in the future.

83
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,220
Si You, Peng Fei, and Jia Wei, come with me.

84
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,760
I can't believe Qi Qi is able to ride on Mr. Liang's coattails so quickly.

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,580
She even wants to step over Sister Shan.

86
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,580
Seems like my cousin will have a hard time fending for herself.

87
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,160
No, I have to go see her.

88
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,380
Come on. I'll follow your side account.

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,420
Why does this ID seem so familiar?

90
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm familiar with your ID too.

91
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,840
I remember.

92
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,920
- Did you use the same ID to create a channel on the beta version of KuGou? 
 -  Yes.

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,720
I followed a lot of channels that were created by this ID.

94
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,840
I even participated in the channel incentive program on the beta version of KuGou last month.

95
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
I even got a cash bonus.

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
Did you create a music channel with your ID in secret too?

97
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,780
I followed that too.

98
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,790

99
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,230

100
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,080

101
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
Look.

102
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,780
Not bad.

103
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,180
Seems like you are quite a rich girl.

104
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,440
Hats off to you.

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,120
Please, take good care of me in the future.

106
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,820
I don't want to.

107
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,000
But then again, Cheng Cheng,

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,560
would it be too tiring for you to take on so many odd jobs?

109
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,820
Do you want to quit your job at the music instrument store?

110
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,200
No, my student likes me so much.

111
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,700
She and her parents specially asked me to teach her.

112
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,120
I can't let them down.

113
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,100
Sit tight. We're heading out.

114
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,800
Oh, God.

115
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,500
That's what a recording studio looks like.

116
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,360
This is my first time in a recording studio.

117
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,360
I... I really don't understand anything.

118
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,220
Can you teach me?

119
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,080
Actually, the production process of a song is very simple.

120
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
We usually start with composing the song and make a demo.

121
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,540
Then, we write the lyrics and make instrumental arrangements.

122
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,160
The final style of the arrangement will be decided based on a particular scenario.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,800
After we finish that process, we can start to record the song, right in there.

124
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,480
We'll record the vocal first and the musical instruments after.

125
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,180
After that, it's audio editing, mixing, and recording the master tape.

126
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,880
At last, we just choose a date to release the song.

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,900
My goodness.

128
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,920
You call that easy?

129
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,020
You're so good.

130
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,280
Cheng Cheng, do you want to try recording "Cola Chicken Wings" with me?

131
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
Me?

132
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Didn't you say you wanted to leave your mark on this world?

133
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,540
From now on, all my songs will have a separate version with you.

134
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Don't be afraid. I'll do it with you.

135
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,160
Come on. Don't be nervous.

136
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,520
Don't be so nervous.

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,800
Come on. Stand here. I'll adjust it.

138
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,060
Cheng Cheng, come take a deep breath with me to relax.

139
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,280
Breath out.

140
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,520
Do it again. Breath in.

141
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,740
Do you feel better?

142
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,060
Cheng Cheng, listen to the song's intro.

143
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,680
You can imagine that this song might be played at our bedside.

144
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,760
It might also be played in the subway,

145
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,680
in a classroom, or in a coffee shop.

146
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,220
Most importantly, your voice will be in this song now.

147
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,360
Don't you feel happy and a sense of accomplishment instantly?

148
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,520

00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:45,617
♫  There's sauce at the corners of your smile   ♫

164
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:50,928
♫  I want to grow old with you like this  ♫

165
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,660
What? You're living upstairs from my cousin?

166
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,940
I ran into her when I was throwing out the garbage last night.

167
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,100
You're the one

168
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,220
who lives upstairs from her and came out of nowhere in the middle of the night.

169
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,320
Stop with the nonsense.

170
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,620
Be serious. Help me find out what's going on with True Image now.

171
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,660
 Lao Jiang has bad history with Liang Zhe after all.

172
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,380
I don't think Liang Zhe buying True Image is a good thing for Jiang Nan.

173
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,300
Okay. Don't worry. Leave it all to me.

174
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,080
Ke Qin, how's my cousin doing today?

175
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,720
Worried about the joint chief editor system.

176
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,680
That Qi Qi had been giving us a hard time before.

177
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,000
She's even worse now.

178
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,320
 - Chief Editor Qin. 
 - Go away!

179
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,760
 Sister Shan, I'm sorry for making you come to me in person.

180
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,440
 What's going on here?

181
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,880
 Our team worked on these topic selections for a whole week.

182
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,000
 Why did you reject them all?

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,060
 If the new boss doesn't approve, I can't approve them.

184
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,140
 I'm just following orders. I hope you'll understand.

185
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,800
 What content will we use next week?

186
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,540
 You're so competent at your job, Sister Shan.

187
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,100
 I'm sure you can take care of that by the end of the day.

188
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Cousin, are you free this afternoon?

189
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,540
Do you want to play badminton together?

190
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,600
Why do you want to play badminton all of a sudden?

191
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,280
My cousin likes to vent off her anger through exercise.

192
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,400
Vent out to who? You?

193
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Of course not. It's someone else.

194
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,840
Either you don't come home, or you just lock yourself in your room.

195
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Can you do anything serious with your life?

196
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,800
Can't you knock before you come in?

197
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,420
You shouldn't be so obsessed with anyone or anything.

198
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,720
Just let bygones be bygones.

199
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,920
So, my mom is deserves to be forgotten?

200
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,320
You're still seeing that woman.

201
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,400
Do you think I don't know?

202
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,640
You two forced my mom to kill herself.

203
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,260
My mom already died so many years ago.

204
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,420
You can't bear to see anything happen to that woman!

205
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,020
All right, enough about that.

206
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,800
Enough about that.

207
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,520
Are you okay?

208
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,880
I'm fine.

209
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,580
I didn't realize

210
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,400
you're pretty good.

211
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,500
You're underestimating me.

212
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
Who else did you invite today?

213
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,700
So, you invited Lord Bao.

214
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
If you two are just playing badminton, why did you ask me here?

215
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,760
Don't you want to ask about True Image?

216
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,080
I think it's best to ask in person.

217
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,880
Your cousin?

218
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,420
She's here.

219
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,480
Cousin!

220
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,460
Are you crazy? Are you asking for trouble?

221
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,640
Why did you invite him?

222
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,160
It's serendipity.

223
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,520
Brother Rui wants to ask you something.

224
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,260
Brother Rui is a very good badminton player.

225
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,900
You two can certainly play well together.

226
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,380
Take this.

227
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,780
- What a coincidence. 
 - Yep, a coincidence.

228
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:13,200
Jiang Nan just restored some popularity.

229
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,680
Why aren't you in a hurry to advance to the next level?

230
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,480
How do you have time to play badminton?

231
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,040
We're both pretty busy, right? Let's forget it.

232
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,480
We should exercise more when we're busy.

233
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,019
Exercise stimulates the release of dopamine and dopamine makes people happy.

234
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
Why don't you two play a game with each other?

235
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
We can't.

236
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,960
- Who can't play? 
 - I can't play.

237
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,020
Fine, let's play.

238
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,300
Acting like a pro.

239
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Go for it, Brother Rui!

240
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,660
Bravo, Sister Shan!

241
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,980
What are you planning to do?

242
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,520
Don't you think they'll be a great couple just like us?

243
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,260
Are you trying to set up Sister Shan and Lord Bao?

244
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm sure Brother Rui is the person Master mentioned.

245
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,420
To prevent my cousin from waiting for another 60 years,

246
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,380
I have to help them.

247
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
Good shot!

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
You're getting smart.

249
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,320
Why do I think the mood is a bit off?

250
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,660
Why do I think the mood is perfect?

251
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,980
Zhu Lin Feng.

252
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,440
Brother Rui, you're too weak. Did my cousin hurt your kidney too?

253
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,540
You're the weak one.

254
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,300
Have you ever played against your cousin before?

255
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,120
If you play against her, you'll be worse than I am.

256
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,520
Rui, I learned TCM massage in my free time when I was learning photography in the U.S.

257
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,280
Come on, I'll try it on you.

258
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,760
Take a break.

259
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,640
You learned TCM massage in the U.S. Can't you improve your skills in China before you do it on me?

260
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,680
What's wrong with your cousin? Is she bad luck for me?

261
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,960
Brother Rui, let's talk about a serious matter.

262
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,920
You're not getting any younger. Shouldn't you consider the most important event in your life? 
  (T/N: Refers to marriage)

263
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,800
Do you think I don't want to? I have to have a person in mind.

264
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,060
I know someone really suitable for you.

265
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,440
- Who? 
 - My cousin.

266
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,960
Your cousin is a tough ball to catch.

267
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,040
I want you two to be in a relationship, not to play ball.

268
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,040
She already beat me up in a game. If we are in a relationship, who knows how badly she'll beat me up?

269
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,860
 Orange, Cool Singer-Songwriter still hasn't agreed to cooperate with us.

270
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,580
 Although Lao Jiang has been trying to convince Alex, Alex has been very unyielding.

271
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,260
 Lao Jiang has been working really hard on the new song lately. Take good care of him.

272
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,960
 Orange, I asked around for you.

273
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,880
 Alex is coming to True Image the day after.

274
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,320
 That's all I will do for you.

275
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,860
 You'll have to do the rest yourself.

276
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,760
Hello? Orange, Alex went downstairs.

277
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,060
 Don't tell him I'm the one who told you about him coming for an interview,

278
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,760
or I'll lose my job.

279
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,800
Got it.

280
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,680
Hello, Chief Producer Alex. I'm Jiang Nan's assistant, Xu Duo Cheng.

281
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,720
About Cool Singer-Songwriters, I wish you can give Jiang Nan another chance.

282
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
Assistant?

283
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,820
You're his girlfriend, right?

284
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,400
Yes.

285
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
This is the information about Jiang Nan since his debut and his creative experience.

286
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,780
This included his unique understanding of music. Please, take a look.

287
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,180
I believe you'll understand his vision for music after you look at them.

288
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,760
You're pretty persistent but I already rejected Jiang Nan.

289
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,080
That's not necessary.

290
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,180
Please, take a look!

291
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,820
Good thing I was quick enough.

292
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,280
I am certain I will get through to you.

293
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,780
That's my friend over there. I'll deliver it for you.

294
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay, thank you.

295
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,660
Wait.

296
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,280

297
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,760
Let me tell you, don't worry about that.

298
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,340
- Okay. 
 - Just leave it with me!

299
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,940
Take it easy.

300
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,580
- Don't worry. 
 - Take it easy. Take it easy.

301
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,160
- Bye-bye. 
 - Take it easy.

302
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,940
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

303
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,810

304
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,400
♫  The bright color of caramel is the sign of summer  ♫

305
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,950
♫  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  ♫

306
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,610
♫  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  ♫

307
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,980
♫  You lift away my arrogant facade  ♫

308
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,780
What exactly do you want?

309
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,680
♫  It isn't the best feeling  ♫

310
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,200
- Thank you. 
 - All right.

311
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,180
I'll come by in the morning to hear your comments.

312
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,600
Okay.

313
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,610
♫  I like the taste of cola chicken wings  ♫

314
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,780
♫  I want to be close to you, I'll never get tired; the perfect amount of sweetness  ♫

315
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,390
♫  Secretly fermenting these memories in cola  ♫

316
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,440
♫  I want you to count on me forever  ♫

317
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,160

318
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Good morning.

319
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,020
To Jiang Nan, writing music isn't just guided writing

320
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,900
that caters to the market but an empathetic experience of life.

321
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:00,740
I'm a fan of his. Just like other fans, my youth began with Jiang Nan's music.

322
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,380
His music made me to perceive the world and look inside my heart.

323
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,020
Even though I'm afraid of death, his songs showed me

324
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,580
the wonders and beauty of the world.

325
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,340
You must have a lot of stories to tell.

326
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,940
No. These are all inspirations I got from his songs.

327
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,601
This is another version of "Cola Chicken Wings" that we recorded together.

328
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:31,340
He said this version can bring more sense of happiness to his fans.

329
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,640
You recorded it together?

330
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,120
Does that mean you support this music career?

331
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,580
Of course.

332
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,240
So, I wish you can give Jiang Nan control over his music.

333
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,060
He will certainly surprise you.

334
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,540
That's what he told you?

335
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,780
Is there another reason?

336
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,900
Your five minutes are up. You should go now.

337
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,280
Hello.

338
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,440
Come on.

339
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,360
Why did you ask to see me here?

340
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,460
Look, I've been saving two bottles of great liquor here.

341
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,420
I've been waiting to have a nice drink with you.

342
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,920
No need for such formalities.

343
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,020
Just be direct with me.

344
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,840
I heard you're preparing for season 2 of the show.

345
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,540
I want to piggyback on its popularity and put in an ad.

346
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,840
I'll sponsor all the expenses for the stage.

347
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,540
Sure. I'll certainly say yes to money.

348
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,380
You're very straightforward, Alex.

349
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,340
There's another thing.

350
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,540
I heard Jiang Nan wanted to join this show too.

351
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,040
I... I don't really like him.

352
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,480
Do you think you can do something...

353
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,120
President Liang, you know me.

354
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,520
I will welcome any investment.

355
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,960
However, I have my own ideas about the show.

356
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,040
You're right.

357
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,200
Yes, I won't take part in the creative process.

358
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,900
You'll be in charge,

359
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,240
but as for the sponsorship, it's a deal then.

360
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,560
Let's have a pleasant cooperation.

361
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,680
Thank you very much.

362
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,440
I didn't expect you to readily agree.

363
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,480
- Let's have a pleasant cooperation. 
 - Let's have a pleasant cooperation.

364
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,680
You should really thank your girlfriend.

365
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,760
Cheng Cheng came to see you?

366
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,960
She didn't just come to see me.

367
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,300
She also brought me the version of "Cola Chicken Wings" that you sang together.

368
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,920
I only changed my mind because of that song.

369
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,140
However, you already recorded a song with her.

370
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,760
Why won't you just bring her on the show?

371
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,960
That song was recorded as a keepsake.

372
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
I never planned to release it.

373
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,280
My original intention was to incorporate her in every one of my songs.

374
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,820
It also means she's as precious as my songs.

375
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,680
No, she's more precious than that.

376
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,200
Therefore, I will never allow her to be disturbed or hurt.

377
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,420
That's also a precondition to our cooperation.

378
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,940
Come on.

379
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,560
I'm really starting to admire you.

380
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,540
Why does this smell so familiar?

381
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,040
What did you put in it?

382
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,660
I added the broth from stewed pig trotters.

383
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,940
You're pig trotters.

384
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:01,360
I added Sichuan peppers, wormwood leaves, safflower, and cinnamon to the foot bath.

385
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,020
 I also put Sichuan peppers, mugwort, safflower, and cinnamon in it.

386
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,420
You remember?

387
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,040
From now on, I'll help you soak your feet every day.

388
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,880
It can relax the muscles and stimulate blood circulation.

389
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,860
- Jiang Nan... 
 - Cheng Cheng,

390
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,340
you promised that no matter what happens in the future,

391
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,560
we will face it together.

392
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,140
We'll face it together.

393
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,600
I knew you'd be here.

394
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,460
You came to drink in the middle of the day.

395
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,300
Seems like you're lovelorn again.

396
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,920
You came to see me in the middle of the day.

397
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,000
Did you hear any news?

398
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,340
Jiang Nan will be on Cool Singer-Songwriters.

399
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,600
When he makes a comeback,

400
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,540
it will be totally hopeless for me.

401
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,360
Cool Singer-Songwriters?

402
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,720
Hello.

403
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,700
How are you doing with your new song?

404
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,520
The topic Alex gave me isn't that eccentric.

405
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,240
It's actually pretty common

406
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,700
 but if I want to do it well, it's not simple at all.

407
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,560
I already tried a few music styles,

408
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,420
but I just can't find the sense of purity I had when I first started composing.

409
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,260
Wait a minute. Get to the point.

410
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,380
In a nutshell, I wasn't able to do it.

411
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,120
You're about to go on the show, Brother.

412
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,680
Don't rush me.

413
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,020
The more you rush me, the less inspired I am.

414
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,270
Well, the deadline is there whether I rush you or not.

415
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,120

416
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,000
- Your problem is  that the song isn't fluent enough. 
 - Cheng Cheng, what did you just play?

417
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,760
The homework my student sent me.

418
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,840
Play it again. Let me hear it.

419
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,260
That's the original aspiration I was looking for.

420
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,160
It's choppy and immature, just like when we first started to study music.

421
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,640
As long as we persist, we can reach our original goal.

422
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,260
Cheng Cheng, we were meant to meet each other after all.

423
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,460
Let's go.

424
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,960
How do you know how to play this song?

425
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,260
I wrote this song.

426
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,420
I surely know how to play it.

427
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,860
Why didn't you tell me if you knew a long time ago?

428
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,440
Because this song was a failure.

429
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,820
At the time, I hadn't composed any new songs in a long time

430
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,880
and wasn't in my best state.

431
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,020
I seemed to have lost my inspiration for music all of a sudden.

432
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,719
 Teacher Dong. Teacher Dong.

433
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,040
 As you know, Jiang Nan hasn't been doing well lately.

434
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,520
 He can't even write a complete song.

435
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,639
 Has it only been the past few days?

436
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,400
 Jiang Nan hasn't released a song in a long time.

437
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,600
-  No producer will accept a song that's only halfway finished. 
 - Yes, Teacher Dong.

438
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,579
 Teacher Dong, give him a few more days.

439
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,580
Well, let's rewrite this song.

440
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,900
I believe you already found back your inspiration for music again.

441
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:59,020

442
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:09,539
♫  I walked past many side roads before you met me  ♫

443
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:16,053
♫  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  ♫

444
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,950
♫  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  ♫

445
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:29,637
♫  You shine a light to all my loneliness  ♫

00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:33,283

447
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:37,263

448
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:43,716
♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

449
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:47,176
♫  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  ♫

450
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:48,949
♫  I suddenly became very foolish  ♫

451
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,349
♫  I was just like a wooden person  ♫

452
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,263
♫  My longing still asks me at night  ♫

453

♫  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  ♫

454

♫  Why have I become so strange?  ♫

455

♫  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  ♫

♫  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  ♫

476
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:45,244
♫  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  ♫
