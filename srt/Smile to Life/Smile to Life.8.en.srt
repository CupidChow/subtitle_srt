1
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

2
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,960
You made it, didn't you?

3
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,480
What do you think?

4
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
The gift I gave you,

5
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,120
isn't it good?

6
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,760
You've been chasing a lot of oranges all day,

7
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,880
but you haven't made much progress.

8
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,840
So I made a merciful gesture to give you a hand.

9
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
Let Jiang Nan misunderstand many oranges,

10
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,400
so you'll have a chance.

11
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,400
Gu Jiayi,

12
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
it seems that I underestimated you.

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,240
Isn't that what you want?

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,560
Did you really fall in love with that girl?

15
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,680
I really don't get it.

16
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,120
What's so good about that bean sprout?

17
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,360
I want you two to be around her.

18
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,720
Anyway,

19
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,640
I have my own plan.

20
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,800
Hope

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
Don't let your plan affect me.

22
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,400
Otherwise,

23
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,800
things wouldn't be so simple.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
Everyone is threatening me.

25
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,920
Why do many oranges

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
want me to apologize?

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,560
If I did anything wrong, just let me apologize. I have something to tell you

28
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,640
at 6: 00 tomorrow

29
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,079
night.

30
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,440
Come in.

31
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,880
Did you make all these?

32
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
What's so hard about that?

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,400
Have a seat.

34
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,200
How about you try

35
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,560
this fish first?

36
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,600
The fish is so tender.

37
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,200
The market price of catfish

38
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,120
should be quite expensive, right?

39
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Expensive,

40
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
It's expensive in the market,

41
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,160
so it's not easy to buy it.

42
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,360
Isn't the delivery fee

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
quite expensive?

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,160
9. 9 yuan?

45
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,080
It's still fully reduced.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,520
Tell me,

47
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
why did you ask me to come here today?

48
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,600
I asked you to come here today,

49
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,600
so I want to say,

50
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Do you understand?

51
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know

52
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,760
what I mean.

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Well,

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,840
I had a problem with my attitude yesterday,

55
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Excuse me,

57
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,920
try that dish for me.

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
Forget about this.

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
-It

60
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:26,920
tastes good. -No,

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
He's not mature yet.

62
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,960
Let me get you a bowl of soup.

63
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
This soup is delicious.

64
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,800
Now that

65
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
you've ordered takeout,

66
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,640
Why did you cook a dish yourself?

67
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I just want to try myself, okay?

68
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,000
It can't all be fake, can it?

69
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,080
Orange,

70
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,120
what is it?

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
Why can't you explain it clearly on the phone

72
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,880
when you have to come out in such a hurry?

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,040
I got it.

74
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,640
You're going to give me

75
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
some exclusive news.

76
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,120
Don't be ridiculous.

77
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
I really have a problem

78
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
this time. What is it?

79
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,000
Someone secretly caught Zhan Zhilin and I

80
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,000
trying to avoid suspicion,

81
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Jiang Nan asked me to move out and live with him.

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,960
Is there such a thing?

83
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,960
Then move out.

84
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,320
It's not that easy.

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,480
The question is, what should I tell my parents?

86
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,080
That's easy.

87
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm here,

88
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
You,

89
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,960
Just tell me,

90
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
you want to move out and live with me?

91
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,800
Here's a good idea.

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,560
Stir-fry

93
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,520
Chengcheng's favorite kale and griddle chicken.

94
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,680
Nutrition mix.

95
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,880
Thank you, Lin.

96
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
You don't have to do this for me in the future.

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,480
I'll eat whatever you want.

98
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,960
How can I do that?

99
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,960
Look how thin you've become recently.

100
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,840
You have to make up for it.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll make you some

102
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,000
black-bone chicken soup tomorrow.

103
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,520
Have a piece of black-bone chicken,

104
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,520
Come on.

105
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,560
I have an announcement to make.

106
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,760
I found a job.

107
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
You found a job?

108
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,000
Why did you tell us so late?

109
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,040
What kind of job did you find?

110
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,840
State-owned enterprises, private enterprises or the top 500?

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,440
Why are you so wordy?

112
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,800
The bank

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,480
is teaching students to play the piano at Xinhai Musical Instrument Store.

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,160
I've been working

115
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
for a while,

116
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,160
What about the salary?

117
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,320
It's good in all aspects.

118
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,040
The main thing is that I like

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
the piano teacher. Okay,

120
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,919
-Hello, piano teacher. -Hello, piano

121
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,240
teacher. -What's wrong

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
with you, Madam?

123
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
My daughter has found a job.

124
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
Why are you frowning?

125
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,400
The piano teacher is so good.

126
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,600
Stable and decent.

127
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,640
I'm not saying it's not a good job,

128
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,920
Xinhai Musical Instrument Store,

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
He's so famous.

130
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
It's so far from our house.

131
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,840
It's so tiring to go to work.

132
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Why did Chengcheng come back for dinner recently?

133
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,960
At this hour,

134
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,080
my daughter,

135
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,080
It's a bit far.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,080
So,

137
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Mom and Dad,

138
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,560
I want to discuss something with you.

139
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
I want to move out.

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,040
I don't agree.

141
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,120
Chengcheng,

142
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
you're a good girl.

143
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
You can't be a bad student.

144
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,440
You have to protect yourself.

145
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,480
You can't let that brat take advantage of you.

146
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
Lin, sit down. Sit down.

147
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,200
It's not a girl.

148
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
Jiang Nan and you

149
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
just fell in love,

150
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,720
There's something

151
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,080
going on. Don't be so anxious.

152
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,520
All right, all right,

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,320
all right. What are you talking about? You two.

154
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,520
Is our girl that kind of person?

155
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,880
You don't even know her.

156
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,240
Who are you going to live with?

157
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,960
Keqin,

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
don't you feel at ease when I live with Keqin?

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,880
So amiable.

160
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,880
Mom,

161
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,240
I also graduated from college

162
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
and entered the society.

163
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,880
Right?

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,360
I can't live under your protection

165
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,640
all the time.

166
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
I have to go out and experience

167
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
the beating of this society,

168
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,160
And look how independent you were when you were young.

169
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,760
That's my role model.

170
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,680
You're really following me.

171
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,280
I agree.

172
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,680
With such a big poster of myself hanging in my house,

173
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,400
I can immediately guess that this is my home.

174
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,240
No way.

175
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,720
Everything is ready.

176
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,440
No,

177
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,200
why do I feel like I'm the assistant?

178
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,800
I didn't bring you

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,520
the medical record. Slow down.

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,360
Mom, why are you back?

181
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,520
What? Why am I back?

182
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,120
Your dad asked me to come

183
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,960
and see you. What are you dawdling about?

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,160
Why do you take a medical record?

185
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I'll take this with me. It'll be easier

186
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
for you to see a doctor.

187
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,480
But girl,

188
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,240
if you get sick,

189
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,160
You can't go to the hospital alone.

190
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
You have to tell me and your dad anyway.

191
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,440
We have to stay with you.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,160
Which year was the case?

193
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Is it still working?

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Oh no.

195
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,760
Tell me about this doctor.

196
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,080
It's been so many years,

197
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,160
The handwriting is still so hard to understand.

198
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
Mom, stop looking.

199
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,480
Dad, it's time to wait.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,520
All right,

201
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,120
all right.

202
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,840
Let's go.

203
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,160
I'm so sleepy.

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
Why are you asleep?

205
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,880
Clothes.

206
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm here.

207
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,360
Jiang Nan,

208
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,120
why are you here?

209
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,960
Auntie,

210
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,600
here's the thing,

211
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,240
Well,

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,800
Chengcheng and Keqin told me before,

213
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,560
If you want to find a house,

214
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
let me ask for help.

215
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,560
As it happens,

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,880
my friend's room is empty,

217
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,880
This is your friend's house,

218
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,400
Auntie.

219
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,800
Look how nice this house is,

220
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
how bright the lighting is,

221
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,440
Judging from the decoration,

222
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,120
the landlord cherishes this house

223
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,240
very much. What are you doing?

224
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,480
You're holding it well.

225
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
Come on in, Dad.

226
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Hello, uncle.

227
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,920
And underground,

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,680
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

229
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,960
Let me have a look.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,160
Be careful.

231
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,480
This floor is pretty, too.

232
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,000
Why are there so many instruments?

233
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,800
There's

234
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,800
Jiang Nan here,

235
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
Why are there so many instruments?

236
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,760
Your friend

237
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,760
… My friend is just like me,

238
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,480
A unique talent

239
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,280
in music,

240
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,560
Why are you talking about so many instruments?

241
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,000
Photos!

242
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Hurry up!

243
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,200
This house satisfies

244
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,880
all my dreams of renting a house,

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,640
Wait.

246
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Keqin,

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,040
where's your luggage?

248
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,720
Uncle,

249
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
girls have so much luggage,

250
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,720
It can't be done so quickly.

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,840
Besides, I've been working overtime,

252
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
haven't I, Orange?

253
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,640
That's right.

254
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,680
You're busy with work.

255
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,760
By the way,

256
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,720
Where is Chengcheng's room?

257
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,640
Upstairs,

258
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,360
Mom and Dad,

259
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Let me take you upstairs to have a look.

260
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay, okay. Come on,

261
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,680
let's go.

262
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,200
Let's go.

263
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,080
Mom,

264
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
This is the room.

265
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
How about

266
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,360
the sheets?

267
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,600
It's a good match.

268
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
That's great.

269
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,440
Good for you.

270
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,160
This room is so nice,

271
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,840
why didn't you tell me?

272
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,240
These cosmetics,

273
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
these cosmetics

274
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,880
are a surprise

275
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,800
that I prepared

276
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,280
for Orange.

277
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,440
Are you surprised?

278
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,080
Surprise.

279
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,000
It was an accident.

280
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,480
You two remind me of me and my bestie Keqin

281
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,200
Where's your room?

282
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
My room

283
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,600
is over there.

284
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,720
Come and have a look.

285
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,960
This room is not bad, either.

286
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,600
But it feels a bit like

287
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,640
a boy's room,

288
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,920
This is my style.

289
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,080
The closet is nice too.

290
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
Well

291
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,120
You have a boyfriend, right?

292
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,480
Auntie,

293
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,200
Well,

294
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,800
Auntie came here at that time.

295
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,160
Let me tell you,

296
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
my mom was so beautiful when she was young.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,160
It's beautiful now.

298
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,560
These two kids,

299
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,640
come on,

300
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,200
I've seen it too.

301
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,520
Your dad and I can rest assured.

302
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,040
It's time for the family to be busy.

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,960
I'm leaving.

304
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,880
Mom,

305
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,119
If you look at it for a while,

306
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,280
why are you leaving now?

307
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,599
I don't want to see it anymore.

308
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,599
I'm leaving.

309
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm leaving.

310
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,200
Let's go.

311
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,720
Let me give you a ride.

312
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,720
No need.

313
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,440
It's just on the way.

314
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,760
You're welcome.

315
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,079
Well,

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,480
Auntie,

317
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,800
Have you seen the house?

318
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,400
The house is so nice that

319
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,520
we can have dinner together when we're free.

320
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,400
Okay, Auntie.

321
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,920
That's right.

322
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
You're not leaving?

323
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,760
You're not leaving?

324
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,240
I'm leaving.

325
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,560
I'm leaving too.

326
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,840
Go away.

327
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,240
Waiting for the bus?

328
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
There's no car.

329
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
It's not here yet.

330
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,520
I'll wait

331
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,280
for Dad

332
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,840
to leave too.

333
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,920
When will you arrive?

334
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,200
right away

335
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,640
Let's go.

336
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,000
Didn't you tell him when he was waiting for the bus,

337
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,640
why are you in such a hurry?

338
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,600
Let's go.

339
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,960
What's wrong with him?

340
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,560
Bye.

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,840
He's finally gone.

342
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,680
Thank you.

343
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,440
I know I can do it tonight.

344
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
I'll give you one day.

345
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,840
Clean up the room.

346
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,320
No,

347
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,680
I've been struggling for a whole day.

348
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
I hit my nose.

349
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,280
Luckily, it's true.

350
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,280
I'll clean it up tonight.

351
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,960
When Jiang Nan listened to his heartbeat,

352
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,920
he felt that everything was too sudden and unreal.

353
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,520
When Xu's dad, Xu's mom and Yu Keqin

354
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,760
left one by one,

355
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,120
This place will be

356
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
a world for him and many oranges.

357
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,680
Thinking of this,

358
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,680
he couldn't help but get nervous.

359
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,760
No,

360
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,760
why should I be nervous?

361
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,000
Why should I hide in the bedroom?

362
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,320
This is my home.

363
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
Jiang Nan was at a loss.

364
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was caught off guard.

365
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Are you starting to worry that your future life

366
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,360
will be like what you imagined?

367
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm done.

368
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,280
You wash it.

369
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,320
Why is she running so fast?

370
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,600
Am I a beast?

371
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,000
That's embarrassing. Isn't Jiang Nan

372
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,920
supposed to be working out at this hour?

373
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,840
A lot of oranges.

374
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,480
Be careful next time.

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,600
Forget it.

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
Why should I care

377
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,640
what's wrong with her?

378
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,160
I'm a singer-songwriter.

379
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,040
I'm not a muscular man

380
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,600
or a singer-songwriter.

381
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,680
I told you to ignore me,

382
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,040
and you said you liked my song,

383
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
I've been playing here for so long.

384
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,320
You didn't even look at me.

385
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,320
What's the matter now?

386
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
It's so noisy.

387
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,200
Brother,

388
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,320
it's ten o'clock in the evening,

389
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,640
Aren't you going to sleep?

390
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,880
It's only ten o'clock. Why are you sleeping?

391
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,360
You're disturbing the people. Do you know that

392
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm playing games in my own house?

393
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,680
I didn't sing K

394
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,520
again. Who am I disturbing?

395
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Me? Me?

396
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,000
Sleeping at 10 o'clock can enhance immunity

397
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,600
and promote detoxification of the liver.

398
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm not stopping you.

399
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,680
Go to sleep.

400
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,000
Six o'clock?

401
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,000
Why is that so early?

402
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,160
Babies,

403
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,800
don't forget longan,

404
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,120
Just put it in for 15 minutes.

405
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,760
Isn't it easy?

406
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,880
All right, babies.

407
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,120
That's all for today's video.

408
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,960
What about a beautiful day?

409
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,320
From this morning onwards,

410
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,360
you must remember to have breakfast.

411
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,440
Also,

412
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
in this way, you can be in good health.

413
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,680
If you like

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,840
the "Live to 99" health channel,

415
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,480
Be sure to double-click 666.

416
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
I love you guys.

417
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,440
You can't even make a sound when you walk.

418
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,520
Why do you talk so much early in the morning?

419
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,800
I don't want anyone to sleep.

420
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm not singing K at home.

421
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,960
Who are you disturbing?

422
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,600
I didn't expect you to broadcast it live.

423
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,600
Don't worry.

424
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,520
I didn't show my face.

425
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,560
This is

426
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,760
just my side business,

427
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,000
You have quite a lot of side jobs.

428
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Since you're up,

429
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,320
let's have breakfast.

430
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,680
Come on.

431
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,600
We'll have Ganoderma lucidum stewed chicken soup

432
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,400
for breakfast. This chicken soup,

433
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
Improve immunity,

434
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,960
regulate endocrine,

435
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,680
Beauty and anti-aging,

436
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,880
eat this for breakfast.

437
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,320
What do you want for lunch and dinner?

438
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,160
What about lunch?

439
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
We'll just eat sea cucumber and angelica soup.

440
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,320
What about dinner?

441
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,400
Stewed pigeon with astragalus membranaceus.

442
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,720
What about tomorrow?

443
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,320
Let's have a light meal.

444
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,520
Eat bird's nest and tremella soup,

445
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,320
then according to this way,

446
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,520
Your salary isn't enough, is it?

447
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,800
It's okay.

448
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,720
You can eat and cover here,

449
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,360
As for these,

450
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,600
Mr. Bao will reimburse them.

451
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Bao Rui,

452
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,920
where's Ganoderma lucidum today?

453
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,160
I'll take it as an advance payment.

454
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,320
Ask Mr. Bao to prepare more

455
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,040
Ganoderma lucidum later,

456
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Astragalus membranaceus,

457
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,520
Angelica sinensis,

458
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
Bird's nest,

459
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,360
donkey-hide gelatin and so on,

460
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,680
Angelica sinensis can nourish blood

461
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
and promote blood circulation,

462
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
Where's Astragalus membranaceus?

463
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,640
Replenish Qi and strengthen the watch.

464
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,720
Shan,

465
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,560
are you looking for me?

466
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,880
Come in and have a seat.

467
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,000
Follow up on a project.

468
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,240
Okay,

469
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,640
Jiang Nan is releasing a new song next month,

470
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,240
He hasn't produced any works for a long time.

471
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,640
The popularity on the Internet and fans'expectations are

472
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
very high.

473
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,960
Contact his company,

474
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,240
ask him to do an exclusive interview,

475
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,920
I want to start.

476
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,720
This is an interview

477
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,560
with his agent.

478
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
When we were targeting Jiang Nan before,

479
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,960
would his company agree?

480
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,640
We never target anyone.

481
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,560
Whether they can agree or not

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
depends on your ability.

483
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,320
You don't need me to teach you anything else.

484
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,480
Shan,

485
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,080
can I ask you a question?

486
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,800
Tell me,

487
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,560
You didn't allow me to follow up on Jiang Nan's matter before,

488
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,440
but you don't want

489
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,080
to do it now.

490
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,560
No, no, no.

491
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,000
I promise to complete the task.

492
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,800
Sis, you're the best.

493
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,600
We had a deal,

494
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,760
just this once.

495
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,680
Just this once.

496
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,800
What a strange smell.

497
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
What a strange smell.

498
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,160
Many oranges,

499
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
what are you doing in my house?

500
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,160
What's this smell?

501
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,840
Does it smell good?

502
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,320
I'm frying wormwood.

503
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,680
Fried wormwood,

504
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,040
promoting blood circulation and dredging blood stasis,

505
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,280
Warm yourself up

506
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,920
and protect the baby in the palace fighting drama. Ai,

507
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,680
do you want to protect the baby?

508
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,560
Who said only pregnant women can fry wormwood?

509
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,760
If you don't understand,

510
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,720
go to Baidu more often.

511
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,480
Wait a minute.

512
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,600
Give me a hand.

513
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,240
This way.

514
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,680
You're going to smoke me to death.

515
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,400
Where did you get the foot bath bucket?

516
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,480
I asked Mr. Bao to buy it.

517
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,560
Why did you buy it?

518
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,720
Of course the foot bath bucket is for soaking feet,

519
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,040
otherwise what else can we do?

520
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,440
Hurry up!

521
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
What else did you add?

522
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,760
It's so tasty.

523
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,560
What about me?

524
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,280
With Sichuan pepper, mugwort leaves, safflower and cinnamon,

525
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,640
how about the same one for you.

526
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,200
You're so young

527
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,080
and healthy,

528
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,360
If you don't raise a baby at such a young age,

529
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,760
it will be too late to regret it when you are old.

530
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,240
Does that sound like

531
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,440
a 22-year-old girl?

532
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
This is the tone of a mature person,

533
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,640
though,

534
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,920
You are a few years older than me,

535
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,240
but boys mature later.

536
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,760
With your mental age,

537
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,560
you might not be able to catch up with me.

538
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,200
Where are you going with my pan?

539
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,080
When I come out,

540
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,680
I'd better not have these smells at home.

541
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,680
I can't take it anymore.

542
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
I can't take it anymore.

543
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,320
Many Chenghuotuotuo are just old Chinese medicine practitioners.

544
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,440
When she came here these days,

545
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,680
I felt like I was confinement,

546
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm going to supplement the agreement tomorrow,

547
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,280
so I can't let her go on like this.

548
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,560
Okay,

549
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,640
What is it?

550
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
I'll choose the recipe.

551
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,840
Also,

552
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,400
you can't cook those weird things at home.

553
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,040
and

554
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,080
No sound before ten o'clock in the morning.

555
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:41,960
Okay,

556
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,120
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

557
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,920
What now?

558
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,120
Mr. Bao, it's me.

559
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,800
Chengcheng,

560
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,520
what's wrong?

561
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,120
I'd like to sign a supplementary agreement,

562
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,880
adding that

563
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,560
you can't talk after 10 PM.

564
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Okay,

565
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,120
No problem.

566
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,880
Bye.

567
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,640
Can you

568
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,840
let me sleep?

569
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,280
Don't sign anything tomorrow if you don't let me sleep.

570
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,840
Orange,

571
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,080
what's wrong with you?

572
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
Why are you so sleepy?

573
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,920
It's all because of Jiang Nan.

574
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,280
I didn't sleep all night.

575
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,760
You've come this far.

576
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,120
What are you thinking of?

577
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,600
I'm telling you,

578
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
I found out that the way I live with him,

579
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,880
It's totally different.

580
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,000
He works at night and sleeps during the day,

581
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,680
which disrupts my schedule.

582
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,680
Besides, I can't have dinner with him.

583
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,000
I cook so many delicious food for him every day,

584
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,680
but he thinks it's too nourishing.

585
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,120
From a male god to a happy enemy,

586
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,000
according to this rhythm,

587
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,040
In a few days,

588
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,680
you can have the wedding candy.

589
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,880
What are you thinking?

590
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,240
In my opinion,

591
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,360
beauty can only be produced

592
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,000
if the filter is broken all over the floor

593
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
or if it's distance.

594
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,600
Anyway,

595
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,720
now I'm completely stuck

596
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,640
in the back neck of fate,

597
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,200
I don't want to talk about it.

598
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,800
Why are you in such a hurry to ask me to come here?

599
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,240
By the way,

600
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,800
I almost forgot my business.

601
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
The thing is,

602
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,000
the devil

603
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,560
suddenly assigned me a mission,

604
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
He said Jiang Nan wanted to release a new song,

605
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,960
and asked me to publish an exclusive interview with Jiang Nan,

606
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,040
And you have to start.

607
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,280
After the photo incident,

608
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,520
she stopped me from being in charge of Jiang Nan's news.

609
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
In this arrangement,

610
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,760
I don't quite understand her intention.

611
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,520
Regarding Jiang Nan's work,

612
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,720
you have to go to Mr. Bao.

613
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,600
Last time at the press conference,

614
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,360
the devil offended all of you.

615
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,760
I'll go find Bao Rui.

616
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,320
Isn't that asking for trouble?

617
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,640
So,

618
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,440
can you blow the pillow wind,

619
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,600
Give me a first round.

620
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,760
What kind of pillow wind is that?

621
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,200
If you keep talking nonsense,

622
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,320
I won't talk to you anymore.

623
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:16,920
Fine,

624
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,000
I won't joke anymore.

625
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Orange,

626
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,720
can you be nice to Jiang Nan?

627
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,400
That's what men do.

628
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,640
I'm begging you. If Orange

629
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
doesn't do it well, I'll lose my job.

630
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,480
I'll think of a way.

631
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
But I'm not sure Jiang Nan will agree.

632
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I'm counting on you.

633
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,080
Guys,

634
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,000
this is the supplementary agreement I wrote this morning,

635
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,680
Take a look.

636
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,600
Take a look.

637
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,000
That's it.

638
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,360
You can't fry wormwood at home, you can't make any noise before 10: 00 in the

639
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,480
morning,

640
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,240
The daily menu is selected by Party A,

641
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,360
and Party B cannot make the decision without permission.

642
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,600
I only mentioned two,

643
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,280
and that's all he mentioned.

644
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,200
It's not fair.

645
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,520
What's so unfair about that?

646
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,280
This is my home.

647
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,920
Didn't you invite me here?

648
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,920
Well,

649
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,560
Orange,

650
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,280
Any new ideas?

651
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,600
Add whatever you want.

652
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,480
We can't take up public space.

653
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,880
The public space is half for each person,

654
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,840
since you want to mention it,

655
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,560
I also want to mention,

656
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,160
when you use the bathroom,

657
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,520
No more than half an hour.

658
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,720
After taking a shower,

659
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,160
you must wrap your bath towel before you come out.

660
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,120
If you wash your stuff

661
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
in the future,

662
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,160
You have to close the door and wash it.

663
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

664
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,920
wait, wait, wait, wait. I think these two.

665
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
There's no need for us to write it in.

666
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,200
Pay attention.

667
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,840
Pay attention to each other.

668
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,560
No way.

669
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,360
I seriously suspect that

670
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,280
you just want to find

671
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,800
a willing nanny.

672
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,480
In that case,

673
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,560
I'm going home.

674
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,280
Okay,

675
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,160
No problem.

676
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,280
Mr. Bao,

677
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,560
please issue a contract to terminate the contract.

678
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,199
I have to answer the phone.

679
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,960
The phone is ringing,

680
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,360
Continue

681
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm done.

682
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,239
What about the war?

683
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,400
It's less than two thousand yuan in the card.

684
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,880
Or you can pay it off in one lump sum.

685
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,800
Terminate the contract,

686
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,840
or,

687
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Just stay here and sell yourself to pay off the debt.

688
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,280
Okay,

689
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,960
I promise you.

690
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,760
But you have to promise me one condition.

691
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,600
I don't think

692
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,360
you have the right

693
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,840
to bargain with me now.

694
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,360
If you don't agree, I'll terminate the agreement with you

695
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,080
even if I sell my blood and kidney.

696
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,760
Let's talk about it first.

697
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,840
Keqin wants to do an exclusive interview with you.

698
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,120
Isn't your friend at Qin Shan's place?

699
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,320
Do you think it's possible for me to go?

700
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,560
She's my best friend.

701
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,080
Her business is my business.

702
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,400
All right. I can

703
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,120
give you an interview.

704
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,160
However,

705
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,360
I have one more point to mention.

706
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,800
Plus,

707
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,680
every day from now on,

708
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,440
In addition to cleaning,

709
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,520
cooking,

710
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,600
You have to report all your trips to me,

711
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,920
and you can't turn off your phone.

712
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,080
I'm on call 24 hours a day.

713
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,920
I'd better sell my kidney.

714
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,960
I'll pay you overtime.

715
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,040
Really?

716
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Judging from your performance,

717
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,240
what if something special happens?

718
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,840
For example, fever or illness,

719
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,360
or special cases of illness,

720
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,200
You have to ask me for leave.

721
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,880
Okay,

722
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,240
I promise you.

723
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
amiable

724
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,520
I sold myself for you.

725
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,080
Who won?
