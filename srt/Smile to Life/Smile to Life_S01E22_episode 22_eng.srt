1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,190

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,552
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:15,892
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:19,192
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:24,467
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:30,225
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:33,039
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,444
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:38,826
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:44,425
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«
 â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

11
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:48,326
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

12
00:00:48,326 --> 00:00:51,153
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

13
00:00:51,153 --> 00:00:53,766
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

14
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:56,613
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

15
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:58,680
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,495
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

17
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:05,836
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

18
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:10,683
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

19
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:13,437
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

20
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:16,171
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

21
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:18,278
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

22
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,091
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

23
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:25,750
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:31,169
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

25
00:01:40,452 --> 00:01:45,117
    ðŸŽˆ

26
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:49,007

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,880
What's wrong?

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,340
 Young President Zhan, I'm afraid the dinner party you ordered can't happen anymore.

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,680
 Happy Family Restaurant is temporarily closed.

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,440
It's closed?

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,560
I'm sorry. Today we're...

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,980
Auntie.

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,800
Are you Xiao Zhan, who came to the opening of our restaurant?

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,360
Auntie, I heard Happy Family closed down.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,040
So I came to see what happened.

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,180
Thank you.

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,000
Today, Gu Jia Yi came to eat at our restaurant.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,060
Somehow after she started eating, she experienced an allergic reaction.

39
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,660
It was very serious, so she was sent to the hospital.

40
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,960
We can only close the restaurant now.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,620
There are people who come and make a scene when we're open.

42
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,220
We can at least have some peace if it's closed.

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,060
Auntie, where's Cheng Cheng?

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,740
Cheng Cheng sent Gu Jia Yi to the hospital.

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,720
I am not sure how she's doing now.

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,380
Xiao Zhan, do you think Gu Jia Yi will make things difficult for Cheng Cheng?

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,580
I don't think so.

48
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,920
Does Jiang Nan know about this?

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,980
Jiang Nan didn't come today.

50
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,920
Also, since Jiang Nan is a public figure, it's best to not

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,840
involve him in matters like this.

52
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,500
Sister, you were so good today!

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,060
Your acting was really good.

54
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,340
I was worried that something actually happened to you.

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,120
I was aware of what I was doing.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,500
There's no need to put my life on the line for Xu Duo Cheng.

57
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,960
By the way, where are they now?

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,580
They are waiting outside.

59
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,860
I think you really scared them.

60
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,300
Cheng Cheng, what happened for her to get an allergic reaction?

61
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,660
I have no idea either.

62
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,820
I already made a note about her allergies in her order.

63
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,060
I also made sure to confirm before serving the dishes.

64
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,560
I really didn't put any peanuts in the dish when I was cooking.

65
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,940
You may come in.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,900
Fix your hair.

67
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,460
Miss Gu, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,840
Although we're not sure what went wrong during the process,

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,860
but since this happened in our restaurant,

70
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,840
we will be sure to give you an explanation.

71
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,260
It's natural for people to make mistakes at times.

72
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,180
Maybe your restaurant staff were careless and missed it.

73
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,680
I did pay attention to not adding any peanut butter in there!

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,500
Jia Yi, if it really was a mistake of Happy Family Restaurant, we will take full responsibility.

75
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,960
We will!

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,620
What do you mean by "if"? She had an allergic reaction at your restaurant.

77
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,160
So many people were able to film the incident. Why are you still making excuses?

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,740
We're not trying to make excuses but everything needs to be verified.

79
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,840
You're doing a self-inspection and correction. Will you just punish yourself with three drinks?

80
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,220
I think your restaurant is fraudulent.

81
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,740
If Jiang Nan didn't endorse your restaurant,

82
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,140
who would come to your restaurant filled with flies?

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,000
Everything is still being investigated.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,260
Don't make groundless accusations here.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,560
Jiang Nan.

86
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,200
You had an allergic reaction to peanuts?

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,500
You still remember?

88
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,520
Since you know you're allergic to peanuts, why were you so careless?

89
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,660
I already told you.

90
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,280
Jiang Nan, at the very least, Sister Jia Yi used to date you.

91
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,540
Don't you feel any distress or remorse now that she has become like this due to your current girlfriend?

92
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,839
We've all seen the videos everyone filmed on the internet.

93
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,180
Sister Jia Yi told them early on that she couldn't have any peanuts.

94
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,500
There was a problem with the food Xu Duo Cheng served.

95
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,100
Perhaps, she was jealous of Sister Jia Yi.

96
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,800
You...

97
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,100
Little girl, you look decent and nice-looking,

98
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,560
but why are your words so sharp and rude?

99
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,640
- You... 
 - Sharp and rude!

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm old enough to be your father, right?

101
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,840
Don't point your finger at me. Watch your manners!

102
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
You call us a restaurant with flies? Have you actually been to one?

103
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,900
Have you seen a fly? My nickname is "Flyswatter".

104
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,593
I'm very good at swatting flies.

105
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,630
- You... Old man... 
 - How am I old?

106
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,520
I just reminded you about manners and you're calling me an old man?

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,460
I'm an experienced senior chef, all right?

108
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,380
- You just... 
 - What about me?

109
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,500
Let me tell you, what you just said can be considered as slander.

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,540
- You said... 
 - I can sue you. 
 - Sue you!

111
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,880
Yes, the food was made by the restaurant.

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,140
- You... 
 - But we also don't know what the cause of the allergies were.

113
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,880
We really don't know. What about that?

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,860
Are you trying to extort money from me? What do you want?

115
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,500
That's what everyone says on the internet.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,900
- Dad. 
 - You shouldn't waste your time on me.

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,260
- Explain it to everyone else. 
 - That's enough.

118
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,320
It's not the time to have a pointless argument.

119
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,620
Anyway, we'll investigate this matter fully.

120
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,240
Yes, not only will we investigate the matter fully.

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
Don't worry, Miss Gu. We will pay for all your medical expenses and any other losses.

122
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,460
How are you going to pay?

123
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,280
Do you know how much upcoming work Jia Yi has lined up?

124
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,080
Can you even afford to pay the penalty fee?

125
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,880
Why can't I...

126
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,700
I'll pay for it.

127
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,520
Don't, Jiang Nan. I can do it.

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,820
Don't worry. I'm here. It's okay.

129
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Gu Jia Yi, are you happy with that?

130
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,220
Since the incident already happened, there is no need to continue pursuing this matter.

131
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,560
This was just an accident. They didn't want it to happen.

132
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,140
Don't worry, I will ask my team to handle everything online.

133
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,260
- Thank you. 
 - Very sensible!

134
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,380
- That's very sensible. 
 - That's very sensible.

135
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,400
I owe you a favor for this.

136
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,500
All right, the patient needs to recover in peace as she just woke up.

137
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,220
Please, stop hovering around her.

138
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,380
That's right.

139
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,560
We won't bother you anymore. Get some rest.

140
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,540
- We're leaving then. 
 - Thank you.

141
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,020
Let's go.

142
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,720
Get some rest.

143
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,380
Jiang Nan, can you stay?

144
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,080
I want to talk to you in private.

145
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,380
Let's go, Dad.

146
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,920
- Let's go. 
 - Where are we going?

147
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
Let's hurry and leave.

148
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,919
- I... 
 - Dad! Dad!

149
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
- I need to put some sense into that girl. 
 - Don't be angry!

150
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,460
- She's so arrogant! 
 - They are alone in the room.

151
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,180
I'm already like this.

152
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,280
Can't you show some concern for me?

153
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,400
How should I show concern for you?

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,180
You used to peel apples for me.

155
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,300
I see that you don't really need anything else. I'll get going then.

156
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,820
Jiang Nan,

157
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,820
I only forgave Happy Family Restaurant because of you.

158
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,880
I already did all of that,

159
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,500
isn't that enough?

160
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,380
If you ask me, love is never selfless.

161
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,980
Love is always selfish!

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,420
I...

163
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,740
Jiang Nan,

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,760
help me get in bed.

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,540
Girl, where are you going?

166
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm going to buy some water.

167
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,780
Buy some water?

168
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,440
I was right?

169
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,200
I did it correctly.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,220
Why won't it come out?

171
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,380
Why do I have such bad luck today?

172
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,880
- Hello, Ke Qin. 
  - Why were you involved with Gu Jia Yi again?

173
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,860
The news is all over the Internet now.

174
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,500
Where are you? I'll come to find you.

175
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,620
There's no need to.

176
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,340
It's all taken care of.

177
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,100
You can just focus on your own work.

178
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,240
The whole Internet has been letting loose a whole stream of curses against you and Happy Family Restaurant.

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,200
You have to be careful.

180
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,560
Hello, Brother Rui. Where are you?

181
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,160
Something has happened at the Happy Family Restaurant.

182
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,727
I don't trust Gu Jia Yi.

183
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,720
 Something almost happened to Sister Shan the day before as well.

184
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,520
What? Something happened to Qin Shan, too?

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,880
Is everyone all right?

186
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,320
 We're all right.

187
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,360
 I just saw the news about Happy Family Restaurant.

188
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,060
 You don't have to be too worried.

189
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,700
 I'll do what I can with everything online.

190
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,320
 You can be rest assured.

191
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,400
Okay. Thanks.

192
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,160
It's too much of a coincidence that Qin Shan and Happy Family Restaurant

193
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,600
both had something happen to them.

194
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,820
Stop looking.

195
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me.

196
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,826
You shouldn't get involved in the Happy Family Restaurant incident.

197
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,600
How can I not get involved in your matters?

198
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,540
Your career is currently on the rise.

199
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,820
We will only implicate you.

200
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,400
Also, because of the Happy Family Restaurant incident, you have to deal with her...

201
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,860
Are you jealous?

202
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,800
I'm being serious with you. Stop changing the subject.

203
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,020
It's all right.

204
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,980
After I heard something happened to Gu Jia Yi at Happy Family Restaurant,

205
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,780
the first reaction was to think if this matter would hurt you.

206
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,840
That's why I came right away,

207
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,020
but I don't know what's going on right now,

208
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,720
so I could only try to minimize the losses.

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Cheng Cheng, no matter what happens in the future,

210
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,300
you must never say that you will implicate me.

211
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,740
Also, no matter what I'll be by your side.

212
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,980
But...

213
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,880
But what?

214
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,680
But you remembered she was allergic to peanuts.

215
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,900
I... I just have a good memory.

216
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,080
You even carried her back to bed.

217
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,180
- When did I carry her back to bed? 
 - Just now.

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,920
You came back and peeked?

219
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,820
I didn't.

220
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,580
You're still denying it?

221
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,720
I... I just glanced in there secretly when I walked by.

222
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,220
After that, I...

223
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,580
The hospital has surveillance cameras.

224
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,040
We're back.

225
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,560
You're back?

226
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
How was it? How's Gu Jia Yi?

227
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,820
Mom, don't worry. Gu Jia Yi is fine.

228
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,520
Not only is she all right, but she also is not holding us accountable.

229
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,280
Not only is she not holding us accountable,

230
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,320
she even promised to take care of everything online.

231
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,080
I didn't expect that at all.

232
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,200
Are you tired? Everyone should come to sit down.

233
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,640
Thank you for notifying me just then.

234
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,800
I did it for Xu Duo Cheng, not for you.

235
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,600
By the way, Brother Ye, did you check the surveillance footage from the kitchen and in the front?

236
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
Xiao Zhan warned us before.

237
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,620
There's no surveillance camera in the kitchen. We only have one in the dining hall.

238
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,000
I checked it and didn't find anything suspicious.

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,860
We must put a camera in the kitchen right away.

240
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,800
All right then.

241
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,800
Get back to what you have to do.

242
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,660
We already started investigating it, right?

243
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,400
We shouldn't stop doing business.

244
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,200
It's almost time for lunch. The customers are arriving soon. Let's get working.

245
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
No one is coming.

246
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,400
It's bad enough that people came to curse us before,

247
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,680
but the Public Health Bureau also sent people here.

248
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,160
Why were they here?

249
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,440
There was a complaint that our restaurant's hygiene was not up to standard.

250
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,480
It was said that some customers had an upset stomach after eating here.

251
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,380
People started to spread rumors about it online after the Public Health Bureau left.

252
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,920
They have been saying that our restaurant has bad hygiene.

253
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,620
How can they slander us like that?

254
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Why is it so hard to do something?

255
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,840
Uncle, don't be anxious. This is part of running a business.

256
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,480
When there's no one in the restaurant, people tend to think there's something wrong here,

257
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,800
so no one will come.

258
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,820
If there are a lot of customers in the restaurant,

259
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,980
people outside will think the food here is good and will come in to try some.

260
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,020
Xiao Zhan, I understand all of that,

261
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,400
but what about the customers?

262
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,560
Where do we find customers?

263
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,260
Da Lin, Xiao Zhan really does have his ways.

264
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,560
He asked employees from his company to have a dinner party here.

265
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,600
The rumor collapsed on its own.

266
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,100
Master, if we can attract new customers,

267
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,480
we'll be able to keep them with the taste of our food.

268
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,980
Of course.

269
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,260
Ye Tao, did you cut up the potatoes?

270
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,760
It's done!

271
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,420
I heard you also made your employees give Happy Family Restaurant good reviews.

272
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,360
It's because the food here is good.

273
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,980
It had nothing to do with me.

274
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,200
If Happy Family Restaurant can maintain their food quality,

275
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,360
it's only a matter of time before business picks up again.

276
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,500
Thank you for your help this time.

277
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,260
I wasn't helping you.

278
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,200
I think we have to check the surveillance footage again.

279
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,120
You also suspect Gu Jia Yi?

280
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,700
Don't you as well?

281
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,440
They don't know what kind of person Gu Jia Yi is.

282
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,040
They would never suspect a big star like her.

283
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,160
Also there were a lot of people there that day.

284
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,420
Even if someone did anything, it would be hard to find the culprit.

285
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,460
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence that Gu Jia Yi came that day?

286
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,839
I don't want Cheng Cheng to worry about this.

287
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,900
She has poor health.

288
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,940
She already has enough to worry about with Happy Family Restaurant.

289
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,480

290
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,140
Go slower. Rewind it back a little.

291
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,820
Look at what that person did with his hand.

292
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,200
I've already looked at this footage three times.

293
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,120
Are your eyes bad or something?

294
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,500
I am being careful with details.

295
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,080
You do it then.

296
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Public opinion on the internet hasn't been very friendly towards Xu Duo Cheng lately.

297
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,280
You should care more about how she's feeling.

298
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,720
Don't worry.

299
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,580
Cheng Cheng was feeling pretty down before,

300
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,720
but under my care, she's feeling much better.

301
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,020
It's already at a time like this.

302
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,320
Can you not mention yourself?

303
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,640
It's a natural reaction to being her boyfriend.

305
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,920
There's only one surveillance camera at the restaurant.

306
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,800
We've been looking through the footage for so long and didn't find anything.

307
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,700
Cheng Cheng told me she didn't serve the wrong dish.

308
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,780
I also asked Da Lin.

309
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,120
He said he even switched to corn oil instead.

310
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,400
So, what went wrong?

311
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,280
Rewind.

312
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,660
Right here.

313
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,480
Can you improve the picture quality?

314
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,620
This is already the highest resolution.

315
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,020
But look, she never showed up in the footage after that.

316
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,260
Judging by the footage, that person seemed to touch that bowl.

317
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,900
But we can't prove anything with just that.

318
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,680
 Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Jia Yi.

319
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,380
 Two days ago, I had a slip of the hand,

320
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,560
 which caused a video of the Happy Family Restaurant to gain a lot of traction.

321
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
 Many people now know about the Happy Family Restaurant.

322
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,960
 I didn't expect that due to eating something I am allergic to,

323
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,920
 I caused such a large reaction.

324
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,700
 I apologize for taking up public resources

325
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,320
 and causing distress to everyone because of my personal affair.

326
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,020
 I also hope all malicious speculations about my relationship with Xu Duo Cheng can stop as well.

327
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,480
 Please, also stop sharing harmful comments towards Happy Family Restaurant.

328
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,600
 I already accepted an apology from the restaurant.

329
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,040
 I'm also willing to believe this was not done on purpose.

330
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,140
 I hope everyone online can give the parties involved some personal space

331
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,600
 and not excessively discuss this matter.

332
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
 Thank you.

333
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,260
Why did you post this video?

334
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,920
 Why else would I?

335
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,680
To help the Happy Family Restaurant solve its problem.

336
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Doesn't that take care of everything all at once?

337
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,380
 Besides, I'm under a lot of pressure

338
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,800
for posting an apology video on behalf of the Happy Family Restaurant.

339
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
Do you know how many people are keeping an eye on me?

340
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,940
Gu Jia Yi, I know what you are up to.

341
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,480
Jiang Nan, I'm the victim of this incident.

342
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,480
 We still don't know what happened at the restaurant.

343
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,933
Maybe you were the victim before

344
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:03,280
but you are causing harm to someone else now.

345
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,520
Gu Jia Yi, don't make me hate you more.

346
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,800
Happy Family Restaurant is really famous now.

347
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,540
What do you think Gu Jia Yi meant by this?

348
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,140
This incident isn't worth being on the trending search.

349
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,200
She's up to no good.

350
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,060
Aren't Brother Nan and Zhan Zhi Lin investigating this?

351
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,800
Don't tell Ke Qin about this.

352
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,680
Xu Duo Cheng doesn't know about this.

353
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,220
I'm Mr. Right, now. 
  (T/N: Ideal husband)

354
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,480
Why would I know about this?

355
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,420
- Don't worry. 
 - Okay.

356
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,500
Who are these people?

357
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,600
 Orange must be feeling horrible.

358
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,200
 I'm so pissed.

359
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,520
 These people don't care about the clarification.

360
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
 All they care about is the gossip.

361
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,560
 I won't believe it.

362
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,160
 I'll keep posting the clarification!

363
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,680
Who knows when this matter can be resolved?

364
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,820
My dad just started to pull himself together and now this happened.

365
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,740
Zhan Zhi Lin and I have been investigating

366
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,180
but Gu Jia Yi's video unexpectedly

367
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,100
put you and the Happy Family Restaurant in the public eye again.

368
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,720
Why didn't you tell me you were investigating?

369
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,940
The surveillance footage showed someone that bumped into you.

370
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,120
That person's hand touched the plate.

371
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,160
She had a chance to do it

372
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,560
but we still can't be sure yet.

373
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,520
Besides, you already have enough on your mind about the Happy Family Restaurant.

374
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,620
I don't want to add to your worries and hurt your brain cells.

375
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,300
You're telling me now though.

376
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,220
I'm telling you now because I want you to pull yourself together.

377
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,400
No matter how much doubt you hear,

378
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,440
no matter what will happen later,

379
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,240
you should always be the most optimistic Xu Duo Cheng.

380
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,460
We can solve this problem together.

381
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,560
- Cheng... 
 - You can't say no.

382
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:04,993
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:23,968
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

384
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:30,482

385
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:38,479
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

386
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:44,166
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

387
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,712
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

388
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,792
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

389
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:58,045

390
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:01,605
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

391
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,478
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

392
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,778
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

393
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,592
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

394
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:12,580
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

395
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,897
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

396
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:19,965
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

397
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:24,251
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

398
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,900
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

399
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,291
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

400
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:34,425
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

401
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:37,259
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

402
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,258
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

403
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:44,601
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

404
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:48,663
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

405
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:52,878
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

406
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:59,026

407
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,840
Jiang Nan, thank you.

408
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,920
It's so good to have you.

409
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,960
A kiss is not enough to reward me.

410
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,400
Did you stay up all night?

411
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,586
But I saw a little piggy who slept really well.

412
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:04,960
I didn't dare disturb her sweet dream,

413
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,800
so I had to carry her back to bed.

414
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,500
You're a little piggy.

415
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,220
Here, drink it to replenish yourself.

416
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,660
- Hello. 
  - Someone left me a comment on Weibo

417
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
that they shot a video at Happy Family Restaurant,

418
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,440
and the angle they got is what we need.

419
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,960
I already contacted them.

420
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,400
That's great. Tell me if there are any updates.

421
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,480
Let's hurry and find this person. They are very important.

422
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,640
Cheng Cheng, there's no rush.

423
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
That person hasn't replied yet.

424
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,240
Anyway, you don't need to worry.

425
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,180
This matter will be resolved soon.

426
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,920
 Sister Jia Yi, I think there was someone who shot a video of you

427
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,180
 and contacted Zhan Zhi Lin.

428
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:07,880
Didn't I ask you to get a lot of people to block their view?

429
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,780
Sister Jia Yi, do you think someone was really able to film you?

430
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,080
Think about it yourself.

431
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,000
 I'm sorry.

432
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,920
 Bro, it's crispy and delicious. Very good!

433
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,820
They probably got a video at that time.

434
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,140
Why were you so careless?

435
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,300
Hurry and think of something.

436
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,800
If this is exposed, you know what the consequences are.

437
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,640
 Cheng Cheng, I wrote an article for you. True Image won't let me publish it

438
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,280
 but I finally got approved by a media firm.

439
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,060
 Don't worry. I will surely bring justice to you and the Happy Family Restaurant.

440
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,860
 We'll fight to the end.

441
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,520
Any news?

442
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,480
No. It's Ke Qin.

443
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,840
We haven't heard from Zhan Zhi Lin yet.

444
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,020
Don't be anxious.

445
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,720
Let's eat first.

446
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,320
You said Zhan Zhi Lin had someone contact him.

447
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,240
Why haven't we heard anything yet?

448
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,720
No news isn't bad news.

449
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,060
Now, you need to eat

450
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,160
to ensure you have enough nutrition inside you.

451
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
It's Zhan Zhi Lin.

452
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,500
 Bro, it's crispy and delicious!

453
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,900
That's the person.

454
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
It's a pity the picture quality is a bit poor.

455
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
Otherwise, we can see her face clearly.

456
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,460
Who do you think wants to harm Gu Jia Yi?

457
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,280
That's not important.

458
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,940
I'll send this video to Lord Bao and ask him to clarify for us.

459
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,400
It's time to clear Happy Family Restaurant's name.

460
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,660
Don't forget, we'll clear your name too.

461
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,220
Jiang Nan, you're here.

462
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
Take a look at the menu.

463
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,880
I remember the desserts here used to be your favorite.

464
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,220
I didn't ask you here just to eat.

465
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,020
I just want to ask you,

466
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,460
why are you playing these tricks behind my back?

467
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,640
How would I know something like that would happen at Xu Duo Cheng's restaurant?

468
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,220
There's no need to put on an act in front of me.

469
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,060
Gu Jia Yi, does this have anything to do with you?

470
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,280
Why must you suspect me every time something happens?

471
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

472
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,040
At first, you "liked" an ad of Happy Family Restaurant.

473
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,700
Then, someone swapped out the dishes at the restaurant.

474
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,820
Now, you deliberately posted an apology video.

475
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,020
Don't always speak from Happy Family's standpoint

476
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,960
just because it belongs to Xu Duo Cheng's family.

477
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,440
We already found proof and called the police.

478
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,480
I don't care if you did it on purpose.

479
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,180
Do not get involved in my affairs ever again.

480
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,520
You're still suspecting me?

481
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,560
I'm not the only one who's hung up on unrequited love.

482
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
Why aren't you suspecting anyone else?

483
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,980
Why are you so sure it's me?

484
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,020
Let me tell you one last time.

485
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,380
No matter if there was Xu Duo Cheng or not, there can never be anything between us.

486
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,380

487
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Master!

488
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,720
Master! Master!

489
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,420
- Master! Master! 
 - What are you shouting for?

490
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,800
Someone posted a video and a statement.

491
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,360
They said someone framed us for Gu Jia Yi's allergy incident.

492
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,240
Someone deliberately bumped into Cheng Cheng and sprinkled peanut powder into the dish.

493
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,680
- Sprinkled what? 
 - Peanut powder.

494
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
- What powder? 
 - Peanut powder!

495
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,420
I told you someone framed us!

496
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,740
We didn't do it.

497
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,180
This is great. It certainly wasn't us.

498
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,000
Master, that's not what you said the other day.

499
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,880
- What did I say that day? 
 - You said I...

500
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,160
I told you to flip the sign to temporarily close the restaurant. Get working now!

501
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,480
Master. Master, why don't we take this chance to celebrate it with a 20% off discount event

502
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,280
to use the popularity we have at the moment?

503
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,940
We should use the attention we have!

504
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,488
You're too young.

505
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,420
Da Lin. Too young!

506
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,640
I had an epiphany over the past few days.

507
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,100
Popularity is only temporary,

508
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
but delicious food is forever

509
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,080
and everlasting.

510
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,800
Perseverance will prevail.

511
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,920
Also, we need to train ourselves

512
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,840
to remain modest and to keep our cool at all times.

513
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,740
Master, let's start preparations now.

514
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,360
A lot of customers are waiting to order out there.

515
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,760
You should...

516
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,480
Most importantly, you need to be able to size up the situation.

517
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,640
Give me my ladle!

518
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,460
What's upsetting you?

519
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:18,880
Did you forget your promise to me?

520
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,700
 Sister, don't be mad at me for speaking out.

521
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,100
 At this time, only President Liang can help us.

522
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,460
 We shouldn't try to save a little only to lose a lot

523
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,880
 by ruining your promising career.

524
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,240
 What do you want?

525
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,880
 Must I repeat what I want?

526
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,400
 What if I don't accept?

527
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,340
 You know the consequences

528
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,840
 better than anyone if you don't accept.

529
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:55,300
Since you got the video before Jiang Nan,

530
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,660
why didn't you have it deleted? You even sent it to Jiang Nan.

531
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,740
Public opinion on the Internet has taken a sharp turn.

532
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,980
They are all apologizing to the Happy Family Restaurant and Xu Duo Cheng.

533
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,940
If I didn't give the Happy Family Restaurant a blurry video to clarify the situation,

534
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,660
Jiang Nan would certainly think it was strange.

535
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,559
With Jiang Nan's personality, he will surely get to the bottom of this.

536
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,300
If there is any proof we somehow missed, we will be in trouble.

537
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,480
You should be happy.

538
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,420
I'm telling you, this is already the best result.

539
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:38,139
By the way, ask your studio to release a statement right away

540
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,560
and say you had been followed by anti-fans lately.

541
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,500
Hurry and put a close to this matter. If you keep delaying, you might be in more trouble.

542
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,339
I don't have to teach you how to word it, right?

543
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,860
No.

544
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,380
The statement released by Gu Jia Yi's studio claims that she had been followed by anti-fans.

545
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,480
The person who came to Happy Family Restaurant is one of her anti-fans.

546
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,200
She's officially warning her anti-fans.

547
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,160
What's the use of warning them?

548
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,780
She should report to the police and arrest her.

549
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,980
Actors are public figures.

550
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,640
A lot of things aren't in their control.

551
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,400
Anti-fans are so scary these days.

552
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,780
No wonder celebrities all have bodyguards now.

553
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,320
Maybe I should do some training and protect you.

554
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,900
With your fragile frame?

555
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,520
However, I still think Gu Jia Yi's allergy incident isn't so simple.

556
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,420
The anti-fan excuse is too well-reasoned.

557
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,300
Cheng Cheng, do you still remember any specific features of the person who bumped into you?

558
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,080
Specific features?

559
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,440
I remember.

560
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,200
There's a scar on that person's arm.

561
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,640
It's about...

562
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,760
It's about the length of an inch.

563
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,320
An inch-long scar?

564
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,480
It's her.

565
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,460
Sister Jia Yi, it's fortunate you were able to come on this show at the last moment.

566
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,540
Otherwise, we wouldn't even know what to do about the show.

567
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,040
- Then we have to work together again next time. 
 - All right.

568
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,880
- It would be a waste otherwise. 
 - We will.

569
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,120
Xiao Mei, set up a time.

570
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,300
Xiao Mei, you must give me a chance.

571
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,100
No problem.

572
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,260
Why are you here?

573
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,980
You guys can talk. I'll head back up.

574
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,660
You're the only one allowed to work here?

575
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,580
Can't I have work here too?

576
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,950

577
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:37,141
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

578
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:43,655
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

579
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:51,452
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

580
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:57,239
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

581
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,885
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

582
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:04,865
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

583
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:11,118
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

584
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:14,678
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

585
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:16,451
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

586
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,851
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

587
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,665
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

588
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:25,653
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

589
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:28,970
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

590
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,938
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

591
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:37,324
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

592
00:38:37,324 --> 00:38:39,973
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

593
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:43,364
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

594
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:47,498
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

595
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:50,332
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

597
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:57,674
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

598
00:38:57,674 --> 00:39:01,736
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

599
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:05,951
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

600
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:12,299
