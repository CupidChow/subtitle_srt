00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,020

2
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:13,648
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:15,988
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:19,288
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:24,563
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:30,321
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,135
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,540
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,922
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,721
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,435
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:48,422
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:51,149
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,862
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:55,509
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:58,776
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:01,491
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:05,832
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:10,679
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,533
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,267
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,274
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:21,087
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:25,746
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:31,065
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:45,204
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:48,657

28
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,567
Brother Nan, are you feeling better?

29
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,887
What happened?

30
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,427
I'm fine.

31
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,947
Brother, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:06,147
I didn't explain it to them clearly.

33
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:08,807
They booked you two one queen bedroom.

34
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,187
Just get another room.

35
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:12,387
I just asked. The hotel is completely booked tonight.

36
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,527
All the rooms are full?

37
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:17,607
Because it's the tourist season, all the rooms have been booked in advance.

38
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:20,087
It's true, Brother Nan.

39
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,587
It's my fault, Brother.

40
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,427
I've been keeping an eye on this ever since I got to the hotel.

41
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:24,707
They really don't have any vacancies.

42
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,807
The rest of our crew have been arranged two to a room.

43
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,307
What should we do now?

44
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,787
There aren't any other hotels around here.

45
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,407
Maybe...

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,140
There's no other way.

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,747
Give me the room card.

48
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:48,807
Hurry and go take a shower.

49
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:51,047
Sh-Shower?

50
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,947
What are you thinking?

51
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:28,987
Of course you should take a shower after being rained on.

52
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,467
Well, I'm going to take a shower now.

53
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,067
I'll sleep on the couch tonight.

54
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,567
You'll sleep on the bed.

55
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,167
 He's not really going to start undressing, right?

56
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,267
Wait!

57
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,507
- Why are you taking your clothes off? 
 - I'm drenched.

58
00:03:57,507 --> 00:04:00,067
If I don't get changed, should I just wait to catch a cold?

59
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,607
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:05,927
It's all my fault for making you get caught in the rain.

61
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:15,987
Hurry up and go shower.

62
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:18,407
Don't catch a cold.

63
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,790
How is it going?

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,807
Lord Bao,  everything is arranged as you said.

65
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,447
We even got an unexpected reward.

66
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,500

67
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,907
What's that noise?

68
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,590

69
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:49,227
What's the unexpected reward? Hurry up and report it.

70
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:52,307
No need to bother. I'll report it to you myself.

71
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:59,607
Lord Bao, you're here too?

72
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,427
Don't come back if you can't even handle such a small matter!

73
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,140
Did he take the wrong medicine? 
  (T/N: Acting abnormal)

74
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:11,007
- Where's the cold medicine I told you to buy? 
 - Here.

75
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:12,587
Thanks.

76
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,947
E-Editor-in-Chief  Qin, you're here to workout too?

77
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:21,047
I just moved to this area recently.

78
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:22,907
You shouldn't just focus on fishing in your free time.

79
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:24,707
You should exercise a little.

80
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,427
I'm leaving.

81
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,540

82
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,587
Hello, Mom. I'm at the hotel.

83
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:45,947
Don't worry.

84
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,667
I'm telling you, this place is a lot of fun.

85
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:49,907
You and Dad should come by when you have a chance.

86
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:52,067
 We don't have the time. We'll do that later.

87
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,927
We're too busy with Happy Family Restaurant. We just got home.

88
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,827
I'm exhausted. I'm soaking my feet now.

89
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:58,390
New boss, new atmosphere.

90
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,800
Darling, why are you using Jiang Nan's phone?

91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,247
Are you two staying in the same room?

92
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:07,627
Of course not.

93
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:09,367
It's because my phone ran out of battery

94
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,027
and I was in a rush to call and tell you everything was okay.

95
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,447
 What's that noise?

96
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:20,367
Why is there a huge rat in the hotel?

97
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,967
 - There's a rat in your room?  
 - Exactly.

98
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,547
The rat is huge and stinky too.

99
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:30,267
Hurry, call the front desk and change your room if needed.

100
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:33,347
- I... 
 - Darling, go to another hotel if there's a rat.

101
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:35,907
- That's right. 
 - You should live more comfortably on a trip.

102
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,667
Don't be reluctant to spend money.

103
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,127
Got it.

104
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,907
By the way, Darling, it's very important to eat well when you're on a trip.

105
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:45,507
Make sure the food is sanitary.

106
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:50,287
Dear Chef Xu, I'm not going on a tropical rainforest expedition.

107
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,147
 Don't worry, okay?

108
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:53,287
 It's getting late.

109
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,427
I'm going to sleep now. You and mom should go to bed soon too.

110
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:56,947
Okay, bye.

111
00:06:56,947 --> 00:07:00,327
What do you mean by "bye"? I'm not finished yet.

112
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:04,519
Are you sure you want to stay in a room with a rat?

113
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,747
Our daughter has really grown up.

114
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:14,907
Honey, is this the first time our daughter

115
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:18,287
went on a long trip with a man?

116
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,287
That's right.

117
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,927
Why? Are you worried?

118
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:29,067
All right, I made my observations. Jiang Nan is an honest boy.

119
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,147
You're right.

120
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,447
Even if that boy has evil intentions,

121
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:36,167
our Cheng Cheng might not even agree, right?

122
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:38,167
Look at you.

123
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:43,227
But I'm just worried about whether she will eat and sleep well.

124
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:45,007
I'm still a little worried.

125
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,387
Things are always fine and dandy at home. Everything becomes difficult when you're away.

126
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:49,107
Home is always the best.

127
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:50,547
You...

128
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,327
Can't you comfort me a little?

129
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,527
You're making me feel worse.

130
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,667
No, Honey, I'm not trying to make you feel worse.

131
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,587
Isn't that normal?

132
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,367
She's all grown up and already graduated from college.

133
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,807
Besides, she's in a relationship.

134
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:08,587
In the future, she might not talk to us about everything.

135
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,987
She will talk to Jiang Nan instead.

136
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:12,767
It's not that she doesn't love us.

137
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,707
It's just... that she doesn't want us to worry.

138
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:18,687
Therefore, we just have to live our lives well

139
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,847
and not let her worry about us.

140
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,547
Right?

141
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,767
Xu Duo Cheng,

142
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,667
wake up.

143
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,227
What?

144
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:05,047
Get up. Go sleep on the bed.

145
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,827
What?

146
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,167
If you don't go, then forget about it.

147
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,687
I'll go!

148
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,580
The bed is more comfortable after all.

149
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,507
The happiness came too suddenly

150
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,187
and I'm not used to it.

151
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,547
No need to thank me.

152
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:32,947
You were snoring too loudly and I couldn't sleep anyway.

153
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,327
Did I snore?

154
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,127
That can't be.

155
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:43,227
Jiang Nan,

156
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:45,907
thank you.

157
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,667
If it weren't for you,

158
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,847
I might have been sleeping on the street tonight.

159
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,067
I know. Go to sleep now.

160
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:01,487
 Jiang Nan, thank you for appearing in my life.

161
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:04,087
 You brought me good fortune time and time again.

162
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:07,507
 You made me so happy at the end of my life.

163
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,687
 Thank you.

164
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,627
Please, confirm this location again.

165
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:15,567
All right, all right.

166
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,507
- Hello, Teacher Jiang Nan. 
 - Hello.

167
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:33,007
This is for you. It's a teether.

168
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:38,027
You're still a child. You're the one who needs it.

169
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,387
Director Liu, why isn't the female lead here yet? She won't have time for makeup later.

170
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,267
Wait a minute. She might not even come.

171
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,127
Who will take the blame if I have no time to do her makeup?

172
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:48,507
Don't worry about it!

173
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,887
 - Is everything in order in your department? 
 - Yes, no problem.

174
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,227
 What's wrong?

175
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,667
 Director, something came up and the female lead can't make it.

176
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,627
Do you want to call and ask again?

177
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,947
Nonsense!

178
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:01,187
If you don't give me any actors, what am I going to shoot?

179
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:02,607
I told you to tell the production team,

180
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:04,867
no matter what happens, they have to find me an actress!

181
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:07,587
I want the aesthetic I'm looking for! I want beauty! Suffocating beauty!

182
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:10,047
I'll rush them again. I'll rush them again.

183
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,347
Director, what happened?

184
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:16,847
The female lead, Lisa, said something about appendicitis, so she can't make it anymore.

185
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,187
Director, give me some time.

186
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,387
I'll figure something out.

187
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,527
Because this MV is very important to me.

188
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,927
Please, calm down.

189
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,627
Sorry to trouble you.

190
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:32,567
Go find me someone! Find an actress!

191
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,267
I need to shoot!

192
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,147
 Something terrible happened. They are changing the female lead.

193
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:43,947
I already know. I was just about to call you.

194
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,147
No, you really have no idea.

195
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,587
The producer just called me and told me Gu Jia Yi is going to play the role.

196
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:51,187
 Why won't that woman give up?

197
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:54,747
She never acted in these MVs before.

198
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:59,447
I'm even suspecting she has something to do with Lisa's appendicitis.

199
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:06,647
Sister, look, our suitcase is almost full.

200
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,007
Do you still want to take this outfit?

201
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,307
Take them.

202
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:14,867
I can walk around with Jiang Nan after we finish the MV.

203
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,947
By the way, when will the car arrive?

204
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:20,547
It's probably already here. I'll go contact Lao Fang.

205
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:35,247
 Brother, Liang Zhe got the female lead role of the MV,

206
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,967
 but I didn't expect Gu Jia Yi would go.

207
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:40,647
 She went to the producers herself and reduced her remuneration to get the role.

208
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:43,287
Let's sit back and enjoy the show.

209
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:46,607
Someone's more anxious about this than we are.

210
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,467
Brother Rui.

211
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:01,947
I'm here.

212
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,907
Please, communicate with the producers.

213
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,467
We mainly need to get two things straight.

214
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:09,847
One, if Gu Jia Yi takes the role, we will terminate our collaboration.

215
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,987
 I will compensate them for all losses.

216
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:15,567
Two, I've already found a suitable candidate for the MV's female lead.

217
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,127
 If the producers agree to use her,

218
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:19,567
 I can waive my remuneration.

219
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:23,227
Furthermore, if we don't achieve the desired result in the end,

220
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:26,307
I will cover all the costs of the MV.

221
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,487
Wait a minute.

222
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,087
I understand the first half of that.

223
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,567
Who's the female lead you want for the MV?

224
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,467
Do I know her?

225
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,407
Xu Duo Cheng.

226
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,127
Xu Duo Cheng was my muse for this song.

227
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:43,427
Therefore, she's the most suitable female lead.

228
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,287
Got it. As long as you're sure.

229
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,427
I'm very sure.

230
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:53,087
All right, I'll help you deal with the rest.

231
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:02,867
That bumpkin?

232
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:03,867
No.

233
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:07,140
I don't care what you do, I have to be the female lead.

234
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,010

235
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,807
What's going on? Why did the female lead suddenly drop out?

236
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:23,147
It's okay. Don't worry.

237
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:25,110
Lord Bao is handling the situation.

238
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,387
However, we might need your help.

239
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,747
What can I help with?

240
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:37,667
- Come to the rescue. 
 - Come to the rescue?

241
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,327
Jiang Nan.

242
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,367
Hello, Director.

243
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,827
This is the girl you recommended?

244
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:48,107
Yes. She's also my girlfriend.

245
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:50,267
Your girlfriend?

246
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,227
Have you read the script?

247
00:14:52,227 --> 00:14:54,887
She can play the piano and she's a piano teacher at a piano store.

248
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:58,087
As for the script, I think she's more familiar with it than I am.

249
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,887
The most important thing is,

250
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:03,267
she gave me the inspiration for this song.

251
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:08,467
A real couple would certainly have good chemistry in the MV.

252
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,847
All right. All departments, get her ready.

253
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,147
Jiang Nan, I'll leave her to you.

254
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,567
Wait, no, Director. I...

255
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,967
You're the reason why this song exists.

256
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,347
Therefore, you are the female lead of this song.

257
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:24,647
You have to believe in yourself.

258
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:27,427
No, I really can't.

259
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:31,127
It's an emergency.

260
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,127
If you don't take the role,

261
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:35,587
I won't be able to shoot this MV.

262
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:40,807
Lin Yun.

263
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,467
- I'll leave her to you. 
 - Sure, no problem.

264
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,327
Sister, what's wrong?

265
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:14,247
In a while, you'll run the blocking again and we'll rehearse the scene.

266
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,687
- Okay. 
 - After that...

267
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:18,307
Director, the actress is ready!

268
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:35,807
I'm about to get an award.

269
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:57,667
More...

270
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,367
A little more.

271
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,007
More...

272
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,607
Cut!

273
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,447
That was good, both of you. Both good.

274
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,847
I want authenticity.

275
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,207
What I want is a real couple

276
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:15,347
to demonstrate their real feelings in our MV.

277
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:18,146
Authenticity. Only authenticity can touch the audience.

278
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,547
Come on.

279
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:22,087
Look at each other. Look at each other.

280
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:23,987
That's right. Gaze upon each other.

281
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,227
Good. Gaze into each other's eyes with tenderness.

282
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:29,086
Good, keep looking. Keep looking.

283
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,527
Get in touch with your emotions.

284
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:36,627
Imagine what you'd do in real life.

285
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,187
Yes! Yes!

286
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,617
â™«  The bright color of caramel  â™«

287
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,415
â™«  is the sign of summer  â™«

288
00:17:59,415 --> 00:18:03,046
â™«  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  â™«

289
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:06,748
â™«  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  â™«

290
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:10,377
â™«  You lift away my arrogant facade  â™«

291
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,727
â™«  It isn't the best feeling  â™«

292
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:17,497
â™«  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  â™«

293
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,403
â™«  Maybe you added your favorite ingredients  â™«

294
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:28,070
â™«  Every day becomes magical because of you  â™«

295
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,695
â™«  I like the taste of cola chicken wings  â™«

296
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,266
â™«  I want to be close to you, I'll never get tired  â™«

297
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,869
â™«  The perfect amount of sweetness  â™«

298
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:39,453
â™«  Secretly fermenting these memories in cola  â™«

299
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,610
â™«  I want you to count on me forever  â™«

300
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,240
â™«  I can't abstain from the taste of liking you  â™«

301
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,470
â™«  A match made in heaven, just perfect  â™«

302
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,747
Beautiful!

303
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:55,827
Great chemistry!

304
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:58,907
You can't fake this kind of chemistry!

305
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,227
You can't sleep?

306
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,947
Me neither.

307
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,547
Where did you get this?

308
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,087
The director gave it to me today.

309
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:54,407
The director said what we shot today was really good.

310
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:01,147
Xu Duo Cheng, was this your first time filming an MV?

311
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,127
Of course.

312
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,147
Was it your first time getting caught in the rain?

313
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,687
Of course not.

314
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:12,267
Was it the first time you filmed a MV in the rain?

315
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,567
What exactly do you want to say?

316
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:20,187
What I mean is, professional actors might not be able to

317
00:20:20,187 --> 00:20:22,887
to act the way you did in the last few shots.

318
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:48,767
Do you think I can be an actor too?

319
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,407
Well, that would be an overstatement.

320
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:53,047
Go to sleep.

321
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,827
I need to wake up early tomorrow to tour around.

322
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,327
You're still going to tour around?

323
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:00,547
You lost your phone last time.

324
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,707
What are you planning to lose this time?

325
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:06,727
It'll be fine as long as I don't lose myself.

326
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,187
There's no guarantee about that.

327
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:13,367
If you lose yourself, wouldn't I suffer a huge loss as your creditor?

328
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,887
- Hello? 
  - Are you Mr. Bao?

329
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,207
 Prada ran away in the park.

330
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,680
 The call won't go through to his owner.

331
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,727
Wait, no.

332
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:53,027
Prada! Prada!

333
00:21:53,027 --> 00:21:54,727
Prada!

334
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,827
Prada!

335
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:02,687
Prada!

336
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:07,187
President Qian, I think we can still negotiate about the financing issue.

337
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:10,147
Yes, yes, yes.

338
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:13,447
I certainly have journalistic pursuits

339
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,987
but the problem with True Image now is...

340
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:18,627
Hello?

341
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,727
Where did he go?

342
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:32,407
Lord Bao?

343
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:36,127
What are you doing here? Are you playing cricket-fighting?

344
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,967
- I'm looking for a dog. 
 - You're looking for a dog?

345
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:41,547
Son! Son!

346
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:43,927
I didn't know you have a dog.

347
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,847
- Son! 
 - Prada!

348
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,547
Prada!

349
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:49,047
Isn't that my dog?

350
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:50,247
Your dog?

351
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:52,827
That's right. Prada.

352
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:56,827
Wait. What type of dog owner are you?

353
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:59,107
You never take care of him and just leave him in the pet store.

354
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:01,767
Don't you know he's a golden retriever? He needs a lot of exercises.

355
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,267
He'll be depressed if he doesn't exercise. He'll be depressed, you know?

356
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,087
Keep him if you have time to take care of him.

357
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,687
Don't keep a dog if you can't take care of him.

358
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,287
Cats and dogs are not toys.

359
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,887
Let me tell you, if I wasn't here todayâ€”

360
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,487
Wait a minute!

361
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:16,467
Why do you care if I can take care of a dog?

362
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:20,347
Besides, who let you approach my dog without my permission?

363
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,667
Otherwise, why would Prada come to such a dirty place like this?

364
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,107
Don't you use a leash when you walk the dog? You have to be responsible for him!

365
00:23:26,107 --> 00:23:27,407
What if he gets lost?

366
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,427
No. It's true I didn't use a leash,

367
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:31,807
but I was helping you look for your dog.

368
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:34,167
Aren't you being a little too unreasonable if you say that?

369
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:38,627
You almost lost my dog! I haven't even settled that with you yet. Who are you trying to lecture?

370
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,767
Fine.

371
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:41,407
If I can't deal with you, I'll just stay away from you.

372
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:43,647
I... I won't touch your dog anymore!

373
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:45,907
Who asked you to?

374
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:51,887
Prada? Praâ€“

375
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:55,127
Prada, you don't recognize Mommy anymore?

376
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,987
Wait!

377
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:02,367
What?

378
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,047
I think the dog is startled.

379
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,947
He's not coming with me.

380
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:07,867
What does that have to do with me?

381
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,847
Well...

382
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:18,927
I'm sorry. I had a bad attitude just now.

383
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:20,927
I want to apologize.

384
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,667
I won't accept it.

385
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:33,147
Prada. Prada!

386
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:34,307
Prada, hurry and come here. Come!

387
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,727
Come to Mommy, Prada!

388
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:36,807
Let's go, Prada.

389
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:39,987
Prada, come here. Be good. Be good! Be good!

390
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:42,587
I just don't want him to have no owner.

391
00:24:42,587 --> 00:24:44,287
Wait...

392
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,667
Ungrateful dog!

393
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:48,947
Prada!

394
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:52,147
I'm Mommy, Prada!

395
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,394
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

396
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:05,899
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

397
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:09,281
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

398
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,980
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

399
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,794
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

400
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:19,007
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

401
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:21,207
So childish.

402
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,887
Is it?

403
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,812
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

404
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:29,079
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

405
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:31,894
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

406
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:36,135
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

407
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:41,005
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

408
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:43,759
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

409
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,593
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

410
00:25:46,593 --> 00:25:48,700
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

411
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,413
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

412
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:57,082
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

413
00:25:57,082 --> 00:25:58,787
Hi, this is your ice cream. Please, take it.

414
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,287
Thank you.

415
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:13,267
It's okay. Like the heavenly maid scattering flowers, may you have peace year after year. 
  (T/N: Buddhist reference)

416
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,767
Wipe your hand.

417
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,307
Here. I bought you another one.

418
00:26:39,587 --> 00:26:41,287
Thank you.

419
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,727
When you see such beautiful scenery,

420
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:07,927
does your mind automatically turn them into lyrics?

421
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,447
It's not that extreme.

422
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:11,747
I just remember the current scenery and how I feel.

423
00:27:11,747 --> 00:27:15,327
When I need to write lyrics, I'll bring it back out.

424
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:18,667
It's like an information database.

425
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:22,047
Anyway, you are really skilled.

426
00:27:22,047 --> 00:27:25,987
I think the lyrics in all of your songs paint a really vivid picture.

427
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:29,567
You can always capture the highlights in your audience's memory.

428
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:32,027
How do you do that?

429
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,887
I'm gifted.

430
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,547
So cocky.

431
00:27:56,987 --> 00:28:00,667
"The ancient banyan tree was planted during the Ming Dynasty.

432
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,367
The tree is about 500 years old.

433
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:06,247
The tree once survived a lightning strike and maintains lush foliage."

434
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:09,947
This tree is really effective.

435
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:11,947
You believe that?

436
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:15,147
Hello.

437
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,787
No peeking.

438
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:28,267
No peeking.

439
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:29,887
It won't work if you peek.

440
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,587
Is it that serious?

441
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,785

442
00:28:54,887 --> 00:29:00,067
"I hope Jiang Nan's career will flourish and he can be a superstar soon!"

443
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:08,767
Jiang Nan, your wish won't come true if you say it out loud.

444
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,700
â™«  The bright color of caramel is the sign of summer  â™«

445
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:26,267
Who told you that's the wish I wrote?

446
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,800
â™«  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  â™«

447
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,747
Wait for me.

448
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,540
â™«  It isn't the best feeling  â™«

449
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,500
â™«  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  â™«

450
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:47,082

451
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,707
After being in the city for so long,

452
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:09,767
it's pretty nice to come out and relax.

453
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,567
It is pretty nice.

454
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,267
The sunset is so beautiful.

455
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,787
Why?

456
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:25,287
Because after the glorious sunset, comes the sky full of stars.

457
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,167
It's my first time seeing a sunset like this.

458
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,847
Do you like it?

459
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:43,607
Actually, what you see

460
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,887
is a fireball that's been burning a few hundred million light-years away.

461
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,067
Why are you such a mood killer?

462
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:55,127
But honestly, maybe the light you see

463
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:58,727
has already burnt out a few hundred million light-years away.

464
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,847
Don't you think that's what makes it romantic?

465
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:05,727
We're witnessing their final glory a few hundred million light-years away.

466
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:08,007
Their radiance is rushing here to see you

467
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:11,907
across the Milky Way at the speed of 300.000 km per second.

468
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:15,567
Xu Duo Cheng, I've realized you have quite a gift with words.

469
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,287
That was a really good line.

470
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:18,287
Really?

471
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:20,047
Did I inspire you just now?

472
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,490
Will you write a new song?

473
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:25,347
I'll think about it.

474
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:34,247
Actually, I never expected that one day,

475
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:37,567
I could sit here with you and talk.

476
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:42,487
It really feels like a dream.

477
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:45,407
Then who do you think should be by my side?

478
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:47,307
Zhan Zhi Lin.

479
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:54,307
Actually, I know you've always wanted to ask about what happened between me and Zhan Zhi Lin,

480
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:56,007
but this is very complicated.

481
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:58,687
I can't explain it in a few words.

482
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:00,547
Besides, it happened so many years ago.

483
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:02,147
I don't want to mention it again.

484
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:05,067
- Actuaâ€” 
 - Anyway, stay away from him.

485
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:08,887
Actually, I don't think he's a bad guy.

486
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,367
Sure, he's not a bad buy.

487
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,167
I'm a bad guy.

488
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:15,080
Why are the two of you so strange?

489
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,960
You both get so angry when the other person is mentioned.

490
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,287
What did he say about me?

491
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,207
He just said...

492
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,327
- somethâ€” 
 - Forget it. I know what he said even if you don't tell me.

493
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,827
What's wrong?

494
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:37,627
You made me so angry that my stomach hurts.

495
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:40,687
Don't joke around with me.

496
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,527
Does it look like I'm joking?

497
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,487
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

498
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:45,887
Let's go.

499
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:38,727
Why did they give us so many fly sheets again?

500
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,027
There's almost no more space to stick them in the script.

501
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:43,167
It's making my head spin.

502
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:52,647
Sister, actually, I know you're upset because of Xu Duo Cheng.

503
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,767
Don't take it to heart.

504
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,507
That Xu Duo Cheng seems like an innocent girl on the surface

505
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,847
but she's actually very sly behind the scenes.

506
00:33:59,847 --> 00:34:03,147
Do you remember she forcefully kissed Jiang Nan at the press conference?

507
00:34:03,147 --> 00:34:04,727
And this time she wanted to steal the role in the MV.

508
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:06,087
She just wants fame.

509
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,866
She just wants to use Jiang Nan to make a name for herself.

510
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:11,687
Based on her skills?

511
00:34:11,687 --> 00:34:15,947
She just takes advantage of men's weaknesses for wanting to protect others.

512
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:24,187
I must let Jiang Nan see her true colors.

513
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,640

514
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,780

515
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,086
Do you feel better?

516
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:42,166
No. Let's go see a doctor first.

517
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:45,947
Take it easy.

518
00:34:49,327 --> 00:34:52,086
- No, I can't. 
 - How can a man be ticklish?

519
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:53,407
You won't feel ticklish if your girlfriend touches you, right?

520
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:54,927
Come on, Miss. Help me.

521
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,327
Come on.

522
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:00,907
Press here.

523
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:02,647
Is there a lump?

524
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:05,267
- Yes. 
 - There is?

525
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,887
Miss, this is an ab.

526
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,247
He's trying not to laugh.

527
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:13,087
Of course, his abs would tense up.

528
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:14,267
What did he eat today?

529
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:16,367
We went to the street food alley in the scenic area.

530
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:20,647
He drank milk tea and ate sugar-coated haws, ice cream, and spicy hot pot.

531
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:21,767
He eats quite a lot.

532
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:25,687
I told you the food there was not sanitary.

533
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:29,427
But I ate the same things you ate and I'm fine.

534
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,006
Sit up.

535
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,847
It's acute gastroenteritis.

536
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:36,127
He might also puke and have diarrhea later.

537
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:37,527
He also might have a fever.

538
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:42,587
How's this? I'll prescribe you some medication to relieve your symptoms.

539
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:47,627
Wait... What's wrong, Jiang Nan?

540
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:49,627
I want to puke.

541
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,207
Here, drink some water.

542
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:10,207
No. I need to go to the bathroom again!

543
00:36:19,507 --> 00:36:21,247
This is anti-inflammatory medication and antibiotics.

544
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,727
He has another bottle after this. Just call me when it's done.

545
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:24,747
Thank you.

546
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:27,407
- Thank you, Nurse. 
 - You're welcome.

547
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:34,887
Sorry to keep you here.

548
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:37,247
I originally wanted to come out with you to relax

549
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:39,247
but I ended up making you stay in the hospital with me.

550
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:40,687
It's all my fault.

551
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:44,047
I made you eat all those things and you ended up in the hospital.

552
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:46,047
It's all my fault.

553
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:48,767
Since you already admitted your mistake,

554
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,567
can you let me rest early?

555
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,187
Sure, get some rest now.

556
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,987
Do you want to lie down on that bed for a little?

557
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:06,487
It's okay. I'll stay here with you.

558
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:11,967
Good night.

559
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:14,947
Good night.

560
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,300
â™«  Flustered  â™«

561
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,830

562
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:26,442
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

563
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:32,129
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

564
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:35,375
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

565
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:39,748
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

566
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:46,257
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

567
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:49,648
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

568
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:53,682
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

569
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:56,616
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

570
00:37:56,616 --> 00:38:00,615
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

571
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:03,958
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

572
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:08,020
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

573
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,235
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

574
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:17,683
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

575
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:30,030

576
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:41,465
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

577
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:48,079
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

578
00:38:49,366 --> 00:38:55,976
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

579
00:38:55,976 --> 00:39:01,663
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

580

â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

584
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:20,975
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

585
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:23,275
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

586
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:26,089
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

587
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:30,077
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

588
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:33,394
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

589
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:37,262
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

590
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:41,748
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

591
