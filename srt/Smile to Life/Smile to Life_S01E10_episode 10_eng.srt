00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,120

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,614
♫  I've walked around in a big circle  ♫

3
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,954
♫  To finally meet you  ♫

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:19,254
♫  How can my love be restrained?  ♫

5
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:24,529
♫  My love for you is too obvious  ♫

6
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:30,287
♫  I guess you must have already discovered it  ♫

7
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,101
♫  On that clear evening  ♫

8
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,506
♫  It was romantic meeting you  ♫

9
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,888
♫  An unforgettable memory  ♫

10
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:41,587
♫  I heard that passionate love  ♫

11
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:44,401
♫  Can dissolve glaciers  ♫

12
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:48,388
♫  I say good night to you every night  ♫

13
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:51,115
♫  If you get used to it as well  ♫

14
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:53,828
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

15
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:55,475
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

16
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,742
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you   ♫

17
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:01,457
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

18
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:05,798
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

19
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:10,645
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

20
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,499
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

21
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:16,233
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

22
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,340
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,053
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

24
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:25,712
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

25
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:31,331
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

26
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:45,150
    🎈

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,109

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,360
Xu Duo Cheng!

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,360
Xu Duo Cheng!

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,580
 Xu Duo Cheng, are you okay?

31
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,760
Xu Duo Cheng,

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,900
 if you don't say anything, I will come in!

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,600
No!

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,800
That... can you buy something for me?

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,680
Buy what?

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,620
Just... that thing.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,600
Sir, may I help you with anything?

38
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,600
It's all right. I'm just looking around.

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,480
You must be buying pads for your girlfriend.

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,580
What's there to be shy about? What brand are you looking for?

41
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,440
I forgot too. Do you have any recommendations?

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,580
I recommend this one. It's ultra-thin and instantly absorbent. Also...

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,940
All right!

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,900
I'll get one of each. Thank you.

45
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,980
No one recognized you, right?

46
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,880
What do you think?

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,080
I'm sorry for troubling you.

48
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,000
- Hello? 
 - Where are you? They will be here soon.

49
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,870
I'm currently busy, so I can't make it.

50
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,780
Make up an excuse for me.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,800
This is such an important matter. How can you just say you aren't coming?

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,540
All right, that's enough. I'm hanging up now.

53
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,940
Hello?

54
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,480
I'm so angry!

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,620
Am I keeping you from your work?

56
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,920
It's okay. Just lie down and get some sleep. Call me when you wake up.

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,000
I haven't seen Ting Ting in a long time. She really is like her name. 
  (T/n: The character "Ting" means "fair and graceful")

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,540
You've become a slim and graceful young woman.

59
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,880
You flatter me, Uncle Zhan.

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,000
I am only saying the truth. She must be bashful.

61
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,420
It would be great if she got together with our family's Zhi Lin.

62
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,040
Is Zhi Lin about to arrive?

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,340
He's on the way. Let's not wait for him. Go ahead and eat.

64
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm sorry for coming late. Take a seat!

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,260
This is...

66
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,180
Zhi Lin's friend.

67
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,440
Let me formally introduce her to everyone.

68
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,870
This is my girlfriend. She's a car model.

69
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,300
We met at an auto show last week.

70
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,140
Zhi Lin is a good-looking man. There must be many girls who like him.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,560
I have some matters to attend to. We'll get going then.

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
- I'll see you out. 
 - No need to see me out.

73
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,680
It's the first time Zhi Lin has brought back a girl. You should get to know her better.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,840
Our children's matters are more important.

75
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,380
Do you know what kind of occasion it is today?

76
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,240
Why did you bring a dubious woman here?

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,820
Why is your dad speaking like that?

78
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,180
Honey, you can head back. I'll find you later.

79
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,180
What? It's not enough to control my education and career.

80
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,120
Now, you want to meddle in my marriage too?

81
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,200
Ting Ting is good in every aspect.

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,920
She has a good family background and education. How is she not good enough for you in any way?

83
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,900
If she's so good, you should marry her.

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,360
My mom passed away a long time ago and you never remarried.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,260
 At this point, I have nothing else to say.

86
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,860
 Of course, you can't say anything.

87
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,080
 You think I don't know where your heart has been over the years?

88
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,720
 Have you ever cared about how I feel? If it wasn't for Zhi Lin...

89
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,040
 Don't you mention Zhi Lin!

90
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,480
 Fight, fight, all they do is fight.

91
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,780
 Mom. Mom!

92
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,560
 Shu Qian! I'll call an ambulance!

93
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
 Mom!

94
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,400

95
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,830

96
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
Have some water.

97
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,980
Thank you.

98
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,580
Don't move.

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,620
Does it still hurt?

100
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,180
I feel much better.

101
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,240
I'll go make you something to eat.

102
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,660
What can you make?

103
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,060
I...

104
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,140
 Jiang Nan, it's me.

105
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,220
 If you don't open the door, I'll keep waiting.

106
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,020
It's so late at night. Who is it?

107
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,980
Bao Rui.

108
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,280
By the way, Orange, are you still in pain?

109
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,060
No.

110
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,720
Go upstairs and get some rest. Get some sleep.

111
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,780
I've already slept for a while though.

112
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,140
Listen to me. Hurry and go upstairs now.

113
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Go upstairs now.

114
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,560
Why are you here? Aren't you filming something recently?

115
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm on vacation.

116
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,980
Why are you here anyway?

117
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,940
I know you posted that photo today to distance yourself from me and to have me give up,

118
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,100
but the more you do that proves that I am still in your heart.

119
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,620
Let's get back together, okay? I really love you.

120
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,820
You're overthinking it. Please, leave.

121
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,880
Gu Jia Yi!

122
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
There's nothing between us anymore. Please, leave!

123
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,280
You two are not living together, right?

124
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,200
It's not possible for you to like Xu Duo Cheng. You two are in two different worlds.

125
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,560
Why can't you give me another chance?

126
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,040
The two of us stopped having a relationship since the day you left.

127
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,700
You still hate me?

128
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,740
But doesn't that just prove you still love me?

129
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,680
Liang Zhe and I broke up. I am not under his control anymore.

130
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,280
You already got what you wanted. What else do you want?

131
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,980
Yes, I already got what I wanted

132
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,260
but this part of me is empty.

133
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,780
I've been saving this place just for you.

134
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,060
I can help you become popular again and get you opportunities to sing like before.

135
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,320
Isn't that nice?

136
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
I really don't know you anymore.

137
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,020
I already have a girlfriend. If there's nothing else, you should leave now.

138
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,840
What do you like about her? Tell me so I can move on from you.

139
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,500
All right, Xu Duo Cheng only wants to live a simple life.

140
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,660
She hopes to live every day to the fullest.

141
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,600
She never chases after fame and wealth.

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,880
She treats every single friend of hers sincerely and wholeheartedly.

143
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,400
She never takes advantage of anyone.

144
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,020
She's simple and pure.

145
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,680
This ordinary girl caused me to fall deeper in love with her again and again.

146
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,480
Aren't you talking about my past self?

147
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,580
She's not like you.

148
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,380
Jia Yi, you're currently a popular celebrity.

149
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,140
You're making it difficult for me when you come to see Lao Jiang so late at night.

150
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,520
Jiang Nan, I have always regretted letting you go before.

151
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,840
I won't let you go in the future.

152
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,740
Did you not come tonight because of Gu Jia Yi?

153
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,660
No, she just got here.

154
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,380
Xu Duo Cheng's "Aunt" came and her stomach hurt really badly. 
  (T/N: Menstrual period)

155
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,200
How is she now?

156
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,840
She's upstairs.

157
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,200
She didn't hear that, right?

158
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,680
She probably didn't, right?

159
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,820
My ancestor, eat up!

160
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,560
Do you think you're worthy of me?

161
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,900
You stood me up and I still brought you a midnight snack.

162
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,780
Thank you for your motherly love.

163
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,680
Is that good enough?

164
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,800
I haven't seen you for just a day.

165
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,360
The two of you made that much progress?

166
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,120
Stop trying to get gossip from me.

167
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,880
You're not here to deliver food, right?

168
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,240
Of course not.

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,100
We were supposed to talk to Producer Chen Dong about your crossover into acting,

170
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,720
but you didn't go.

171
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,560
Luckily, I had quick wits and was able to make an excuse for you on the spot.

172
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,460
However, they really liked our song, "Cola Chicken Wings".

173
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,280
They even asked to use this song as the theme song for their next project.

174
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,280
They also asked us to shoot an MV in Jingcheng City next week

175
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,260
and for you to be the male lead of the MV.

176
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,320
Really? That's great.

177
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,340
Of course, don't you know who was the one talking?

178
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,540
But I think Xu Duo Cheng might really be the source of your inspiration.

179
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,290
If I knew Orange was this charming,

180
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,120
I should've gone to find her within the vast ocean of people a long time ago.

181
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,700
Wait a minute.

182
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,900
Where did you say we're shooting the MV?

183
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,200
Jingcheng City. Is that a problem?

184
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,300
No.

185
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,690
Xu Duo Cheng and her bestie were planning to go on vacation in Jingcheng City as well.

186
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,300
Isn't that great?

187
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,580
Will she go?

188
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,380
I'll go!

189
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,040
You were there?

190
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,620
You've been here all along?

191
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,340
Lord Bao, what will I be doing there?

192
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,970
It's like this!

193
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,400
Orange, you know how our studio hasn't assigned any work to you yet.

194
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,580
Lao Jiang is preparing to shoot an MV for his new song.

195
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,160
Can you be his personal assistant?

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,140
What do you mean by "personal assistant"?

197
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,800
No problem.

198
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,200
- About your overtime pay... 
 - It's up to you.

199
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,360
Thank you, Lord Bao.

200
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,880
You're welcome.

201
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
What's going on?

202
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,220
Did she hear that just now?

203
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,080
Hear what?

204
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,480
 She hopes to live every day to the fullest.

205
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,200
 She's simple and pure.

206
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,000
 This ordinary girl caused me to fall deeper in love with her again and again

207
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,720
Isn't that Gu Jia Yi's car?

208
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,820
Why was she here?

209
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,440
Did she find out about my mom?

210
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,960
Let's hurry and leave!

211
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
Auntie, I haven't come to see you in a long time.

212
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,020
Do you still remember me?

213
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,180
Who are you?

214
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm Gu Jia Yi,

215
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,300
Jiang Nan's girlfriend.

216
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,500
Jiang Nan?

217
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
I don't know him.

218
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,400
Auntie,

219
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,220
you don't remember Jiang Nan anymore?

220
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,220
You're his girlfriend?

221
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
What's wrong, Auntie?

222
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,000
 Auntie, stop hitting me!

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,140
- Cai Yun! 
 - Stop!

224
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,160
Cai Yun, stop hitting her!

225
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,460
Cai Yun!

226
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,780
Jiang Hai, who is she?

227
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,200
What's your relationship with her?

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,680
Why did she say she's your girlfriend?

229
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,660
Cai Yun, please, calm down.

230
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,940
Cai Yun, calm down first.

231
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,860
I have nothing to do with her. She's speaking nonsense. Don't believe her!

232
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,920
You have nothing to do with her?

233
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,120
You evil woman! You're seducing my husband!

234
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
- You're seducing my husband! 
 - Cai Yun!

235
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,780
- You're seducing my husband! 
 - Cai Yun!

236
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,180
Scram!

237
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,880
Get out! I don't want to see you anymore!

238
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,380
Cai Yun, don't be angry.

239
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,860
Toss all of those things out!

240
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,460
Toss them out! I don't want to see it!

241
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,200
Take them out! Leave!

242
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,880
Gu Jia Yi!

243
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm warning you.

244
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,940
My mom is a patient.

245
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,880
If anything happens to her because of you, I won't let you off!

246
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,060
I only wanted to visit Auntie!

247
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,220
It's all right now.

248
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,620
 Xu Duo Cheng, it's good that I have you.

249
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,240

250
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,740
Doctor Sui, this is the EMG from my checkup.

251
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,860
Please, take a look.

252
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,040
How have you been feeling lately?

253
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,920
I have had trouble holding chopsticks recently.

254
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,580
My hands felt weak when I was tying my hair up this morning.

255
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,760
Also, my leg went weak all of a sudden

256
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,420
when I was walking and I almost fell a few days ago.

257
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,040
Please, come in.

258
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,240
Why are you here?

259
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,660
I came specially for you.

260
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,140
My family is in the medical equipment business.

261
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,880
Doctor Sui told me you're here for a checkup.

262
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,300
I came to see if I could be of any help.

263
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,520
There's no need.

264
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,680
We're friends.

265
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,480
I already know everything, so I came to check on you.

266
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,160
Actually, I also suggest that you try some more treatments.

267
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,020
Zhan Zhi Lin has been a friend of mine for years.

268
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,760
Kanglin Group has been a long-time partner of our hospital.

269
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,840
They provide medical equipment to our hospital

270
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
like EMPs, infra-red therapy devices, etc.

271
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,520
These are quite helpful to your condition.

272
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,380
Are these devices really expensive?

273
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
You don't have to worry about that.

274
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,640
Xu Duo Cheng, judging from your EMP,

275
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,160
there is clear neuron damage.

276
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,700
It's okay.

277
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,560
I'm already mentally prepared.

278
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,600
Are you still not going to tell your family?

279
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,860
I'll delay it as long as I can.

280
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,580
If you insist, you'll have a lot of pressure financially.

281
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,260
Because besides Riluzuole,

282
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,180
I also have to add an Edaravone injection today.

283
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,180
This is important for slowing down your condition from spreading,

284
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,280
but you don't have any family taking care of you currently.

285
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,760
You must be very careful in your daily life.

286
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,040
Because you might have symptoms such as muscle spasms and muscle weakness from time to time.

287
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,500
If you're in a special environment, for example, crossing the road or pouring hot water,

288
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
it might become dangerous for you.

289
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,860
I understand.

290
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,660
By the way, Doctor Sui, how is Dou Dou's condition?

291
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,300
His situation isn't very optimistic

292
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,400
but he's very tough.

293
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,140
I'll play a piano game with you, okay?

294
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,800
Don't you think you're caring too much for Xu Duo Cheng?

295
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,260
I just find her pitiful.

296
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,100
If you're not sincere about it, you should keep your distance.

297
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,740
She can't bear too much hurt in her current condition.

298
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,700
What do you take me for?

299
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,560
I just think

300
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,880
it's very unfortunate for her to have this condition at such a young age.

301
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,600
Does this look nice?

302
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,120
- Play by yourself for now. 
 - The physiotherapy device I ordered is here.

303
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,860
Dou Dou doesn't know about my illness.

304
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,060
Don't tell him.

305
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,580
Let's arrange a time tomorrow. I'll bring it to you.

306
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,360
I'm going out of town tomorrow.

307
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,160
How about this? Why don't you come to my house to get it?

308
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,140
- I... 
 - Why are you being so hesitant?

309
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,560
The sooner you get it, the faster you can start your treatment, all right?

310
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,040
 Thank you, Zhan Zhi Lin.

311
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,420
 It's really hard to bear the pain of being ill alone .

312
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,820
 Thank you for being by my side.

313
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,400
Your house is so big!

314
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,420
My house has a glided exterior but it's shabby and ruined on the inside.

315
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,460
I specially chose a mini version for you,

316
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,160
so it's easier to take around.

317
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,840
Take a look.

318
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,660
How do you use it?

319
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,060
Come here.

320
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,780
How do you feel?

321
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,660
It feels tingly and sore.

322
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,300
That's how you should feel. Use it for 15 minutes every day.

323
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,900
You have to persist.

324
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,260
What songs do you listen to normally?

325
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,940
I notice you have a lot of CDs.

326
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,060
There are so many rock soundtracks.

327
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,640
Liang Shu Qian?

328
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,780
You listen to her songs too?

329
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,661
My dad really likes her. He listens to her songs every day!

330
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,940
That's my mom.

331
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,780
Liang Shu Qian is your mom?

332
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,480
What a coincidence!

333
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,780
My dad said she was beautiful and had a sweet voice,

334
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,060
but he doesn't know why she stopped singing later.

335
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,860
After my mom married my dad, he didn't allow her to sing anymore.

336
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,700
That's too bad.

337
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,820
Is it something you inherited that you like music so much?

338
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,480
I guess so.

339
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,200
My dad isn't very interested in fine arts.

340
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,180
If my mom didn't change my gaokao preferences for me, 
  (T/N: Interest form for major to study in college after taking the gaokao, college entrance exam)

341
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,840
I would have never gone to an art school

342
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,380
or met Jiang Nan.

343
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,640
It's not enough for you to play outside?

344
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,100
You even brought a girl home?

345
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,800
She's my friend.

346
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
Please, watch what you're saying.

347
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,540
That's for the best. Your Uncle Liu is still mad.

348
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,260
Hurry and go apologize to Ting Ting now!

349
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,900
I won't be with Liu Ting.

350
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,120
I don't need you to arrange all my important life matters.

351
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,320
Hanging out with dubious women all the time is your important life matter?

352
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,060
As long as you are not involved, I will live every day like this!

353
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,220
I will act all happy for you to see! What can you do about it?

354
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,600
I'm sorry.

355
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,820
I'm fine.

356
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,160
I never thought your family would be like this.

357
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,440
That's how my dad is.

358
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,040
Don't be upset.

359
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,200
Let's listen to Auntie's song together!

360
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,040
Auntie really supported your music career.

361
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,620
Did she try to talk you out of disbanding 2BeOne?

362
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,960
You never asked Jiang Nan?

363
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,740
I did. He wouldn't tell me.

364
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,460
He's too embarrassed to say, of course.

365
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,160
 You're here so early.

366
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,060
 What's wrong?

367
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,480
 Have some coffee to wake yourself up.

368
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,100
 Sister Yun talked to me about the company's plan for our future.

369
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,860
 She thinks

370
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,080
 if we continue together as a group,

371
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,680
 it won't help develop our future careers.

372
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,180
 What do you mean?

373
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,780
 Zhan Zhi Lin,

374
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,080
 let's disband.

375
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,740
 We are at the height of our popularity

376
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,080
 and we're going to disband because of a few words from Sister Yun?

377
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
 Don't listen to her. Let's rehearse!

378
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,660
 We don't need to rehearse anymore!

379
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,440
 I also think my future is limited by being together in a group with you.

380
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,320
 It won't help my future career.

381
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,980
 Every band is bound to break up someday.

382
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,640
 Jiang Nan,

383
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,960
 do you think I'm a burden since I can't write songs?

384
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,700
 That's not what I mean. We can develop our careers separately!

385
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,740
 Develop separately?

386
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,300
 You're the songwriter of 2beOne.

387
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,700
 I can't compose.

388
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,840
 How will we develop separately?

389
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,520
 You know how badly I fought against my father for our band back then.

390
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,060
 You were the one who told me we would certainly make something of ourselves.

391
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,100
 You also said we are one.

392
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,460
 You were the one who came up with the name 2beOne.

393
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,060
 The name means we can stay together forever.

394
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,800
 - Have you forgotten all of that? 
 - I didn't forget

395
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,120
 but I don't want to continue anymore.

396
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,500
 Jiang Nan!

397
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,940
 Just treat it like I've let you down.

398
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,360
 I'm leaving.

399
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,090

400
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,540
Jiang Nan abandoned you to develop his own future career?

401
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,120
I really hope it was like that.

402
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,680
Why do you say that?

403
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,260
The day after we disbanded, my mom went to see Jiang Nan,

404
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:43,020
but she committed suicide when she came back.

405
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,640
I went to ask Jiang Nan what happened,

406
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,500
but I saw him with my dad.

407
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,400
 I want to thank you for not telling Zhan Zhi Lin.

408
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,060
 Take this card.

409
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,060
So Jiang Nan had something to do with your mom's death?

410
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,070
Anyway,

411
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,180
my dad forced my mom to her death.

412
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,680
Jiang Nan knew about all that,

413
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,040
but he didn't say anything to me.

414
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,540
If he was willing to tell me,

415
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,160
maybe I had a chance to save my mom.

416
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,720
Maybe my mom didn't have to die.

417
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,600
Why would my mom

418
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,520
rather talk to Jiang Nan

419
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,080
than me before she died?

420
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,720
Although I don't know what matter Auntie couldn't bear

421
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,900
and made her decide to kill herself,

422
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,800
but as someone who is about to die, when I put myself in her place,

423
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,220
Auntie must have said nothing to you since she loved you so much.

424
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,740
Xu Duo Cheng, please, don't say that.

425
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,860
It's nothing.

426
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm just telling the truth.

427
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,060
You know, death isn't actually that scary.

428
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,780
The scary thing is,

429
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,940
it will cut off the connection between you and your loved ones.

430
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,860
Once I think of that, I really don't know what to do.

431
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,680
Xu Duo Cheng,

432
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,140
I really don't think Jiang Nan is worthy to have you.

433
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,440
Zhan Zhi Lin, I know you have a reason to hate Jiang Nan

434
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,400
but I think there must be a misunderstanding.

435
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,540
I believe Jiang Nan is not that kind of person.

436
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
How can there be a misunderstanding?

437
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,220
You're his girlfriend now.

438
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,420
You would certainly be on his side.

439
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,180
 I must find a chance to ask Jiang Nan.

440
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,540
 There must be a misunderstanding.

441
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
 Hello, Orange.

442
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,640
 You're going with Jiang Nan to shoot a MV?

443
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,440
You get news so quickly.

444
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,800
This is the first task Lord Bao assigned to me since I joined the studio.

445
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,380
This is not a task.

446
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,160
It's a benefit, okay?

447
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,720
If I wasn't hurt,

448
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,800
I'd want to take time off to go on vacation too!

449
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,020
I have never been on set and seen how an MV is filmed before.

450
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,320
I'm quite curious.

451
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,760
Exactly! You're so lucky!

452
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Let me tell you, you must seize this opportunity!

453
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,420
Maybe something will really happen between you two

454
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,160
from the time you leave to the time you come back.

455
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,840
Stop trying to urge on something impossible between us.

456
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,320
Don't you know the bigger the expectation you have, the bigger the disappointment you'll have?

457
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,720
All right, I won't keep talking.

458
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,240
I need to pack up. Bye-bye!

459
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,960
What were you doing?

460
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,000
That... have you eaten yet?

461
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,940
Did you forget? I met up with someone tonight.

462
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,240
I already ate.

463
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,880
That's right.

464
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,020
Hurry and finish packing. We're heading out to Jingcheng City early tomorrow morning.

465
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,200
We'll be driving there, so it will be very tiring.

466
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,860
By the way, we'll be away for a couple of days.

467
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,100
I'm afraid Auntie will miss us.

468
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,780
So, I already went to the sanatorium today,

469
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,940
and told the nurses about it.

470
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,400
Also, I got the itinerary for tomorrow.

471
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,180
There's nothing going on, so you don't have to be with me.

472
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,760
I'll give you a day off. You can make your own arrangements tomorrow.

473
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,960
Really? That's great, God Nan!

474
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,160
I really love you so much!

475
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,960
What did you say?

476
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,840
I said...

477
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,800
I'll help you pick up the things on the floor.

478
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,780
There's no need, I'll do it myself.

479
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,560
Who did you buy these for?

480
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,360
For Dou Dou.

481
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,600
Are you sure you don't need me today?

482
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,180
I don't. You just need to keep an eye on your phone.

483
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,840
Call me if anything comes up.

484
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,140
If you get tired from playing, have Xiao Du come pick you up.

485
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,060
That's not necessary. Xiao Du must be tired from driving all day.

486
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,340
I won't trouble you anymore.

487
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,480
- Then, I... 
 - That's enough.

488
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,380
If you keep nagging, I'll cancel your day off!

489
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,040
A nobleman's word is his bond. 
  (T/N: Live up to one's word)

490
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,340
Bye.

491
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,880
Brother, we can't park here for too long.

492
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,480
Let's go.

493
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,600
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

494
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,370
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

495
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,510
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you  	♫

496
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,230
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

497
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,650
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

498
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:44,470
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

499
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,210
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

500
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,910
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

501
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,140
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

502
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,870
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

503
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,430
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

504
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,270
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

505
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,000
This is the first time I'm meeting you all.

506
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,500
You might not know me very well.

507
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,920
I don't have a lot of requirements

508
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,440
and I'm rather nice to people.

509
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,960
However, you can't just do some flat lighting!

510
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,580
I want more layers!

511
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,000
I want warm lighting amidst cool lighting and cool lightening within the warm!

512
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
- It's a kind of beauty that stifles you... 
     : Did you take an umbrella?

513
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,140
Stifling!

514
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,940
Can you do that?

515
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,340
Jiang Nan, you just arrived today.

516
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,280
Go take a break first.

517
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,420
There's no need. You can talk about my part now.

518
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,700
Okay.

519
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,180
That's a workaholic.

520
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,900
We are mainly matching the images to the lyrics for this MV.

521
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,020
It's a beautiful memory of a girl

522
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,820
playing the piano and Teacher Jiang Nan.

523
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,140
Brother!

524
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,180
Brother, I heard Jiang Nan went to shoot an MV in Jingcheng City.

525
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,640
Jingcheng City?

526
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,300
 I'm going out of town tomorrow.

527
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,720
So that's why.

528
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,660
I got it.

529
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,180
Then, should we...

530
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,320
There's no hurry.

531
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,020
Let those other two know about this first.

532
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,640
I hope the rain starts to lighten up! Have the rain stop.

533
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,120
 The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

534
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Stop raining.

535
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,770
Stop raining.

536
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:02,400
 The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

537
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,260
 Please, call again at another time. Sorry...

538
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,500
I'm sorry, Director. Brother Nan must not be feeling well.

539
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

540
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,540
Xu Duo Cheng, did the rain damage your brain?

541
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,440
Why didn't you answer my calls?

542
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,500
I dropped my phone in the lake.

543
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,700
You dropped your phone in the lake?

544
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,020
Why didn't you just drop yourself in the lake too?

545
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,600
Don't you have work to do today?

546
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,380
If I didn't come, were you just going to stay in this pavilion for the entire night?

547
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,610
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

548
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,170
♫  The years become gentle   ♫

549
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,450
♫   As the wind gently blows behind you   ♫

550
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,230
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

556
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,200
♫  I walked past many side roads before you met me  ♫

557
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:26,714
♫  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  ♫

558
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:34,611
♫  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  ♫

559
00:39:34,611 --> 00:39:40,298
♫  You shine a light to all my loneliness  ♫

560
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:43,944
♫  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  ♫

561
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:47,824
♫  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  ♫

562
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:54,377
♫  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  ♫

563
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:57,737
♫  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  ♫

564
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:59,510
♫  I suddenly became very foolish  ♫

565
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,910
♫  I was just like a wooden person  ♫

566
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,724
♫  My longing still asks me at night  ♫

567
00:40:04,724 --> 00:40:08,712
♫  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  ♫

568
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:12,029
♫  Why have I become so strange?  ♫

569
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:16,097
♫  It has become difficult to guess your every word  ♫

570
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:20,383
♫  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  ♫

571
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:23,032
♫  I don't want to wait any longer  ♫

572
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:26,423
♫  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  ♫

573
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:30,557
♫  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  ♫

574
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,591
♫  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  ♫
