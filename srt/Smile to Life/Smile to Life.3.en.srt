1
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,640
Orange,

2
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
I was really drunk last night.

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,520
I remember I sent it to you.

5
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
Look at my WeChat, there are only two people at the top.

6
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
One is you and the other is the devil.

7
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
You two are too close.

8
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm sure as soon as I slip my hand,

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
I'll send it to the devil.

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,160
I advised our chief editor not to post it,

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,800
but I couldn't stop her.

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,759
As you know,

13
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,560
I will never

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,039
take credit for your material.

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm fine. The point is,

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,560
Jiang Nan,

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
Jiang Nan is giving you a hard time,

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,360
but not at all.

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
But he's troubled by this.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,040
Of course.

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,960
If you ask me,

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
It's all Gu Jiayi's fault,

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
if she hadn't been in the same frame as Jiang Nan,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
Our editor-in-chief won't bother

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
to get his news,

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,960
Jiang Nan even told me today,

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,280
why did he ask me to pretend to be his girlfriend?

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,640
Show it to Gu Jiayi,

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
then you agree?

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,560
No.

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,160
That's good.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,640
You, an ordinary citizen,

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,320
get involved in the celebrity business,

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,920
But there will be no peaceful life.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,720
If your parents know about it,

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,880
your relatives and friends

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,520
know about your life,

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,080
Completely exposed in broad daylight.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,800
Then stop.

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Li,

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,240
Me,

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,000
Xu,

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,160
I haven't contacted you for a long time.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
How are you?

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay?

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,240
What?

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
It's such a big deal.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Who is my dad calling?

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,320
Your dad wants to have a family affair?

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,280
Well,

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,640
we're raising money to borrow 300 houses?

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
300 houses and where can I borrow this?

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
I guess I didn't borrow it.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,680
OK Li,

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
don't worry,

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
I'll visit you

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
and your sister-in-law

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,440
some other day.

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,320
That's it. You didn't borrow it,

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
did you?

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Every family has a difficult experience?

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,080
Money is hard to make,

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,120
if you ask me,

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,960
You don't have the life to open a restaurant,

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,640
daughter-in-law

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,720
Do you want to open a restaurant?

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
It really doesn't matter to me.

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm just worried.

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
My old friends,

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,640
my disciples,

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Why are you so worried?

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,960
Your old friends,

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
your disciples,

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,760
Why don't you

76
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,240
think about your ability?

77
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,960
Okay,

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
Even if you borrow 300 houses,

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
I'd like to ask,

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
What are you going to give it back?

81
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,240
No.

82
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,240
Mom and Dad,

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,640
don't you have a bank card

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,080
that opens an account in my name?

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
You can't touch this money and that money.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
That 100 thousand yuan is for you,

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
to use as your dowry.

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
Don't touch the money.

89
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,040
No, dad,

90
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,560
I think,

91
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,200
Miss,

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,400
about this matter,

93
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
Don't worry about it.

94
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,040
You must be hungry.

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,760
I'll get you something delicious.

96
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,640
It's okay.

97
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't worry about it.

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,120
Are there any students interested?

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,560
Earn some extra money in your spare time.

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,200
You don't have to work in your spare time.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
I can do it.

102
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,120
Jiayi,

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,560
Jiang Nan is so ungrateful.

104
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
Is it your turn to talk about Jiang Nan?

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,920
I was wrong.

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
It's impossible.

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
He always keeps his distance from his fans.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,960
Hello, Mr. Liang.

109
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:35,800
Jiayi,

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,480
Jiayi.

111
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,720
This is your favorite rose.

112
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
I bought it for you.

113
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
Thank you.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mr. Liang, give it to me.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,720
Jiayi,

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,840
I've done enough for you.

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,080
Stop messing around.

118
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Enough is enough.

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,880
I'm not messing with you.

120
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,480
I know you're upset.

121
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,200
I know you're upset.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,200
I was just fooling around with that female model.

123
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,160
You're a superstar,

124
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,720
why do you argue with them?

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,800
What do you care about?

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay, okay.

127
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,200
I promise you.

128
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,400
I'll just ignore them, okay?

129
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
I think

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
you may have misunderstood.

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
I didn't mean that.

132
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,200
You think

133
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,840
I made you popular.

134
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
Then you can escape from my palm.

135
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,440
It's impossible.

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,080
Unless one day I admit,

137
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
you're not mine anymore.

138
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,080
Over the years,

139
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400
have you ever admitted that I'm your girlfriend?

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,080
Have I ever admitted that you're my boyfriend?

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,640
It's just a show.

142
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,160
Why do you have to be serious?

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,920
Gu Jiayi,

144
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,880
are you taking yourself too seriously?

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
Mr. Liang,

146
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,880
the scene between you and me,

147
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840
It's over.

148
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,960
Let's go.

149
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Let me tell you,

150
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,200
I just like your stubbornness.

151
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,960
You.

152
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,640
Gu Jiayi,

153
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
don't push your luck.

154
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,480
If I can make you popular,

155
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
I can still destroy you.

156
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,320
Think about it carefully.

157
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm happy now.

158
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,640
Unhappy,

159
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
It's disturbing.

160
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,600
If you ask me,

161
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
don't think too much.

162
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
Go back to bed early.

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,000
Brother,

164
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
it's not the time now.

165
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
Are you still thinking about sleeping?

166
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,600
If you ask me,

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,440
these oranges are enough.

168
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,880
Otherwise,

169
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,680
you're not attractive enough.

170
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm not attractive enough.

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,880
You can do it. Go ahead.

172
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,560
I'll do it.

173
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,640
I wish you success.

174
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Quit the entertainment industry.

175
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
So serious?

176
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,760
Let me check Jiang Nan's Weibo account.

177
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,640
Well.

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
She must have read the message, right?

179
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
If you ask me,

180
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
your idea is not reliable.

181
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,560
Miss Xu,

182
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
this is Bao Rui.

183
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,720
Okay, okay.

184
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
No problem.

185
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,680
I'll send you the location.

186
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Okay,

187
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,720
see you later.

188
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,800
She agreed.

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
Look who did it.

190
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,560
Okay,

191
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,720
You're the best.

192
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,760
If you ask me,

193
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,160
she's really worried about me.

194
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,440
What about you?

195
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,760
Clean yourself up first.

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,680
Am I right?

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,560
It's

198
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
a great effort.

199
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
Why do I feel like

200
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,320
I sacrificed more?

201
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't tell me,

202
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,840
I really think this little girl,

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
It'll give you good luck.

204
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
As expected, you're getting old,

205
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,320
and you're starting to be superstitious.

206
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,000
What did you say?

207
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,120
You're the best.

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
Mr. Bao,

209
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm really sorry.

210
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
There's a traffic jam

211
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,120
on the road. It's okay.

212
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,000
Have a seat.

213
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,840
I have to thank you for helping Jiang Nan.

214
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Thank you.

215
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,600
You know Jiang Nan,

216
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
he just wants to make a comeback on his own.

217
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
It's just that you two are in trouble now.

218
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
It's so troublesome.

219
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,800
Did Jiang Nan really quit?

220
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
I had no choice,

221
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,880
but if Miss Xu is willing to help,

222
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,840
Jiang Nan will be back in minutes,

223
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,040
so if I help,

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,440
What do you need me to do?

225
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,240
In fact, what you have to do is very simple,

226
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,040
as long as you are always around him,

227
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,720
To participate in activities with him,

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
you'd better be inseparable from him.

229
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,360
Jiang Nan and I

230
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,360
are inseparable.

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Here's the thing, Miss Xu,

232
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,400
we hope Miss Xu

233
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,200
can be Jiang Nan's personal assistant.

234
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,880
As an assistant,

235
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,000
there's no problem.

236
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,200
Just leave the chores to me.

237
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
But,

238
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,680
you told me two days ago,

239
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,480
He asked me to pretend to be his girlfriend.

240
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,280
What's going on?

241
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,280
That's for Gu Jiayi,

242
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,560
now you don't have to pretend to be your girlfriend,

243
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,920
As long as Miss Xu is the assistant,

244
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,760
the intimate photo will make sense.

245
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,680
We can more or less separate Gu Jiayi,

246
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
so that she won't pester Jiang Nan to go on hot searches every day.

247
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,560
It affects his mood of creation.

248
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
As for Jiang Nan,

249
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
we all believe that,

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,360
He will return to the top on his own.

251
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,160
Let's take a look at the contract.

252
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,800
Let's go.

253
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,400
Contract,

254
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,960
That's right.

255
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,160
Formal process.

256
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,800
Take a look.

257
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,120
Let me know if you have any questions.

258
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
Cooperate with Party A's artist Jiang Nan's work arrangement,

259
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
deal with life and work affairs,

260
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
Be on call

261
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
as you wish.

262
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,440
As for this,

263
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,040
I have to explain it to Miss Xu.

264
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,480
Because there are a lot of uncertainties

265
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,240
in an artist's job.

266
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
Mr. Bao, if you explain it this way,

267
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
I will understand.

268
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,160
Of course,

269
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,000
according to

270
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,480
the salary range of this industry,

271
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
I'll pay for your salary.

272
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
It won't be less than that.

273
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,560
Okay,

274
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,440
I promise you.

275
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,120
Mr. Bao,

276
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
may I ask you something,

277
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,000
Can I advance my salary?

278
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,560
Of course.

279
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
We can meet all of Miss Xu's requirements.

280
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,840
Mr. Bao,

281
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,520
Me

282
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,320
Want to advance 300 thousand?

283
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,440
How much is it?

284
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,200
Mr. Bao,

285
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,040
don't be nervous.

286
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm not blackmailing money.

287
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,040
It's because something really happened

288
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,480
in my family.

289
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,320
You deduct this money

290
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,160
from my salary every month,

291
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,800
If I work a few more jobs,

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm sure I'll be able to

293
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,440
pay them back one after another.

294
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,160
No problem.

295
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,640
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

296
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,080
Does it hurt?

297
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,200
It hurts,

298
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,280
You're welcome,

299
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,160
Mr. Bao,

300
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,360
There's one more thing I want to ask you for help.

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
If I suddenly have so much money in my card,

302
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,520
my parents will definitely suspect it.

303
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,240
What do you need me to do?

304
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,560
Welcome.

305
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,440
Please come in.

306
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,320
Sir, how many of you?

307
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,000
One,

308
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,680
please sit here.

309
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,160
Come on.

310
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Is there a problem?

311
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,120
No problem.

312
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,120
This is our menu.

313
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,040
Please have a look.

314
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
What would you like to eat?

315
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,920
Mao Xuewang,

316
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,880
Mao Xuewang, one,

317
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,680
Fish head with chopped pepper,

318
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,760
fish head with chopped pepper, one serving,

319
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,640
One shrimp with crab powder,

320
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,680
one shrimp with crab powder,

321
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,400
What?

322
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,920
You're good at ordering.

323
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
The guests will eat it.

324
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,880
Put it here.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,680
Okay.

326
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,680
Waiter,

327
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,360
you're here.

328
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,920
Sir,

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,000
is there a problem?

330
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
Call your chef here,

331
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,760
and come to me if you need anything.

332
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,360
Lin,

333
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,160
how many times do I have to tell you about that knife?

334
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,720
Xu,

335
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,080
there's a guest outside who wants to call Chef.

336
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,360
Which table?

337
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,240
Table 3,

338
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,760
it shouldn't be.

339
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm the caretaker of those dishes,

340
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,360
is it because my hair fell out?

341
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,760
This stuff is also fresh.

342
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,920
It's not broken.

343
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,240
Yes,

344
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,720
Master.

345
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
I think he's probably looking for trouble.

346
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,120
Let me do it.

347
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,760
Stop right there!

348
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,280
Go back

349
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,360
Show you.

350
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,640
I'll let you do it.

351
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,520
Let me do it.

352
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,640
Right there.

353
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,320
Over there.

354
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,840
Hello,

355
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm the chef here.

356
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,839
What's wrong with this dish?

357
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,920
Something's wrong.

358
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,960
What's wrong

359
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,520
with your cooking?

360
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,760
It's so delicious.

361
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,480
Say it again.

362
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,320
It's so delicious.

363
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,240
Get in.

364
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,840
Go, go, go.

365
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,480
Go, go, go.

366
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,080
Have

367
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
a seat.

368
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,920
Thank you.

369
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Let me tell you,

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
these dishes are all my best dishes.

371
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,880
How did you get here alone?

372
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,600
I was introduced by a friend.

373
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,320
Come here,

374
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,240
come here,

375
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,160
Come here,

376
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
to tell you the truth,

377
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,080
I know a lot

378
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,280
about this cuisine,

379
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,160
Let's talk about it,

380
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,720
On

381
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The fish head with chopped pepper

382
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,560
is tender and tasty.

383
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,000
Taste,

384
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Shrimp with crab powder,

385
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,320
Q-bomb is refreshing,

386
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Cool,

387
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,920
Maoxue is strong,

388
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,320
Sichuan is spicy,

389
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,000
Hot

390
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,280
Chicken soup with fungus,

391
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,080
Chun

392
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,280
Expert,

393
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,400
I don't dare to be an expert.

394
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,440
To be honest,

395
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,680
I just came here

396
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
to taste your cooking.

397
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,200
So this is what you want?

398
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,680
Is there anything else?

399
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,520
Here's the thing.

400
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,600
What about me?

401
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,440
I've always wanted to open a restaurant,

402
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,640
but,

403
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Those restaurants out there don't have any real skills,

404
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,680
they're all empty-headed,

405
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,520
What do you think?

406
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
I only like you.

407
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Are you willing to change jobs

408
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,360
and start your own business,

409
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Swearing?

410
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,440
Am I that unrighteous?

411
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,720
I just want to bring down the family fun.

412
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,240
I've invested

413
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,240
in the funds.

414
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,000
Well,

415
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,760
we don't need to open another store.

416
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,600
I'm investing.

417
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,320
Can you say that again?

418
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,400
I'll vote for him.

419
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,720
Oh my god,

420
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
am I dreaming?

421
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
Slow down. Slow down.

422
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,280
It's a pity that you're not an actor.

423
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,040
Mr. Bao,

424
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
I was very nervous just now.

425
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,720
But your acting is so good.

426
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,640
My dad is not suspicious at all.

427
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,520
I'm telling you,

428
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,680
it's not that I'm good at acting.

429
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,840
Uncle's cooking is really delicious.

430
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,000
Then you can come to have a family dinner more often.

431
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,920
but

432
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,760
Don't get caught.

433
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,240
By the way, Miss Xu,

434
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,200
look,

435
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
I did you such a big favor.

436
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,280
Can you give me a hand too?

437
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,840
Miss Xu,

438
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,920
about what happened today,

439
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,040
In fact, it's very simple, that is,

440
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,440
you cooperate with us and Jiang Nan

441
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,600
to take a group of couple photos,

442
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,240
Just in case.

443
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,640
Because Gu Jiayi always

444
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,040
doesn't play cards according to the routine.

445
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,280
Okay,

446
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,800
What do you need me to do?

447
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,720
Take a selfie,

448
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,800
I don't take selfies.

449
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,720
It's too pretentious,

450
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,240
That's right.

451
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,880
How about this,

452
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Let's be natural.

453
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,480
Live a little more,

454
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,160
just hold hands,

455
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Walking in the sunset,

456
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,560
how romantic,

457
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,240
Am I right?

458
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think so.

459
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,800
Brother,

460
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
how about walking normally?

461
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,840
As soon as you split your legs,

462
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
step by step,

463
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:48,960
Is that okay?

464
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,560
No.

465
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,320
Okay, stop talking.

466
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
Miss Xu, are you okay here?

467
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:53,560
Me,

468
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
I think it's okay if you don't talk.

469
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
You don't need to take a group photo.

470
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,800
I posted it on my Moments. Of course,

471
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,240
some people will think of it.

472
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,760
Brother,

473
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,720
can you understand what you mean

474
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
by sending this Gu Jiayi?

475
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,520
Stop struggling.

476
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,280
I'm an agent.

477
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,520
You have to listen to me.

478
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,800
Miss Xu, let's go together.

479
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,840
What are your expressions?

480
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,840
The enemy's path is narrow.

481
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,240
The brave win when they meet in a narrow way.

482
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,720
Smile.

483
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,720
Listen to me. Smile. Move

484
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
forward.

485
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,120
Take a few steps.

486
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,200
Jiang, smile.

487
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,120
Come closer,

488
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,760
Okay.

489
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,760
Vitamins,

490
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,320
this kid,

491
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,800
How can I take vitamins?

492
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Enjoy your meal.

493
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
Have you really decided to resign?

494
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,400
Maybe I can't meet your sister's requirements.

495
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
Did my sister bully you again?

496
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,600
No,

497
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
she's right.

498
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,960
But I can't do it.

499
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,440
Anyway, from now on,

500
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
I have nothing to do with the truth.

501
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,560
It's you,

502
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,600
why don't you just join the job and tell the truth?

503
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
No, no, no.

504
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,560
My sister is always in charge of my life,

505
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,720
which is already very uncomfortable.

506
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,440
I don't want to work.

507
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,760
She's also under her control.

508
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,040
Then you always run to the truth.

509
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
I did it for our relationship.

510
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,640
What kind of relationship do we have?

511
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,120
A childhood sweetheart?

512
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,240
Who was your childhood sweetheart?

513
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,760
I wanted to

514
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,880
wait for a more formal opportunity to tell you,

515
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,320
But choosing the right day is better than hitting the right day.

516
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,280
When I was in high school, people disliked me for being fat,

517
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,000
laughed at me,

518
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,360
But only you,

519
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,200
at that time, only you stood up for me.

520
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,400
From then on,

521
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,880
my heart is yours.

522
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,280
That's not even childhood sweetheart.

523
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,040
I've told you many times.

524
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
I was just

525
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,320
fighting injustice and doing good deeds,

526
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,120
You really don't have to take it to heart.

527
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Besides,

528
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,800
you're not fat anymore.

529
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,600
He's handsome.

530
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,080
There must be a girl chasing you.

531
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,480
But I only have you in my heart.

532
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
Stop it.

533
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
I don't want to date my buddies.

534
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,960
I'll wait for you to change your mind.

535
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,160
Enough. Cut the crap.

536
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,040
Are you going to eat or not?

537
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,000
-Why don't you eat? -Give me your bowl. Come on. I'll eat. I'll eat. I'll

538
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
eat.

539
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,320
Jiang Nan. Is this an open relationship?

540
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,080
Jiang Nan,

541
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,800
with whom?

542
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
With a Xu or something?

543
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,520
Look, there are pictures of them on it.

544
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm really

545
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,720
familiar with Jiang Nan,

546
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,560
Let's not interrupt before.

547
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,760
What happened?

548
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,240
No way.

549
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,240
I can't resign.

550
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,160
Your sister has been keeping an eye on

551
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,720
Gu Jiayi's relationship with Jiang Nan,

552
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,240
Orange will be implicated.

553
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,760
There must be an inside man.

554
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:19,840
Stop eating.

555
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,640
Go to the company with me.

556
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,000
I haven't finished yet.

557
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Aren't you afraid of getting fat after eating so much?

558
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,840
I put my resignation letter on your sister's desk

559
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,120
before I got off work.

560
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,480
It'll be too late if we don't find out soon.

561
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,360
Get out of here!

562
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,080
Get out of here!

563
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,880
Didn't I tell you to prepare for a rainy day?

564
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
You posted it online,

565
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
not me.

566
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,040
I'd like to send it,

567
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,720
but you have to agree.

568
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,720
What are you mumbling about?

569
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,400
I mean,

570
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,560
I really just want to promote it.

571
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,240
Who knew it would be so hard to deal with?

572
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
But I think it's a good thing,

573
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,600
we don't have to get involved and the rumors will fall apart.

574
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,320
No way.

575
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,640
I don't agree.

576
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,680
If you don't agree, we can do it.

577
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,800
The Internet is full of concrete proof.

578
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,480
What are you going to do?

579
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:20,920
You,

580
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,240
Actually,

581
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,080
I think Mr. Bao is right,

582
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,600
The news started because of me.

583
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,640
At least now,

584
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,160
people won't talk about your gossip with fans or anything like that.

585
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,440
I hope this matter

586
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
can be completely resolved.

587
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,840
You don't bother

588
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,320
Chengcheng anymore,

589
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,360
It's okay,

590
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,600
little boy.

591
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,640
It's easy to be shy.

592
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,840
Don't take it to heart.

593
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,640
Just get used to it.

594
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,880
You did the right thing.

595
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,640
Give me a thumbs-up.

596
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Luckily,

597
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,040
it's still there. Let's go.

598
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,240
The door will be locked soon.

599
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,360
Go, go,

600
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,240
go. What are you doing?

601
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,160
Security guard,

602
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm working overtime,

603
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,920
My boyfriend came to pick me up.

604
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,680
Yes.

605
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm here to pick up my girlfriend from work.

606
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,720
If you don't turn on the lights when you work overtime,

607
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,160
do you have an employee ID card?

608
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,640
You don't want to save electricity for the company,

609
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,040
but you want to save money, right?

610
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,400
We'll be quick.

611
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,120
I'll leave right away.

612
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,280
The company is not a hotel. Go back

613
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,360
when you're done.

614
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,520
Keqin,

615
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,960
you just said,

616
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,680
I was just playing it by ear.

617
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,240
You'd better choose to forget

618
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,880
what happened tonight,

619
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,200
If you dare to tell anyone,

620
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,600
you're dead.

621
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,400
Okay, okay.

622
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,560
I won't tell you.

623
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,960
Just hide it in my heart.

624
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,560
The hero is so handsome.

625
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
Hurry up and start your career.

626
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
When you abuse your wife for a while,

627
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
women who engage in careers are the most attractive.

628
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,280
Wife Pursuit Crematorium.

629
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,080
The dowry is 100thousand,

630
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,280
and the piano is 200 thousand

631
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,720
300 yuan less for a class.

632
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
Four classes a week.

633
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,000
Hello,

634
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,120
Keqin.

635
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,800
Come on. Why didn't you tell me such an important thing?

636
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Are you not treating me as your sister anymore?

637
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,520
Keqin, don't get excited,

638
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,400
this thing suddenly changed,

639
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,640
I haven't had time to tell you yet.

640
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,760
Forget it.

641
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,000
Look at your picture,

642
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,320
your face is so red.

643
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,400
I don't believe it.

644
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,120
By the way,

645
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,520
do you know?

646
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
I don't know how to tell them yet?

647
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,280
You should have told them earlier.

648
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
If they find out

649
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,200
about it now,

650
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm afraid you're going to be severely beaten.

651
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,800
They don't surf the internet.

652
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,680
Besides, Family Fun's business is so busy,

653
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
we won't know it for a while.

654
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,840
Anyway, I've already advised you.

655
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,560
By the way,

656
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,760
you are no longer an ordinary person.

657
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,160
Your life will change dramatically.

658
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,000
You have to protect yourself.

659
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,440
Don't

660
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,920
Fake it. Fake it

661
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,640
for real.

662
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
Don't make fun of me.

663
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,640
We can't do that.

664
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,040
I don't think so.

665
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,280
All right, I won't talk to you anymore.

666
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,120
I'm going to sleep.

667
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,320
Bye.

668
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,000
Bye.

669
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,160
1. 2 thousand。 .

670
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,720
-Hello. -Hello. My

671
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,280
name is Many Orange.

672
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,880
I'm here to apply for a piano teacher.

673
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,040
Hello,

674
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm the head of this shop,

675
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,000
My last name is Yang.

676
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,920
Have you ever taught before?

677
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,920
I don't have any substitute experience before,

678
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,440
since you haven't?

679
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,760
I might need you to try it out.

680
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,920
So that I can evaluate it.

681
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,640
No problem.

682
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,080
Something always goes wrong at the critical moment.

683
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,520
Miss Xu,

684
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,680
according to the evaluation criteria of teachers

685
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,240
in our musical instrument store,

686
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,560
I know.

687
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,440
Sorry

688
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,520
to bother you.

689
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,760
However,

690
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,320
you seem to be quite friendly.

691
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,600
And the overall performance

692
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,600
is also very good.

693
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,880
I only made a small mistake.

694
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,560
I believe that in the future,

695
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,560
you will pay great attention to it.

696
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,840
You mean,

697
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,560
I'm hired.

698
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,200
Yes,

699
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,880
Congratulations,

700
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,200
Our boss happened to be here,

701
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,400
and I just heard you play a part,

702
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,360
Not bad.

703
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,120
Miss Xu,

704
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,520
you look familiar to me.

705
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,840
You must be Jiang Nan's girlfriend, right?

706
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,640
Yes

707
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,080
When did you two get together?

708
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,360
Recently,

709
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,080
if you come to work here,

710
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,680
Will he have a problem with it?

711
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,880
I don't think so.

712
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,120
What will he say?

713
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
I mean,

714
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,240
he's a public figure after all.

715
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,040
He probably doesn't miss his girlfriend.

716
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
In public or something,

717
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm not in the entertainment industry,

718
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,240
I have to work too.

719
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,040
Okay,

720
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,560
From tomorrow on,

721
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,040
you will be the teacher of our musical instrument store.

722
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,000
600 yuan an hour,

723
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,400
how about three classes a week?

724
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,040
600. I think

725
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,040
the recruitment information is 300.

726
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,240
Few recruiters

727
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,720
think their salary is high.

728
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,800
No, I won't.

729
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,600
Of course not.

730
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
I will do my best.

731
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,280
I'll get going then.

732
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,280
Bye.

733
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,600
Did you fall in love

734
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,960
with Jiang Nan's girlfriend again?

735
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm not sure

736
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
if he's his girlfriend.
