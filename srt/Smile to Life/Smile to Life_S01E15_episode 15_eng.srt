00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:13,667
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:15,907
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:19,207
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:24,482
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:30,340
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,054
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,559
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,900
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,350
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,454
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:48,341
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,168
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,781
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:56,628
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:58,795
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,510
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,851
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,698
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,452
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:16,186
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:18,393
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:21,106
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:25,665
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:30,984
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,368
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:48,501

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,520
Jiang Nan,

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,240
If...

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,200
If I...

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
Forget it.

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,560
What are you trying to say?

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,740
Are you really all right?

34
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm fine.

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,520
Do you know you'll keep people in suspense if you don't finish your sentence?

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,060
Nan Nan, Sister-in-law disappeared!

37
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,000
Help me look for her!

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,080
- Cai Yun! 
 - Cai Yun!

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,880
Sister-in-law!

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
Cai Yun!

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,200
- Cai Yun! 
 - Sister-in-law!

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
Excuse me, may I ask

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,440
if you've seen a woman in a grey cardigan with hair up to here?

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,660
No, I don't think so.

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
- Cai Yun! 
 - Thank you.

46
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,980
- Sister-in-law! 
 - Cai Yun!

47
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,580
Aunt, did my mom say anything to you before she left?

48
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,860
She didn't say anything.

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,320
She just disappeared when I turned around.

50
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,460
Jiang Nan, you go to where your mom usually visits.

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Aunt and I will look along the nearby streets!

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,460
Cheng Cheng, you don't know the way either. Be careful.

53
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,680
Okay.

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,180
- Cai Yun! 
 - Cai Yun!

55
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,040
Sister-in-law!

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,580
Cai Yun!

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,380
Cai Yun! Cai Yun!

58
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,280
Cai Yun!

59
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,940
Cai Yun!

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,940
Sister-in-law!

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
Have you seen my husband?

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
My husband is about this tall.

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
He's wearing a dungaree.

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,580
No.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,780
No.

66
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,080
This is such a good dog.

67
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Cai Yun!

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,700
 Cheng Cheng, I want to go watch a movie.

69
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,860
 Jiang Hai used to take me there all the time.

70
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,980
Movie?

71
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,770
The old movie theater!

72
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,060
Cai Yun!

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,100
 Based on the patient's account,

74
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,220
 she remembers her life and dates

75
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,120
 with her husband in her hometown very clearly.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
The movie theater.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,000
Excuse me, where is this?

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Lide Road.

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Isn't there Red Star Cinema on Lide Road?

80
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,380
What happened to the movie theater?

81
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,480
The Red Star Cinema?

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,020
It was demolished a few years ago.

83
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,200
It was demolished?

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,440
The movie theater is demolished?

85
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,060
The movie theater is demolished?

86
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 It's that woman.

87
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
 Mom!

88
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,720
 It was our fault.

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,400
 Shu Qian died because of us.

90
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,040
 She just took things too hard.

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,320
 Don't think that way.

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,520
 No, I really didn't expect things to turn out like this.

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,600
 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,460
Cai Yun, are you okay?

95
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,240
Xu Duo Cheng, are you willing to risk your life for this woman?

96
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,580
What were you doing, Zhan Zhi Lin?

97
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,980
Come with me.

98
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,580
Who are you? Why...

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,100
- Why are you taking Cheng Cheng away? 
 - Scram!

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Let go of me! Where are you taking me?

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,520
Let go of me!

102
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,220
If you don't want them to know about your condition, then come with me!

103
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,920
Get in the car!

104
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
Zhan Zhi Lin!

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,380
Jiang Nan!

106
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,600
Cai Yun!

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,360
Cai Yun, it's me. It's me, Cai Yun!

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,320
- Sister-in-law! 
 - I'm Jiang Hai!

109
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,820
I'm Jiang Hai.

110
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,680
Cai Yun, are you okay?

111
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,240
Jiang Hai. Jiang Hai!

112
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Aunt, take my mom home first.

113
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
I'll go get Cheng Cheng back.

114
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
Okay. I'll take care of your mom.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Go ahead.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,320
Drive safely!

117
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Got it!

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
What exactly are you doing?

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,180
Why are you transferring your anger towards Jiang Nan on his mom?

120
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,120
She's just a patient!

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,340
She's innocent!

122
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,540
She's innocent?

123
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,740
Stop the car now.

124
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,000
Where are you taking me?

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,800
What do you want?

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm saving your life.

127
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
I can't watch you seek your own demise.

128
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
I am well aware of my own condition.

129
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,660
You have no right to interfere!

130
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,680
Stop the car!

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,800
Stop the car now!

132
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,220
Are you crazy?

133
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,659
Come on!

134
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,780
- Come on! 
 - Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,860
How did you end up like this?

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,540
All thanks to you and your lunatic mother!

137
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,720
- Say that again! 
 - Jiang Nan!

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,840
If this ever happens again, I will never spare you!

139
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,380
Don't move.

140
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,580
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

141
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,980
It'll heal in a few days.

142
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,860
You're bleeding. How can you say you're okay?

143
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,560
You had a scare today. Go get some rest soon.

144
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
Don't worry about my mom.

145
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
My aunt will stay with her.

146
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,860
Why would Zhan Zhi Lin target your mom?

147
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,560
What exactly happened between you?

148
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,580
Don't ask.

149
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,200
Why would Zhan Zhi Lin say it's all thanks to your mom.

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
I told you to stop asking!

151
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,600
I'm sorry. I'm in a bad mood.

152
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,460
Go get some rest soon.

153
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,420
You still haven't gone to bed?

154
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,960
But that's all right.

155
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Sooner or later,

156
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,880
you will all leave me.

157
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,760
I really want to go back to the past.

158
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,880
Back then, my dad was still alive.

159
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,280
Zhan Zhi Lin and I could play music free of any worries.

160
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,120
There's no way back.

161
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,020
I can never go back anymore.

162
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,740
It's gone.

163
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,840
Everything is gone.

164
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,280
Jiang Nan, stop drinking!

165
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,440
- Give it to me! 
 - Stop drinking.

166
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,100
Xu Duo Cheng,

167
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,200
can you not leave me?

168
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Can you stay by my side forever?

169
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,160
Is that okay?

170
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,500
Okay.

171
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,080
 What did I do last night?

172
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,960
 Xu Duo Cheng, you didn't drink at all.

173
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,660
 Why were you intoxicated too?

174
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,320
I'm sorry. I woke you up.

175
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,060
I lost my earring. I'm looking for it.

176
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,740
You lost your earring? I'll help you look for it.

177
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,600
Last night, did we...

178
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,200
What? No.

179
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,620
I didn't even say what it was yet.

180
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,240
What didn't you do?

181
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
You...

182
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
You didn't rinse your mouth yet.

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,740
You reek of alcohol.

184
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,120
Well, did nothing happen between us last night?

185
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,960
By the way, go pack up later.

186
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,400
I'm going home first.

187
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,940
Why are you going home so soon?

188
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,400
Even Zhan Zhi Lin could find this place yesterday, so can the media.

189
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,920
If I stay here, I will disturb my mom's peaceful life.

190
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,240
After we leave, my aunt will take my mom to her place.

191
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,360
That way, they won't find her.

192
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,960
Okay.

193
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,480
Where is it?

194
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,140
Nan Nan, come here.

195
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,040
Your mom is fine.

196
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,880
She just recognized me.

197
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,259
I'll take care of her.

198
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,900
Well, I must leave my mom in your care for a while.

199
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,739
Call me at any time if anything comes up.

200
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,100
Don't worry.

201
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,839
Take care on your way back.

202
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,539
We're leaving now.

203
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,360
You can take a nap. I'll wake you when we get there.

204
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,260
That's all right. I'm not sleepy.

205
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,680
By the way, Cheng Cheng, I just remembered something.

206
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Let's go buy a birthday present for Dou Dou together.

207
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,580
How do you know Dou Dou's birthday?

208
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,300
Dou Dou invited me to his birthday party.

209
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,320
There are so many choices.

210
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,780
What should I choose?

211
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,620
Kids these days are so lucky.

212
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,680
They have so many toys. I don't even know what to choose.

213
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,940
Should we get more in case Dou Dou gets bored in the hospital?

214
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,620
Dou Dou can't play with these complicated toys in his current condition.

215
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,640
You're right.

216
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,120
ALS is such a tormenting disease.

217
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,820
He needs more family support as he gets to the later stages.

218
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,800
I don't know how Dou Dou's mom manages to hang in there.

219
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,260
Hello, what's the age of the child you're buying toys for?

220
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,540
Eight years old.

221
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,340
You're such young parents.

222
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,380
We...

223
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,720
We can choose on our own. Thank you.

224
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,320
It's okay.

225
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,320
Cheng Cheng,

226
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,000
has Dou Dou ever mentioned anything he really wants?

227
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,160
What he really wants?

228
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,920
These puppies are so cute!

229
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,180
They are super adorable.

230
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,920
Xu Duo Cheng, control yourself.

231
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,260
We're here to buy a present for Dou Dou.

232
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,380
Well, let's buy this Shiba Inu.

233
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,280
It has a great personality.

234
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
Don't just look at his size now.

235
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,320
It's really naughty when it grows up.

236
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,180
It's not suitable for Dou Dou.

237
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,260
Well, let's buy the Schnauzer.

238
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,720
When Schnauzers grow up,

239
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,020
they have super long eyelashes.

240
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,020
They are super cute.

241
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,680
But Schnauzers are too delicate.

242
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,980
Dou Dou's family is already busy taking care of Dou Dou.

243
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,780
How can they take of it?

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
How about this? We'll buy a Pomeranian.

245
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Look at this Pomeranian.

246
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
It won't eat much and it doesn't really shed.

247
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,840
It's also cute and clingy.

248
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,040
That's perfect for Dou Dou.

249
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
That's it then.

250
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,720
Sure.

251
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,313
- Hello. 
 - I got some information.

252
00:20:54,313 --> 00:20:56,013
 What did you find out?

253
00:20:57,286 --> 00:21:00,160
Gu Jia Yi was the one who exposed the address of the nursing home.

254
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,920
- It was her indeed. 
 -  Don't be impulsive...

255
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,280
What happened?

256
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,840
There's an emergency.

257
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,920
Well, you should go now.

258
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,280
It's okay. I'll take you upstairs first.

259
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,040
Come on.

260
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Go do your thing. I'll clean up.

261
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,320
Cheng Cheng, you take care of the puppy at home.

262
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,940
Wait for me.

263
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,930
â™«  I want to accompany you until the end of the dream  â™«

264
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,980
â™«  Piecing together our tacit agreements  â™«

265
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,130
â™«  Until the mottled world becomes transparent  â™«

266
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
 Why are you blushing?

267
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,460
 I-I-I'm not blushing.

268
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,160
 It's too hot.

269
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,220
 I'm here to be your assistant and not your housekeeper!

270
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,620
 It's the same thing.

271
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,800
 Cola chicken wings. It has to taste the same as last time.

272
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,280
 I'll make you stay on the treadmill forever.

273
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,400
 Xu Duo Cheng, what's that smell?

274
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,500
 I'm boiling wormwood.

275
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,230
 It promotes circulation, removes blood stasis, and warms up the body and uterus.

276
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,820
â™«  You are my life's new light  â™«

277
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:06,150
â™«  Walking by the glittering past with you  â™«

278
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,920
â™«  is a passion that will never betray  â™«

279
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,400
 Aren't you just relying on your handsome looks?

280
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,180
 This counts as disturbing your neighbors, don't you know?

281
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,000
 I'm playing a game at my own house, not singing karaoke.

282
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,080
 Who am I disturbing?

283
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,420
 Why are you talking so much in the morning?

284
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,560
 Are you going to let anyone sleep?

285
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,380
 It's not like I'm singing karaoke at home.

286
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,420
 Who am I disturbing?

287
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,460
 Are you happy now?

288
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:35,530
â™«  I'm waiting to watch the sky full of shooting stars with you  â™«

289
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,960
 I wrote a new song. Do you want to hear it?

290
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,500
â™«  I want to accompany you until the end of the dream  â™«

291
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,080
â™«  Piecing together our tacit agreements  â™«

292
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,340
 Can you not leave me?

293
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,940
â™«  Until the mottled world becomes transparent  â™«

294
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,220
â™«  I want to accompany you until the end of the dream  â™«

295
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,300
â™«  Touching those new sceneries  â™«

296
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,580
â™«  Until the noise fades to silence  â™«

297
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,540
 Jiang Nan, I'm sorry.

298
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,140
 I broke my promise.

299
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,820
 I can't be by your side anymore.

300
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,060
 My existence will only bring trouble to your life.

301
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,480
Coming.

302
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,440
Brother Nan! Brother Nan!

303
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,620
- Brother Nan! 
 - Gu Jia Yi,

304
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,100
were you the one who exposed the address of the nursing home?

305
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,800
The nursing home?

306
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,640
Did anything happen?

307
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,650

308
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,220

309
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,920
Is Auntie all right?

310
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,300
There's no Oscar in this.

311
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,720
You don't have to put on an act.

312
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
You're suspecting me?

313
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,640
Why aren't you suspecting Xu Duo Cheng?

314
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,600
She's the one who goes to the nursing home every day!

315
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,020
- It can't be Xu Duo Cheng! 
 - It can't be her?

316
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,760
So, I'm the one who does all the bad deeds?

317
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,220
Why do you always suspect me every time something happens?

318
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,200
I don't care if you're responsible for this.

319
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,280
Anyway, do not bother my mom ever again.

320
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,640
She's sick. She needs a quiet environment to recuperate!

321
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,040
There's more. No matter how hard you try,

322
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,240
Xu Duo Cheng and I will never break up!

323
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,720
Brother Nan.

324
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,640
 Feed the puppy twice a day with 50g of dry dog food every time.

325
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,860
 Walk the dog once in the morning and once at night.

326
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
 I was afraid you'd leave quietly.

327
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,900
 I even bought a puppy as a reason to keep you here.

328
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,840
 But you still left.

329
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,380
 Why?

330
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,340
 Why must you be so determined?

331
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,380

332
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,140
Ignoring his calls all the time is not a good option.

333
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,220
I don't want to say goodbye to him for the second time.

334
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,500
I just don't understand. Why do you have to leave?

335
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,360
I can tell Jiang Nan truly loves you

336
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,780
and you love him too.

337
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,040
Why can't you stay together?

338
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,793
I want to live the life of an ordinary person again.

339
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,940
We were bound by a contract from the start.

340
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,240
Turning an act into reality won't end well.

341
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,140
Did something happen when you went to Jiang Nan's hometown with him?

342
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,000
Nothing happened.

343
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,600
I just thought it through.

344
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,260
Ke Qin, as my best friend,

345
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,660
I hope you can support me.

346
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,960
Have you thought it through?

347
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,260
No regrets?

348
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,960
No regrets.

349
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,900
Fine, no matter what you decide,

350
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,340
I'll always be by your side.

351
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,680
 I don't know what happened between you.

352
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,400
 Orange won't tell me either.

353
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,480
 Maybe you should leave her alone for a few days

354
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,960
 and let her stay at my place for a while.

355
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,520
 Maybe everything will be fine in a few days.

356
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,960
Okay. We'll do as you say.

357
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,420
Okay, got it. That's it then.

358
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,120
Same as always.

359
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,840
What's with the long face?

360
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,120
Come on, have a drink to celebrate a temporary victory

361
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,440
from our first collaboration.

362
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,860
I can't believe that's all the famous President Liang can do.

363
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,460
I understand what you mean,

364
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,640
but you can't rush this.

365
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,940
You're the one who said we need to hit him where it hurts.

366
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,680
If we want to mess with Jiang Nan,

367
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,980
we need to start with his Achilles heel.

368
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,600
I think you're right.

369
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,960
What's Jiang Nan's Achilles heel?

370
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,660
His mother.

371
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,340
Of course, there's also Xu Duo Cheng now.

372
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,440
President Liang, let me make it clear to you.

373
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,860
Do not touch Xu Duo Cheng.

374
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,960
If you do, we'll be enemies.

375
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,440
I didn't expect you to be such an affectionate man, Little Director Zhan.

376
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,040
We'll just follow our previous plan and each will takes what he needs.

377
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,740
I want my Gu Jia Yi.

378
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,400
I'm not interested in that

379
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,460
Xu Duo Cheng of yours.

380
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,360
Are you planning to avoid him for the rest of your life?

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't know.

382
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,960
I'll avoid him for as long as possible.

383
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,680
Fine. I'm going to work now.

384
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,260
Go on.

385
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,860
Ke Qin, how's Cheng Cheng?

386
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
She's eating and sleeping well.

387
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,380
She just doesn't want to see you.

388
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Why?

389
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,720
You should know better than I do.

390
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,580
- I... 
 - You can't find out anything from me.

391
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,660
Jiang Nan, you shall stay away from a friend's wife.

392
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,640
Ke Qin has me now.

393
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,880
Chubby Zhu, who's your wife?

394
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,460
Well... It's something like that.

395
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,000
Jiang Nan understands me.

396
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,180
What are you thinking?

397
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,980
I'm here to see Cheng Cheng.

398
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,620
Chubby Zhu, are you here to take me to work?

399
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,320
Yes.

400
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,260
I'm about to be late. Let's go now.

401
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,960
Will do.

402
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,780
Why do you seem strange today?

403
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,780
I really don't want to be interrogated by Jiang Nan.

404
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,380
Hurry up!

405
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,050

406
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,800
He's recovering pretty well after the surgery. 
   â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

407
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,320
That's good. 
   â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

408
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
Hurry up. The birthday party is about to start. 
  â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

409
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,520
How can you blame me? Didn't you forget to bring the present?

410
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,300
Let's hurry. 
   â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

411
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
Happy birthday!

412
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,720
- Good, let's take a picture. 
 - Three, two, one!

413
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,000
Stop!

414
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
Sister Cheng Cheng! Come on, come take a picture!

415
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,940
Come here!

416
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,200
We're taking a picture.

417
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Come on, you're right on time.

418
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,840
Okay, look this way.

419
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,800
Three, two, one!

420
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,920
- Cheese! 
 - Cheese!

421
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,580
I'm sorry, Dou Dou.

422
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Something came up and I came late.

423
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,480
What's wrong? You're mad at me?

424
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,840
He woke up early this morning just to wait for you and Jiang Nan.

425
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,160
You two are his best friends now.

426
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,880
Well, my best friend, check out my gift for you.

427
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,380
Why are these dog food and dog toys?

428
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,420
I don't have a dog at home.

429
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,300
You'll have one soon.

430
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,980
Sister Cheng Cheng!

431
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,040
Have some of this.

432
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,020
- Dou Dou. 
 - Brother Jiang Nan!

433
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,520
Happy birthday.

434
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,960
Thank you, Brother Jiang Nan.

435
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,740
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes, I do.

436
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,560
By the way, Brother Jiang Nan, you're here just in time.

437
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,440
Sister Cheng Cheng just left.

438
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,260
Sister Cheng Cheng came by just now?

439
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,980
She went that way.

440
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,260
Thanks, young man!

441
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,280

442
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,980
Xu Duo Cheng!

443
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,500
Don't worry.

444
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,720
Okay, okay. Got it...

445
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,200
- Why are you in such a rush? 
 - Drive!

446
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,800
Here.

447
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,319
Thank you.

448
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,999
Why are you avoiding Jiang Nan?

449
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:41,420
Did he find out about your condition?

450
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,940
No.

451
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,820
Please, don't ask.

452
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,480
If you want to cry,

453
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,660
I can lend you my shoulder.

454
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm sorry to drag you in again.

455
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,460
You're sorry again?

456
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,740
You see, I can be your shield and I can piss Jiang Nan off.

457
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,340
Why wouldn't I take this opportunity?

458
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,080
What exactly happened between you and Jiang Nan?

459
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,420
You seemed possessed in Jiang Nan's hometown that day.

460
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,300
You weren't like the Zhan Zhi Lin I know at all.

461
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,220
I wasn't like me?

462
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,020
That's the real me.

463
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,200
How much do you know about me anyway?

464
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,420
Maybe I don't know you that well,

465
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,900
but I know what you did last time was impulsive.

466
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,400
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

467
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,400
 You seemed possessed in Jiang Nan's hometown that day.

468
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,080
 You weren't like the Zhan Zhi Lin I know at all.

469
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,900
 My dad paid you.

470
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,720
 I saw it!

471
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,980
 Jiang Nan.

472
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,960
 Did you know about everything all along?

473
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,540
 Why didn't you tell me?

474
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,020
 If you told me, I could've saved my mom!

475
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,140
 My mom wouldn't have died!

476
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,700
 We have nothing to do with the past grudges of our elders.

477
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,980
 Jiang Nan, is that something a decent person would say?

478
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,080
 You're just being partial to your mom!

479
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,560
 No wonder you want to disband.

480
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,800
 It's because you can't bear to face me!

481
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,540
 Are you done?

482
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,500
 If you are, I'm leaving.

483
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
 I won't spare you and your mom!

484
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,820
 I'm here. Where are you?

485
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,200
Did you expose the nursing home?

486
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,980
Who are you to ask me that?

487
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,540
Why should I answer you?

488
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,760
Jiang Nan came and barked that question at me for no reason.

489
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,220
Who else could've done it besides you?

490
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,560
I'm not the only one who wants to destroy Jiang Nan.

491
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,460
It was Liang Zhe?

492
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,680
Let me tell you something else.

493
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,960
Xu Duo Cheng already moved out of Jiang Nan's house,

494
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,580
so you don't have to waste your energy on her anymore.

495
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,480
Xiao Mei, accept that TV show for me.

496
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,120
I want to show Jiang Nan the glorious me again.

497
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:30,050

498
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:42,131
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

499
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:48,545
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

500
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:56,442
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

501
00:38:56,442 --> 00:39:02,129
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

502
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:05,775
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

503
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:09,855
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

504
00:39:09,855 --> 00:39:16,108
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

505
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:19,668
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

506
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:21,441
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

507
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:23,841
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

508
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:26,655
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

509
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:30,643
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

510
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:33,960
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

511
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,928
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

512
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:42,314
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

513
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,963
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

514
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:48,354
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

515
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:52,388
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

516
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:55,322
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

517
00:39:55,322 --> 00:39:59,321
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

518
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:02,664
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

519
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:06,726
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

520
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:10,941
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

521
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:17,389
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

522
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:35,242
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

523
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:39,322
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

524
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:45,669
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

525
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:49,160
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

526
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,294
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again â™«

527
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:56,228
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

528
00:40:56,228 --> 00:41:00,127
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

529
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,470
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

530
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,532
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

531
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:11,747
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

532
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:17,936
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
