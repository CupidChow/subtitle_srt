1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,970

2
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:13,659
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:15,899
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:19,199
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,474
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:30,332
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:33,046
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,551
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,933
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:41,732
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:44,446
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:48,433
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:51,160
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,873
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:55,420
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,787
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:01,502
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:05,843
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:10,690
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,544
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:16,178
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,385
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:21,198
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:25,657
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:31,176
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,232
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:48,931

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,940
At the time, I hadn't composed any new songs in a long time

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,880
and wasn't in my best state.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,180
I seemed to have lost my inspiration for music all of a sudden.

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,420
I didn't like any of the songs I wrote either.

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,320
Well, let's rewrite this song.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,840
I believe you already found back your inspiration for music again.

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,260
But we don't have enough time.

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm not sure I can do it.

36
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,940
Do you want to hear my story for this half-finished song?

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,540
 The day I was diagnosed with ALS,

38
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,090
 I felt like my entire world collapsed.

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,660
 No one could understand how I felt back then.

40
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,460
 I'm sorry.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,120
 Hello, Dad.

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,320
 Daughter, you said you've been feeling weak lately.

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,540
 What did the doctor say?

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,680
 The doctor said I need to exercise more.

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 Okay, okay.

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,220
 Then if anything comes up, you can tell me.

47
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,000
 If it's nothing, you should come home soon.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,120
 I'm waiting for you to come back to eat.

49
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,959
 I accidentally picked up a music score.

50
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,300
 I didn't think the song I picked up would be filled with an uplifting energy

51
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,480
where it refused to give in to life.

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,300
So I used its etude and taught it to my students.

53
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,400
I didn't know my song could be used to teach others.

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,280
Should I ask you for some music royalty?

55
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,380
Am I not enough?

56
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,760
You are.

57
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,220
Do you remember I told you that if I'm lucky enough

58
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,980
to meet the owner of this music score,

59
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,900
I will tell him personally...

60
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,660
 Not everyone in this world

61
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,900
 has the chance to pursue their dreams.

62
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,360
 If he has the chance,

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,010
 he shouldn't give up easily.

64
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,440
I will officially give you these words now.

65
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:34,175
â™«  Remember the first time we met  â™«

66
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:42,055
â™«  Both of us were caught unprepared  â™«

67
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:49,961
â™«  No time to hesitate. We're already running out of time  â™«

68
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:55,221
â™«  Leave a hint in your smile as we go on  â™«

69
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,720
Reduce two decibels here. Let me hear it.

70
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,000
Is the chorus too loud here?

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,452
- Reduce another three decibels of the chorus here. 
  - All right.

72
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:10,315
â™«  You and I will both try hard to be reasonable  â™«

73
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,912
â™«  All we can do is   â™«

74
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:17,590
â™«  give each other our tacit understanding  â™«

75
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,320
â™«  We'll put away our words  â™«

76
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,021
â™«  And end it with a smile  â™«

77
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,050
â™«  Oh, at this moment  â™«

78
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,529
â™«  The past ends with one final note  â™«

79
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,984
â™«  The skill to forget  â™«

80
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:38,022
 â™ª But I can never perfect  â™ª

81
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,599
 â™ª I wish you would hold my hands â™ª

82
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,190
 â™ª But you're stuck in the memories of the past â™ª

83
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,035
 â™ª Ten thousand kilometers â™ª

84
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:52,251
 â™ª is the distance between the dawn and midnight â™ª

85
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,399
 â™ª Oh, at this moment â™ª

86
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,733
 â™ª It's clearly not how it used to be â™ª

87
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,348
 â™ª But it feels so real â™ª

88
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:06,585
 â™ª I cannot turn my eyes away â™ª

89
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:09,890
 â™ª My heart's in the most painful story â™ª

90
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,475
 â™ª The late winter when I long for you â™ª

91
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:17,306
 â™ª Love gradually fades away â™ª

92
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:26,390
 â™ª In an ending without you â™ª

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,780
You're drinking this early?

94
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,600
Jiang Nan is about to go on Cool Singer-Songwriters.

95
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,220
Cool Singer-Songwriters is such a popular show.

96
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,100
Aren't you afraid Jiang Nan will become more popular than before?

97
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,620
By then, no matter how hard you try,

98
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,900
Gu Jia Yi won't spare even a single glance at you.

99
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,740
I have no choice.

100
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,820
I'm telling you, Alex is so stubborn.

101
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,840
He has set his mind on Jiang Nan. What else can I do?

102
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,680
So, Alex chose Jiang Nan instead of you?

103
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,059
That makes sense.

104
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,020
Sometimes money can't do everything.

105
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,460
No, no, I don't think so.

106
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,780
Who would go against money?

107
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,000
I still made an investment.

108
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,000
Here's what I think.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
I must first set out the fish hook,

110
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,520
so it would be convenient when I want to go fishing.

111
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,760
You still have other ideas?

112
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,840
So that's why I came to discuss them with you.

113
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,220
What are you planning to do?

114
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,940
The higher he climbs, the harder he falls.

115
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,980
The way I really like it is...

116
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,600
How do I put it? It's like...

117
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,460
It's the pleasant sensation you get

118
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,860
when someone gradually climbs to the top

119
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,420
and falls all the way back down.

120
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,360
Here's what I think.

121
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,500
I want to put a person of mine into Cool Singer-Songwriters

122
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,520
and bind him with Jiang Nan to create news.

123
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,260
What do you think?

124
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,320
I have a perfect candidate.

125
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,200
No one is better than him.

126
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,020
That's why I say us two brothers

127
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,100
should hang out more often when we have time.

128
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,700
Cheers.

129
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,900
- Brother Rui. 
 - Lord Bao.

130
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,300
- Xiao Du is here too? 
 - Brother Nan.

131
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,340
Can you two stop casting dog food all the time? 
  (T/N: Internet slang. Couples who act lovey-dovey in public are giving "dog food" to those who are single)

132
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,320
Can you consider my feelings?

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,600
Lord Bao, are you jealous?

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,900
When will you get a girlfriend?

135
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,820
We're waiting to eat your dog food.

136
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,260
Lao Jiang, I'm telling you that Cheng Cheng has been led astray by you.

137
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,120
She's already starting to rub in my weaknesses, you know?

138
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,360
Let me tell you, the happiest person in here is this guy.

139
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,060
He's going back to his hometown today to get married.

140
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,100
Xiao Du, this is a small gift from Cheng Cheng and me.

141
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,260
Bring your wife with you when you come back from getting married.

142
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,740
I don't want to see you two live separately.

143
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,020
Thank you, Brother Nan and Sister-in-law.

144
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,160
I...

145
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,940
Lord Bao, where's your red envelope? 
  (T/N: Given to celebrate couples getting married)

146
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,000
Hurry, take it out now.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,120
No, why are you looking at me like that?

148
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,880
Am I such a frugal person?

149
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,180
But to be serious, I'll be sending Xiao Du to the train station later.

150
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,460
Tonight, on the stage, you can...

151
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,600
No problem.

152
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,980
I think I asked about my own loneliness.

153
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,480
Yes, no one needs me anymore.

154
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,300
You're right.

155
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,140
But Lao Jiang, you haven't been on stage for a while.

156
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,740
Today is the day to see if you will win this battle.

157
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,413
I understand. Why are you still nagging me?

158
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,520
- Let's go. 
 - Bye-bye.

159
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,700
- Xiao Du, congratulations on your marriage! 
 - Congratulations on your marriage!

160
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,240
What do you think? Do I look all right?

161
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,440
Is my hair messy?

162
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,340
No.

163
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,900
You can do it!

164
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,060
I'm not afraid of anything with you by my side.

165
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Brother, everything is ready.

166
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,720
Jiang Nan will be the last to go on stage.

167
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,020
Just wait and see what happens when he starts singing.

168
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,890
President Liang's people really did a good job.

169
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Brother, why don't we go watch what happens live?

170
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,340
You're right. There's nothing to see.

171
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,740
He just going to sing.

172
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,000
What is he even saying about pursuing his aspiration for music?

173
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,380
Brother, I'll get going then.

174
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
What's wrong?

175
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you nervous?

176
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm nervous when you're here.

177
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,460
I'll go check up with your accompaniment. I'll be back soon.

178
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,580
Jiang Nan, I feel like we came to be your supporting role in this show.

179
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,880
Everyone can tell Alex thinks very highly of you.

180
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,600
I never heard what everyone is singing and no one knows what I am going to sing.

181
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,560
So, before the show begins,

182
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,340
no one knows who will be the final winner.

183
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,740
If you ask me, it doesn't matter who wins.

184
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,180
Jiang Nan, do you know Jian Xing?

185
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

186
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,580
He suddenly joined the show right before it began.

187
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,020
They say he's a challenger.

188
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,740
What do you think Alex means by that?

189
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,340
 Are you crazy?

190
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,380
 Jiang Nan, please, respond!

191
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,600
 Jiang Nan, please, respond to Jian Xing's accusation.

192
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,380
 Jiang Nan, are you really terminating your contract with Sheng Yu Entertainment?

193
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,200
 Jiang Nan, please, respond.

194
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,840
 Please, give us a direct response!

195
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 Give us an explanation.

196
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,800
 Due to Jiang Nan's drunken act of violence towards Jian Xing,

197
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
 and the disbanding of 2BeOne, Sheng Yu Entertainment will be terminating its contract with Jiang Nan.

198
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,620
 Jiang Nan will have to pay a high penalty fee for his contract termination.

199
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,560
 At this moment, he has waved his music career goodbye.

200
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
I made some adjustments to the accompaniment, so I want to replace the track.

201
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,500
All right. Please, listen to see which version it is.

202
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,040
 This sounds exactly like Jiang Nan's new song.

203
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,120
Yes, that's the one.

204
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,520
Okay, I have your confirmation then.

205
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,460
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

206
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,020
Mr. Sound Engineer, hello.

207
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,120
Do you have the latest performance order list?

208
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,460
You are...

209
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm Jiang Nan's personnel.

210
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
Thank you.

211
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,020

212
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,850
- Let's have a drink tonight. 
 - Sure.

213
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,440
Jiang Nan, long time no see.

214
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,920
Come on.

215
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,380
You haven't changed from the last time we saw each other.

216
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,120
Who do you think will be the winner of this competition?

217
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Come out for a moment.

218
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,060

219
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,060
What's wrong?

220
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,740
I just went to confirm the accompaniment

221
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,700
and I discovered Jian Xing's song is almost the same as yours.

222
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,280
Are you sure?

223
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,020
There are too many similarities.

224
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,500
He's a challenger contestant.

225
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,220
No one notified us of his appearance.

226
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,640
He is also going before you.

227
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,400
I think something is wrong.

228
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,480
What should we do?

229
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,360
We'll change to another song.

230
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,380
There are only a few more hours before the show starts.

231
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,180
Do we have enough time?

232
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,940
If Jian Xing is targeting me,

233
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,460
changing the song is our only choice.

234
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,879
You don't believe me.

235
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:20,079
I do believe you.

236
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,780
I'll go confirm with the accompanist that we are changing songs.

237
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,340
Hello, Alex. There has been an accident that has come up last minute.

238
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,620
I might need to change to another song.

239
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,380
Just to let everyone know that Jiang Nan is changing songs last minute, so...

240
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,560
Changing songs last minute?

241
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,720
Can he do that?

242
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,480
He has the talent to do so.

243
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,680
No, he's just wasting everyone's time.

244
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,040
You can't do that. I have another show I have to go to afterwards.

245
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,220
 Changing songs last minute?

246
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,660
 What should I do?

247
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,860
 I think I was a bit nervous, so my breath was unsteady just now,

248
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,200
 but the encouragement the judges gave me warmed my heart.

249
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,640
Da Lin, how many performances have we seen already?

250
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,360
Why isn't it Jiang Nan's turn yet?

251
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,740
Jiang Nan is the last performer.

252
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,980
You have to wait.

253
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,100
Seems like the show doesn't think highly of him.

254
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,860
What do you know?

255
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,460
He's the grand finale.

256
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,420
Only big shots do the finale.

257
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,040
Use your brain.

258
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,880
All you care about is eating.

259
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,300
If you keep this up, you'll have to leave!

260
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,860
How can you work for me if it takes you so long to get some equipment?

261
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,500
If we came any later, we wouldn't get any evidence of Jiang Nan's plagiarism.

262
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,420
President Liang, we have a situation.

263
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,860
I was planning to use Jiang Nan's song,

264
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,460
but I didn't expect that good-for-nothing changed songs last minute.

265
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,980
I am not sure what happened.

266
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,760
Yes.

267
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
Wait a minute.

268
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,740
What are you doing here?

269
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,880
Why did you plagiarize Jiang Nan's song?

270
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,380
Are you crazy?

271
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,120
Don't leave!

272
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,680
I heard everything when you were changing your music track.

273
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,840
Your song is exactly like Jiang Nan's song.

274
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,980
Are you crazy? Didn't Jiang Nan change songs?

275
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,840
I've never heard of it.

276
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,240
Jiang Nan only changed his song because you plagiarized him!

277
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,680
We have records of the original score and revisions of Jiang Nan's song.

278
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,520
We can confront each other and see who plagiarized the song!

279
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,600
I am too lazy to talk nonsense with you.

280
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,300
Jian Xing!

281
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,720
Although there are grievances between you and Jiang Nan,

282
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
he already paid his price.

283
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,340
Why are you playing these shenanigans on this show?

284
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,280
If you don't explain yourself, I'll expose you to the media!

285
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,640
You also know the stupid things Jiang Nan did in the past?

286
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,400
Oh, I remember now.

287
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,760
You're his girlfriend, right?

288
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,020
Go expose it to the media.

289
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,720
Since I dare use this song today, why would I be unprepared?

290
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,360
If you want to make it public, do it anytime!

291
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,040
So, you admit you plagiarized the song?

292
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,600
Let me tell you, watch your mouth!

293
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,240
Jiang Nan will be done for sooner or later.

294
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,260
Don't overestimate yourself!

295
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
Jiang Nan, calm down!

296
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,920
Jiang Nan!

297
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Jiang Nan, let go!

298
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,060
Jiang Nan!

299
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,400
- Let go of me! 
 - Calm down, Jiang Nan!

300
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,100
Let go.

301
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,840
How can they say that?

302
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,320
That's not what happened.

303
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
This is really good.

304
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,410
I used to think drinking herbal soups was like a woman in post-parturition 
  (T/N: In Chinese culture, after childbirth, women follow special diets and drinking herbal soups.)

305
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,920
but now your skills are getting better.

306
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,160
Your father's true skills have been passed down to you.

307
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,460
What time it is now?

308
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,840
How can you be in the mood to say that?

309
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,520
Also, why does Jian Xing have your music score?

310
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,400
Why did you beat up Jian Xing back then?

311
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,900
It's all in the past.

312
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,560
As for why he would have my music score,

313
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,020
we will have to talk with Lord Bao tomorrow about it.

314
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,400
Cheng Cheng, I'm sorry.

315
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,580
I made you worry today.

316
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,380
You have to promise me something then.

317
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,160
From now on, no matter what happens,

318
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,240
you cannot hit anyone again.

319
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
I promise you.

320
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,310

321
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,360
This article is way out of line!

322
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,840
Every word is hinting that there is something wrong with Jiang Nan's character.

323
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,960
They are using such an old topic to create a buzz by taunting him up front.

324
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,640
I even played badminton with her a few days ago!

325
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,140
I'm so pissed!

326
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,960
All right, don't be so angry.

327
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,200
Lord Bao, someone is calling.

328
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,160
It must be from a reporter. I'm not answering it.

329
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,240
Why is that Jian Xing so disgusting?

330
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,680
If it weren't for Orange, Jiang Nan would have been accused of plagiarism.

331
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,920
Where did he get the music score?

332
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,120
Actually, not a lot of people know about this song.

333
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,900
Besides us, there's also...

334
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,690
Xiao Du?

335
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,300
Finding who leaked the music score is not the most pressing matter.

336
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,080
What's important is how Jian Xing will act next.

337
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,980
He had such a large scheme planned, but he failed and was beaten up by Jiang Nan.

338
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,220
He definitely won't leave the matter at that.

339
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,040
It's Alex.

340
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,000
Put him on speaker.

341
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:43,880
 Jiang Nan, you really disappointed me.

342
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,280
 You've created such a scene!

343
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,420
Alex, I'm sorry. I was too impulsive.

344
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm sorry, Teacher Alex. I'm Bao Rui.

345
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:58,160
It's like this. I wanted to ask if Jian Xing told you why Jiang Nan hit him?

346
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,980
He said Jiang Nan was jealous of him for coming on the show at the very last minute!

347
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,860
 Without saying anything else, the two of them started fighting.

348
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,940
How can he say...

349
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,460
 I don't care what reason you have.

350
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,040
 Jiang Nan hit him first, so he is at fault.

351
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,080
Jiang Nan, you must handle this properly

352
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,160
or I will never give you another chance!

353
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,580
Alex, I'm very sorry if this incident affected the show in any way,

354
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,480
but what I want to tell you is, I have my reasons for hitting Jian Xing.

355
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
I wasn't acting on impulse.

356
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,280
Even if I lose my chance to be on Cool Singer-Songwriters, I won't have any regrets.

357
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,520
Young man, don't be so sure of yourself.

358
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,960
Judging by how big things have got,

359
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,000
why don't we have Jiang Nan and Jian Xing withdraw from the competition?

360
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,600
I don't care about Jian Xing.

361
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,220
As for Jiang Nan, he really does have the skills.

362
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,940
Also, I didn't think we would get so much trending news from him.

363
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,720
Let's wait and see.

364
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
Anyway, the show has generated a large amount of buzz.

365
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,740
It would be even better if Jiang Nan is problem-free.

366
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,320
He can continue to be on the show and generate more news.

367
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
Lao Jiang, why didn't you let me speak?

368
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,800
He won't believe anything we say now.

369
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,200
It's because this show is really important for you.

370
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
In my opinion, Alex won't easily give up on me at this moment.

371
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,040
This show has been generating quite a large amount of buzz.

372
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,620
Got it. How about this?

373
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,240
I'll contact a few reporters I know to ease the public for now.

374
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
Is that okay?

375
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,960
There's no rush.

376
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240
As you said, Jian Xing must've come prepared.

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,500
Besides waiting, there's nothing else we can do.

378
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,540
In that case, I'll take Cheng Cheng to eat at the Happy Family Restaurant.

379
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,800
I haven't visited my father-in-law in such a long time.

380
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,920
We're leaving.

381
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,340
You have worked hard, Lord Bao.

382
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,120
I...

383
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,900
Editor-in-Chief Qin, do you need to see me?

384
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Did you write the article about Jiang Nan?

385
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,360
Why did you publish it without my permission?

386
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,260
There are two editors-in-chief in True Image now.

387
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,000
President Liang says I have the power to publish articles independently now.

388
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,020
If you have any problems with it, you can go ask him.

389
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,640
First of all, both chief editors should supervise each other.

390
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,280
As you didn't hold a publishing meeting, you went against protocol.

391
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,680
Secondly, your article is highly subjective and instigating.

392
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,420
That's not the style of True Image.

393
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,620
Even those clickbait writers on the internet won't write something like that.

394
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Qi Qi, at the very least, I was the one who trained you.

395
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,800
Is this the level of journalism you have?

396
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,740
That's all in the past, yet you still clearly remember it.

397
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,260
You have your style and I have mine.

398
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,280
What I want is high viewership.

399
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,760
Stop!

400
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,580
I know you have an opinion on Jiang Nan,

401
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,040
but there was no need to do that at all.

402
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,440
What do you mean?

403
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,380
Are you saying I have a selfish motive?

404
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,640
You and I both know about it.

405
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,520
What do I know?

406
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,200
You're just upset that I've become an editor-in-chief like you, right?

407
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,100
All right, I'll let everyone know who's the real boss here.

408
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,220

409
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,640
Everyone, put down your work.

410
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,027
I'll make it clear to you all today.

411
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:42,960
President Liang belives the reason why True Image wasn't doing well financially before

412
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,080
is because our previous style was too old-fashioned and inflexible.

413
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,100
I'm just following his instructions. I hope everyone will cooperate.

414
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,180
From now on, we will publish a trending article every week,

415
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,960
and it will affect your performance rating.

416
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,520
From now on, all work will be reported directly to me.

417
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,200
Do you understand?

418
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
Qi Qi, listen up!

419
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,340
Since the establishment of True Image,

420
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,120
it has never belonged to me,

421
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,580
and it certainly won't belong to you.

422
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,300
Is that important?

423
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,760
Your job is more important, right?

424
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,280
We used to always call Sister Shan the Female Devil.

425
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,220
Now, we know that Sister Shan is the Female Guardian Deity,

426
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,080
while Qi Qi is the Monster in human skin.

427
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,360

428
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,560

429
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,900
Jiang Nan, don't just sit there. Have some meat.

430
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,660
Jiang Nan, I stared at the TV for a long time.

431
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,280
I didn't see you come out on stage. What happened?

432
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,680
You're such a bumpkin.

433
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,280
Popular shows these days are split into two parts.

434
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,640
- Am I right, Jiang Nan? 
 - Is that true?

435
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,000
Uncle, Auntie, it's like this.

436
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,100
Someone was stirring up trouble backstage while we were recording the show,

437
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,620
so the show might be suspended for a while.

438
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,100
Stirring up trouble?

439
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,020
What happened then?

440
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,780
You got physical?

441
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,240
- This child. 
 - You...

442
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,160
You're an adult, why did you hit someone?

443
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,400
I have to scold you.

444
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,080
You should think before you act. You have Cheng Cheng now.

445
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,280
- You have to keep a clear head when you encounter problems. 
 - No, Dad, you can't...

446
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,040
That...

447
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,480
That person pushed me.

448
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,860
Jiang Nan only beat him up to protect me.

449
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,880
He pushed you?

450
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,520
- Uncle! 
 - Dad!

451
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,480
- What are you doing? 
 - Let go!

452
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,580
- Uncle! 
 - Sit down!

453
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,060
- Uncle, please, take a seat! 
 - Sit down!

454
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,700
- You... 
 - He pushed our daughter!

455
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,080
- Think about it. I... 
 - Uncle!

456
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,160
- What are you doing? 
 - Uncle, you must stay calm and clear-headed.

457
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Calm down!

458
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,720
Are you hurt?

459
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,320
No.

460
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,600
Uncle and Auntie,

461
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,440
there might be a lot of news about this matter for the next few days because I hit someone,

462
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,940
but please, don't worry about me.

463
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,280
Because what they're saying isn't true.

464
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,880
That's right. Mom, Dad, those people just want to use the opportunity to promote and gain views on their articles.

465
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,060
Don't worry, Jiang Nan.

466
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,160
No matter what they say on the news, we'll only believe you.

467
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,740
That's right. Your Auntie is right.

468
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,720
We believe you wholeheartedly. We all support you.

469
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,380
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's eat.

470
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,880
Bring me along next time.

471
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,640
Cheng Cheng, thank you for staying with me.

472
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,680
Jiang Nan, you're acting a bit strange today.

473
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,380
How so?

474
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,720
You aren't worried at all, even when something this big  happened.

475
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,720
That's nothing.

476
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,560
I've been through worse things.

477
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,880
Back when we were at the peak of our popularity,

478
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
a lot of people asked to work with me every day,

479
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,560
as if their ads and shows were tailor-made for me

480
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,040
and they couldn't do it without me.

481
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,980
I was the center of attention wherever I went.

482
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,480
But after 2BeOne was disbanded,

483
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,600
all the people around me disappeared all at once.

484
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,260
It was as if everyone forgot my existence,

485
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,820
but after being with you, I am more certain of what I should cherish.

486
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,840
It's like everything else isn't important anymore.

487
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,040
Why did you disband back then?

488
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,960
Xu Duo Cheng, I'm telling you all my true feelings.

489
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,880
Can you play along and act touched?

490
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,540
You're my boyfriend.

491
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,980
I want to know your past and your future.

492
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,080
Do you really want to know?

493
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,480
Five years ago, Sister Yun, the boss of Sheng Yu Entertainment,

494
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,720
was also our band's manager.

495
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,240
She brought Zhan Zhi Lin and me to attend a dinner party.

496
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,140
 Don't worry. Just leave it to me.

497
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,040
 President Yang, I'll count on you for helping A'Nan.

498
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,200
 A'Nan, his clothes.

499
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,100
 Send him out.

500
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,960
 President Yang, take it easy.

501
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,600
 He's drunk.

502
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,780
 President Yang!

503
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,880
  President Yang, take care!

504
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,480
 Lin Zi.

505
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,980
 Lin Zi, are you drunk?

506
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,900
 Does he have an ambiguous relationship with Sister Yun?

507
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,260
 What did you say?

508
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,740
 I said Jiang Nan is just a pretty boy.

509
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,140
 He's trash who lives off a woman by sleeping and drinking with her.

510
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,280
 Come on.

511
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,100
 Lin Zi, let's have a drink.

512
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,459
 Come on.

513
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:27,760
You are saying Zhan Zhi Lin was the one who hit him?

514
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,620
At the time, Uncle Zhan didn't support Zhan Zhi Lin's music career.

515
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,260
If Jian Xing exposed him, he might have never had a chance to ever sing again.

516
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Also, Liang Zhe kept targeting me because of Gu Jia Yi,

517
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:47,180
but I think Liang Zhe was the one who told Jian Xing to hang out with Zhan Zhi Lin.

518
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,320
Jian Xing doesn't have the guts to do so himself.

519
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,519
Did you tell Zhan Zhi Lin?

520
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,099
Why didn't you tell him?

521
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,840
You should let him know.

522
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,480
He has been targeting you just because of that matter.

523
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,260
But he didn't continue to sing later on.

524
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,926
All right, that's all the time I have for stories today.

525
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:15,700
We'll continue some other time.

526
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,800
Come to think of it, the bar we used to often perform at before debuting is near here.

527
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,080
Do you want to go see?

528
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,600
Before your debut?

529
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,680
- I do. 
 - Let's go.

530
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,240
Jiang Nan?

531
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
It's very rare to see you nowadays!

532
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
Long time no see.

533
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,580
Yes, it's been about two or three years already.

534
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,520
What do you want to drink?

535
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,240
We won't be drinking tonight.

536
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,860
I'm keeping her company. We'll just have some alcohol-free beverages.

537
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,260
He is...?

538
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,760
Brother Cheng is the owner of this place. He's a very loyal friend.

539
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Hello.

540
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,260
At the time, we would always perform till 2 or 3 a.m.

541
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,620
We were hungry and tired.

542
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,900
Brother Cheng would prepare midnight snacks for us

543
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,380
and let us drink his prized collection.

544
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,340
I really want to go back in time and watch 2BeOne's concert.

545
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,040
You are playing the guitar and Zhan Zhi Lin plays the bass.

546
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,760
You worked really well together back then, right?

547
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,640
I really envy your audience at the time.

548
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,660
Here comes my prized collection.

549
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,440
- Wahaha? 
 - Here. 
  (T/N: Yogurt Beverage)

550
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,000
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

551
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,220
Jian Xing will be live-streaming tomorrow.

552
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,640
I invited some media.

553
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,320
That way, the incident of Jiang Nan hitting him will get even bigger.

554
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,520
Jian Xing is a scumbag.

555
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,080
It's been so many years and he is still playing the same old trick of complaining to the media.

556
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,740
Jian Xing is just a pawn.

557
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,920
Please, don't take him seriously, President Zhan.

558
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
But what I don't understand is,

559
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,840
you, Jian Xing, and Jiang Nan were all from the same agency

560
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,400
and you were very close friends.

561
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,840
Why did you all turn out like this?

562
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,380
I'm leaving if you're looking for small talk.

563
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,560
We won't talk about it.

564
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,500
I won't ask, all right?

565
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,160
Today is a day worth celebrating.

566
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,820
Let's drink.

567
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:50,090

â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

577
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,196
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«
