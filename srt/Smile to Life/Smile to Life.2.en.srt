1
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Many oranges,

2
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,880
you left me to meet Jiang Nan.

3
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,960
It's Nan.

4
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
What are you doing?

5
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm afraid you'll be exposed.

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
Are we exposed?

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,640
We got caught.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,200
Let's go!

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360
Let's go. I'm not exposed.

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,640
Let's go!

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
There was a time

12
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,680
when I was very depressed.

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
But when I listen to your song,

14
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,280
your voice is like in my mind,

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
To cheer me up silently,

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,400
I might say this,

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
You think it's a bit exaggerated?

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,480
But it's because

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,440
you gave me the reason and motivation to live.

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
So, Goddess Nan,

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,360
please do your best.

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,600
You should know that

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
there is a man named Many Orange behind you,

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll always support you.

25
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
That's all I have to say.

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,120
Thank you for listening to me.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,160
You should say thank you.

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,440
It's me.

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,080
Thank you.

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,040
And you're willing to be my fan,

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
everyone,

32
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,120
There are times when things go wrong for him.

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,320
At this time,

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
you just think of yourself as going on vacation.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,840
God Nan,

36
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,040
my friend sent me a message,

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,680
They said someone saw us.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Just go.

39
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
I'll get going then.

40
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,320
Keep this.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,920
Aren't you leaving?

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
The client,

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,160
Let's go.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,600
You gave me this kind of thing.

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,920
Where is she?

46
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,960
At that time, the environment was not very good,

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,760
do you think who would let you

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,080
take photos casually in front of you?

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,680
Sis,

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
It's my fault.

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
I didn't hold the camera firmly,

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,240
It's mainly about taking photos secretly.

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,280
I really don't have a good psychological quality.

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,160
Shut up!

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
You're everywhere. Get out.

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,320
Sis,

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,320
Calm down.

58
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,920
With your ability to work,

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,680
there's no reason why you can't even do such a small thing well.

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,000
You know what the truth is.

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
If the result is still like this,

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,240
then I have to consider

63
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,840
whether you are suitable for the truth?

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,840
I'm sorry, Shan.

65
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,560
I hate apologies the most.

66
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Remember,

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,760
there is no shortage of people in this field,

68
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,840
If you don't think

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,400
you're qualified for this job,

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Please choose to leave.

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,200
Don't make me ask you to change your job.

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,480
Say something.

73
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll do my best.

74
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,120
You don't need to talk about Jiang Nan.

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,800
Kiki will arrange other work for you.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
No, Shan.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,080
Give me one more chance.

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,040
I can do it.

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,600
I don't have the patience to go out

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,600
and be amiable.

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm sorry that

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,640
you were scolded by Sis Shan.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,120
You really don't recognize me?

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,160
I … Zhu Lin

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,760
Feng, Zhu Lin Feng,

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Zhu Xiaopang.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,320
You're Zhu Xiaopang,

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,040
Yes.

89
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,520
You look so thin.

90
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,320
I started working out after I went abroad.

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
I've lost 30 kilograms in the past few years.

92
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,400
Fatty is indeed a potential stock.

93
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't recognize you at all.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,840
There's a picture to prove it.

95
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,800
It's like a fake one.

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,080
Why did you use this as a table top?

97
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,960
I got it.

98
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,040
You just want to remind yourself,

99
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
don't put on weight anymore.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,920
It's not like that,

101
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,800
because

102
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,520
This is the only photo of you and me.

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Then why are you here?

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,960
Qin Shan is my cousin.

105
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,840
What a coincidence.

106
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
I thought you were here as an intern,

107
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,640
but I didn't expect to meet you here.

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,640
What a coincidence.

109
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
If my sister bullies you again in the future,

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,640
you can come to me.

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
There's nothing my sister can do about me.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,400
It's okay.

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,960
Sis Shan is right.

114
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,760
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,440
Let's have dinner together.

116
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,840
I have an appointment.

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,080
Bye.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,160
Bye.

119
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
I heard

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,920
a lot of news

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
about you and Jiang Nan recently.

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,120
So what?

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,640
This is a hot face with a cold butt,

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,520
thank you for caring about

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,240
my own business, Mr. Liang,

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
I'll take care of it.

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,760
What do you mean by your own business?

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,800
Everyone in the supercar club

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
knows that you're mine.

130
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,080
You're embarrassing me.

131
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Mr. Liang,

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,240
you're kidding. Your face,

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,920
I never gave it to you.

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,320
Besides,

135
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,560
I think your model girlfriend suits you very well.

136
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,840
You two are perfect for each other.

137
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
If Mr. Liang has nothing else to do,

138
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
I'll leave you alone.

139
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
Thank you, Mr. Yang, for inviting me here,

140
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,920
to talk about the endorsement contract at my company some other day.

141
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,880
Of course.

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,720
Mr. Liang,

143
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
when you made her popular three years ago,

144
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,840
I should have thought that one day she would have hard wings,

145
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,800
which would make Mr. Zhan laugh.

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,320
How could I let her

147
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,240
escape from me easily?

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,880
Even if she runs away one day,

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,760
I'll break her wings.

150
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,200
It's rare for Mr. Zhan to be alone.

151
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
If you do this,

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
he'll be embarrassed.

153
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,880
I've broken up with him.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,360
Everything I do now is my freedom.

155
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,280
Just like when you

156
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
dumped Jiang Nan,

157
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,160
A good horse will never turn round,

158
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,160
but now you're having an affair with Jiang Nan,

159
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,280
Does it still make sense?

160
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Jiang Nan is no longer popular now,

161
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
he is of no use to you.

162
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
The biggest advertising space in this city now

163
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,400
belongs to you, Gu Jiayi.

164
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,640
Isn't this

165
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,520
what you want?

166
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't know since when,

167
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,720
Mr. Zhan has been so concerned about me,

168
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,120
You're well-dressed during the day,

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,400
and feasting at night,

170
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm already busy enough.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,160
I don't need you to worry about me.

172
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
I'm just trying to remind you,

173
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,320
after all,

174
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,040
A bird that has been locked in a cage

175
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,360
for a long time suddenly flies,

176
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,160
You might fall.

177
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Aren't you going to work at any time?

178
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,280
Why are you drinking?

179
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,880
No matter how much you want to eat today,

180
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,920
just add whatever you want.

181
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,600
My treat.

182
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,800
I won't drink it.

183
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,600
Are we good sisters?

184
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,560
Of course it is. It has to be.

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,520
Drink this glass of wine then.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Tell me honestly.

187
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,840
What's your relationship with Jiang Nan?

188
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I have nothing

189
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,600
to do with him.

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,080
Didn't I tell you?

191
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Then why did you meet him

192
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
at the coffee shop again.

193
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
You see,

194
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
that's because,

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,640
Forget it.

196
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,760
I can't explain it clearly in a few words.

197
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
When I entered the cafe,

198
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
I saw you sitting in front of Jiang Nan,

199
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,320
Do you know how flustered I am?

200
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,880
I tried my best,

201
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,320
but I didn't let the photographer take a picture of your face.

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,680
I was scolded by Qin Shan when I came back.

203
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,040
Do you know how bad she scolded me?

204
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
I can't talk about our relationship yet.

205
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Keqin,

206
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,920
this is really a drag on you.

207
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,640
In this case,

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll punish myself for three cups.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,440
By the way,

210
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,400
I found this score

211
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,680
in your ledger.

212
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,280
I found this score by chance

213
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
a few months ago,

214
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,880
After I read it,

215
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
I feel very sorry.

216
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,880
It's already half done,

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,480
as long as you keep going,

218
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Then it will be perfect.

219
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
You think it's good?

220
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,800
I wonder why the owner of this score

221
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,200
lost it?

222
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,680
I can't even write a complete song.

223
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,720
It's been a long time since Jiang Nan sang a song.

224
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,280
No producer will accept a song.

225
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,680
Only half of the songs

226
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,560
were written by Mr. Dong,

227
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,320
Mr. Dong,

228
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
give me a few more days.

229
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
He's right.

230
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,880
I really can't write it.

231
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
Don't be disappointed.

232
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Nobody is inspired every day,

233
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,080
creating this thing requires state itself,

234
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,040
Don't listen to them.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,920
You don't have to comfort me.

236
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
I really hope that one day,

237
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,640
I can meet the owner of this song,

238
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,800
Then you met him,

239
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,800
and then what?

240
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,520
Give him back the score.

241
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,360
And tell him,

242
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,240
in this world,

243
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,920
Not everyone has a chance to pursue their dreams.

244
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
If he does,

245
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160
don't give up easily.

246
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,960
You just joined the company.

247
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
I'll get you scolded by the leader.

248
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,480
I'll punish you

249
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,840
for one more cup.

250
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm mainly worried about you.

251
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
Don't worry.

252
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,760
God Nan and I will never see each other again.

253
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,880
Actually, I said,

254
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,240
look at the pictures of you two,

255
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,360
It's a perfect match.

256
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,440
Don't make fun of me.

257
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,040
What is she?

258
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Stars,

259
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,560
Singer,

260
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,920
Me,

261
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,120
Ordinary people,

262
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,360
you can't say that.

263
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,520
What's wrong with a celebrity singer?

264
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,800
Forget it.

265
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,840
Let's not talk about him.

266
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,880
We have graduated.

267
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,480
But right now, I'm still at a loss

268
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
about my future.

269
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,920
It's the last one.

270
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
I'm all alone here.

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,720
I should drink this glass of wine.

272
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,840
You still have me.

273
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,520
And you still have such a good job,

274
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,520
but I don't have anything.

275
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I should drink this one.

276
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,440
You have your God Nan.

277
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,920
I don't have a house or a car.

278
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,840
I'll drink it.

279
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,080
I don't have a house or a car.

280
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,440
I don't have a boyfriend.

281
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,280
I don't have a boyfriend either.

282
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,440
Me,

283
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm sick.

284
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm sick, too.

285
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,320
What's wrong with you?

286
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
What's wrong with you?

287
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,800
You're crazy.

288
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,320
You're so poor

289
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,640
and crazy. Don't try to trick me into giving you this glass of wine.

290
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,040
Hey,

291
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,560
Boss,

292
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,840
two more bottles of wine.

293
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,040
Many oranges,

294
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,840
I need to talk to you.

295
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,040
Who are you?

296
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,960
Are you coming to drink with me?

297
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Send me your location.

298
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,240
God Nan,

299
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
Nan Shen

300
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,560
Why did you drink so much?

301
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,400
amiable

302
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I haven't even taken a photo with God Nan.

303
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,560
Take a picture of us.

304
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Stand still.

305
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,240
Don't move!

306
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,360
All right,

307
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,840
You.

308
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,040
Put her

309
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,640
Take her home safely.

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
Let me send you back together.

311
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,840
You don't need to see me off.

312
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,280
Go your own way.

313
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,920
I'll call a taxi myself.

314
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,400
I can do it.

315
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,960
Let's go.

316
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
Keqin,

317
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,560
don't forget to send me the photos.

318
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,960
Pass it on now,

319
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,840
pass it on now,

320
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,840
I'll send it to you as soon as possible.

321
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,480
Send photos.

322
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,080
Send photos.

323
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,120
Be careful.

324
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,280
Where is your home?

325
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,280
On the way.

326
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
On the way.

327
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,280
On the way.

328
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
It's past ten o'clock,

329
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,680
and you didn't reply to my WeChat message,

330
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
He didn't answer the call.

331
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
Chengcheng is so big now,

332
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,560
don't worry about it.

333
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,400
Okay,

334
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,360
You can do the math there.

335
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
If I think about it,

336
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,760
I miss your lousy restaurant,

337
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,040
Boss Bai doesn't care anymore,

338
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640
what do you care?

339
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,600
Can we not care?

340
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,120
Cut out all the steel bendss of our wall brick.

341
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,840
You don't have enough 300 thousand

342
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,680
to worry about it.

343
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,000
Do you think

344
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,520
Chengcheng is in love?

345
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,520
Falling in love,

346
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,520
With whom?

347
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,120
Who was that?

348
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
The child is old.

349
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
Don't worry about it.

350
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,000
Who told me that?

351
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,800
Can you be more careful?

352
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,960
Look at the time.

353
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,320
The kid went out.

354
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,400
What if you get taken advantage of

355
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,000
when you're with someone who's not good or bad?

356
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,320
Are you still happy?

357
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,000
What about you? You

358
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,200
haven't called yet,

359
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,280
That's right.

360
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,000
Make a call.

361
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,200
Yes.

362
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,280
She,

363
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,480
Turn off the phone.

364
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,360
This kid

365
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
is so annoying. I … I … I …

366
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,120
I … I'm flustered.

367
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,560
Do you think something happened to her?

368
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,840
What could have happened?

369
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,120
Don't worry. It's okay.

370
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,080
Wait a minute.

371
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,200
I'll be back soon.

372
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Don't worry.

373
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,040
Let me have a look.

374
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,240
This kid is too worried. If you say no,

375
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
give him another one.

376
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,040
amiable

377
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
Where is the phone charger

378
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,280
amiable,

379
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
No one is here.

380
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,080
Hotel.

381
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,920
Why am I here?

382
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,920
Weren't you with Keqin yesterday?

383
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,640
Oh my god.

384
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,240
Who's wearing

385
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,480
a bathrobe?

386
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,160
Oh, my God.

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,800
Run back.

388
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,080
Oh, no.

389
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
What should I do?

390
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,560
I've prepared breakfast for you.

391
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,160
Let's eat.

392
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,120
You don't have to look at me like that.

393
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,240
Don't worry.

394
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,360
You drank too much last night and threw up all over.

395
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,160
I asked the lady in the hotel to change your clothes.

396
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,080
I've washed it for you.

397
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,280
Sit down

398
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,960
Many oranges,

399
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,880
I said,

400
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
Your wine is really good.

401
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Don't go!

402
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,240
Drink.

403
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm really sorry.

404
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,920
Sorry for the trouble.

405
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,000
That video,

406
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,840
can you

407
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,400
delete it?

408
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,480
Have breakfast first.

409
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,920
What's wrong with you?

410
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,480
What did the girl who drank with you

411
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,520
do yesterday?

412
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,200
You mean amiable?

413
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,040
Entertainment Records,

414
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,360
lots of oranges.

415
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,080
I really don't know what's going on.

416
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,440
I'm really going crazy.

417
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,200
Send photos.

418
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,680
Good timing.

419
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,000
I was just looking for you.

420
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,640
You did a good job this time.

421
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,040
Thank you, Shan.

422
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,840
Looks like you listened to

423
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,880
what I said yesterday.

424
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm curious,

425
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,560
how did you get

426
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,880
these photos?

427
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,520
Shan,

428
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,280
I have a request.

429
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,400
Tell me,

430
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,960
this picture of Jiang Nan and this girl,

431
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,680
Can you withdraw it?

432
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,920
Didn't you send me these photos?

433
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,640
I mean,

434
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,680
these photos I took.

435
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
After all, it's his privacy.

436
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,880
What do you think the truth is?

437
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Do you chase people's privacy blog every day?

438
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,200
The girl who had an affair with Jiang Nan

439
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
is your friend, right?

440
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
Yes.

441
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,640
No wonder.

442
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm telling you,

443
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,360
I'll dig deeper into this matter.

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,280
Now that your friend is involved,

445
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,680
I can't guarantee if it will be exposed to radiation.

446
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,800
But as a part of the truth,

447
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,560
I want you to separate your work from your personal life.

448
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,720
Shan,

449
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,920
if you can do it, just do it.

450
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,280
You can't do it. Get out of here as soon as possible.

451
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,080
Sis,

452
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,520
Why are you here again?

453
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,440
Sis,

454
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,720
Work is work.

455
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,760
If you're so angry, you'll get wrinkles.

456
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,600
Don't be so glib with me.

457
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,320
Let me tell you,

458
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,200
or you can come in and work hard.

459
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,440
Or don't keep coming to me.

460
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,320
Make trouble for me.

461
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,640
Look at what you said.

462
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,840
I was abroad before,

463
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,680
I miss you every day

464
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,640
when I can't see my cousin,

465
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,920
Now you're back.

466
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,280
You must come more often.

467
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,840
What's wrong with you?

468
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,760
Tell me the truth.

469
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,360
Sis,

470
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,960
Do you remember when I was in high school,

471
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,640
I told you there was a goddess I had a crush on?

472
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
It's Yu Keqin

473
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,160
Sis,

474
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,760
You're like the reincarnation of a matchmaker,

475
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
who descends from the mortal realm,

476
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,400
Sis,

477
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,600
Thank you for bringing Keqin to me.

478
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,720
Do you think this is fate?

479
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
You brat.

480
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,760
Don't you miss me every day?

481
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,360
You spent a lot of time looking for someone amiable, didn't you?

482
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,440
Sis,

483
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,960
I'm warning you,

484
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,560
don't delay the work here.

485
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,560
I promise.

486
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,880
I promise it won't be delayed.

487
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,800
Also,

488
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,600
don't expect me to protect her because of you.

489
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,840
Understood.

490
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,200
Don't be angry, sister.

491
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,200
What is it?

492
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,960
Don't be mad at me.

493
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,760
Hello Mom,

494
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,080
where did you go last night?

495
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,520
I slept directly at Ke's in-laws'house yesterday.

496
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,080
I just saw your phone this morning.

497
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
You didn't even tell me.

498
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
It's so worrying.

499
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,280
I got it.

500
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,960
In the future,

501
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,480
if I don't go home at night,

502
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,360
I'll report it to you and Dad

503
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,720
in advance. I'll hang up now.

504
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,160
Yu Keqin,

505
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
actually gave me to a man when I was drunk.

506
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,680
Yu Keqin,

507
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,480
what happened to the photo of Jiang Nan and me?

508
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,080
Did you feed your sisterhood to the dog?

509
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,240
Its operating income in the first half of the year

510
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,480
increased by 20 points,

511
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,080
Good job, everyone.

512
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,680
But profitability

513
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,720
is not the only indicator of Kang Lin,

514
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,840
Recently, the purchasing department has added a new group of suppliers,

515
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
and I want to repeat it here,

516
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,000
When we make medical devices,

517
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,720
the red line and the dead line are safety and hygiene,

518
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,680
What do you know about

519
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,760
this group of new suppliers, Mr. Zhan?

520
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
Mr. Zhan has told me

521
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,240
to get a summary of all the suppliers

522
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,360
in the new cooperation,

523
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,240
Mr. Zhan has to go through the objectives one by one.

524
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
That's all for today's meeting.

525
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,520
Go back to your work.

526
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,440
You,

527
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,520
Wait.

528
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,760
Put your phone down!

529
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,640
It's been almost three years since you joined the company,

530
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
and you haven't done anything serious.

531
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,160
Whose time do you think you're wasting?

532
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Your own.

533
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,200
When I was your age,

534
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,000
Kang Lin has been established.

535
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,160
Don't mention Kang Lin.

536
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,640
If it weren't for my mom,

537
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
would you be able to do it?

538
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,640
You.

539
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,840
You let me in, Kang Lin.

540
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm in.

541
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,800
Then what should I do?

542
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,560
What should I do?

543
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
Whatever I like.

544
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,560
Why do you think so?

545
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,760
Just because half of this company was left to me

546
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,840
by my mom,

547
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm still the chairman of Kang Lin.

548
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,720
I can keep it if I want.

549
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,040
If I want to destroy it, I'll destroy it.

550
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

551
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,840
Mr. Liang,

552
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,320
have a seat.

553
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,960
Relax.

554
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,440
Kiki, I have to thank you.

555
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
Jiang Nan is such a big piece of material.

556
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,680
It's good.

557
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,080
You've lived up to my ardent hope for you.

558
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,000
But what are you going to do

559
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,320
in the future?

560
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,720
Here's the thing, Mr. Liang,

561
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
because of the photo of that girl and Jiang Nan,

562
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,160
It was taken by a colleague of mine,

563
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,400
but I heard from Qin Shan that,

564
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,840
She will continue to dig deeper.

565
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,600
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on this matter?

566
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,600
Why didn't you find out?

567
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,640
Well,

568
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,680
I've been following other cases,

569
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,560
All right,

570
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,880
all right. The news has been exposed.

571
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,760
That's it.

572
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,600
You know I don't like Jiang Nan all the time,

573
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,720
can you find a chance to get involved?

574
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,720
Do something for me.

575
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,600
I know what you mean.

576
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,160
However,

577
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,640
Qin Shan has been

578
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,160
in charge of this case.

579
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,880
My power is limited,

580
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,160
and if I get involved now,

581
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,120
It will be a little difficult.

582
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,040
But I can keep you informed.

583
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,160
You know I never raise idle people,

584
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
so I choose you.

585
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,040
I just took a fancy to the truth,

586
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,600
its influence in this industry,

587
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,200
If you can't do anything about it,

588
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,160
I'll think about it.

589
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,600
Do you continue to use you?

590
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,800
Mr. Liang,

591
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,120
I'll find a way to get involved in Jiang Nan's project.

592
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,320
I won't let you down next time.

593
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,920
I'm telling you,

594
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
I'm number one,

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,840
Cut the crap.

596
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,920
Second,

597
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,400
Don't listen to nonsense.

598
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,320
About what's not in the photo,

599
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,520
you're worrying too much.

600
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,280
Don't worry.

601
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,080
No,

602
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,680
put it down!

603
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,640
After such a big accident,

604
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,160
why aren't you in a hurry?

605
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,600
Then I'll be anxious with you.

606
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,000
You can withdraw from the hot searches.

607
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Well, can we help you figure out a way?

608
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,920
With these photos suddenly exposed,

609
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,360
how am I supposed to end it?

610
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
Didn't you tell me that

611
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,360
you really like the pleasure of being on the hot searches?

612
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,280
I do like hot searches,

613
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,840
but we have to have a degree.

614
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,720
Come on, tell me

615
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,640
what this is. This is

616
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,360
a statement,

617
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,240
-Explain it. -No,

618
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,120
bro,

619
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,320
About your experience,

620
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
I need someone to believe me even if I make a statement.

621
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,960
Then I won't post it.

622
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,960
Admit it then.

623
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,520
The two events are about to be signed.

624
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,120
After what happened and getting cold,

625
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
we just got a little better,

626
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,040
I planted it on this kind of gossip.

627
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
It's really not worth it.

628
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,600
What are you going to do with Auntie?

629
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Now that you know you're worried,

630
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,600
sit down.

631
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,520
Say it.

632
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,880
Forget it,

633
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,480
One more thing is better than one less thing.

634
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,920
Rui,

635
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,040
go ahead.

636
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,000
Instead of being riddled with holes,

637
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,720
it's better to hit them with one blow.

638
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,600
What do you mean?

639
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,840
I think it's time for you to fall in love.

640
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,120
You and a lot of oranges can really give it a try.

641
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
You've been single for so long,

642
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,680
unmarried and unmarried,

643
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,520
Maybe a lot of oranges

644
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,920
are really the one for you?

645
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,360
Other agents

646
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,800
stop artists from falling in love,

647
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,520
But you arranged

648
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,200
a blind date game for me,

649
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Stop it!

650
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm serious.

651
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,040
Tell you what, has Gu Jiayi

652
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,560
always been obsessed with you?

653
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,280
What does she have to do with me?

654
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
Of course it does.

655
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
Look at the hot searches you were on yesterday,

656
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
either it's related to Gu Jiayi.

657
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,320
Or you're having an affair with a female fan,

658
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,400
scheming guy,

659
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,200
All of this proves that

660
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Gu Jiayi wants to get back together with you,

661
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,360
As long as you're with a lot of oranges,

662
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,160
she'll naturally give up, right?

663
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,080
But between me and many oranges,

664
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,520
it's really nothing.

665
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,360
Is that a problem?

666
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,000
Feelings can be cultivated slowly.

667
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,800
You cultivate a little bit and I cultivate a little bit.

668
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,000
Don't you just take your time?

669
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Okay,

670
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,040
let's not talk about dating for now,

671
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,200
As a friend,

672
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,520
can you do me a favor and pretend to be your girlfriend?

673
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,840
We just want to get rid of Gu Jiayi's trap,

674
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,040
and leave the rest to me.

675
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,600
Okay?

676
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,360
Jiang,

677
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,760
we really can't be willful anymore.

678
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,840
As long as we get rid of Gu Jiayi's trap

679
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,800
and say goodbye to those gossips,

680
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,720
We can start our business in a down-to-earth manner,

681
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,200
which is the best way for now.

682
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,120
You.

683
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,280
Think about it.

684
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,480
It's me.

685
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,640
It's you.

686
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,280
Well,

687
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,920
There's no one in this bookstore. Are you sure

688
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
you want to wrap it up like this?

689
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,800
We just finished the hot searches.

690
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,720
Don't be careful,

691
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,240
Sorry,

692
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,280
we were all drunk yesterday,

693
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,840
I'll ask Keqin about it,

694
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,120
and find a way to make her

695
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,080
Stop,

696
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,920
I came to see you today.

697
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,720
I'm not here to punish you.

698
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,400
Well,

699
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,880
we are friends in need now.

700
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,440
Right?

701
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,040
Yes.

702
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,720
What if there's anything I need your help with?

703
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,960
Are you willing to help?

704
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,680
Yes

705
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,440
The hot searches.

706
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,360
Although it's your friend's responsibility,

707
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,080
aren't you a little bit jointly and severally liable?

708
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,680
Yes,

709
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,880
Now,

710
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,000
I have a solution,

711
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,640
I need your cooperation.

712
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,640
-Cooperate. -I'll cooperate. What

713
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,640
do you need me to do?

714
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,160
Be my girlfriend,

715
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,680
Okay.

716
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,200
What are you doing?

717
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,960
Girlfriend,

718
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,560
Girlfriend.

719
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Well,

720
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,320
we haven't seen each other for a few times,

721
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,320
You're not familiar with me either,

722
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,280
isn't it too soon?

723
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,000
Besides,

724
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,520
I haven't been in a relationship yet.

725
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,960
First love begins like this.

726
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,199
Isn't it a little too casual?

727
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,280
That's enough.

728
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,840
You're overthinking.

729
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,920
I'm asking you to pretend to be my girlfriend.

730
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,880
Show it to Gu Jiayi.

731
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
It's not true.

732
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,800
You want me to pretend,

733
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,800
You agreed?

734
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,480
No way.

735
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,440
What?

736
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,240
-Hello, Miss Xu. -Hello,

737
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,080
Miss Xu.

738
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm Jiang Nan's agent, Bao Rui.

739
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
You can call me by my nickname,

740
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,200
Mr. Bao,

741
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,360
where's Jiang?

742
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
But his face is a bit smelly,

743
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,160
but he's easy to get along with,

744
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,640
What about you?

745
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,880
Just think about it

746
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,000
and promise him.

747
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,200
Well, I know

748
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,520
it's really my responsibility.

749
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
But this is too sudden.

750
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,000
I don't think I can do it well.

751
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,200
It will also bring trouble to God Nan.

752
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,400
And my parents won't agree.

753
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,240
Personally,

754
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,040
I told you your idea wasn't reliable.

755
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm leaving.

756
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,200
Miss,

757
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,320
let me add you on WeChat. Let's go.

758
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,520
Miss, my WeChat number

759
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,520
includes all the pinyin of Lord Bao in lowercase.
