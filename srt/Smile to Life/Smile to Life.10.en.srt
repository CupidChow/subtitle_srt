1
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,480
Many oranges.

2
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,440
Many oranges.

3
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,520
Many oranges,

4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,440
are you okay?

5
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,840
Many oranges,

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
I'll go in if you don't say anything.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,640
No way.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,920
Well,

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,120
can you

10
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,240
buy something for me?

11
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
What should I buy?

12
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,520
It's that thing.

13
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,400
Sir,

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
how can I help you?

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,000
It's okay.

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,440
I'm just looking around.

17
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,080
You must be buying sanitary pads for your girlfriend.

18
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,360
There's nothing to be shy about.

19
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,680
Which brand do you want?

20
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,440
I forgot, too.

21
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Do you have any recommendations?

22
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,600
I recommend this one.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,920
Ultra-thin instant suction,

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,640
and.

25
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
All right,

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
one for each of you.

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,960
Thank you.

28
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,720
You weren't recognized just now, were you?

29
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,880
What do you think?

30
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,480
I'm sorry

31
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
to have troubled you.

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,640
Hey,

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,680
Where are we now?

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,080
We'll be there soon.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
I have something to do here.

36
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,480
I'm not going there.

37
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,520
Think of a way to round it up.

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
It's such a big deal,

39
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,320
why didn't you come?

40
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,840
All right, stop it.

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,520
I'll hang up now.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,040
Hello.

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,160
I'm so pissed off.

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,680
Did I delay your business?

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,280
It's okay.

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,440
Just lie down

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
and sleep for a while,

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,960
Call me when you wake up.

49
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,760
I haven't seen Tingting for a long time.

50
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,760
You're really a man as his name suggests.

51
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,200
She's already a pretty girl.

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,800
Uncle Zhan, you flatter me.

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,480
Uncle is telling the truth.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Shy.

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,720
If you're with Lin,

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,280
that would be great.

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
Zhilin will be here soon, right?

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm on my way.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,200
No more waiting,

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,080
Let's eat first.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Sorry for being late.

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,760
Sit down.

63
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,160
Well

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,080
Zhilin's friend,

65
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,080
I'd like to introduce to you,

66
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,600
This is my girlfriend,

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,720
a model car,

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
Lin Zhi, who we met at last week's auto show,

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,000
is a very talented person,

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Looks like a lot of girls like him.

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,720
I have something else to do.

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
We'll get going then.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:06,840
Let me see you off.

74
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
It's the first time

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,200
Lin brought a girl back,

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
You should be familiar with your children. It's important

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,000
to get familiar with their business.

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't you know what the occasion is today?

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,000
Why did your dad talk like that

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,720
when he came back with a woman of no three and no four?

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,360
Honey,

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,280
you go back first,

83
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,320
I'll see you later.

84
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,320
how

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,120
Isn't it enough to arrange academic work for me?

86
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
now

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
You want to interfere in my marriage?

88
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,640
What's wrong with Tingting?

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,640
You have to have a family background,

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,840
a degree, a degree,

91
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,120
What's not good enough for you?

92
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,120
If you say it so well,

93
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,120
you can marry him,

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,280
Anyway, after my mom has been gone for so many years,

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
there's no room for you.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,560
At this point, I have nothing to say.

97
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,640
Of course you have nothing to say.

98
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,040
Don't you think I don't know,

99
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,960
where has your heart been all these years?

100
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,960
Have you considered my feelings?

101
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
If it weren't for Zhilin,

102
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,840
don't mention Zhilin to me.

103
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,080
It's noisy. It's noisy

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,560
all day.

105
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,720
Mom,

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,880
Mom,

107
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,760
Shuqian,

108
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,480
I'll call an ambulance.

109
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Mom.

110
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,120
Have some water.

111
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,640
Thank you.

112
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,600
Don't move.

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Does it still hurt?

114
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
I feel much better.

115
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,480
Let me make you something to eat.

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,520
What can you do?

117
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,200
Me.

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,240
Jiang Nan, it's me.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,960
If you don't open the door,

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,520
So I kept waiting.

121
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,040
It's late.

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,080
Who is it?

123
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Bao Rui,

124
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,680
by the way, Orange,

125
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Are you still in pain?

126
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
It doesn't hurt anymore.

127
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,160
Go upstairs and have a rest.

128
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Get some sleep.

129
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
I've been sleeping for a long time.

130
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,400
Listen to me.

131
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,240
Go upstairs.

132
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,520
Go upstairs.

133
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,360
What are you doing here?

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,800
Don't you need to shoot recently?

135
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm on vacation.

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,880
Why are you here?

137
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,800
I know you sent that photo today,

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
just to get rid of me,

139
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
He told me to give up.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
But the more you do this,

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,440
won't it only prove that you still have me in your heart?

142
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,520
Let's get back together, okay?

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
I really love you.

144
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,400
You think too much.

145
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,920
Please go back.

146
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,960
Gu Jiayi.

147
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
There's no relationship

148
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,360
between us anymore.

149
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,120
Please leave.

150
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
You don't live with her, do you?

151
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,720
You can't like many oranges,

152
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
you're not from the same world as her,

153
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,960
Why can't you give me another chance?

154
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,040
The relationship between us,

155
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
since the day you left,

156
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,840
It has been completely broken.

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,160
You still hate me?

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,600
But doesn't this

159
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
only prove that you still have love in your heart?

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,360
Liang Zhe and I are over now.

161
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
I don't need to be pushed around by him anymore.

162
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,920
You've got what you want.

163
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,360
What else do you want?

164
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,680
Yes

165
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
I've got everything I wanted.

166
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,560
But I have no space here.

167
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,200
This position

168
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,040
has always been reserved for you.

169
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,960
I can help you become famous.

170
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll get you a chance.

171
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,400
Isn't it good for you

172
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
to sing like before?

173
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,760
I really can't see you clearly.

174
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,120
I already have a girlfriend.

175
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
If there's nothing else, just leave.

176
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
What do you like about her?

177
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,960
As long as you say it and make me give up,

178
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,440
Okay,

179
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
What many oranges want

180
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
is just a simple life,

181
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,160
She just wants to live a good life every day.

182
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
She never pursues fame and gain,

183
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,520
nor covets money.

184
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,200
She treats every friend

185
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,440
around her sincerely,

186
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
I've never used anyone.

187
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,160
She's simple,

188
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,360
innocent,

189
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,000
She is such an ordinary girl,

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,960
which makes me feel excited again and again.

191
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,040
Aren't you

192
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,520
talking about me back then?

193
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
She's different from you.

194
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,920
Jiayi,

195
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
you're a popular artist now,

196
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,640
It's hard for me to come to see Jiang

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
in the middle of the night.

198
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,760
Jiang Nan,

199
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I missed you before,

200
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,680
It's my regret all the time.

201
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,160
From now on,

202
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
I won't miss you again.

203
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
You're not going to the appointment tonight?

204
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,600
Because of Gu Jiayi?

205
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,600
No.

206
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,400
When she first

207
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,560
came to dinner,

208
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
Many oranges are having their period.

209
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,200
She has a terrible stomachache.

210
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,320
What about her now?

211
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Upstairs.

212
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,880
Didn't she hear you?

213
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,880
She didn't hear me, did she?

214
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,840
Ancestor,

215
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,840
Eat,

216
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,760
Didn't you say you were worthy of me?

217
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,800
He stood me up.

218
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
I have to bring you a midnight snack.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Thank you for your old mother's heart.

220
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,360
All right?

221
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Why haven't I seen you all day?

222
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,000
You two are making such rapid progress.

223
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
Stop gossiping with me.

224
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,600
You're not here to bring me food, are you?

225
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,760
Of course not.

226
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,760
I thought we were going to talk about your cross-border acting

227
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,160
with producer Chen Dong tonight.

228
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
But you didn't go.

229
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,280
Luckily, I was quick-witted,

230
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,440
and got it over with.

231
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,040
However,

232
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,760
they're interested in our "Coke Chicken Wings"

233
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,960
I appreciate it.

234
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,360
And asked him to use this song

235
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,640
as the theme song for their next project.

236
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,760
And asked us to go to Jingcheng next week

237
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
to shoot the MV,

238
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,360
I want you to be the leading actor.

239
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,040
Really?

240
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,360
That's great.

241
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,080
How fresh?

242
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
Don't you see who's going to do it.

243
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,440
But now I think,

244
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,160
a lot of oranges might be your inspiration.

245
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,240
If I had known Orange was so charming,

246
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,000
I should have found her out

247
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
in the crowd.

248
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,760
Wait.

249
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Where did you say we were going?

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Jingcheng,

251
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,560
is there a problem?

252
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,840
No problem.

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,760
Many Cheng told her bestie before that she was going to travel,

254
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,240
and she was also talking about Jingcheng,

255
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,080
Isn't that great?

256
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,880
Is she going?

257
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,360
I'll go.

258
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
There you are.

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,720
You've always been there.

260
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,400
Mr. Bao,

261
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,440
what do I need to do when I go there?

262
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,680
Here's the thing.

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,520
Orange,

264
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,040
Look,

265
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,680
Since you came to our studio,

266
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,040
I haven't given you any work.

267
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,680
This time, Jiang's new song is going to be a MV,

268
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,360
can you be his personal assistant?

269
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,520
What do you mean by personal assistant?

270
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,040
No problem.

271
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Overtime pay,

272
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,040
it's up to you.

273
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,480
Thank you, Mr. Bao.

274
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,000
You're welcome.

275
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,280
What's going on?

276
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,920
Did she hear that?

277
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,160
What did you hear?

278
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,800
She just wants to live a good life every day.

279
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,280
She's simple,

280
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,440
innocent,

281
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,120
She is such an ordinary girl,

282
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,040
which makes me feel excited again and again.

283
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
Isn't this Gu Jiayi's car?

284
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,920
Why did she come here?

285
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,440
Did she find my mom?

286
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,040
Let's go!

287
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,080
Aunt,

288
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
I haven't come to see you for a long time.

289
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Do you still remember me?

290
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,720
Who are you?

291
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm Gu Jiayi,

292
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,600
Jiang Nan's girlfriend,

293
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Jiang Nan,

294
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,280
I don't know him.

295
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,440
Auntie.

296
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,320
Don't you even remember Jiang Nan?

297
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,120
Are you his girlfriend?

298
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,880
What's wrong, Auntie?

299
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,640
Auntie, stop hitting me.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,560
Caiyun,

301
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,520
stop fighting!

302
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,360
Caiyun, stop fighting. Caiyun.

303
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,640
Caiyun,

304
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,960
Jiang Hai,

305
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,000
Who is she?

306
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
What's your relationship with her?

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,440
Why did she say she's your girlfriend?

308
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,600
Caiyun, calm down. Caiyun,

309
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,720
calm down.

310
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,720
I have nothing to do with her.

311
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,280
She's talking nonsense.

312
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,960
Don't believe me.

313
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,120
No, it's okay.

314
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,080
Bad girl. You seduced my husband.

315
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,520
Seduce my husband.

316
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,040
Caiyun,

317
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,600
you seduced my husband. Caiyun

318
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,760
rolled out.

319
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Get out of here. I don't want to see you again.

320
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Caiyun,

321
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,400
don't be angry.

322
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
Throw them all out!

323
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Throw them all out!

324
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,600
I don't want to see these. Take them out.

325
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,920
Gu Jiayi.

326
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,200
I'm warning you,

327
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,480
my mom is a patient.

328
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,440
If anything happens to her because of you,

329
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,040
I won't let you go.

330
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,160
I just want to visit Auntie.

331
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,320
It's okay now.

332
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,079
Many oranges,

333
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,720
it's good to have you.

334
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,080
Dr. Sui,

335
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,720
this is the electromyography for reexamination.

336
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,640
Have a look.

337
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,040
How are you feeling recently?

338
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Recently, I've been holding chopsticks unsteadily.

339
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,880
When I tied my hair this morning,

340
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,440
my hands were a little weak.

341
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,760
Also,

342
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,400
the other day when I was walking,

343
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
My legs suddenly became weak

344
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
and I almost fell down.

345
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,080
Please come in.

346
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,640
What are you doing here?

347
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,360
I'm here especially for you.

348
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,160
We do medical equipment,

349
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,840
and Dr. Sui said you had an appointment for a check-up,

350
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,760
Let me have a look.

351
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,040
How can I help you?

352
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,200
No, thanks.

353
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,320
Let's be friends.

354
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
I know everything.

355
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,880
You'd better come and have a look.

356
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,200
Actually, I suggest you

357
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,280
try more treatments,

358
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,560
Try more treatments,

359
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,440
Zhilin Zhan has been my friend for many years,

360
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Kang Lin is also a long-term partner of our hospital.

361
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,560
will provide us with some medical equipment,

362
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,680
like electromagnetic pulse infrared physiotherapy instrument or something,

363
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
It's very helpful to your condition.

364
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,360
Aren't these instruments expensive?

365
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,440
You don't have to worry about that.

366
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
Many oranges,

367
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,200
according to your electromyography,

368
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,360
You have obvious neuronal damage now.

369
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,280
It's okay.

370
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,760
I'm mentally prepared.

371
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,600
Do you insist on not telling your family?

372
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,160
As long as you can.

373
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,800
If you insist on doing so,

374
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,920
you will be under great financial pressure.

375
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Because besides Liruzole,

376
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm going to give you an edaravone injection today,

377
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,040
It's very important to delay your illness.

378
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,240
But now

379
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
you don't have a family to take care of you,

380
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
You must pay attention to safety in your daily life.

381
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,640
Because now you have muscle twitches

382
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,600
from time to time,

383
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,880
The symptoms of muscle weakness.

384
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,920
If you were in a special environment,

385
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,280
like crossing the street and pouring water,

386
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,720
It's easy to cause danger.

387
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
I got it.

388
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,000
By the way, Dr. Sui,

389
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,760
how is Doudou's condition?

390
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
His condition is not promising.

391
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,200
But he's strong.

392
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,240
Let me play a piano game with you.

393
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,480
Don't you think

394
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,840
you care too much about many oranges?

395
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
I just feel sorry for her.

396
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,600
If you don't mean it,

397
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
you'd better stay away from her.

398
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,920
She can't

399
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,840
take too much damage.

400
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,800
Who do you think I am?

401
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,600
I just think,

402
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,600
at such a good age,

403
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
It's a pity to have

404
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,120
this kind of disease.

405
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,520
Does this look good?

406
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,160
Play by yourself first.

407
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,120
The physiotherapy instrument I ordered has arrived in Doudou

408
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,360
and I still don't know my condition.

409
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
Don't say it out loud.

410
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,720
Make an appointment

411
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,520
tomorrow. I'll bring it to you.

412
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,560
I'm going out of town.

413
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,360
I'm leaving tomorrow.

414
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,720
Well,

415
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
come home with me now.

416
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,080
Go get it.

417
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,640
Me,

418
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,880
Why are you so slow?

419
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
If you get it earlier

420
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,080
and get treatment earlier,

421
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,760
Got it?

422
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,960
Zhan Zhilin,

423
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,400
thank you.

424
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,960
It's really hard to bear the pain of illness alone,

425
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,880
thank you for always being there for me.

426
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,080
Your house is so big.

427
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,320
Apart from gold and jade,

428
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,520
it's just a waste.

429
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,840
What about me?

430
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
I specially picked a small one for you,

431
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,200
so it's easy to carry.

432
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,000
Take a look.

433
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,560
How can I use this?

434
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,280
Come here.

435
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,080
What do you think?

436
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
It feels sour and numb.

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,440
That's right.

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,320
It takes 15 minutes every day,

439
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,040
Hang in there.

440
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,160
What songs do you usually listen to?

441
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,040
I see you have a lot of CDs.

442
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,160
There are so many rock and roll discs.

443
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,320
Liang Shuqian,

444
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,800
listen to her songs too,

445
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,760
My dad really likes her.

446
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
I listen to it every day.

447
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
This is my mom.

448
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Liang Shuqian is your mother.

449
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,080
What a coincidence.

450
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,240
Where's my dad?

451
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,720
She said she was beautiful and sweet,

452
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,920
but I don't know why,

453
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
Then she stopped singing.

454
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,960
After my mom married my dad,

455
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,120
he stopped her from singing.

456
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,600
That's a pity.

457
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,400
You know,

458
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,720
you like music so much,

459
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,920
Is it hereditary?

460
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,600
Kind of.

461
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Where is my dad?

462
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,600
I'm not very interested in art.

463
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,280
If my mom hadn't

464
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,640
helped me change my college entrance examination,

465
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,040
I can't get into an art school at all.

466
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,480
It's impossible to know Jiang Nan or something,

467
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,320
not enough fun outside,

468
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,680
You even brought it home.

469
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,160
She's my friend.

470
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
You'd better

471
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,840
watch your mouth.

472
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,240
Your Uncle Liu hasn't died down yet,

473
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
go apologize to Tingting,

474
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,720
I won't be with Liu Ting.

475
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't need you to arrange my life.

476
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,720
Hanging out with those weird women all day,

477
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,080
it's a big deal in your life.

478
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,600
As long as you didn't arrange it,

479
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,040
I'll have a good time.

480
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,040
Then I'll be happy.

481
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
How about I show it to you?

482
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,560
Sorry,

483
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,520
I'm fine.

484
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,920
I didn't expect that

485
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,680
your family would be in such a situation,

486
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,240
That's my dad's temper.

487
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Don't be sad.

488
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,200
Let's listen to Auntie's song together.

489
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,840
I was so supportive of your music,

490
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,920
when 2BeOne broke up,

491
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,720
Didn't I persuade you not to disband?

492
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,720
Haven't you asked Jiang Nan?

493
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,800
I asked him,

494
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
but he wouldn't tell me.

495
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,640
Of course he's embarrassed to say it.

496
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,240
It's so early.

497
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,120
What's wrong?

498
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,840
Have a cup of coffee

499
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,600
to refresh yourself.

500
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,440
Yun talked to me

501
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,920
about the company's plans for our future,

502
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,840
She thinks,

503
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,360
if the two of us

504
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,640
are bound together again.

505
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,160
It's not conducive to the future development.

506
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
What do you mean?

507
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,920
Zhan Zhilin.

508
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,200
Let's disband.

509
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,520
We're very popular now,

510
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,160
but we're going to disband just because of Yun's words.

511
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't promise her.

512
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,760
Let's rehearse.

513
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,720
No need to line up.

514
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,880
I also think that when I'm with you,

515
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,200
I have too many limitations.

516
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,600
It's not conducive to future development.

517
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,800
Combined solo flight

518
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
is an inevitable trend.

519
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,680
Jiang Nan,

520
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,760
you think

521
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
I don't know how to write songs.

522
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,720
Am I dragging you down?

523
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,080
That's not what I meant.

524
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,320
We can develop separately.

525
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Let's go our separate ways.

526
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,040
You're the one who's creating 2beOne,

527
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,320
I don't know how to write songs.

528
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,840
How can I develop separately?

529
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,080
Back then,

530
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,400
in order to form this group,

531
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,840
How did my dad and I end up?

532
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,920
You know that.

533
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,040
You're the one who kept telling me,

534
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,760
we can definitely get ahead,

535
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,400
It's also because you told me

536
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,440
that we're one.

537
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,840
You also named 2beOne.

538
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,000
It means that

539
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,840
we can keep going together.

540
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,040
Have you forgotten all this?

541
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,960
I didn't forget.

542
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,400
But I don't want to go on.

543
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,640
Jiang Nan.

544
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
Just take it as I'm sorry.

545
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm leaving.

546
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
You mean,

547
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,640
Jiang Nan abandoned you for personal development,

548
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,120
I'd rather hope so.

549
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,480
Why do you say that?

550
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
The day after the group disbanded,

551
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,480
my mom went to see Jiang Nan.

552
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,920
But he jumped off the building

553
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
and committed suicide after he came back.

554
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,640
I want to ask Jiang Nan about it.

555
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,080
But when I saw him with my dad,

556
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,000
you hid it from Uncle Zhan Zhilin

557
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,600
for me. Thank you.

558
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,560
Take

559
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,000
this card.

560
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,000
You mean,

561
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,080
Jiang Nan is involved in aunt's death.

562
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,080
Anyway,

563
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,440
my dad drove my mom to death,

564
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,680
Jiang Nan knew all this,

565
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,040
but he didn't tell me anything.

566
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,640
If he's willing to talk to me,

567
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,160
maybe I'll have a chance to save my mom.

568
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,720
Maybe my mom wouldn't have died.

569
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,960
Tell me,

570
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
why did my mom

571
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,720
die,

572
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,680
She's willing to go to Jiang Nan.

573
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You didn't even come to me.

574
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,680
Although I don't know

575
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,120
why I can't bear it

576
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,000
and chose to commit suicide.

577
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,320
But as a dying person,

578
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,920
you can compare your heart to your heart,

579
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,520
It's because I love you so much.

580
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,200
That's why I chose not to say a word about you.

581
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,880
Many oranges,

582
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,080
don't say that.

583
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,280
It's nothing.

584
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,760
I'm just being honest.

585
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,440
You know what?

586
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,240
In fact, death is not terrible,

587
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
but what is terrible is that,

588
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,760
It will cut off the connection

589
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
between you and the one you love.

590
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,160
When I think about it,

591
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,960
I don't know what to do.

592
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,800
Many oranges,

593
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,480
I really don't think Jiang Nan is good enough for you.

594
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,960
Zhan Zhilin,

595
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,560
I know.

596
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,400
You hate Jiang Nan for your own reasons,

597
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,480
but I always feel that in this matter,

598
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,600
There must be some misunderstanding.

599
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
I believe Jiang Nan is not that kind of person.

600
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,240
There's no misunderstanding.

601
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,520
You're his girlfriend now.

602
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,560
He must be talking to him.

603
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,920
We need to find a chance to ask Jiang Nan.

604
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,440
There must be a misunderstanding.

605
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,360
Hey, Orange,

606
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,360
you're going to shoot MV with Jiang Nan.

607
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,920
You got the news so fast.

608
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,920
After I entered the studio,

609
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,720
Mr. Bao arranged a job for me for the first time,

610
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,240
What kind of work is this?

611
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,360
This is welfare, okay?

612
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,560
If I hadn't been hurt,

613
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,640
I would have taken a vacation to travel.

614
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,720
I still don't know how the MV was filmed?

615
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,400
I've never been to the scene.

616
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm quite curious.

617
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,160
Yeah.

618
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,600
You're so lucky.

619
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,600
I'm telling you,

620
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,160
you have to seize the opportunity.

621
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Maybe when you come back from this trip,

622
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,960
there will be a qualitative change between you two.

623
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,600
Don't push me.

624
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,600
Don't you know that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment?

625
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,960
All right,

626
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,840
I won't talk to you anymore.

627
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,800
I have to pack up.

628
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,320
Bye.

629
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,160
What's wrong with you?

630
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,400
Did you eat that?

631
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,800
Have you forgotten?

632
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,960
I had dinner

633
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,920
with someone tonight.

634
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,800
Yes.

635
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Clean it up early.

636
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,760
We're leaving for Jingcheng tomorrow morning.

637
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
It must be hard

638
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,240
to drive there all the way.

639
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,520
By the way,

640
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,760
we're going on a business trip for a few days,

641
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,040
I'm afraid Auntie will miss us.

642
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,800
So I went to the nursing home today.

643
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,840
And I also greeted the nurses there.

644
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,400
Also,

645
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,200
the schedule for tomorrow is out.

646
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,440
Nothing special.

647
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,120
I don't need your company.

648
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,280
You can take a day off.

649
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,640
You can make your own arrangements tomorrow.

650
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,680
Really?

651
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,880
That's great, Goddess Nan.

652
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,360
I love you so much.

653
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,000
What did you say?

654
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,160
I said,

655
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,200
I'll help you pick up the things on the floor.

656
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,560
All right?

657
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,880
I'll do it myself.

658
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,280
Who are these for?

659
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,520
I bought it for Doudou.

660
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,520
Are you sure you don't need me for today's schedule?

661
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,560
I don't need

662
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,280
you,

663
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,160
Keep an eye on your phone. Keep in touch

664
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
if you need anything.

665
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,880
If you're tired,

666
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,920
ask Du to pick you up.

667
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,760
No, thanks.

668
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,080
Du has been driving for a whole day,

669
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,080
and it's been hard enough.

670
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,360
I won't trouble you.

671
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,240
Well, well,

672
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,760
if you keep nagging,

673
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,920
So I canceled your welfare leave.

674
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,960
A man of honor cannot be recalled by his word.

675
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,560
Goodbye.

676
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,280
Brother,

677
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
We can't stop here for too long.

678
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,440
Let's go.

679
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,560
When we meet for the first time,

680
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,160
you may not know me,

681
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,280
What about me?

682
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,160
He's not demanding,

683
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,240
and he's gentle with people.

684
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,200
but

685
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,880
You can't give the light straight.

686
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,240
I want layers.

687
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,760
I want you to give me warm light in the cold light.

688
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
There's a cold light in the warm light.

689
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,760
Do you have an umbrella?

690
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,920
This kind of beauty is suffocating.

691
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm suffocating.

692
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Can you do it?

693
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,360
Jiang Nan

694
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,200
just arrived today,

695
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,240
Go get some rest.

696
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,880
No, thanks.

697
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Let's talk about my part first.

698
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,880
Okay,

699
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,680
This is the work school,

700
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,920
our MV is mainly about pictures with lyrics,

701
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,080
A beautiful girl who plays the piano,

702
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
and fond memories of Mr. Jiang Nan.

703
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,320
Brother,

704
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,640
Brother,

705
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,480
There's news that Jiang Nan went to Jingcheng to shoot MV,

706
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,880
Jingcheng,

707
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,480
I'm going out of town.

708
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,600
I'm leaving tomorrow.

709
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,000
I see.

710
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:34,960
Got it.

711
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,880
Then let's

712
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,920
No rush

713
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,040
Let those two

714
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,600
know about this first,

715
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,560
Less rain,

716
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,360
less rain,

717
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
Lower the rain,

718
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,080
stop the rain,

719
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,520
Stop raining,

720
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280
stop raining,

721
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,360
Stop raining.

722
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm sorry, Director. Nan

723
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,480
might not be feeling well,

724
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm sorry.

725
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,480
Many oranges,

726
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,440
are you out of your mind because of the rain?

727
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,680
Why didn't you answer my call?

728
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,800
I dropped my phone in the lake.

729
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,000
If you drop your phone in the lake,

730
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,240
why don't you drop yourself in the lake too?

731
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,520
Don't you have work today?

732
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,760
If I don't come,

733
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,760
are you going to stay under the pavilion for a night?
