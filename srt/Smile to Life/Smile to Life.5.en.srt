1
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,560
We can't convince everyone that

2
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,600
we're really boyfriend and girlfriend.

3
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,360
Look,

4
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,320
it must be true.

5
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
Actually,

6
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,720
love is a matter between two people,

7
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,520
We really don't need to explain it to everyone.

8
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,480
Or prove something.

9
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
But now that

10
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,520
I have someone I like,

11
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
I also have someone who cares about me.

12
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,240
So I chose to announce my relationship publicly today.

13
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,440
I hope you can understand

14
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,120
and bless me.

15
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,720
I hope you can

16
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,320
give us some private space.

17
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Thank you, everyone.

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,240
You didn't talk at that time,

19
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
so someone has to come forward.

20
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,160
That's why

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,840
I didn't expect you to be so brave.

22
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,880
That was my first kiss.

23
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,320
Congratulations.

24
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
You look beautiful today.

25
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,280
It's for you.

26
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
Come at me if you need anything.

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,720
Don't involve anyone else.

29
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm here

30
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,160
for you today.

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Isn't this Zhan?

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,480
We haven't seen each other for centuries.

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,640
-Let's talk. -Let's go.

34
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,040
Let's go.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,640
What did Zhan Zhilin mean just now?

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,640
It's not interesting.

37
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,920
Seeing how silly you are

38
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,200
to bully you,

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
What happened between you two?

40
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
You were so close before,

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
but now

42
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,280
it has nothing to do with you.

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's go.

44
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
Go now.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
Wait for the reporters to stop you.

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,640
God Nan,

47
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,920
can you dream with me for a little longer?

48
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,480
That was my first kiss.

49
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,040
There's no problem with your hand shape.

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,960
But your wrist and shoulders are too stiff.

51
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
Put your hand on the teacher's shoulder and feel it.

52
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,800
Do you feel it?

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
But I always feel stiff when I play it.

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
My mom said I was too stupid

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,600
to learn.

56
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,840
How could it be?

57
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,920
As long as you practice hard every day,

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,520
you'll soon surpass the teacher.

59
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,600
Besides,

60
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
you are the teacher's first student.

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,920
What about your little progress every day?

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,520
The teacher will be very happy.

63
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,600
Let's do it again.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
Hello, babies,

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm here

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,360
at the most famous high-end musical instrument store in the city,

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,160
Do you want to see

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,040
what it looks like

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,320
when I try to play these millions of pianos?

70
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Come on, babies. Guess

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
who I saw?

72
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,880
Isn't this Gu Jiayi's ex-boyfriend Jiang Nan's

73
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,120
girlfriend Many Orange just made public?

74
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
Please don't disturb our class.

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,520
This musical instrument store is a business place.

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
I came in to check. What's wrong?

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
You can take pictures of me,

78
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,120
but please don't take pictures of my students.

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,000
I heard that you graduated from the Conservatory of Music,

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,200
so please don't interfere with my work.

81
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

82
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,240
look,

83
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,400
There's a handsome guy over there playing the guitar.

84
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,840
Do you want to see how handsome he is?

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,720
Hello,

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm broadcasting live now.

87
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,000
Can I take a picture of you playing?

88
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,040
Sure, no problem.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,800
Why is Zhan Zhilin

90
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,480
in many of Cheng's musical instruments?

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,360
You really care about her now.

92
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm not.

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,400
Besides,

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,880
she was harassed by so many people

95
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
because of me.

96
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
You have a conscience.

97
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Rui,

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,240
look for the livestreamers,

99
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,880
Tell them

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,080
not to harass many oranges again.

101
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,600
Okay,

102
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Where are you going?

103
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Are you going to pick her up?

104
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm crazy. I'm going to pick her up.

105
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,080
Where are you going?

106
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
I'm going to the nursing home.

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Is this how idol dramas are filmed now?

108
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,320
It's true.

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,920
Long time no see.

110
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Jiang Nan, what are you doing?

111
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
Let go of me!

112
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,880
Jiang Nan,

113
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
let go of me!

114
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,440
A lot of people watched the live broadcast just now,

115
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,640
and more and more people will come to trouble you.

116
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
Why should I care about them?

118
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,000
Many oranges,

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
don't forget our current relationship,

120
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
I know.

121
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,000
But I can't stop working

122
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,560
just because of this.

123
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
Quit your job now.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,040
I signed a contract with the manager.

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,240
I have to take responsibility.

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,600
You and me too.

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,640
You're my girlfriend now,

128
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
so you have to be responsible for me.

129
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,440
Can't you see he doesn't want to leave?

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,520
She's my girlfriend.

131
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,480
What does it have to do with you?

132
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,160
Treat girls with compassion.

133
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
Why do you have a crush on him?

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,320
I happen to

135
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,960
have a vacancy for my girlfriend,

136
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,880
Do you want to think about me?

137
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Zhan Zhilin,

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,000
are you done?

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,520
In front of a girl,

140
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,880
why are you so insecure?

141
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,200
That's right.

142
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,200
You are no longer

143
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,240
a popular singer, Jiang Nan.

144
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,920
Now you're just trying to attract attention

145
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
by speculating rumors.

146
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,600
How can you say that about Jiang Nan?

147
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,120
Don't be self-righteous.

148
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,160
Interesting.

149
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,480
Is it not enough to lend you 300 houses?

150
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,640
How much salary does the musical instrument store offer you in a month?

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,120
I borrowed 300 houses for emergency use.

152
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,280
I have to pay it back.

153
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,920
I'll return 300 thousand to Bao Rui.

154
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
You're teaching here?

155
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,480
When will you be able to save so much?

156
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,080
The most important thing for a man is to keep his word,

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,520
I borrowed the money.

158
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,040
Why should I ask you to give it back to him?

159
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,280
Besides,

160
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm just your nominal girlfriend,

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,000
In the contract we signed,

162
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,880
there is no restriction.

163
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm a teacher in a musical instrument store.

164
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
My students are waiting for me.

165
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,560
They are the flowers of the motherland,

166
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
the hope of the future,

167
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,040
A soul that needs to be fed.

168
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,280
Get me out of the car.

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Don't be

170
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,640
so glib with me,

171
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,080
Look at the car behind you.

172
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,040
It has been following us since we left the musical instrument store,

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
if you want them to know where your house is,

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
You can get off now.

175
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,080
Well,

176
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,480
Where are we going?

177
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,960
My house,

178
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,320
your house.

179
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, no.

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,880
I was so anxious that I forgot to ask for leave from my boss.

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
Will my job at the musical instrument store be ruined?

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,600
We still need to remedy it.

183
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
Dear boss,

184
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm really sorry for today,

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
I left in such a hurry that I forgot to ask for leave.

186
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,720
I'll make up the procedures with the manager later,

187
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,400
so I'm really sorry.

188
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,360
What are you doing?

189
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,240
Nothing

190
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
What are you waiting for?

191
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Come in.

192
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,840
Have a seat.

193
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,720
It's because I'm handsome.

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
You have this too.

195
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,280
This is a custom-made pumpkin group. There's one person

196
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,640
in the pumpkin group.

197
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
I remember you wore this hat

198
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,080
during your first concert, right?

199
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,120
I remember,

200
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,720
after the concert that day,

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,480
You even kissed the stage.

202
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,120
God Nan,

203
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,360
I'm not talking about you.

204
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
As an idol,

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
you're too sloppy.

206
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,320
What's wrong with the idol?

207
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,680
Idol has to eat

208
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,560
and go to

209
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,560
the ladies'room.

210
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Do you see the kitchen?

211
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,360
Go cook.

212
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,280
I'm here to be an assistant.

213
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,760
I'm not here

214
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,120
to be a nanny,

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,480
Oh, right.

216
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,240
Coke chicken wings,

217
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
the same taste as last time,

218
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,080
I want to eat in half an hour.

219
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,000
I owe you.

220
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,000
Just do it.

221
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,440
It smells so good.

222
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,440
Jiayi,

223
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
at this time,

224
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,440
There must be a lot of reporters

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,080
in front of Jiang Nan's house. Are you sure you want to go?

226
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,280
But Jiang Nan has announced that he has a girlfriend.

227
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,360
Can't you see that

228
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,440
many oranges are taking the initiative all the time?

229
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,000
You even kissed him

230
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,240
in public? Jiang Nan did that,

231
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,680
It's all to piss me off.

232
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,320
He took the first step.

233
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,160
Then I should take the second step.

234
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,600
He has changed a lot indeed.

235
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
But it doesn't matter. I made

236
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,480
a girlfriend public yesterday,

237
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,040
You can be single again tomorrow.

238
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,600
It's no big deal.

239
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,280
Those reporters who took photos secretly,

240
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
I just need them.

241
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Why are you here?

242
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,960
Can't I come to see you if I'm fine?

243
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,960
If you see it,

244
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,360
aren't you going to invite me in?

245
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,760
That's not necessary.

246
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,440
I need to talk to you.

247
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,480
Who is it?

248
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,360
Gu Jiayi,

249
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,800
the meal is ready,

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
I'm working on it.

251
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,440
You live together?

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,640
Jiang Nan,

253
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
you've really changed a lot.

254
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,320
People always tell me that I've changed.

255
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,080
No one ever asked me why

256
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,120
and you saw it,

257
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,840
I don't want my girlfriend to misunderstand.

258
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,960
Please go back.

259
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,160
Why did you break up?

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
You were so good at dating each other back then.

261
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,720
The love of Yi Nan

262
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,760
is hard for us pumpkins to reconcile.

263
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,120
Yi Nan,

264
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I still have miscellaneous symptoms.

265
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,320
Go and cook your meal.

266
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm so pissed off!

267
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,120
Let's go.

268
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,040
Okay, sister.

269
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,520
This is a good picture.

270
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,480
I'm busy.

271
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Mr. Bao,

272
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,680
what a coincidence.

273
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,640
Qiaoqiao,

274
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,040
it's almost time to get off work.

275
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,680
Let's go.

276
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,480
Sit down,

277
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,520
sit down, sit down.

278
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,520
I was lazy

279
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,600
and came to chat with you for a while.

280
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,240
Is it appropriate?

281
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,320
Look at this,

282
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:51,960
Mr. Bao,

283
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,440
Don't make fun of us.

284
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,120
How can it be a joke?

285
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,720
We're all part-time workers.

286
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,640
It's not easy for us.

287
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm telling you,

288
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,160
I understand

289
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,920
and respect you both.

290
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,760
Am I right?

291
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,760
You can't do it for nothing.

292
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,160
Let me tell you something,

293
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
so that you can finish your job when you go back.

294
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,079
You cooked so many dishes?

295
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,880
There are so many things in my fridge,

296
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,440
but there are quite a few things in your fridge.

297
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,119
You're asking me to cook and you're not eating,

298
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,119
so I have to think about my body.

299
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,440
Your cooking is too rich.

300
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
Didn't you say you don't need to avoid working out?

301
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
You have to get on the treadmill and run away.

302
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,360
Forget it if you don't want to eat.

303
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,120
Maybe we can run a little longer.

304
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,320
There's only one left.

305
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm determined to win.

306
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,080
There are only 12 chicken wings.

307
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
But you ate them all.

308
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,440
I only ate three. One bite

309
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,680
counts as one bite,

310
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,040
You wasted all three of them.

311
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
You're an idol.

312
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,360
You need to control your diet or you'll gain weight.

313
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,640
Chicken wings are inspiration.

314
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,960
Only when you eat them can you write songs.

315
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,120
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,440
Wipe it first.

317
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,280
It's all your fault.

318
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,600
I've done too little this time.

319
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
Do more next time.

320
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,680
Forget it.

321
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,280
I won't argue with you.

322
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,920
Since you've had enough to eat and drink,

323
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,080
it's time for me to go home.

324
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,920
Wait.

325
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,880
What now?

326
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,560
Many oranges,

327
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,480
use your brain to think about

328
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,400
how difficult paparazzi are, do you know?

329
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,280
There must be a lot of paparazzi out there.

330
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,200
Gu Jiayi just left and then you left,

331
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
if you're not afraid that they'll know

332
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,280
where your house is,

333
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,600
Be my guest.

334
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
Then I have to go home.

335
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,600
Anyway,

336
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,040
something happened,

337
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,280
Termination of the contract.

338
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,200
Give me back 300 thousand, too.

339
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,760
You.

340
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,760
Stop wiping it.

341
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll find you a new dress to wear later.

342
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,400
Hey, Dad,

343
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,480
I'm going to sleep tonight but my in-laws won't come home.

344
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,680
No, no, no.

345
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,080
You don't have to put me on the phone.

346
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,400
You two go to bed early.

347
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,960
I'm hanging up.

348
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,560
Bye.

349
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,360
Don't you blush even if you lie?

350
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,440
Where should I sleep tonight?

351
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,600
Please designate a place for me.

352
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,560
My room.

353
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,160
What do you want to do?

354
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,960
I mean, there's a tent in the room.

355
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,080
Take it yourself.

356
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,880
Who's sleeping in the tent?

357
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,680
What are you doing at night?

358
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
What are you doing?

359
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,040
Why are you scaring me.

360
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,720
What are you doing?

361
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
You even startled me.

362
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm practicing.

363
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,800
Eight Vajra Skills?

364
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,800
What evil skills?

365
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,120
This is a serious health-preserving skill.

366
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,160
It's not good for you to interrupt me like this.

367
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,960
You're not possessed, are you?

368
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,320
I said,

369
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,800
practice as you practice.

370
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
Why are you closing your eyes?

371
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,280
Because of your bath towel. Okay,

372
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,240
okay,

373
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,000
What's wrong?

374
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,840
Usually, at this time,

375
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,040
bath towels will fall off.

376
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,440
Are all you can think about is oranges?

377
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,040
Stop watching stupid dramas.

378
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,440
Idiotic dramas also come from life.

379
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,720
Many oranges.

380
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
How much longer do we have?

381
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,680
It's a long time ago.

382
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,880
Take your time.

383
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,600
It's only 11 minutes 516 seconds,

384
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,200
and the surprise is coming soon.

385
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,160
What's wrong?

386
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
Are you scared?

387
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,440
Sun Tzu is afraid.

388
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm not afraid. Why are you covered?

389
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,920
Who's under the blanket?

390
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,600
You're not.

391
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,880
Surprise is coming again.

392
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,120
Many oranges,

393
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,320
why are you so familiar with this film?

394
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,840
I've seen this film

395
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,840
many times,

396
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,960
I shouldn't have promised you to watch horror movies.

397
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Let's discuss something.

398
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,400
What is it?

399
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,760
About my work at the musical instrument store,

400
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
I work part-time at the musical instrument store,

401
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,480
First, I have to pay back the money,

402
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
and second, I like to

403
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,560
work related to music.

404
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,840
Don't worry,

405
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,680
I won't delay my work

406
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,040
as your assistant.

407
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,640
If I delay,

408
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
you can deduct my salary,

409
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,080
No way.

410
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,040
I don't agree.

411
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,280
All right,

412
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,720
I agree.

413
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,080
Are you satisfied?

414
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Okay,

415
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
Then it's a deal.

416
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
Why don't you go upstairs to sleep?

417
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,400
Well,

418
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
This is my home.

419
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
I can sleep wherever I want?

420
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Okay,

421
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,520
I'm going to bed.

422
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,920
Many oranges,

423
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,240
let me tell you,

424
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,560
Tomorrow morning,

425
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,320
sandwich milk,

426
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
We can't miss anything.

427
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,720
Many oranges,

428
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,680
did you hear what I was talking to you?

429
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,120
Many oranges

430
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
fell asleep.

431
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,640
Are you a pig?

432
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,280
You slept so fast?

433
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,400
Jiang Nan,

434
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,360
the people in our house,

435
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
Why are they all gone?

436
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,320
Many oranges.

437
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,080
I'm going to keep you from getting up and down on the treadmill.

438
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,520
What are you doing?

439
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,280
Nothing.

440
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,280
You're awake.

441
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
Have breakfast.

442
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:50,880
Well,

443
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,800
What is this?

444
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,360
Sandwiches!

445
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,360
Sandwiches look like this.

446
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,080
I did what you asked me to do.

447
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,720
You must have been scared out of your wits

448
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,520
by watching a ghost movie last night.

449
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,480
Did you?

450
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,880
No.

451
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,640
Did you make this?

452
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,280
From now on,

453
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,400
this is it.

454
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,760
It's quite delicious,

455
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,000
Jiang.

456
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,360
Hello, sister-in-law.

457
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
Don't leave.

458
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,720
Don't go!

459
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,520
Well,

460
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,920
why don't you explain it?

461
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,080
Who is your sister-in-law?

462
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,320
What's wrong?

463
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,600
My stomach hurts,

464
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,120
is it because I put too much sauce just now?

465
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,240
Brother,

466
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,520
When Lin rushes out later,

467
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,920
you have to stop him.

468
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,120
I can't stop him.

469
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,720
If you want to stop me, let's stop him together.

470
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
I can't handle him myself.

471
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,120
Have you seen that photo?

472
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,800
It's with that little milk dog.

473
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,040
Look.

474
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,120
It's inappropriate to hold Chengcheng in your arms.

475
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,240
Well,

476
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,680
So explicit?

477
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,000
If Master sees this,

478
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,440
he'll be furious.

479
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,720
If I really saw it,

480
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,400
I guess I'd be even angrier than Lin Zi.

481
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,880
Many oranges,

482
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,120
Xu

483
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,800
You're back.

484
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Give me your phone.

485
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,120
No

486
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,800
When you're free later,

487
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,680
give me your phone.

488
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,920
No,

489
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,200
I know him.

490
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,320
This is singing

491
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,840
… Jiang Nan,

492
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,440
Okay,

493
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,880
You brat,

494
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,720
I have to chop you into hob pieces.

495
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,440
Just wait and see.

496
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,640
Master Master Xu, Master Xu,

497
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,640
Master Xu,

498
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,840
Don't get excited.

499
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,680
Master,

500
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,720
let me do it.

501
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
What does he mean?

502
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,720
Chop off

503
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,080
his hob,

504
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,760
Lin,

505
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,320
don't be impulsive.

506
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
Take a long-term view, Xu.

507
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,720
Many oranges.

508
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,320
What did you put for me?

509
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,720
I just put some.

510
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,040
Wait.

511
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,480
-Hello? -Dad? Dad?

512
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,320
What dad?

513
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,200
You're my dad.

514
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,040
Where is it?

515
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Come back now!

516
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,080
You have a good attitude?

517
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,360
Yes.

518
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,720
Don't move.

519
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,320
What's wrong?

520
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,880
I don't know.

521
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,160
My dad told me to hurry home.

522
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Wait, wait, wait.

523
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,960
Bao Rui and I will go back to the studio,

524
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,560
and you ask Du to send you back first.

525
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,920
All right. I'll go get changed.

526
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,000
Should I go upstairs or downstairs?

527
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,040
Upstairs.

528
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,080
Tell me,

529
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,200
when did it start?

530
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,720
Tell me,

531
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
Why didn't you tell us?

532
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
Why didn't you tell us?

533
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,160
I didn't say it because I didn't want you to get angry.

534
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,480
Look at you,

535
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
how can I not be angry?

536
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,000
Tell me,

537
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,880
does your dad and I object to your relationship?

538
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,400
That's right.

539
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,280
Even if you didn't tell us in the first place,

540
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,560
would we admit it?

541
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,400
You admit it, too.

542
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,800
What did you find for us?

543
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,440
What?

544
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,160
I found a singer.

545
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,280
Who are they?

546
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,040
You like to play.

547
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,320
Yes.

548
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,160
Without a sense of responsibility,

549
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,520
Yes.

550
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,560
I'm sure you don't want to get married if you like to play.

551
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,480
Is a singer called a regular job?

552
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
If you don't have a regular job,

553
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,040
you definitely don't have a fixed income.

554
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,040
After talking to you for a few years,

555
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,640
wouldn't it be a waste of time?

556
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,840
It's nothing.

557
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,640
Mom,

558
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,920
you don't know the situation,

559
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
God Nan wouldn't do that.

560
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,800
What?

561
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,640
Prince Charming

562
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Prince Charming

563
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,840
is lying to you ignorant people,

564
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,280
Ignorant girl,

565
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,840
Scum,

566
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,640
Divide it for me now

567
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,160
Points,

568
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,120
Jiang Nan is not that kind of person.

569
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,760
That's not who he is. What kind of person is he?

570
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,440
Tell me,

571
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,560
tell me,

572
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,280
He goes to bed early and gets up early,

573
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,000
and he doesn't have any bad habits,

574
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,600
Go to bed early and get up early,

575
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,240
I go to bed early and get up early, too,

576
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,040
He goes to bed early.

577
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
He goes to bed early and wakes up early.

578
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,800
How do you know that?

579
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,400
That's right.

580
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,880
I'm his girlfriend,

581
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,320
so of course

582
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,840
I know him better,

583
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,200
Look at you.

584
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,520
Look at your daughter.

585
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,360
Now you're talking to outsiders.

586
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,680
Did I raise you for nothing? I.

587
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,000
Mom,

588
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,200
I raised you for nothing, didn't I?

589
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:55,720
Just do what you want.

590
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,200
Mom,

591
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,680
What are you doing?

592
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,160
Don't do it. You're crazy.

593
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,560
Listen to me,

594
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,280
I think,

595
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,080
I don't want you to think

596
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,440
now I want me to think,

597
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,240
I think you spoiled her.

598
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,400
I think you spoiled her.

599
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,640
Mom, mom,

600
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,560
I was wrong.

601
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,360
All right,

602
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,800
the child said it wrong,

603
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,720
What are you doing?

604
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,440
Now that you know you're mistaken,

605
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,080
you're already on TV.

606
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,440
What do you think if you let the neighbors see it?

607
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I told you that when I went to the market these two days,

608
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,680
I always felt that someone was staring at me,

609
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,120
It's because of you.

610
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,440
It's because

611
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,920
you were born beautiful

612
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
and still have charm.

613
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,800
Wind,

614
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,120
As soon as you get to the market,

615
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,480
you'll be the focus.

616
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,680
Focus,

617
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,640
you're talking nonsense.

618
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
How dare you talk nonsense?

619
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,000
If you keep talking nonsense,

620
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,240
calm down. Calm down.

621
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,280
Listen to me.

622
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,080
Since that's the case,

623
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,040
About what happened to us,

624
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,560
we've come to this point.

625
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,680
It's better to call that,

626
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,240
that Jiang,

627
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,000
Jiang Nan,

628
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,920
that's right.

629
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Call Jiang Nan home,

630
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,920
let me talk to your mom.

631
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,760
Let's meet.

632
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,720
Check it out,

633
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,160
you can finally say something human.

634
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,600
No,

635
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,760
What did you do just now?

636
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Don't stab me.

637
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,680
Isn't it too urgent?

638
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,360
And he may not come.

639
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,440
What did you say?

640
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Jiang,

641
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
this is your latest schedule,

642
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,640
Take a look.

643
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,000
There may be a few interviews,

644
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,120
so be prepared.

645
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,320
Because Gu Jiayi

646
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,760
might also take some action.

647
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,640
Anyway, I have a lot of oranges now.

648
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Let's see what tricks she can pull.

649
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,720
You already have a lot of oranges.

650
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,680
That's so natural.

651
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,600
You see,

652
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,560
I can't help but say,

653
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,320
-Is that right? -She called.

654
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,120
It's her, right?

655
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,120
What's wrong?

656
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Is it Jiang?

657
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,560
I'm the father of many oranges.

658
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,600
Uncle,

659
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,040
what can I do for you?

660
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,440
Are you free tomorrow?

661
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,720
Tomorrow

662
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,840
Here's the thing.

663
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,080
We were thinking,

664
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,000
I want to meet you,

665
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,760
have dinner,

666
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,640
Seven o'clock,

667
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,440
family fun,

668
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,360
Let's see each other.

669
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,400
Uncle,

670
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,840
what's wrong with me

671
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,160
tomorrow?

672
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,280
You look ugly.

673
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,280
Many Cheng's dad

674
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,720
asked me out for dinner

675
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,560
tomorrow.

676
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,320
It's good.

677
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,360
Get ready,

678
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
No need to prepare.

679
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm not going.

680
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,520
Why?

681
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,560
We're not real in the first place.

682
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,680
If you meet your parents,

683
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,720
things will be more complicated.

684
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,280
I'm telling you,

685
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,320
it's your fault.

686
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,040
I'm telling you, when we come up with this idea,

687
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,440
you should be mentally prepared.

688
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,760
And the girl was exposed to the public

689
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,360
because of you,

690
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,760
If it's hard for your parents,

691
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,560
they don't owe you anything.

692
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,680
Can't you

693
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,520
help each other?

694
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,880
Think about it.

695
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
How can you use lipstick of this color?

696
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,720
Your skin is so white,

697
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,240
shouldn't you use No. 07?

698
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,240
I just went to the scene to check the lights.

699
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,240
The lighting is hard,

700
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,320
and the 19th will make you look haggard.

701
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,199
What's wrong with your mouth?

702
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
-It's because of the press conference. -Xiao

703
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:12,880
Mei,

704
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,320
Help me find an ointment.

705
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,080
Okay,

706
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Mr. Zhan knows a lot.

707
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,120
Looks like you have a lot of confidants.

708
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,480
You're not here for me, are you?

709
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,440
Which sister do you like again?

710
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,560
The little girl didn't see me

711
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,040
coming today,

712
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,840
Congratulations

713
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,719
to your old friend.

714
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,400
Are you trying to piss me off?

715
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm curious.

716
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,080
Why can't you forget Jiang Nan?

717
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,520
Aren't you the same?

718
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,440
Jiang Nan hasn't been doing well

719
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,400
in the past two years.

720
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,679
It's all thanks to you.

721
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,679
He's at his wit's end.

722
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,120
What does it have to do with me?

723
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,440
But you suppressed him.

724
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,240
It has something to do with me.

725
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,960
But I really don't understand,

726
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
what is the reason?

727
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,120
I made you two brothers who were so good back then,

728
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
become like this.

729
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Combined solo flight

730
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
is an inevitable trend.

731
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
We can develop separately.

732
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,840
Take

733
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,080
this card.

734
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,840
You have time to care about me.

735
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,640
You might as well care about yourself.

736
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,000
Jiang Nan has a new lover,

737
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,080
like the one who publicly shows her love,

738
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,160
It's not you.

739
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,600
As for his new love,

740
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,200
I'll just forget it.

741
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,720
Why are you thinking about it?

742
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,120
What do you mean?

743
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,920
What a coincidence.

744
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,960
I happened to see it.

745
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,360
But I really don't understand,

746
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,720
what's so good about that girl?

747
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,520
So that both of you can be interested in her.

748
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,280
As long as Jiang Nan is interested in it,

749
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
I'm interested in everything.

750
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,920
The little girl is quite cute

751
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,160
and lovable.

752
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,680
That's good.

753
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,920
If we work together,

754
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,880
you'll steal a lot of oranges?

755
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
I'll get Jiang Nan.

756
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,920
What do you think?

757
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,240
Sis ointment.

758
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,040
What does Zhan Zhilin want?

759
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
I know very well.

760
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,200
As for whether you can seize the opportunity or not,

761
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
it depends on you.

762
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,440
I think someone will stop you.

763
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,120
No one can stop me.

764
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,480
In my opinion,

765
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,880
the 19th is more suitable for you.

766
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,000
Jiang Nan,

767
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,000
I know it's hard for you.

768
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,000
Just meet my parents.

769
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,720
Otherwise, they won't let me go.

770
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,840
Please beg me first.

771
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm begging you.

772
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,000
You're too perfunctory.

773
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,600
Brother,

774
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,440
I'm counting on you.

775
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,160
Please, please.

776
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Jiang Nan,

777
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,600
that's enough.

778
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,200
Let me think about it.

779
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,960
So you said yes?

780
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,960
I didn't say yes.

781
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,920
It's my first time

782
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,720
to meet my parents,

783
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,520
I'm nervous,

784
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,240
Jiang Nan,

785
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,120
It's not the first time for anyone.

786
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm not going anyway.

787
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,440
Stop!

788
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,800
What do you want to do?

789
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,760
If you don't go with me,

790
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,520
I'll tell the media about you.

791
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,400
What embarrassing thing,

792
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,120
saying that your house is like a pigsty,

793
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,680
And what happened in the ladies'room,

794
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,200
You.

795
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,200
Many oranges,

796
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,840
you promised me you wouldn't tell anyone about this.

797
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
If you dare to tell anyone, just wait and see.
