1
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,440
Today,

2
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,760
we are gathered here together.

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,640
Not to say goodbye sadly

4
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
to the bodies of many Miss Cheng.

5
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,080
We just hope that,

6
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,680
from now on,

7
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Many Miss Cheng

8
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,120
can enter a whole new world.

9
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,040
Start a brand new life.

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,840
Unknown things are always scary.

11
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,920
So we have to give her courage.

12
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,440
Just like she infected us.

13
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,520
In the past few years when Chengcheng fought against the disease,

14
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
we even saw that

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,040
in such a petite body,

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,400
How dare you show such great courage.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,120
Let's observe a moment of silence for many Miss Orange.

18
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,840
Let's congratulate a lot of Miss Cheng on her successful challenge.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,960
He even broke the opening record

20
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
of our Death Experience Hall.

21
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,080
It's two hours and five minutes.

22
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
The extra five minutes will have to be paid.

23
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
It costs a lot more.

24
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,560
two thousand

25
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
You loser.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Brother Liu.

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,640
It's your turn.

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,760
Thank you, Brother Liu.

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,160
In the future, when it comes to activities like lying down and making money,

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,360
remember to come to me.

31
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
After our event is over,

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,440
even if it's officially opened,

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,160
You'll have to pay for it if you come.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,280
But you're quite good at lying down.

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,080
Most people can't lie down for that long,

36
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,800
so you're not asleep, are you?

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,160
I was sober the whole time.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,960
Besides,

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
I realized it deeply.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
The feeling of death.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
Brother Liu, I have something urgent to do,

42
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,600
so I have to go.

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,040
Bye.

44
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,920
Be careful.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
My name is Many Orange,

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,800
a fresh graduate from the piano department

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,880
of Xinhai Conservatory of Music,

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,240
This death experience, is a preview for me.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
"

50
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,720
matter

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,400
Let's start from three months ago.

52
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
One day, I was diagnosed with gradual freezing,

53
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,480
which is extremely rare.

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,960
But it's a strange and incurable disease.

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,920
Shocked.

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,360
Fear,

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
not agree

58
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
Helpless,

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,040
suddenly fell into the countdown of life.

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,680
I hid the bad news,

61
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,000
so I couldn't find the meaning of living.

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Fortunately,

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
the rest of my life is bleak.

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,160
Finally, it was illuminated by a beam of light.

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,920
That's the singer Jiang Nan.

66
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,480
He said,

67
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,160
"Death stands like a lighthouse. ",

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
Waiting for everyone to arrive.

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
We were born to die.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,080
We should grasp the present.

71
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,880
Seize the day.

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,400
I want to be like him,

73
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
to express myself bravely and freely.

74
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,080
Pursuing my dream,

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
and my first stop,

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's start with Star Band.

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,600
Let's get started.

78
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,560
Okay.

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
The rhythm is quite good.

80
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,960
It's really nice.

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
It's really great.

82
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,160
Not bad. Yeah.

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,400
You chose a very difficult track,

84
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
and the completion of the whole track is also very good.

85
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,720
But in the most important chapter,

86
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,000
you made a mistake,

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,760
So we need to be more mature.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,720
A more stable professional player.

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,600
Although I was not selected,

90
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,560
I made it to the end.

91
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't have any regrets.

92
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,400
Hello, Miss.

93
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
What can I do for you?

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,640
I want to buy an entry gift for my bestie.

95
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,080
Look at this bracelet,

96
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,920
Wish bone design,

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
simple and textured.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
And it has a very good meaning.

99
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,960
Bring good luck.

100
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
Take a look. This earring

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,480
and bracelet are from the same series.

102
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,200
I don't want the earrings for now.

103
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,760
Wrap the bracelet for me.

104
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
Okay, please wait a moment.

105
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
It's so pretty.

106
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,560
But we can't spend money now.

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,640
There are plenty of places to spend money on.

108
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,280
Bro,

109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
can I borrow some paper?

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,200
Pervert!

111
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,600
Hold on.

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
I'm not a pervert.

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
You went to the ladies'room.

114
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,960
You're not a pervert. What are you?

115
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,919
Ladies'room. I'm

116
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,919
sorry,

117
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,760
I was too anxious when I first came in.

118
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
I didn't see it clearly. It's the one

119
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,520
in the ladies'room,

120
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,560
Can you lend me some paper?

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,160
How about this?

122
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
I'll exchange the ticket with you.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
I don't want your ticket. What ticket?

124
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,880
This is Jiang Nan's ticket.

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,200
You can change the wrapping paper anyway.

126
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,800
What about me?

127
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,600
But Jiang Nan is a big fan,

128
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,360
why didn't I know he had a performance?

129
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
You're his fan.

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
Of course.

131
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,360
I'm waiting for his performance.

132
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,080
But I waited for three years.

133
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,280
I keep an eye on him every day.

134
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Your ticket must be fake.

135
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
It's not fake.

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,880
Take a closer look.

137
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,280
Is it really Jiang Nan?

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't expect you to be better informed than me.

139
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,000
Am I right?

140
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
I can't take this ticket for nothing.

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,760
Can you give me a price?

142
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't want money.

143
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,520
Just give me some paper.

144
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,360
Wait.

145
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,200
Can you take a look

146
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,240
outside for me? I'll go out if there's no one else.

147
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,680
Okay.

148
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
There's no one outside.

149
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,160
Come out.

150
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
What took you so long?

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Don't you have some paper with you?

152
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,560
You have diarrhea again.

153
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
What's wrong with you?

154
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,240
Let's go

155
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,080
Du Keqin,

156
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,800
Orange,

157
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
it's their loss that they don't want you.

158
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Uncle and aunt and I are your strong backing.

159
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
Don't be sad.

160
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,480
I'm fine.

161
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Where's my sadness?

162
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,080
It's all in the past.

163
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,040
And it's true that I'm not as skilled as others.

164
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,360
Keep up the good work in the future.

165
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,800
I ordered juice for you.

166
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,480
Do you want to drink it?

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Let me give you a sip.

168
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,480
No.

169
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,520
Don't tempt me.

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,560
I'll drink this.

171
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,520
I really don't understand

172
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
why you stopped drinking coffee all of a sudden?

173
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,160
You've always been a heavy coffee lover,

174
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
as I told you,

175
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,440
If I go to bed early and get up early,

176
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
this coffee will seriously affect my sleep.

177
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,040
Besides, my routine

178
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,800
is regular now.

179
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,200
Do you want to keep healthy like this?

180
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
You're only 22 years old.

181
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Wait for my skin to become like coagulated fat.

182
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,840
When you look like a peach blossom,

183
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
you should envy me.

184
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,800
By the way,

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,200
if you don't join the band,

186
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,720
What kind of job are you going to look for next?

187
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,760
I don't know yet.

188
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,640
Just do whatever you want to earn.

189
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,560
You can be a piano teacher,

190
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,320
and you can be me.

191
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Don't worry about it.

192
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,640
Now the most important thing is to congratulate you,

193
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,560
congratulations on finally getting through the probation period.

194
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,000
Official entry.

195
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah,

196
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm telling you,

197
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
Ever since I got into the truth,

198
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,120
I've been living a completely inhuman life.

199
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm waiting.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,880
A small gift for you.

201
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,480
Thank you.

202
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,520
This wishing bone bracelet

203
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
is very efficacious.

204
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
I just bought it yesterday,

205
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
and I got a ticket.

206
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Jiang Nan,

207
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,800
where did you get this ticket?

208
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,920
Yesterday,

209
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,320
I gave someone a pack of facial tissues in the toilet,

210
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,000
Then he gave me this ticket.

211
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,760
Jiang Nan's ticket is changed to facial tissue.

212
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,760
Tell me,

213
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,240
Am I destined to be with God Nan?

214
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,240
You mean that good people get what they deserve,

215
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,720
how come such a thing doesn't happen to me?

216
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,280
The devil has summoned me again.

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I have to go back to the company first.

218
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
Take more videos at night.

219
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,360
Be careful on the way.

220
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,400
See you. Bye-bye.

221
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,280
Bye.

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,400
What's going on?

223
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,040
that

224
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
Arrange temporary adjustments.

225
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
Please feel aggrieved.

226
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,240
Then I can't go.

227
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,080
This is the sponsor's request.

228
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,720
You paid for the appearance

229
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,720
fee. Are you kidding me?

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,600
I've been preparing for a solo concert for a year,

231
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,600
but suddenly it's the appetizer.

232
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Aren't you laughing at me?

233
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,880
How did you become an agent?

234
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,200
It's my fault.

235
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,520
But there's nothing I can do.

236
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,080
Agent, let's face it,

237
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,400
if you don't go on stage tonight,

238
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,960
There will be a penalty of 1 million yuan.

239
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,840
Ancestor,

240
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm begging you.

241
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,800
For this concert,

242
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,200
I will definitely find a way to make it up for you.

243
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,880
Trust me,

244
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,480
okay?

245
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
Hot guest,

246
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,040
Jiang Nan.

247
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,320
Do me a favor tonight.

248
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,240
Although God Nan has been replaced as a hot guest,

249
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,920
as long as he performs,

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm happy.

251
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,120
Why did you send yourself here?

252
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,000
I heard that he might come tonight.

253
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,920
Such a big piece of material,

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,920
I can only serve it myself.

255
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
But the gap is too big, isn't it?

256
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,080
Look at Jiang Nan,

257
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,280
now he has become a hot spot for newcomers.

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,080
You only see newcomers laughing,

259
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,360
but you don't hear old people crying.

260
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,080
Who says it's not?

261
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,200
Besides, his song

262
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,680
is out of date.

263
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,880
How dare you sing?

264
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,160
Now the industry is in a cold winter,

265
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,320
advertisers are staring at the traffic,

266
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
You're not young anymore,

267
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,640
and you don't have traffic support,

268
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,240
It's really not the time

269
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
for us to be willful now.

270
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,320
Is it about to start?

271
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,680
Here we go.

272
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,720
It's coming out.

273
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,960
God Nan.

274
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,320
Hello,

275
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm Jiang Nan.

276
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,080
Next,

277
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,640
I'm going to show you the song "Island".

278
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm going backstage to get Jiang Nan's autograph.

279
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,960
Gu Jiayi,

280
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,000
why is she here?

281
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,480
Let go!

282
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,240
Jiang Nan,

283
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,160
seeing you on the stage again,

284
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm so happy.

285
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,480
Jiayi,

286
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,560
in what capacity did you come here today?

287
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Are you two going to get back together?

288
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,800
Jiang Nan is an old friend I've known for a long time,

289
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,600
and I'm here today,

290
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm here to support him.

291
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
And he and I

292
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
are going to work together on music.

293
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
I hope you can give me more support.

294
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,720
I hope you can pay more attention to Jiang Nan.

295
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,200
Please move the camera to him.

296
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,880
If you don't want to be noticed by others,

297
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,800
you shouldn't have appeared on this stage.

298
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,400
Jiang Nan,

299
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
how do you feel now?

300
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,840
Is this the support you agreed in advance?

301
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,040
Orange.

302
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,440
What is this?

303
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
What's going on?

304
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,960
So this is your goal.

305
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
Why are you leaving?

306
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,840
Don't go.

307
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,920
Nan Shen

308
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,280
Take a picture.

309
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,480
Let's go.

310
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,960
Hurry up. Hurry up.

311
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,520
Hurry up!

312
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Here! Here! Here!

313
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,280
Don't run, Jiang Nan.

314
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,360
Hurry up!

315
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,600
Hurry up! Hurry up!

316
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,520
Be careful.

317
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,240
Hurry up. Hurry up. Follow me.

318
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,280
Over there.

319
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,120
Where is it?

320
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,800
I didn't mean to.

322
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,120
I know.

323
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,080
They are all troublemakers,

324
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,640
I don't want them to attract my attention.

325
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,880
This voice,

326
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,680
bro,

327
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,200
Can I borrow some paper?

328
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,640
How about this?

329
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
I'll exchange the ticket with you.

330
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,800
The person who was in the ladies'room yesterday …

331
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,160
What ladies'room?

332
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

333
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,440
Don't mention this to anyone.

334
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,160
Do you hear me?

335
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,200
Do you hear me?

336
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,720
No wonder it sounds so familiar.

337
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
What kind of idiot

338
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,360
did I have to react to it?

339
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
Why is there no such thing?

340
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,440
Let's go up there and have a look.

341
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,160
Why are you laughing?

342
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,680
Me,

343
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,280
You.

344
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
I can't breathe.

345
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
We can't just wait here.

346
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
We need to get out of here.

347
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,840
I drank,

348
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,720
can you drive?

349
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,520
Yes,

350
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,600
Let's run together.

351
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,520
Can you really drive?

352
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,760
Are you sure you can drive?

353
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,080
One is faster and the other is slower.

354
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,480
Pull over. I can't help it.

355
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,200
I'm going to throw up.

356
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Do you know how to drive or not?

357
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,920
I just got my driver's license.

358
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,320
God Nan,

359
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
wait for me.

360
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,960
Can I have your autograph?

361
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
Sorry about today,

362
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,800
something happened at the scene.

363
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,200
Thank you for driving me back.

364
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,640
Thank you, Goddess Nan.

365
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,840
Many oranges,

366
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
you're so lucky today.

367
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,520
I can't believe you're in the same car with God Nan.

368
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,440
By the way,

369
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
God Nan even gave you an autograph.

370
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,240
I'll put you in the account book

371
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
with my autographed photo.

372
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,960
Really?

373
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,360
God Nan.

374
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
All I can do now is to send a private message to Nanshen Weibo,

375
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,040
leave my phone number,

376
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,640
Tell him to return the ledger to me.

377
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
God Nan,

378
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm Many Orange,

379
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,600
It's the ladies'room. I'll give you paper.

380
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
The girl who drove you just now,

381
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,080
I left a notebook in your car.

382
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,520
If you see it,

383
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,520
please contact me

384
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,360
through the phone number below.

385
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,160
Brother,

386
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,520
There are paparazzi following us.

387
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
You're hiding something from me.

388
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,080
No.

389
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,440
The car in the back,

390
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,400
you hired it.

391
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,800
It's all because of the scandal

392
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,080
you caused at the concert yesterday.

393
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,360
Hello.

394
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,240
-Jiang Nan is

395
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,800
here. -Hello,

396
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,440
Let's go in.

397
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Miss Gu is already inside.

398
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,120
Why is it Miss Gu?

399
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Didn't you say your surname was Hu?

400
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,760
What?

401
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,320
I didn't hear you clearly.

402
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,840
Let's go.

403
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,440
Let's go.

404
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,880
Ready to start.

405
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
Is the project done?

406
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,440
No problem.

407
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,440
You can start anytime.

408
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,080
Mr. Jiayi,

409
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,040
we are all ready.

410
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,040
You can start anytime.

411
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,440
Thank you.

412
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,160
Jiang Nan,

413
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,440
although you refused my invitation,

414
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
But the producer

415
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
still insists that men and women sing together?

416
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
I still want to invite you.

417
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,480
This is the Mr. Hu

418
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
you told me about. I'm sorry.

419
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,240
Why are you pulling?

420
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,480
You've been out of breath for so long,

421
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,760
yet you're still so fierce?

422
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,520
If it weren't for Jiayi,

423
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,480
shut up!

424
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,920
-Please listen to

425
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,480
me. -No,

426
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
I really can't leave today.

427
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,160
I know you don't like Gu Jiayi,

428
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,520
and I know you're really angry.

429
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,000
But if there's something I can do,

430
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,240
I won't take this job.

431
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,920
If you don't have a job, just wait.

432
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
I can't wait any longer.

433
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,280
The studio is almost empty.

434
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,440
Look, Du,

435
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,120
your girlfriend is urging you to get married every day,

436
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,120
He's been putting off a girl for a long time,

437
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
just because he can't afford to get married,

438
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
You have the heart

439
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
to watch everyone drink with you.

440
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,280
Okay,

441
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
If you really want to leave,

442
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,680
I'll let them know.

443
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Wait.

444
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,240
This is the only time,

445
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
and the last time.

446
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Okay, for the last time,

447
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,000
control your emotions,

448
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,640
Got it.

449
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,320
Okay, okay.

450
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,360
Miss still asks questions at night,

451
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,160
give me a score in his heart.

452
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:34,720
Stop,

453
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
What are you singing?

454
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,040
I sang it according to the sample.

455
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,080
Is there any problem?

456
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,360
What do you think?

457
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,760
It's either a snap shot or out of tune.

458
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,040
Again.

459
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,320
Raise your head,

460
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,120
look into your eyes

461
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,160
and share your emotions and sorrows bit by bit,

462
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,880
Stop,

463
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,080
You need to relax your mouth,

464
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,080
push your diaphragm,

465
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,080
How can you resonate with such a tight mouth?

466
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,280
Mr. Jiayi's voice may not be open yet,

467
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,280
so let's try it a few more times.

468
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,160
Again.

469
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,320
Raise your head,

470
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,200
look into your eyes

471
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,800
and share your emotions and sorrows bit by bit,

472
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,000
Walking side by side,

473
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,000
the hand that I reached out at this moment,

474
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,560
Two planets,

475
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,280
Stop,

476
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,640
What this song wants to express,

477
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,600
is a girl's feelings of risking her life for love,

478
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
Do you think you sang this kind of emotion just now?

479
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,760
Mr. Jiayi is an actor after all,

480
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
not a professional singer.

481
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,960
Besides, we can tune it later,

482
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,440
so it's more important to sing the whole song now.

483
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,400
It's okay.

484
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Ask Jiang Nan to come,

485
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,600
I just hope he can give me professional advice.

486
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,640
Sir,

487
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
let's record my part first.

488
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,560
Okay.

489
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,760
There have been so many forks in the road,

490
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,800
you see,

491
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,280
He was born to be a singer,

492
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,280
I've wronged him in the past few years,

493
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,520
Yes,

494
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,880
if you really want what's best for him,

495
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,560
With my current strength,

496
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
I can totally help him become famous.

497
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,600
This should

498
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
also be your wish.

499
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,560
I've always believed that

500
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
gold can shine wherever it is.

501
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,080
I believe Jiang Nan. Thank you

502
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,400
for what happened today.

503
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,200
But remember,

504
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,200
this is what you owe Jiang Nan.

505
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm telling you,

506
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,520
I really can't be willful anymore.

507
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,520
We are old now.

508
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's talk about what happened today.

509
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,520
It's so awkward.

510
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,320
There's nothing wrong with being more demanding,

511
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,560
but we have to learn to be flexible.

512
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,920
You don't care about her at all.

513
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,920
At least the coffee table is there now.

514
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,560
Things are different now.

515
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,320
No matter how big the coffee table is,

516
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,920
poor singing means poor singing.

517
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,520
Of course.

518
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,800
I also think her singing is not good.

519
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,320
Although we sing well,

520
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,960
we have to have a chance to sing.

521
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,800
Even if you don't think about me,

522
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,240
right?

523
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,440
If you don't think about the company,

524
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,040
can't you think about your mom?

525
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,360
For our mom's sake,

526
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,120
right, Bu Du?

527
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,720
Yeah, that makes sense.

528
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,280
Hello, Keqin,

529
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,440
why did you answer my call so late?

530
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,160
I'm doing the accounting.

531
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,680
What are you doing?

532
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,920
You still have time to do the accounting?

533
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,480
Look at our official account.

534
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,480
You're so popular,

535
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,240
What nonsense are you talking about in the morning?

536
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
Take a look.

537
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,680
Hurry up! Hurry up!

538
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,560
This is too much of an oolong.

539
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,400
Brother,

540
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,800
I found it when I was washing the car.

541
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,560
I didn't look at it.

542
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,800
I'll get going now.

543
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,520
Why does she have this?

544
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
You're finally here.

545
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,720
What's wrong with you?

546
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,600
Let me tell you,

547
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,000
the person I met in the toilet that day was Jiang Nan,

548
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,360
But for some unknown reason,

549
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
someone took a sneak shot when he came out.

550
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
And then things turned out

551
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,280
like this,

552
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,440
Miss Xu,

553
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
let me interview you.

554
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
How do you feel about gossiping

555
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
with the idol of your dreams?

556
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,720
Stop messing around.

557
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,160
My little heart

558
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,280
is still beating.

559
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,560
I feel like the current situation

560
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,920
is like a dream.

561
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
What are your plans for the future?

562
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
What am I planning to do?

563
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
Let's not fight a war we didn't prepare for.

564
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Let me help you think about countermeasures.

565
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,280
Stop messing around.

566
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,520
I've told you everything,

567
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,120
why don't you believe me?

568
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,000
Of course I believe you.

569
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,840
But no one will believe what you said.

570
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I'll tell you about it.

571
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
I also promised Jiang Nan that I wouldn't tell anyone.

572
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
Don't let anyone else know.

573
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,200
Especially your boss,

574
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
you can put your heart back in your heart.

575
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,280
I still have

576
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,640
this kind of sisterhood.

577
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,640
But

578
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,960
even if I don't tell you,

579
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,080
Our boss is starting to pay attention

580
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,120
to Jiang Nan.

581
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,640
You have to be careful.

582
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,760
Hey,

583
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,920
I'm Jiang Nan.

584
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
Sakuragi Coffee. I'm here

585
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,720
to get your stuff.

586
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,240
Good

587
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,360
Keqin,

588
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
I have something to do, so I have to go now.

589
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,000
See you next time.

590
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,320
Who called you?

591
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,120
You just left me like this?

592
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,000
Hello, editor-in-chief,

593
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,640
Hello, editor-in-chief,

594
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,720
Hello, editor-in-chief.

595
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,280
Chief Qin,

596
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,679
you scared me to death.

597
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,600
Why are you here?

598
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,600
Sis,

599
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,960
I miss you so much.

600
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,600
Don't be so insincere.

601
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,040
If you didn't tell me in advance when you came back,

602
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,719
did

603
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,760
your wings grow hard?

604
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,120
I'm here.

605
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,320
Let me give you a massage.

606
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,360
Tell me,

607
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,280
What are your plans for returning home this time?

608
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,239
Not yet.

609
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,159
Let's take a look first.

610
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,840
Get familiar with the domestic environment.

611
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,400
The best way to get familiar with the environment

612
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,920
is to take part in work,

613
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,760
Why don't you come to my company as an intern?

614
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,480
Anyway, your major is right.

615
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,360
Sister, I appreciate your kindness.

616
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,040
But I, a young man,

617
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,920
came back from school,

618
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,440
It's time to be self-reliant

619
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,840
and ambitious,

620
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,320
I don't want to get involved, do I?

621
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,840
Forget it.

622
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,160
Don't you think I don't know you,

623
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,600
Sis Shan,

624
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
The photographer is in a temporary situation and can't come.

625
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
I'm on a mission now.

626
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,200
We're short of hands.

627
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,400
Yu Keqin, don't you know how to knock?

628
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,320
Sorry,

629
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,240
I was too anxious.

630
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,000
Borrow someone from another team.

631
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,880
I have work to do even if I borrow it.

632
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,760
I'll go.

633
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,600
Can I

634
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,440
change so fast?

635
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,920
God Nan.

636
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,360
Take care of your things.

637
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,560
Don't lose it again next time.

638
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,600
I won't.

639
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
You didn't read it, did you?

640
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,200
No.

641
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,240
It opened itself for me to see.

642
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,640
Since you've already watched it,

643
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,360
as your fan,

644
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,680
I have something to say to you,

645
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,440
okay?

646
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,560
On this occasion,

647
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,680
don't call me by my first name,

648
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,720
Go ahead,

649
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,880
Okay.

650
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,200
I'll buy every album

651
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,520
and single of yours.

652
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,880
I'll listen to it when I eat and sleep.

653
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,160
You're a creative singer.

654
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
You've written a lot of songs,

655
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
and your lyrics are partial to characterization,

656
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
The first time we meet each other,

657
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
you said it in your previous interview,

658
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,600
No matter what the joys and sorrows are,

659
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,200
we have to impress each other at first sight.

660
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
That's why there will be a later story.

661
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,160
Just like the first time we met.

662
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,880
I was destined to have a later story.

663
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,240
Can you stop

664
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,240
beating around the bush and remind us that

665
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,040
we met each other,

666
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,960
Besides,

667
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,320
there can't be a story between us,

668
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,960
No, that's not what I meant.

669
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,360
It's not just the Ladies'Toilet that impressed us.

670
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,240
And concerts,

671
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,040
being chased by paparazzi

672
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,600
Stop,

673
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,080
Are you sure you're not blackmailing me?

674
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
Can you do it?

675
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,400
Do you know what to do?

676
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,200
I know.

677
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,800
I majored in photography.

678
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,560
Did you bring the equipment?

679
