28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,680
You've asked me to see me again

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,660
because of Xu Duocheng, right?

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,540
Why else?

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,560
In the end,

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,320
an unattractive girl like Xu Duocheng ended up

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,240
being the biggest winner.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,900
She has you and Jiang Nan

35
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,680
at the palm of her hands.

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Do you know Xu Duocheng?

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,040
You think you're safe now that

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,380
you're back with Liang Zhe?

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,080
What do you mean?

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,320
I don't understand.

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,180
You'd better not.

42
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,440
Otherwise, I'll make you understand soon.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,120
By the way, I already paid the check.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,740
Drink more of it.

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,580
Director,

46
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,220
public opinion is completely one-sided.

47
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,380
They said Jiang Nan is a great boyfriend
and a responsible man

48
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,520
who won't leave or forsake his sick girlfriend.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,660
Did you hear anything from Jiang Nan?

50
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,780
Jiang Nan's statement already
went viral on the internet.

51
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Bao Rui sent us a notification
to terminate the contract.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm afraid there's no way around it.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,580
I'll figure something out.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,460
Director Wang, I'm really sorry.

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,820
Have you seen the news lately?

56
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,780
Jiang Nan hasn't been in a good state lately.

57
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,646
We'll certainly write that song for you.

58
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,920
Please give him some time to recuperate, okay?

59
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,260
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,100
Bao Rui...

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,580
I have a call.

62
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,180
Mr. Chen.

63
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,700
Mr. Chen,

64
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,060
I've been so busy.

65
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,240
You want to see me?

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,380
You're already downstairs?

67
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,520
Well...

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,420
But ..I can't leave yet.

69
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,200
There's someone in my office.

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,940
Alright then.

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Alex, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,400
As you can see, I'm really busy here.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm really busy here.

74
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,800
Let's talk another day, okay?

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,320
okay?

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,900
Stop playing these tricks with me.

77
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,180
I am really busy.

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,860
How about this.
 Let's make a long story short, okay?

79
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,100
Okay.

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,900
The final competition will be in two days.

81
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,500
How should we handle Jiang Nan's situation?

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,320
Look at what you're saying.

83
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,100
You were the one who stirred up trouble.

84
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,540
How can you ask me to help you handle it?

85
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,920
Is that a refusal?

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
Of course.

87
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,380
Look, this could've been a great thing.

88
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,740
But you just had to expose Cheng's condition.

89
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,040
You drove a dagger right into Jiang Nan's soft spot.

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Think about it, with Jiang Nan's temperament,

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,860
with Jiang Nan's temperament,

92
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,040
not even an 8-horse carriage could drag him back.

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
You should think it through.

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,900
If he refuses to participate in the competition,

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,760
all of the efforts
he made previously would be in vain.

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,900
Besides,

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,780
he would also have to pay a huge penal sum.

98
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,440
Look, Alex,

99
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,260
None of us

100
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,840
are new to the business.

101
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,140
How can you try to hoodwink us with that?

102
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,220
How much revenue did Jiang Nan bring to the show?

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,800
You must know that better than us.

104
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,060
Who knows which one of us

105
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,500
would sue the other?

106
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,780
Please be on your way.

107
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,460
I won't walk you out, okay?

108
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Mr. Chen,

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,620
come on up.

110
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,140
A man in a white shirt
is going downstairs now.

111
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,060
He'll press the elevator for you.

112
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,440
Hello, Chief Director.

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,280
<i>How did you handle the situation of
the final competition?</i>

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,820
<i>A few ad agencies already called</i>

115
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,760
<i>and clearly stated they only became</i>

116
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,400
<i>titled sponsors because of Jiang Nan's commercial value.</i>

117
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,700
<i>They are accusing us of fraud now!</i>

118
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,940
No, Chief Director,

119
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,600
how is that fraud?

120
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
The show already generated a lot of heat.

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,260
Even if Jiang Nan doesn't participate,

122
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,540
they'll still get their money's worth
for their advertising fees.

123
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,380
<i>You call that heat?</i>

124
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,460
<i>Go check online.</i>

125
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,560
<i>Look at how everyone criticizing
the production team.</i>

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,400
<i>They said you're using
unscrupulous means for rating,</i>

127
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,200
<i>and heartless for using a sick person
to hype up the show.</i>

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,720
<i>They are jointly boycotting the final competition.</i>

129
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,420
They're boycotting it?

130
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,760
<i>Alex,</i>

131
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,800

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,420
<i>But you messed it up.</i>

135
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,220
<i>I think Jiang Nan is very determined</i>

136
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,780
<i>to quit the competition.</i>

137
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,400
<i>If he quit the competition,</i>

138
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,840
<i>you can pack your things and leave too.</i>

139
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,920
Wait, Chief Director, I...

140
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,640
Mr. Liang,

141
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,340
don't be anxious.

142
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,940
Look, she's here.

143
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,540
Jiayi, come here.

144
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,820
Let me introduce you.

145
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,960
Didn't you say it's a gathering?

146
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,260
He's Mr. Huang from FT Real Estates.

147
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,020
He's a big shot.

148
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,360
Mr. Huang, Jiayi is here.

149
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,340
Come on, Jiayi.

150
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,920
Let me introduce you.

151
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,000
This is Mr. Huang from FT Real Estates.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,960
Come on.

153
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
Jiayi,

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,960
let's make a toast to Mr. Huang together.

155
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,640
Here's to you, Mr. Huang.

156
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,140
I'm a fan of yours.

157
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,820
Mr. Huang.

158
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,240
Have a seat.

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,080
Have a seat.

160
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,680
Come on.

161
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,320
Here's the thing,

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
you two should sit down

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,140
and have a nice chat about the project.

164
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,660
There's no rush.

165
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,580
Jiayi, make Mr. Huang happy.

166
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,820
Hello.

167
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,200
How dare you hit me, bitch!

168
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,100
Liang Zhe, you bastard!

169
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,280
How can you do that to me?

170
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm calling the police.

171
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,200
Jiayi,

172
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,120
you're a superstar.

173
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,180
Aren't you afraid of making a big scene?

174
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,479
Aren't you afraid that
the reporters out there will find out?

175
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,500
Alright, if you're not afraid,

176
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,680
call the police.

177
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,540
Come on, call the police.

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,120
What do you take me for?

179
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,580
At least I used to be with you.

180
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,200
Shut up!

181
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,900
How do you have the audacity to say that?

182
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,406
You have no idea what kind of person you are?

183
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,040
Did you forget how you threw yourself at me?

184
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,340
If Jiang Nan didn't collapse after a setback,

185
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,080
why would I...

186
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,640
That's enough!

187
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,220
How dare you bring up Jiang Nan with me?

188
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,540
Jiayi,

189
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
if you loved me wholeheartedly,

190
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,200
I would never stir up so much trouble.

191
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,540
Just because you always
had Jiang Nan in your mind.

192
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,280
Do you think I'm stupid?

193
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,760
Let me tell you,

194
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
I can make you a star

195
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
and I can also destroy you.

196
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
What about Jiang Nan?

197
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,040
Wasn't he popular at the time?

198
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,260
I still managed to ruin his career.

199
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,040
What do you mean?

200
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,560
You set Jiang Nan up at the time?

201
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,220
Yes,

202
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,320
it was me.

203
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,460
I was the one who set him up.

204
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,200
How can he fight against me

205
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,320
with his abilities?

206
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,300
You were the one
who framed him for the assault too?

207
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,080
Yes,

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
it was me.

209
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,820
I'm telling you, Gu Jiayi.

210
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,680
A woman like you

211
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,960
means nothing to Jiang Nan.

212
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
When Jiang Nan collapsed after a setback,

213
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,820
you left him and presented yourself to me.

214
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,580
I believe

215
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,460
you're already a slut

216
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,840
in Jiang Nan's eyes.

217
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,760
A slut?

218
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,860
Cheng,

219
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,700
don't take anything on the news to heart.

220
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,320
Let's not have a wedding.

221
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,960
We can't do that.

222
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,013
Marriage is once in a lifetime event.

223
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:07,540
I want to give you a unique
and unmatched wedding.

224
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,960
But I think

225
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,860
But I think for me at the present,

226
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,040
no matter how fancy the wedding is,

227
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,360
it's meant for the guests.

228
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,840
I only care about

229
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,240
the ordinary days we have together.

230
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,700
Besides, if we have a wedding,

231
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,200
we'll surely have to invite family and friends.

232
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,520
My parents finally accepted the reality

233
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,420
and calmed down.

234
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,140
I don't want to...

235
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,320
Alright, our marriage is just between the two of us anyway.

236
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
We'll do it the way you want.

237
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,380
Jiang Nan,

238
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm already very happy to be with you.

239
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,520
Me too.

240
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,260
I'm tired.

241
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,260
Got it.

242
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Come on.

243
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,580
One, two, three.

244
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,100
Let's go.

245
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,704
<i>♫ I like your eyes ♫</i>

246
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:01,345
<i>♫ That even makes time seem gentle ♫</i>

247
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,732
<i>♫ As the wind blows behind your back ♫</i>

248
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:07,447
<i>♫ We walk forward hand in hand ♫</i>

249
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:11,782
<i>♫ If I can cross the entire universe ♫</i>

250
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:16,628
<i>♫ And the Milky Way to pick a planet for you ♫</i>

251
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:19,376
<i>♫ I'm willing to wait ♫</i>

252
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:22,145
<i>♫ Until we cross time and space till we grow old ♫</i>

253
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:24,223
<i>♫ Your gentleness like ♫</i>

254
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:27,052
<i>♫ Being among the stars ♫</i>

255
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:31,626
<i>♫ If we can inhabit any planet ♫</i>

256
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:37,035
<i>♫ Let's encounter in the universe ♫</i>

257
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you slacking off so early in the morning?

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,340
No, Master. Come take a look.

259
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,340
They are talking about Happy Family online.

260
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,520
Happy Family?

261
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,620
What's wrong with Happy Family now?

262
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't scare me.

263
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,340
Mrs. Xu, look.

264
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,280
Master,

265
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,780
isn't that Gu Jiayi's assistant?

266
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,960
Gu Jiayi was the one who planned

267
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,880
her allergy incident last time.

268
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,060
No wonder Gu Jiayi admitted that

269
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,020
she'll quit the entertainment business on Weibo.

270
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
That's good.

271
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,220
It's a good thing.

272
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,080
In any case,

273
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,960
we finally understand what really happened.

274
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Happy Family can open for business with dignity.

275
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,060
It's a good thing. You're right.

276
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,240
Lin, go check in the kitchen

277
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,040
and see what ingredients we need.

278
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,020
Go prepare them now.

279
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,700
Yes, Master.

280
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,400
Honey, it's a good thing.

281
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,020
You should be happy.

282
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,140
Yes.

283
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,920
We finally see some hope after all.

284
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,740
Let's do a good job running our restaurant

285
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,420
and make more money

286
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,400
to treat Cheng's disease.

287
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,500
<i>About P2P,</i>

288
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,920
<i>we already did that many times.</i>

289
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,740
<i>Don't tell anyone about it.</i>

290
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,200
<i>We'll be doomed if anyone hears about it.</i>

291
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,960
<i>Don't worry, Mr. Liang.</i>

292
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,120
<i>Everything is okay.</i>

293
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,720
<i>Don't worry.</i>

294
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,300
The long-term rental apartment

295
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,920
Steel Villa Liang Zhe and the others worked on

296
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,320
is busted.

297
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,680
This was obviously
a P2P illegal fundraising project

298
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,360
that made someone's poor relative
the legal person to take the fall.

299
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,340
Now, they're disinvesting
and trying to escape.

300
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,060
He was able to find such important evidence.

301
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,800
Your informer is pretty good.

302
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,640
What do you mean pretty good?

303
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,380
I don't know him at all.

304
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,600
Which stranger would
record something so important

305
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
and send it directly to you?

306
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,400
Gu Jiayi?

307
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,640
I received this email

308
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,440
right after she announced to
quit the entertainment business.

309
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,500
Gu Jiayi has the best chance of getting close to

310
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,660
Liang Zhe's dirty deeds.

311
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,920
Was Liang Zhe the one who posted

312
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,220
the video to expose Mei?

313
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,160
It must be him.

314
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,460
Gu Jiayi and Liang Zhe's confrontation

315
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,800
crashed the top search system.

316
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,480
Popular star Gu Jiayi admits
to framing the restaurant,

317
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,340
goddess turns Hypocrite.

318
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,980
This really is the most shocking news.

319
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,020
Well, I shouldn't let Gu Jiayi's
determination go to waste.

320
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,540
I recently collected a lot
of evidence on Liang Zhe.

321
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,460
It's time to make him pay the price.

322
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,360
That's right.

323
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,420
Liang Zhe stirred up so much trouble in secret.

324
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,020
We'll settle the scores all at once.

325
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,440
I heard Qi is leaving today.

326
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,840
How could she stay

327
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,880
after her patron collapsed?

328
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,200
I heard she submitted her
resignation letter and left overnight.

329
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,640
The entire industry knows about her

330
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,980
getting paid to write slanderous articles.

331
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm afraid no one will hire her in the future.

332
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,540
That's for sure.

333
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,420
Come on, take a look.

334
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,100
Popular Star Gu Jiayi
Quits Entertainment Business.

335
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,720
Entertainment Tycoon Liang Zhe Involved
in Illegal Fundraising.

336
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,440
Shan.

337
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,060
Thank you, everyone.

338
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,240
Wang Fei,

339
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,580
what would you like to drink?

340
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,860
Milk tea.

341
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,280
I've made a major decision today.

342
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm planning to take you all
on a team-building trip.

343
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,340
- That's great!
- Awesome!

344
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,080
Take a guess.

345
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,620
It's a very beautiful place.

346
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,280
Where is it?

347
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,700
Sanya, Sanya.

348
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,359
Aren't you a know-it-all?

349
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,259
<i>What are you doing?</i>

350
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,420
<i>It's for you.</i>

351
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,319
<i>What do you mean by this?</i>

352
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,000
<i>Take it.</i>

353
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,680
<i>Are you mad?</i>

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,660
<i>What are you doing?</i>

355
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,020
<i>Put me down!</i>

356
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,640
<i>Bao Rui!</i>

357
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,900
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

358
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,160
<i>Bao Rui!</i>

359
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,660
<i>Bao Rui.</i>

360
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,680
What are you doing?

361
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
May you be happy.

362
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,580
Stop right there.

363
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,860
I'll keep the promise I just made to you.

364
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,240
As long as we make it into Top 3 this month,

365
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,840
I'll take you all on a 7-Day trip to Sanya!

366
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,660
You can bring a family member!

367
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,680
Shan!

368
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,380
Are you happy?

369
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,560
I have one more ticket available.

370
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,380
Wish me happiness!

371
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,140
What are you smiling about?

372
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,900
I have first-hand information.

373
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,940
Lord Bao and Shan are officially together.

374
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,580
Really?

375
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,960
In that case,

376
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,700
we'll have to tease them

377
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,780
when Qin Shan invites us to lunch later.

378
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,960
I really didn't expect the two of them to be together.

379
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,980
That's serendipity,

380
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,320
just like us.

381
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,180
Someone is taking pictures.

382
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,790
<i>♫ One, two, three,
you opened the door to my heart ♫</i>

383
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>♫ I suddenly became slow ♫</i>

384
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,910
<i>♫ Like a wooden man ♫</i>

385
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,823
<i>♫ My longings asked me at night ♫</i>

386
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:39,678
<i>♫ How much do I mean to him ♫</i>

387
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,009
<i>♫ Why did I become strange ♫</i>

388
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:47,030
<i>♫ Every word of yours is hard to understand ♫</i>

389
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,783
<i>♫ The best plan ♫</i>

390
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:51,365
<i>♫ Is waiting across the crowd ♫</i>

391
00:19:51,365 --> 00:19:54,013
<i>♫ I don't want to wait any longer ♫</i>

392
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:57,363
<i>♫ One, two, three,
I'll be holding your hand forever ♫</i>

393
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,543
<i>♫ And never let you leave ♫</i>

394
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,483
<i>♫ I raise my head and look into your eyes ♫</i>

395
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:08,377
<i>♫ Sharing all my joys and sorrows with you ♫</i>

396
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:11,690
<i>♫ Don't be shy, I'll give you all my tenderness ♫</i>

397
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,794
<i>♫ And everything in the universe ♫</i>

398
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:20,010
<i>♫ As we walk, I reach out my hand ♫</i>

399
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:23,160
Come on.

400
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,020
Let's celebrate Shan's victorious return!

401
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,760
Let's take a drink.

402
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,360
Come on.

403
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,500
Come on, cheers!

404
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Shan, please look out for me in the future.

405
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,240
With me in between, that's nothing.

406
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, you should hurry up and make this relationship more stable.

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,640
Okay. Don't worry.

408
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,580
Well, I appreciate you all.

409
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,560
Thank you for being so supportive
of me all along.

410
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,540
It's my treat today. Have whatever you want.

411
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,780
Thank you, Shan.

412
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,020
Eat something first.

413
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,080
Don't drink a cold beverage
on an empty stomach. It's bad for your stomach.

414
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,560
Okay.

415
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,880
Are you still Shan I know?

416
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,960
What's your impression of me?

417
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
You're vigorous, resolute, pay no attention to trivial conventions,

418
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,240
eat apples with the skin,

419
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,340
and eat grapes without spitting seeds.

420
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,600
You probably had indigestion back then.

421
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,160
I used to think since you should
get credit for your hard work while I was away from True Image.

422
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,640
- I would give you a promotion now that I'm back. 
 -  Really?

423
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,340
But I don't think you were quite sensible back then.

424
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,300
Shan, my bad.

425
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,360
It was my fault.

426
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,260
Alright, alright. I'm happy today.

427
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,580
You can have your promotion.

428
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,220
Yes! Thank you, Shan.

429
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,340
Congratulations, Keqin.

430
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,980
Thank you.

431
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,960
By the way, we still haven't published the big scoop on Gu Jiayi and Liang Zhe's dogfight.

432
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,860
Don't tell anyone else.

433
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,240
Got it.

434
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,700
You'll be so busy when this explosive hot topic gets out in a few days.

435
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,740
Eat some more.

436
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,720
You're truly concerned about my sister, brother-in-law.

437
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,640
Don't call him that.

438
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
He's still on his trial period.

439
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,420
Let's eat. Let's eat.

440
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,400
- Let me tell you, I'll continue to...
- Peel a shrimp.

441
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,680
Okay.

442
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,540
I want a shrimp too.

443
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,120
I'll peel it for you.

444
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't want it.

445
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,800
Does it taste good?

446
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,580
That's so over-the-top.

447
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,360
How can you be so lovey-dovey
in front of single people?

448
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
It's too dangerous for you
to be holding this right now.

449
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,500
Give it to me.

450
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,580
I just want to make a dish for you.

451
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
Are you crying?

452
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,980
No.

453
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,020
It's the onion.

454
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,260
Even more reason for me to do it.

455
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,780
Don't you forget?

456
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,400
I learned my skills from my father-in-law.

457
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,000
Jiang Nan.

458
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,360
Xu Duocheng, why must you cut an onion out of everything?

459
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,300
Thank you.

460
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,060
Cheng, you and Jiang Nan are so sweet.

461
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
You're alright.

462
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,000
Keqin, I want you to be happy too.

463
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,860
Don't miss out on your Mr. Right.

464
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,100
What Mr. Right?

465
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,640
We've been besties for years.

466
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,200
Do you think I can't tell?

467
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,460
Do you swear I want you to be happy too.

468
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,260
This is from him.

469
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,940
<i>Are you free?</i>

470
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,880
<i>Let's meet up at Lake Yingyue at 8 pm tonight </i>

471
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,900
<i>and give each other an answer.</i>

472
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:09,895
Hi, are you Mr. Right?

473
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,244
Hi, Yu Keqin.

474
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:14,100
Why are you wearing a mask?

475
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,460
I think I'm more like

476
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,360
a virtual person to you.

477
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,640
That's why I'm wearing a mask.

478
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,360
I was never meant to be in your life.

479
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,020
A virtual person?

480
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,460
Are you saying you're AI, codes,

481
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,580
or a robot that was programmed to my liking?

482
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,040
That's not the point.

483
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,860
The point is I'm leaving.

484
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,560
I came specially to bid you farewell this time.

485
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,820
Farewell?

486
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,580
You came just to say goodbye?

487
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,820
I was afraid you'll...

488
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,860
Afraid of what?

489
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,720
Afraid that I'll miss you?

490
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Actually, I've immigrated a long time ago.

491
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,340
I won't come back again.

492
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,840
So, it won't work out between us.

493
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,100
Since it won't work out,

494
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,980
why won't you show me your true self during our one and only date?

495
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,120
I... My appearance is no longer important.

496
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,240
You've already met my soul.

497
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Chubby Zhu, you're still putting on an act in front of me?

498
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,040
you're still putting on an act in front of me?

499
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,280
What Chubby Zhu?

500
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,300
Keep pretending.

501
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,800
Stop! Stop right there!

502
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,900
Stop!

503
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,540
Don't run!

504
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,480
Keqin!

505
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,740
Keqin! Keqin!

506
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,700
Chubby Zhu!

507
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,480
Are you going to keep up with the disguise?

508
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,720
I said I like Modigliani's paintings

509
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,220
and you posted Modigliani's paintings on Weibo.

510
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
I said I like William Russel

511
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,660
and you forwarded all of his works.

512
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,880
I said I want to see the aurora in Iceland

513
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,040
and you posted aurora photos
for three days straight.

514
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,640
You're still not going to admit you're Mr. Right?

515
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm sorry, Keqin.

516
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,660
I know you don't like Zhu Linfeng.

517
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,280
But I want to show you another side of me.

518
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,420
When I see you falling head over heels for Mr. Right,

519
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,540
I really don't know how I should face you in the future.

520
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,800
That's why I had to put on a mask when you suddenly asked to see me.

521
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,960
I'm really afraid you'll hate me more when you find outf

522
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,300
Zhu Linfeng is Mr. Right.

523
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,460
You are

524
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,860
really annoying.

525
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,860
I've decided to sell this house.

526
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,800
What?

527
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,960
I mean, I want to sell this house and move to another place.

528
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,440
Why?

529
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,120
Don't you think the decoration of this house is completely wrong?

530
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,760
You were the one who designed every detail of this house.

531
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,920
Why is it completely wrong now?

532
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,600
Look at this staircase.

533
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,460
How can Cheng go up and down
the floor in the future?

534
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,880
And the bathroom, the floor tiles aren't skid-resistant.

535
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,260
The hallway is too narrow.

536
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,880
Anyway, the house should be modeled based on Cheng's needs.

537
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,920
Most importantly, there's no privacy in this place.

538
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,200
Everyone knows I live here now.

539
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,020
Cheng's condition will only worsen over time.

540
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,100
I don't want too much attention on her.

541
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,240
You're very thoughtful.

542
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,060
Do you have any requirements? Let me hear them.

543
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,740
It needs to have spacious motion lines, a garden, and a lawn.

544
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,220
In that case, we can sunbathe during the day and look at the stars at night.

545
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,120
Cheng won't be bored if she stays at home.

546
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,240
There's more, it needs to be close to Happy Family.

547
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,760
That way, it's convenient
for her parents to visit.

548
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,320
It can't be too far from the hospital either,

549
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,160
within a 20 minutes driving distance.

550
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,880
There's more. Cheng likes dogs.

551
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,460
It would be better if we can keep one.

552
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,660
Are you finished?

553
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,060
That's all I can think of for now.

554
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,760
In conclusion,
there are just two requirements.

555
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,040
One, it needs to be convenient for her condition.

556
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,780
Two, it needs to have a nice environment and privacy.

557
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,440
That's it.

558
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
Just two requirements?

559
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,980
I can't do it.

560
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,240
I'm begging you.

561
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,260
As long as you find the house for me,

562
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,340
I will give all my exclusive interviews to Qin Shan.

563
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,920
Well, let me tell you, not everyone can handle Qin Shan's interviews.

564
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,260
Can you do it?

565
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,480
Why can't I?

566
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,780
- Go claim your credit. 
 - Okay.

567
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,800
From now on, you are legally Mrs. Jiang.

568
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,760
Mr. Jiang, please kindly give me your advice in the future.

569
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,720
Mr. Jiang?

570
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,840
Honey.

571
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,520
- What is it, honey? 
 - Where are we going later?

572
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,000
It's a secret. You'll know when we get there.

573
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,800
Where are we?

574
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,260
This is our new home.

575
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:39,518
<i>♫ Remember the first time we met ♫</i>

576
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:47,526
<i>♫ Both of us were unprepared ♫</i>

577
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:55,553
<i>♫ No time to hesitate, we're running out of time ♫</i>

578
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,680
Why did you hang it here?

579
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,080
This music score is our token of affection.

580
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,633
Of course I have to hang it
in the most prominent place.

581
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:15,628
<i>♫ You and I will both try hard to be reasonable ♫</i>

582
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:18,285
<i>♫ That's all we can do ♫</i>

583
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:23,135
<i>♫ It's our tacit understanding ♫</i>

584
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:26,767
<i>♫ Without a word ♫</i>

585
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,448
<i>♫ We'll end it with a smile ♫</i>

586
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:32,485
<i>♫ Oh, at this moment ♫</i>

587
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:35,882
<i>♫ The past ends with one final note ♫</i>

588
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:39,450
<i>♫ The skill to forget ♫</i>

589
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,500
<i>♫ But I can never perfect ♫</i>

590
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,081
<i>♫ I wish you would hold my hands ♫</i>

591
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:50,630
<i>♫ But you're stuck in the memories of the past ♫</i>

592
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,487
<i>♫ Ten thousand kilometers ♫</i>

593
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:57,662
<i>♫ Is the distance between the dawn and midnight ♫</i>

594
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,791
<i>♫ Oh, at this moment ♫</i>

595
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:04,165
<i>♫ It's not how it used to be ♫</i>

596
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:07,648
<i>♫ But it feels so real ♫</i>

597
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:11,998
<i>♫ I cannot turn my eyes away ♫</i>

598
00:34:11,998 --> 00:34:15,294
<i>♫ The most painful distance ♫</i>

599
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:19,107
<i>♫ The late winter when I long for you ♫</i>

600
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,480
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

601
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,039
That's not enough.

602
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,940
There's more.

603
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,740
Cheng, I will always stay by your side.

604
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,160
What is this?

605
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,280
It's you.

606
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,760
Me?

607
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,660
An orange tree?

608
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,880
I have an orange tree.

609
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,980
More precisely, it's an orange sapling.

610
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,260
Little orange, when will you grow up?

611
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,880
Little orange sapling, please grow up fast.

612
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,480
We have such a big yard.

613
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,300
Why didn't you plant it on the ground?

614
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
I looked it up.

615
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,560
Orange saplings need
to be planted in a pot first.

616
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,480
When its roots and branches become slightly stronger,

617
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,080
we can transplant it to the ground.

618
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,460
You even did the research?

619
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,760
Well, do you know how to water it?

620
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,680
I already planted the orange sapling for you.

621
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,560
What's so hard about watering it?

622
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,920
Is it like this?

623
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,500
Xu Duocheng!

624
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,960
<i>Jiang Nan, I used to think destiny has been cruel to me.</i>

625
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,940
<i>When I met you, I finally realized</i>

626
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,540
<i>the chances of encountering
extreme good luck or bad luck</i>

627
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,080
<i>are as slim as hitting the jackpot.</i>

628
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,380
<i>But for me, I hit the jackpot twice</i>

629
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,660
<i>Destiny is already kind enough to me</i>

630
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,280
<i>for having you during the last days of my life.</i>

631
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,980
<i>I will surely try my best to stay by your side for as long as I can.</i>

632
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,860
<i>If I really can't speak</i>

633
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,200
<i>or move someday,</i>

634
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,260
<i>I believe I can still put on a smile for you.</i>

635
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:57,960
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you by</i>
