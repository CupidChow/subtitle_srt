00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,765 --> 00:00:13,732
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,732 --> 00:00:15,923
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:19,277
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:24,447
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:30,279
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,124
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,544
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:38,911
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,576
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:44,370
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,411
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:51,084
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,823
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,464
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:58,751
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:01,566
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:05,801
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:10,647
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:13,495
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:16,164
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:18,342
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:21,071
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:25,745
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:30,954
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:45,087
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:49,050

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,180
Where's the cut on your arm?

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,540
What cut?

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,880
I burnt myself.

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,980
Jiang Nan,

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,960
what are you doing?

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,400
Gu Jia Yi, I've really underestimated you.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,420
You're not just cruel to yourself.

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,580
You are even crueler to those around you.

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,340
Jiang Nan, stop right there!

37
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,960
How can you accuse me without any proof?

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,240
You know exactly what you did.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
What's wrong with your arm?

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,100
Wasn't it cut by the glass?

41
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,040
How did it turn into a burn?

42
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,460
Sister, President Liang helped take care of this cut.

43
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,640
He said the cut was noticeable

44
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,880
and we must be prepared for all contingencies.

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,220
Sister, just accept your fate.

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,760
We will never be able to escape President Liang's control.

47
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,080
Let me do it.

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,820
You're home.

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
What's wrong?

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
You were so anxious when you left

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,020
and you came back in such a bad mood.

52
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,760
I just went to see Gu Jia Yi.

53
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,080
Are you suspecting that person isn't an anti-fan

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,300
but someone related to Gu Jia Yi?

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,400
Don't take me as an idiot.

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
When you asked me if that person had any special features,

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,820
I knew you didn't trust Gu Jia Yi anymore.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,880
You're right.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,000
There's a scar like the one you described on Xiao Mei's arm, Gu Jia Yi's assistant,

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,040
but when I went to see her, the wound became a burn.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,240
Even though now I know it was Xiao Mei,

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,639
we don't have any evidence to accuse her.

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Misfortunes might be blessings in disguise.

64
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,620
Although Happy Family Restaurant had a close call,

65
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,040
this incident also further proves our quality.

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Isn't that still free publicity?

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
You're pretty optimistic.

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,940
Didn't you teach me to be optimistic?

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,840
Since there are things we can't change,

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,680
then we shouldn't be so persistent.

71
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,060
We should learn to let go.

72
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,720
You're the boss.

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,920
All right, get yourself together.

74
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,340
We still need to go to Happy Family Restaurant today.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,940
 Since we cleared our name today,

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,860
 we should gather together and celebrate.

77
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,240
All of your contributions cannot go unnoticed.

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,980
In my life, I haven't made it big

79
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,460
and I'm not good at anything else, except cooking.

80
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,940
So I made a whole table of dishes today.

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,320
Here's a toast to you all.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,480
- Cheers! 
 - Come on, let's do it together.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,120
- Let's drink. 
 - Cheers! Come on. Cheers!

84
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,480
Well, I need to make a toast to Jiang Nan and Xiao Zhan.

85
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,660
We must especially thank the two for helping Happy Family Restaurant get back on track.

86
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,460
I'll drink first out of respect.

87
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,380
You two should eat and drink to your content.

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,480
- Okay, okay. 
 - Thank you, Auntie.

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,240
Auntie, as for eating and drinking, I won't be reserved.

90
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,380
Please, don't be reserved.  Don't drink so much.

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,800
- Xiao Zhan is such a good boy. 
 - Eat, eat, eat.

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
I really regret it. We should've given Cheng Cheng a younger sister.

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,880
Look at the two of them.

94
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,540
What are you talking about?

95
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,240
Well... I want to make a toast to the two of you too.

96
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,580
Thank you for helping us so much.

97
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,340
Plus, it's so good to see you two reconcile again.

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,640
Jiang Nan, you have to be good to Xu Duo Cheng.

99
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,360
Otherwise, I'll be here.

100
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,560
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,200
What about me?

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,780
Big Lin, I know you've always liked Cheng Cheng.

103
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,920
I really appreciate you.

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,900
All these years, you've taken such good care of her.

105
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
From now on, you can count on me.

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,980
- Don't worry. 
 - How can you guarantee that?

107
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,180
What are you saying?

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,120
What are you doing?

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,620
I want to marry her.

110
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Although this came really suddenly,

111
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,353
I've actually imagined it many times.

112
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,340
But I think now is a good time.

113
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,840
It's simple and everyone is here.

114
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,040
While everyone is here,

115
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,140
I want to announce with sincerity that

116
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,940
I want to marry Cheng Cheng.

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,600
Uncle, Auntie. Please, trust me and give me a chance.

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,540
Please, give me Cheng Cheng's hand in marriage.

119
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,400
I approve.

120
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:50,047
As long as Cheng Cheng is happy, I approve too.

121
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,560
Congratulations!

122
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,140
Sit, sit, sit.

123
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,620
Jiang Nan, thank you for making my parents happy.

124
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,100
Who said I was just trying to make them happy?

125
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,360
I did it for the rest of my life.

126
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,700
Besides, your parents already agreed.

127
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,840
It's already too late to regret your choice.

128
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,800
Jiang Nan, have you really thought it through?

129
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm very sure,

130
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,120
and I've thought it through over and over again.

131
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
But...

132
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,260
But I'll be a bride with chicken-feet hands.

133
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,160
My condition will only get worse.

134
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,980
I'll be in a wheelchair.

135
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,760
In time,

136
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,900
I won't even be able to sit in a wheelchair and will be bedridden.

137
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,040
After that, I will...

138
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,740
Not be able to move at all?

139
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,900
I know all of that. I'm willing.

140
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,680
I want to be by your side forever.

141
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,140
Now,

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,420
I want to know your answer.

143
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,840
How did you find it?

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,460
Even if you throw it away a hundred times, a thousand times,

145
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,700
I'll always find it.

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,440
Just like here, in this mysterious world,

147
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
I found the most important person in my life.

148
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,420
Ms. Xu Duo Cheng, will you marry me?

149
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,620
I...

150
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,950
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

151
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,030
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

152
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,870
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

153
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,864
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

154
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,972
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

155
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:12,932
â™«  In this universe, I will...  â™«

156
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:16,740
It's too late to say anything now.

157
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,420
Do I look nice?

158
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,020
So ugly.

159
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,580
Cheng Cheng, I want to thank you.

160
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,800
Thank you for supporting me when I was a nobody.

161
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,260
Thank you for believing in me when I was down.

162
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,620
You sound like you're giving an award speech.

163
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,600
That's right.

164
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,580
That's what I'll say when I'm the winner of Cool Singer-Songwriters.

165
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,440
Are you serious?

166
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,260
Lord Bao would nag you to death.

167
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,900
Also, my aunt called me a few days ago.

168
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,880
She said my mom is getting better and better.

169
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
She can basically take care of herself.

170
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,560
In that case, let's go visit her at the village

171
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,600
and tell her we're getting married.

172
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,940
Okay?

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

174
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,780
Honey.

175
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,120
Honey.

176
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,100
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

177
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,580
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

178
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,040
 Ke Qin, Jiang Nan and I are getting married.

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,300
 That's wonderful!

180
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,280
 Congratulations, Orange!

181
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,780
 Ke Qin, these are the photos I took recently.

182
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,740
He's a pretty good photographer.

183
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,780
He's quite a talented one.

184
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,220
All right, Chubby Zhu. You're trolling me?

185
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,820
Just wait.

186
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,420
Which one do you want?

187
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,560
I like anything you pick out.

188
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,480
Can you show me this one?

189
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,980
Sir, you have very good taste.

190
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,640
This is the featured item of our store this season. It's two carats.

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,920
Miss, what's your ring size?

192
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,200
I can help you try it on.

193
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,640
I don't know either.

194
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,880
I've never bought a ring for my ring finger.

195
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,140
You don't need to measure it. Size 7.

196
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,980
- Wrap it up. 
 - Okay, one moment, please.

197
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,160
How do you know?

198
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Don't worry. It definitely won't be wrong.

199
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,720
I sneaked in and measured it when you were sleeping one night.

200
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,100
 Will you marry me?

201
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
What took you so long?

202
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,860
Why did you ask to see me all of a sudden?

203
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,320
What's wrong?

204
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,100
Orange is getting married soon.

205
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm in a good mood.

206
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,100
You look different today.

207
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,280
- How am I different? 
 - Your lips.

208
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,940
That's right. It's a man-trap shade. 
  (TN: Red based lip colors)

209
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,380
Does it look good?

210
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,420
My goodness.

211
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,080
Are you still the Yu Ke Qin I know?

212
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,700
Can't I make some changes?

213
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,080
I have a crush on someone now.

214
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,300
My prince charming, Mr. Right, likes gentle and meek girls.

215
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,240
When did I say...

216
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,560
What did you say?

217
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,220
I mean, you've only known each other for a few days.

218
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,320
How is he your prince charming?

219
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,180
Haven't you seen how many ignorant girls fell into traps set by their cyber-lover?

220
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,600
You don't understand.

221
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,240
Have you met your soulmate?

222
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,880
It's someone who you've never met

223
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,260
but somehow you're bound together by the mysterious power.

224
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,480
 He still won't admit it?

225
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,840
 I don't believe you won't expose yourself.

226
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,500
He also likes Modigliani's paintings, William Russell,

227
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,720
and auroras.

228
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
I'll show you his photography work.

229
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,020
Look at his photography skills and look at yours.

230
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,900
But these are my...

231
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,620
What did you say?

232
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,860
I said my photos are really good too,

233
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,020
but you never care when I show them to you.

234
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,500
 Recently, I don't like Modigliani anymore.

235
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,520
 I love Chagall now.

236
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,060
 Dummy, you want to fool me?

237
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,960
Cai Yun.

238
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,440
Son.

239
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,920
Mom, you can really recognize me now?

240
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,540
Cai Yun, we bought these for you.

241
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,460
It's your favorite tea.

242
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,720
Thank you, Cheng Cheng.

243
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
Cheng Cheng, although I like you,

244
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,640
it doesn't seem appropriate for you to call me by my name, right?

245
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,080
Sorry, Cai...

246
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,280
I'm sorry, Auntie.

247
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,780
I got used to it.  It's hard to change it immediately.

248
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,200
You don't have to call me "Auntie" either.

249
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,600
You can just call me "Mom".

250
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,940

251
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,540
 After many years of silence, he's back in the spotlight.

252
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,140
 - On the stage, he's a singer who moved and brought...  
 - Hurry, hurry.

253
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,780
 - ...countless surprises to the audience.  
 - Hurry and sit.

254
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,420
 Jiang Nan!

255
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,780
Since Jiang Nan has participated in the Cool Singer-Songwriters show,

256
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,920
I've watched every episode here.

257
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,240
You're wonderful.

258
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
That's for sure.

259
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,980
- Right? 
 - Yes.

260
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,360
 His girlfriend, whom he warmheartedly protects, has a terminal disease.

261
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,800
 In his private life, he's the caring and affectionate Jiang Nan

262
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,159
 who shows his girlfriend with ALS the utmost solicitude...

263
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,760
Wait, what does this mean?

264
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,480
What did they mean by "an incurable disease"?

265
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,460
Why did they say Cheng Cheng has an incurable disease?

266
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,160
Exactly. Even if they want ratings, they can't do this.

267
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,680
It's so irresponsible! They're spewing nonsense.

268
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,900
That's right. It's...

269
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,280
It's pure nonsense.

270
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,200
That's so out of line!

271
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,740
Shut it off!

272
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,060
Honey, should we call Cheng Cheng and ask what's going on?

273
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,540
Are you confused from working too hard?

274
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,840
Didn't Cheng Cheng go with Jiang Nan to visit his mom?

275
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,280
Is it appropriate to call her right now?

276
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,300
That's right. It's an important occasion.

277
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Let's not disturb them.

278
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,580
Let's wait. Let's wait until she comes back.

279
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,660
We'll ask her when she comes back.

280
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,880
It's fine. I'm sure it's fine.

281
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,660
Cheng Cheng, is this true?

282
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,000
Mom, I've been aware of Cheng Cheng's condition all along.

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,180
That's exactly why I'm determined to marry her.

284
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,340
I don't want to miss out on all the days we have together.

285
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,000
Auntie,

286
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,340
Silly girl, what are you saying?

288
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,780
I won't object to you two being together.

289
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,160
On the contrary, I support you two more than anyone else.

290
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,860
Jiang Nan's father didn't tell me when he was first diagnosed with cancer either.

291
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,080
When I discovered it myself, he was already at the terminal stage.

292
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,800
I didn't get the chance to be by his side

293
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
and take care of him.

294
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,720
That might be the most painful memory and the biggest regret of my life.

295
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,820
So, I hope you and Jiang Nan will be together.

296
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Otherwise,

297
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:41,460
he might go down my old path.

298
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,940
This is part of my dowry.

299
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,100
I've always worn it.

300
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm giving it to you now.

301
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,620
No matter how hard life will be,

302
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,720
no matter how long you'll live,

303
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,420
it's always a happiness to be with the one you love.

304
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,740
Hello?

305
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,300
We'll talk about Cheng Cheng's condition later.

306
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,560
Go tell Alex I want to quit the competition!

307
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,060
Quit the competition? Lao Jiang, don't be worked up.

308
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,160
I already contacted the program team. They said they'd pull down the video immediately.

309
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,660
What's the point of doing that now?

310
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,940
Cheng Cheng tried so hard to keep it a secret because she didn't want everyone to worry.

311
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,660
Those vile people actually took advantage of her.

312
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,380
Yes, I already pulled all the strings I could to minimize the impact of this incident.

313
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,020
 The best solution is for me to quit the competition!

314
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,380
He planned this from the start.

315
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,580
He was waiting for the best chance to expose Cheng Cheng's condition.

316
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,460
 He wasn't convinced by Cheng Cheng to let me participate in the show.

317
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,620
It's because he thinks Cheng Cheng's condition is a big selling point for the show!

318
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,160
I will not let this type of despicable person get his way.

319
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,180
That's right. I'm also really angry right now,

320
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,800
but if you quit the competition now, all the efforts we made will be in vain.

321
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,980
Plus, it's highly likely the production team will sue us for breaching the contract.

322
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,000
They were the ones to breach the contract first. Why should they sue us?

323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,180
It's just that someone like Alex is capable of doing anything.

324
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,660
I don't care what they do. Tell them to come at me.

325
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,820
I will never make any compromises about anything that will hurt Cheng Cheng!

326
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,020
 I'll leave it to you to release a statement about quitting the competition.

327
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,180
If they want to sue me, I'll respond to it.

328
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,200
Don't worry.

329
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,520
Cheng Cheng, let me ask you.

330
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,080
What they said on TV, were they lying?

331
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,960
Cheng Cheng, tell me the truth.

332
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,520
Did you hurt your hand from a fall?

333
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't believe what they said on TV.

334
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,060
I want to hear it from you.

335
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,560
Cheng Cheng, tell me.

336
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,040
Tell us, darling.

337
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,200
What they said on the TV is true.

338
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,760
I do have ALS.

339
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,460
- Wait. 
 - Wait...

340
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,720
What is ALS?

341
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,160
Wh-Wh-What is A-ALS?

342
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,620
Wait, you confused me.

343
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,820
How did you get ALS? Where did you get the diagnosis?

344
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,560
Xiao Jiang, this must be a misdiagnosis.

345
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,760
- It must be a misdiagnosis, right? 
 - It's a misdiagnosis.

346
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,550
- It must be a misdiagnosis. 
 - How about this? We'll go to another hospital and get you re-examined.

347
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,120
It's all right. You'll be fine.

348
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,560
I've been getting treatments at the hospital for six months.

349
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,800
Six months?

350
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,200
Six months?

351
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,020
Six months?

352
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,240
How is it six months?

353
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,980
You k-kept your condition from us for six months?

354
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,840
Why didn't you... Why didn't you tell us in the past six months?

355
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,400
What have we done to you?

356
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,500
Why didn't you tell us? We don't even have the right to know? Why?

357
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,540
Dad, don't be like this.

358
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,040
Then what do you want me to do?

359
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,500
Uncle, Auntie, Cheng Cheng just didn't want you to worry.

360
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,340
You stay quiet for now.

361
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,000
No.

362
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,780
No, no, no.

363
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,300
How's this? Here's the thing.

364
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,260
- What's wrong? 
 - Let's go to the hospital right now.

365
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,160
Let's go to the hospital. Medical treatments are really advanced now.

366
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,220
You can be cured. You can definitely be cured.

367
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,900
I'm willing to pay any price to cure your disease.

368
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,180
Don't be afraid, darling. Don't be afraid. Come on, come with me.

369
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,800
- Come with me! Come with me! 
 - Uncle! Uncle, please calm down!

370
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,560
- Come with me! Let's go! 
- Uncle! Uncle! 
 - Dad!

371
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,680
ALS is incurable!

372
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,060
It's incurable?

373
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,800
As your father, it's been six months and I didn't know about it.

374
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,800
My daughter was suffering alone.

375
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,680
What kind of good father am I?

376
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,280
I was negligent and I didn't help at all.

377
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,880
What am I? What am I?

378
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,720
- What am I? What am I? 
 - Uncle! Uncle! 
 - Dad, don't do be like this!

379
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,160
Calm down, Uncle!

380
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,820
What am I?

381
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,600
- Uncle! 
 - Dad, don't be like this!

382
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,700
- Uncle! 
 - I'm not a human!

383
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm not a human...

384
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,950
Don't cry.

385
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,600
I feel even worse if you are like this.

386
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:25,580
You, go pack your things and move back!

387
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,300
I promise you, I'll move back home.

388
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,100
Now that I'm suddenly leaving, I really feel a little reluctant.

389
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,300
I'll save your room here for you forever.

390
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,600
You can come to stay for a few days, whenever you feel like you've been at home for too long.

391
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,460
 Xu Duo Cheng!

392
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,760
Ke Qin?

393
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,640
 Xu Duo Cheng!

394
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,040
Xu Duo Cheng, what do you take me for?

395
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,600
We're best friends. Do I have to find out about something like this from the news?

396
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,960
Why didn't you answer my calls? I was worried sick!

397
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,700
Ke Qin, I'm sorry

398
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,220
All the reporters started to hound me once they heard the news.

399
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,240
I had no choice but to turn my phone off.

400
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I wasn't deliberately trying to hide it from you.

401
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,920
When I first found out about my condition,

402
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,040
I was at a loss about what to do.

403
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,620
I don't want to leave you with the ugliest and most embarrassing impression of me.

404
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,060
Are you stupid?

405
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,660
How can you bear with something like this alone?

406
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,240
Orange, I will be your arms and legs from now on.

407
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,980
Even if you can't walk or move anymore,

408
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,320
I will always be there with you.

409
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,200
Even if I have to carry you,

410
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,920
I'll carry you to go shopping and watch movies, just like we used to do.

411
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,760
All right.

412
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,720
Ke Qin, why don't we take Cheng Cheng home together?

413
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,820
You're moving back home?

414
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,980
My parents still don't know Jiang Nan and I are living together.

415
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,880
They think it's more convenient for them to take care of me if I move home.

416
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,400
I want to spend more time with them as well.

417
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,240
Stop looking at it, honey.

418
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,160
Don't you know how much money we have?

419
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,320
Don't worry, I'll find a way to get the money.

420
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Honey, be careful not to suffer from excessive internal heat.

421
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,920
We'll be doomed if you collapse.

422
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,040
Don't worry.

423
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,820
I won't let myself collapse.

424
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,240
Okay.

425
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm planning to take our daughter to Beijing in a few days.

426
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,700
They have better medical resources in Beijing.

427
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,380
Maybe there's still hope.

428
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,900
Besides, I looked it up on the internet.

429
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,620
There's a 1% chance of curing this disease.

430
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,060
I was thinking, our daughter is so kind.

431
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:39,180
Maybe she's... she's that 1%, right?

432
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,320
Even if there's only a 0.01% chance,

433
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,640
we still have to try.

434
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,720
We'll go. We'll go.

435
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,780
We'll definitely go. We'll definitely go.

436
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,400
 Hello, Lao Jiang. I already released the statement about quitting the competition,

437
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,660
 but Alex hasn't confirmed about terminating the contract.

438
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,240
 I think he wants to drag it out and see if there's any room for things to change.

439
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,560
Make it very clear to him. This is non-negotiable.

440
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,080
If he dares to hurt Xu Duo Cheng again, I won't spare him!

441
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,020
 Why was Xu Duo Cheng's condition exposed?

442
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,720
 Do you guys have a countermeasure?

443
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,520
 You should comfort Xu Duo Cheng's parents first.

444
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,900
 Call me at anytime if you need help.

445
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,720
 Don't worry.

446
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,080
 It's all been taken care of.

447
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,560
 Thank you.

448
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,120
 Are you all right?

449
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,200
 She must've been so frantic and sad today.

450
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,580
 What's the point of such a surface level greeting?

451
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,120
 Maybe I shouldn't disturb her and her family.

452
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,580
 Your condition is no longer a secret between the three of us.

453
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,140
 Will you still need me in the future?

454
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,180
 Will I still be the first in line to stay by your side and protect you?

455
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm not sad.

456
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,040
I think it's a good thing.

457
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,580
Don't worry.

458
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,220
From now on, our family will never be apart.

459
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,060
Be good, go to sleep.

460
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,620
Xu Duo Cheng has an incurable disease?

461
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,880
Then I still have one last hope.

462
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,919
Sister, although Jiang Nan already released a statement about quitting the competition,

463
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,400
he didn't respond to Xu Duo Cheng's condition at all.

464
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,720
I assume he's already mentally prepared.

465
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,980
As a celebrity's girlfriend,

466
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,740
it's bad enough that she can't help him with his life and career.

467
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,139
Now, she even caused him to quit the competition.

468
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,800
Even if we accept that, would his fans accept it?

469
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,820
That's perfect.

470
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,380
We can use the power of media to tell more of his fans about this.

471
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,260
Hello.

472
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,920

473
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,020
Manager Yang, you've probably already read about my condition on the internet.

474
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,080
I really can't continue to teach anymore.

475
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,460
You don't have to be hands-on, just teach by speech.

476
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,780
You love playing piano so much.

477
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,340
Are you just going to give up?

478
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,100
Exactly. The students and parents really like you

479
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,600
and want you to continue teaching.

480
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,740
I know how difficult it is to learn the piano.

481
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,540
Therefore, I really can't delay them.

482
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,560
I want to see them find a better teacher

483
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,380
and fluently play songs as soon as possible.

484
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Although I didn't want Cheng Cheng to teach here at first,

485
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,740
I want to thank you for taking care of her.

486
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,880
Don't mention it.

487
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,080
If it weren't for you, I would've missed out on Xu Duo Cheng.

488
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,320
Let's go then.

489
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
You're all here.

490
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,220
Why are you here?

491
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,600
I'm here for a lesson.

492
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
I haven't yet finished all the lessons I bought here.

493
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,420
I just quit today. I can't teach you anymore.

494
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,880
You should find another teacher.

495
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,560
- Ms. Xu! 
 - Ms. Xu!

496
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,940
How does it affect you, now that you've been exposed as a patient with ALS?

497
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,700
Or, did the two of you deliberately leak it to the production team?

498
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,860
At the current time, ALS is incurable.

499
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,180
At the last moments of your life, is there anything you would like to say?

500
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,000
Are you crazy? What kind of reporter are you?

501
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,280
How can you ask a patient a question like that?

502
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,300
By the way, netizens are really curious about your condition.

503
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,220
If you can't be cured, will it be a burden to Jiang Nan?

504
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,680
Will your limbs become deformed during the late stages of ALS?

505
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,100
Do you think you're still a good match for Jiang Nan?

506
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,540
Let me answer your questions.

507
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,220
I will not participate in the final round of Cool Singer-Songwriters,

508
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,060
neither will Xu Duo Cheng.

509
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,400
There are some bodily changes during the late stages of ALS,

510
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,880
but no matter what, she will always be the most beautiful girl in my eyes.

511
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,000
Besides, this is a private matter between us.

512
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,360
It has nothing to do with you.

513
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,040
Although she has ALS, as long as she cooperates with her treatments,

514
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,120
she can prolong her life.

515
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,060
There are diagnosed patients who continue to live for another ten to twenty years.

516
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,620
Lastly,

517
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,800
even if Xu Duo Cheng is no longer around in the future,

518
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,420
the memories we have are enough for me to reminisce.

519
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:35,020
With these memories, I will continue to live well by myself.

520
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:54,030

521
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:05,004
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

522
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:11,462
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

523
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:19,316
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

524
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:25,062
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

525
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:28,688
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

526
00:38:28,688 --> 00:38:32,652
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

527
00:38:32,652 --> 00:38:39,188
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

528
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:42,568
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

529
00:38:42,568 --> 00:38:44,422
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

530
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,688
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

531
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:49,701
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

532
00:38:49,701 --> 00:38:53,456
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

533
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,887
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

534
00:38:56,887 --> 00:39:00,908
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

535
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:05,161
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

536
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:07,891
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

537
00:39:07,891 --> 00:39:11,241
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

538
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:15,421
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

539
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,361
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

540
00:39:18,361 --> 00:39:22,155
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

541
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:25,568
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

542
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:29,572
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

543
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:33,839
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

544
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,269
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

545
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:58,255
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

546
00:39:58,255 --> 00:40:02,219
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

547
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:08,603
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

548
00:40:08,603 --> 00:40:12,047
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

549
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:16,127
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

550
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:19,167
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

551
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,961
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

552
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:26,374
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

553
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:30,378
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

554
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:34,568
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

555
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:40,716
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
