1
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,760
Chengcheng,

2
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,000
it's me.

3
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,640
Your dad,

4
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,480
open the door.

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,280
What's wrong?

6
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,440
My dad is here.

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,240
Your dad is here.

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
What should we do?

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,040
How would I know what to do?

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
Hide yourself first.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Chengcheng,

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,639
Chengcheng, open the door?

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
-Clothes! -Give

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,160
it to me!

15
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,680
Then we've communicated

16
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,680
on WeChat.

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,600
Dad, why are you here?

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,160
Why did you open the door so late, girl?

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,520
Well

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,880
How can Keqin eat so much?

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,880
She has too much work to do.

22
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,360
So I ate a lot.

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
I didn't even have time to have a bite of the meal.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
So I was asked to go on a business trip again.

25
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
I ordered takeout

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,120
at a glance. Okay,

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,200
I brought you something

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
delicious. Dad,

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,320
Put the food here.

30
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,600
Go back now.

31
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,080
It's late and I'll worry about you.

32
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,240
And it's not safe.

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
What are you talking about? Dad

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,840
kicked me out

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,960
as soon as he got here, right?

36
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
No, I didn't.

37
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,280
I miss you.

38
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,800
I'll stay with you for two days,

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
not with me, Dad.

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
Don't worry about me.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
You see, Family Fun's business is so busy,

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,280
it's too far away from Family Fun.

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
It's not convenient for you to go.

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,560
Honey,

45
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,880
I've been working as a chef for so many years,

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
It's time to have a rest.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,240
Besides,

48
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
give them a chance.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,080
How about those disciples?

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
Let's go through it.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,200
Right?

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Look at

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,520
the living room.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
This big sofa

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,800
is soft.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,200
What's wrong, daughter?

57
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,880
Dad, are you welcome?

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,360
Welcome,

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,440
Dad,

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,279
I think,

61
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,519
look, we two girls live here.

62
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
You're a grown man here.

63
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
It's really inconvenient.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,320
Besides, we only have two bedrooms,

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,640
and there is no place for you to sleep.

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
Yes,

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,040
this sofa is great.

68
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll sleep on the sofa.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,840
Besides, my daughter,

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
it's a waste for you two to live in such a big room.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
Now that Keqin is on a business trip again,

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,480
how unsafe is it for you to be alone?

73
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
When I was downstairs just now,

74
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
I met a big man,

75
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,840
So fierce.

76
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,040
No, dad.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,080
It's safer

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
if dad is here.

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,840
Dad, where are you going?

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,520
Me,

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,080
Go to

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
the kitchen. The kitchen

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,480
is confused.

84
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
I'll heat this dish up for you.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,840
It's getting a little cold.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,040
From now on,

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,800
let me tell you,

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,240
Don't always order takeout.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
It's not good for your health.

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,360
Got it.

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
Work hard

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,240
and do it yourself.

93
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Dad,

94
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
let me take you to a place.

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:19,880
No, no.

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,480
Where are you going?

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,720
Huo Huo,

98
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,720
don't worry about this.

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Where are you taking me?

100
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,200
Hurry up.

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,400
Just take a look and you'll know.

102
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
I'll heat up the dishes

103
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,040
for you. Let's talk about it later.

104
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's go.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,560
Push me slowly.

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Slowly. Slowly.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,920
No

108
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,720
-Sit here. -Sit here. -No, what are

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,520
you doing?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,680
No, Miss,

111
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,000
Sit down,

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,720
I can't sit still.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,840
I'm still warming up the dishes.

114
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,640
You.

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
Dad, what are you doing?

116
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
My father and daughter

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
haven't watched a movie together for a long time.

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,240
Yes.

119
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,440
Don't you like watching movies the most?

120
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,160
I do.

121
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,680
We'll talk about it later.

122
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,360
No, no, no.

123
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
I prepared your favorite movie

124
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
for you today.

125
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
But you,

126
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,720
do you know what kind of movie I like to watch?

127
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,960
Charlie's angels,

128
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,200
someone's coming,

129
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,320
-Let me do it. -Dad.

130
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,240
Who is it?

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,440
Uncle,

132
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,400
you're here.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
Jiang Nan, it's so late.

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,840
Why are you here?

135
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,320
My friend is having a party,

136
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
and wants coke chicken wings?

137
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,280
The chicken wings are gone.

138
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,800
I came to get some.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,160
I came to get some.

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,000
How did he know?

141
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,480
You have chicken wings in the fridge. I

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,200
guessed it.

143
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
Nice answer.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,760
Uncle

145
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,720
Jiang Nan,

146
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,320
Coke chicken wings,

147
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,000
class reunion,

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,880
You must be hungry.

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,560
If you're hungry,

150
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
sit here and eat.

151
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,720
I won't eat here.

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,840
A bunch of friends are waiting.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,560
Sit down.

154
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,160
Come on,

155
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,240
Eat,

156
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
Eat it.

157
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,600
Two dishes are missing.

158
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,560
Uncle, I'll take it.

159
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,240
Sit down.

160
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
Coke chicken wings,

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,120
Eat it

162
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,640
How about

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
cola chicken wings?

164
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,800
Delicious.

165
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,720
How am I?

166
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,640
How am I?

167
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Very good.

168
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
Of course

169
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,480
What about me

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,840
in 1990?

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
To get close

172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
to your aunt,

173
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,360
So I applied to the school

174
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,080
for the position of dorm manager.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,760
At that time,

176
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,480
the weapon in his hand,

177
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
There's only one flashlight.

178
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,400
Where's the darkness?

179
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,240
There is light everywhere.

180
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,240
Do you understand?

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,280
Understood.

182
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,760
As the old saying goes,

183
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,920
no matter how cunning the fox is,

184
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,120
You can't beat a good hunter.

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,400
Uncle,

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm not a fox,

187
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Besides, I understand

188
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,920
what you just said.

189
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Don't worry,

190
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,280
Okay,

191
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
Then I'm relieved.

192
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
Eat, eat, eat.

193
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,280
Uncle,

194
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,400
I know you usually like to drink a little when you eat,

195
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,560
Let me get you a beer.

196
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,320
Sit down.

197
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Of course

198
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
In 1994,

199
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,720
I retired from the post of dorm manager.

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,640
Because your aunt

201
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,200
graduated too. She's delicious.

202
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
You know how to eat.

203
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,920
What about me?

204
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,240
So I made food for her in a different way.

205
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,760
That's what I said.

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
If you want to grab someone's heart,

207
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,160
you have to grab her stomach first.

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
So I did it in a different way.

209
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
Start with the simplest,

210
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,160
and finally,

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,280
So I went to the chef's school as a dorm manager.

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Uncle,

213
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,120
don't worry,

214
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,080
In the future, like you,

215
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,520
I will improve my cooking skills.

216
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,680
I don't understand.

217
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
Look at Chengcheng's hands,

218
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,960
they're piano players.

219
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,480
You have to protect it.

220
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,840
Take care of it.

221
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
You just can't let her do rough work.

222
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,000
Do you get it?

223
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,160
No problem, uncle.

224
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,680
Uncle,

225
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,600
don't worry.

226
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
I'm sure I can do that.

227
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't worry,

228
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,680
the story is almost finished,

229
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,200
Eat,

230
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,840
Eat it.

231
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
Hello, the number you dialed is busy now.

232
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,440
Good for you, Xu Daqiang.

233
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,360
How dare you hang up on me?

234
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,360
This kid,

235
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,640
his long legs are amazing.

236
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,360
If you take four steps on top of me,

237
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,760
I'll follow you closely.

238
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
That's great.

239
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,200
Well,

240
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,640
I won't drive next time.

241
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll drink more with you.

242
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,560
Okay?

243
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,720
Okay, uncle.

244
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Come on, let's go.

245
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,520
Come in.

246
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,280
Dad, go, go, go, go,

247
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,400
go, go, go, go, go, go.

248
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,240
No, no!

249
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
So what?

250
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,320
My husband-in-law's relationship isn't optimistic.

251
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't mention it.

252
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
I can't go back home.

253
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,360
I can understand her father,

254
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
if our cabbage is arched by a pig,

255
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
I don't like it either.

256
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
You don't even have a cabbage?

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,840
Didn't you confess your love?

258
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
I've never had a chance.

259
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,000
I was thinking about it,

260
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,440
and I wanted to take advantage of dinner today,

261
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,880
We can have a romantic relationship.

262
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,320
I didn't know her father would come out halfway.

263
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,520
Jiang,

264
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
I feel sorry for you.

265
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,280
Look at your temper.

266
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,600
When you meet a girl you like,

267
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
you either dawdle,

268
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,960
Or you won't tell me.

269
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,480
What should you do?

270
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,400
You make it sound like you're not single.

271
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,440
You should worry about yourself first.

272
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,000
Brother Nan is here so early,

273
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,560
you two agreed

274
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,840
to come to my temple together, right?

275
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,640
I asked him to come.

276
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,640
Otherwise, if you complain to me alone,

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,880
I'll be bored to death by you.

278
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
It's expensive for me to preach.

279
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,680
Why don't you appreciate it?

280
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,080
I appreciate it.

281
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,960
Mr. Bao,

282
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,640
please teach me.

283
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,800
As you said,

284
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,600
I haven't contacted my dear family for two days.

285
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,760
But she still ignored me.

286
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,800
What should we do?

287
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
If you can't bear it, you'll make a big plan.

288
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
You two, one of you

289
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
is worried about your father-in-law,

290
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,600
One is worried about his crush.

291
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,360
What about me?

292
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,360
I can only worry about this temple.

293
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,440
You don't like girls, do you?

294
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Fatty,

295
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,360
you don't want to take care of Yu Keqin anymore, do you?

296
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,280
Think about it.

297
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,440
I want to call you "Big Brother"

298
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,560
in my dream,

299
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,400
Brother,

300
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
it's called "Kiss Hot Spot".

301
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
Brother,

302
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,720
please teach me.

303
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,520
Say it again

304
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,560
Brother,

305
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,520
Bao Rui,

306
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
What kind of drawing did you fix?

307
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,840
It's so fake.

308
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,320
Let me see.

309
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,120
Look,

310
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,400
isn't this great?

311
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
It's so textured.

312
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,840
Fatty,

313
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
come on. Aren't you a photographer?

314
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,000
Take a look.

315
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,360
How's it going?

316
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,360
Isn't it good?

317
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,880
It's really well repaired.

318
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,600
Do you have

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
any aesthetic taste?

320
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes,

321
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,400
Brother Nan has become Sister Nan.

322
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
You can do it. You can do it.

323
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Don't make your sister Nan so amiable.

324
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,400
Got it?

325
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,920
Go,

326
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,840
Fat,

327
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm counting on you.

328
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,280
Come on.

329
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,240
It's too sweet.

330
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,480
True feelings are different.

331
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,360
Many oranges can make their debut in the same place.

332
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,960
Zhu Xiaopang

333
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,080
hasn't texted me for days.

334
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,480
Jiang Nan's new song really has the feeling of first love.

335
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,080
It seems that the old Jiang Nan is back.

336
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,680
I'm going back to my fan club.

337
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,560
To listen to music,

338
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,040
I bought a bottle of cola to go with it.

339
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
They are so sweet.

340
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,920
I believe in love again.

341
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Heavyweight Voice of Music

342
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
has commented.

343
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Did you see that?

344
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,800
< Coke Chicken Wings > climbed to the top three of the new song list in just half

345
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,280
a day,

346
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,520
In one fell swoop, it broke the irony of the industry

347
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,440
for many years that Jiang Nanjiang was out of talent.

348
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,440
Good for you.

349
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,360
The Iron Lady even gave me a thumbs-up.

350
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,480
The frequency of you running towards me

351
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,720
is going up.

352
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,040
The coffee is good.

353
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,960
Won't you buy me a drink?

354
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
You really know how to pick the right time.

355
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,320
Drink it.

356
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,240
All right,

357
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,360
stop thinking about it.

358
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,640
Just ask me whatever you want to ask.

359
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
How's the girl doing?

360
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,920
I knew you'd ask her.

361
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,160
She didn't show up today.

362
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,520
She said she'd call again next week.

363
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,720
Why?

364
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,240
She said she has something to do,

365
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,760
so you have to remind her when you find a chance,

366
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,520
This time, edaravone

367
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
is very effective for neuronal degeneration.

368
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,960
You can't fish for three days and bask in the net for two days.

369
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,440
Okay.

370
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:12,920
Hey,

371
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,880
Many oranges,

372
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,079
Dr. Sui said you didn't come for the injection today,

373
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm a little busy these days.

374
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,839
Is it okay to go there two days later for the injection?

375
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,800
Chengcheng,

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
I want to see a movie.

377
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,520
Jianghai used to take me there.

378
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,280
Okay,

379
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,520
I'll go with you

380
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,080
tomorrow. Many oranges,

381
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
Are you at Jiang Nan's mother's place?

382
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,880
How can you give up your treatment

383
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,160
for someone else?

384
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,920
Don't you know that one neuron will be missing

385
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,720
when it dies?

386
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,640
I'll take care of my own business.

387
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
Don't worry.

388
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,520
Remember,

389
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,440
you have to come to the hospital for a check-up.

390
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,320
Jiang,

391
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,680
Jiang,

392
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,560
Why didn't you answer the phone?

393
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,960
Are you happy

394
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,680
to see the rankings?

395
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,880
Are you excited?

396
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,640
Yes.

397
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,440
I hope this good thing can continue.

398
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,080
Comments.

399
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,840
Have you read the comments?

400
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,480
No.

401
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm telling you,

402
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
real couples are different.

403
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,160
It feels

404
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,000
sweet, sweet, sweet,

405
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,480
Really?

406
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,520
That's right.

407
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
That's it.

408
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,880
It's disgusting.

409
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,200
Where are you going?

410
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,920
To pick up a lot of oranges.

411
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,240
-Go home and eat your father-in-law's

412
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,760
cooking. -Father-in-law,

413
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,600
-Father-in-law. -Father-in-law is

414
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,080
very nice.

415
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
A child can be taught.

416
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,800
< Coke Chicken Wings > has a high anti-loudness.

417
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,720
As long as you keep doing this,

418
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,280
there will be new inspiration.

419
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,800
to create a better song.

420
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,560
You're still worrying about my dad.

421
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Hang in there.

422
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I'll figure out a way as soon as possible.

423
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
Think of a way?

424
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,560
Where's my dad?

425
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,880
Just a few sips.

426
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
It's delicious.

427
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,720
-Hello. -Hello. Hello. Hello.

428
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,160
Trust me,

429
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,280
Come on.

430
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,840
You're back.

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,960
Dad, what happened to your family?

432
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,280
These are all your favorites.

433
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,920
It's convenient for you to eat here.

434
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
But,

435
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,880
have a seat,

436
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,880
Why are you standing there?

437
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,080
This is Jiang.

438
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,880
This is his landlord's trophy.

439
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,480
How can you put it on it?

440
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,120
If you rent someone else's house,

441
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,720
you can't touch their things.

442
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,760
Don't move.

443
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,800
The jar

444
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,720
doesn't leak air,

445
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,000
No, put it back.

446
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,800
Don't move.

447
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,440
I have to put it back.

448
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,040
Don't move.

449
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,920
It's not easy,

450
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,640
uncle.

451
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,160
It's okay. Let uncle use it

452
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,560
if he likes it.

453
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,040
I'll talk to the landlord

454
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,280
later. Listen,

455
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Jiang Nan can talk. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit

456
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,320
down,

457
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,640
sit on my mom's face,

458
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,360
please?

459
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,240
No,

460
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
harassing phone calls.

461
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Look,

462
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,640
my mom can't find you.

463
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,800
The phone is calling me.

464
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Xu Daqiang,

465
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
you can do it now, right?

466
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,240
You hid your private money and were kicked out of the house,

467
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,640
but you haven't come back yet.

468
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,320
Dad,

469
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,400
you were kicked out of the house,

470
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,480
Are you hiding private money under my mom's nose?

471
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,320
And they found out

472
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,320
who hid the private money?

473
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,840
Why did you hide it?

474
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,360
Jiang Nan,

475
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
we're all men,

476
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
You should know about this.

477
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,880
What man goes out without some money?

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,280
Well,

479
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,480
he has a party,

480
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,160
Have some water and treat a guest

481
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,720
to a coke and Starbucks.

482
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,680
Uncle,

483
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,520
don't worry,

484
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm not in a hurry.

485
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,680
Let's hide better next time.

486
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
I hid it well.

487
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,920
No,

488
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,760
you have a lot of experience.

489
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,720
Here comes the call again.

490
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,680
Who hung up on me just now?

491
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,320
Xu Daqiang,

492
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,200
do you want to give it to me?

493
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,120
Give it to me.

494
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,400
Mom, it's me.

495
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,200
Chengcheng

496
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
Is your dad at your place?

497
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160
My dad is not with me.

498
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,880
Tell me when your dad goes to your place.

499
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,560
Good mom,

500
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,400
I'll tell you as soon as my dad arrives. Okay,

501
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,720
I'm hanging up.

502
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
Hang up, hang up,

503
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,560
give it back.

504
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,040
I'll transfer it to you.

505
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,800
I didn't hurt you for nothing.

506
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,960
She's really my daughter.

507
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,840
I'll cook something delicious for you later.

508
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,840
I've made up my mind.

509
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm not leaving.

510
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,200
I want to stay here forever.

511
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,680
I want to stay here forever.

512
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,320
Stay here forever.

513
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Jiang Nan,

514
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm thirsty.

515
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,160
I'll

516
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,720
get you a glass of water.

517
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,880
Okay,

518
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,960
Xiao Yang,

519
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,280
you still want to drink

520
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,200
with my wife,

521
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,840
Why are you here?

522
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,400
Why do you think I'm here?

523
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Get up. It hurts.

524
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,760
let go

525
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,440
-Ouch! -Let go of me!

526
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,040
Let go!

527
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
How hard are you trying?

528
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,440
The baby is over there.

529
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,560
If you save me some face,

530
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,240
that's enough for you.

531
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,320
I know.

532
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,040
I know you're worried about your daughter,

533
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
but now that she's older,

534
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,920
You have to trust her.

535
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,280
You called your mom here.

536
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,720
My mom is the only one who can subdue my dad.

537
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
It works the best.

538
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not that I don't trust our girl,

539
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,600
I don't trust that kid,

540
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,800
Look at him.

541
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,560
Look at him,

542
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,000
You don't look like

543
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,760
a good boy.

544
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,400
Besides,

545
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,400
aren't you afraid of an accident?

546
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,640
What happened?

547
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,760
What else do you want?

548
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,680
That's it.

549
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,120
What are you talking about?

550
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,480
I don't know.

551
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,640
These two people,

552
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,600
they're together,

553
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Come on.

554
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,200
Do you know how I got here?

555
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,880
How did you get here?

556
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,680
My daughter called me here.

557
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,360
Think about it,

558
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
If she really wants to have something to do with that guy,

559
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,400
will she call me?

560
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,680
Can you call me here?

561
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,120
Things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme.

562
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,880
I forgot.

563
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,760
This chicken,

564
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,720
when you cook it,

565
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,920
I'm missing some seasoning,

566
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,880
so I have to go home and get it.

567
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,600
Me

568
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,760
Things will develop in the opposite direction

569
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
when they become extreme. Go home early.

570
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,160
Mom,

571
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,840
Don't forget to ask about my dad's private money.

572
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,800
Don't worry.

573
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,280
I can't bear it.

574
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,960
Your parents are so close.

575
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,880
Your dad is quite cute.

576
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,760
Then I'll get it back for you.

577
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,840
Let him go.

578
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,440
Hello Keqin,

579
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,200
Hey,

580
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,240
Uncle just texted me,

581
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,000
asking me to keep an eye on Jiang Nan.

582
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,200
If you don't give him a chance to come home tonight,

583
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
you're not wearing anything.

584
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,440
I told my dad that you were on a business trip.

585
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Of course not.

586
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,200
I knew he went to check on the post.

587
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,920
My dad stayed here for two days.

588
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,640
Gosh,

589
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
Didn't Jiang Nan

590
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,960
get kicked out of the house?

591
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,640
You just got back to the world of two people,

592
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,560
and you came in without saying a word.

593
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,720
I've prepared soup for you.

594
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,720
Remember to drink it.

595
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,040
I have piano lessons in the morning.

596
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm going to the musical instrument store.

597
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,520
Stewed chicken soup with ganoderma lucidum again,

598
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Rui.

599
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,720
Did you have breakfast?

600
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,440
No.

601
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,440
No one did it.

602
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,160
Just in time,

603
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
Yuezi Soup,

604
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,200
Many Cheng often

605
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
shoots health-preserving and food-nourishing videos,

606
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,120
You always make these weird things.

607
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,800
He died from waterlogging.

608
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
I died of drought.

609
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,000
What do you think?

610
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,600
Does it taste good?

611
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,080
Sure. If

612
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,040
we make a lot of oranges next time,

613
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,360
So I called you here.

614
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,000
Many Cheng would be so happy

615
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
if they heard the praise.

616
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,640
Tell me,

617
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,680
what's your plan for today?

618
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,440
Look,

619
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,640
our "Coke Chicken Wings",

620
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,760
I thought the response was good.

621
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,400
just right

622
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
With the heat,

623
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,880
let's take a photo shoot.

624
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,400
I'll take it alone.

625
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,520
What else can I do?

626
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,560
Since < Coke Chicken Wings > has a

627
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,760
good response and the heroine doesn't need to be in the

628
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,120
same frame,

629
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,120
Just tell me that you want to take photos with many oranges,

630
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,760
and that's it.

631
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,960
Why are you standing here?

632
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
Drink the soup.

633
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,960
I'll get changed

634
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,800
and let's go.

635
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
If he had realized this earlier,

636
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
would Du have solved it earlier

637
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,440
What?

638
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,680
You want to take wedding photos?

639
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,320
I thought you wanted to watch

640
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,840
a short music video with male and female actors sprinkling sugar,

641
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,920
Then spread it thoroughly.

642
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,480
What?

643
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,400
Can't I?

644
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,040
Mr. Xu,

645
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,520
Ms. Xu,

646
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,000
The student

647
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,920
asked for leave.

648
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,120
Are you not feeling well?

649
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,640
I didn't ask too much about that.

650
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,800
Okay,

651
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,160
I'll come back tomorrow.

652
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,680
Besides,

653
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,520
the parents said,

654
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,600
He wants to transfer all the classes to Mr. Zhang.

655
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,800
Maybe the last time I came here,

656
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,800
I saw you make a small mistake,

657
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
But don't worry.

658
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,840
In the future,

659
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,280
many students will join our musical instrument store.

660
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,320
Okay, I see.

661
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,160
Thank you, manager.

662
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,600
Okay,

663
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,600
I'll get back to work then.

664
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,680
Mr. Bao,

665
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,560
Chengcheng,

666
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,920
What time is it over there?

667
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
It's over.

668
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,960
That's good.

669
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,160
I'll ask Du to pick you up.

670
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,560
Jiang Nan, take some photos here. Come here

671
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,640
and take two photos together.

672
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Sis,

673
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm busy.

674
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,440
Let's talk about it.

675
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,240
I'm hanging up.

676
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
Don't be so fierce.

677
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,880
I just want to ask you,

678
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,200
how is Keqin these two days?

679
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,560
Zhu Linfeng,

680
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,240
can you do something serious?

681
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,760
You're so amiable all day long.

682
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,520
I shouldn't have recruited her.

683
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
No, no, no.

684
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,280
Don't let me interfere with Keqin's work.

685
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,440
If you don't disturb her, it won't affect her work.

686
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,280
She's been working these days.

687
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,240
Nonsense.

688
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,360
You think it's the same as you.

689
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,280
If she's fooling around every day,

690
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,720
there's nothing unusual about her.

691
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,280
Do you want her to be abnormal?

692
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,360
Just like you,

693
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,280
love brain,

694
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,760
You're not young anymore.

695
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,120
Don't be so childish, okay?

696
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,640
Hey,

697
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,440
Sis,

698
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,640
You're not young anymore,

699
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,840
so don't stay alone.

700
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,360
You're always busy with work.

701
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,880
Work is important.

702
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But you have to be in a relationship.

703
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,640
I can help you fool Auntie for a while.

704
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,160
I can't fool you for the rest of your life.

705
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,640
Who needs your help?

706
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,720
Do you still remember

707
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,600
the divination I gave you with a lot of money,

708
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,280
He said you had a marriage that fell from the sky

709
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
and missed the night this year.

710
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,240
If I miss it,

711
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm afraid I'll have to wait for the next one.

712
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Let me figure it out.

713
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,160
How old are you now?

714
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,040
In 60 years,

715
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,520
Zhu Xiaopang.

716
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,080
Rui,

717
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,480
you're so good at scheming.

718
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,000
You can't just let the cattle work.

719
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,280
Don't let the cows eat grass.

720
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,680
What do you want to eat? Brother Rui can treat you to it.

721
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
No,

722
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,200
you know I didn't mean that.

723
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,720
Me,

724
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,520
You can't just invite Sister-in-law Nan here,

725
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,080
but you can also invite Keqin here.

726
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,520
I'm telling you,

727
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm helping you the most if I don't call you "amiable".

728
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,880
Do you understand?

729
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,880
You haven't seen her for so many days.

730
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,480
I haven't seen her for days.

731
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
But she didn't take the initiative to contact me,

732
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,840
as time goes by,

733
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
Is she missing me?

734
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,560
Bro,

735
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,160
bear with it a little longer.

736
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,920
You're in such a hurry

737
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,240
that all your efforts have been wasted, you know?

738
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,600
Nan,

739
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,040
I brought you my sister-in-law.

740
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,120
Why are we here?

741
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,280
I'm here.

742
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,440
Photographing

743
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,040
"Coke Chicken Wings" here has a good response.

744
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,680
We need to take some photos.

745
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,920
Re-marketing,

746
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,160
Sister-in-law,

747
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
There will be a wedding dress later.

748
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,640
You can take wedding photos

749
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,120
at will,

750
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,120
That's right.

751
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,840
Think about it,

752
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,920
the post-production response of the short music film is very good,

753
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,360
The comments said they wanted to see the follow-up.

754
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
What's the follow-up?

755
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,920
The prince and princess take wedding photos together,

756
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,320
and start a sweet and happy life.

757
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,800
Isn't that right, Du?

758
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,880
Yes, yes, yes.

759
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,120
No way.

760
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,280
Assistant Xu.

761
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,440
With such a small amount of work,

762
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,520
you can't finish it, right?

763
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
So many.

764
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,160
It's so pretty.

765
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,440
What style does Jiang Nan like?

766
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,800
Lace,

767
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,320
Lace,

768
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,920
Which one should I wear?

769
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,760
It's so hard to choose.

770
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,480
Many oranges,

771
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,240
it's not true

772
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
to wake up.

773
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,240
I don't care.

774
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,960
Don't be nervous.

775
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
It's fake.

776
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,280
You're fake.

777
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,160
Is this okay with me?

778
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,720
Split up.

779
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,200
Come on.

780
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,200
Step aside.

781
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,080
Look at the camera,

782
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,520
Come on,

783
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,080
Okay,

784
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,800
One more.

785
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,960
One more.

786
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

787
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,159
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

788
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,920
-It's not sweet. -Can

789
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,280
you come closer?

790
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,400
Dark background is popular now.

791
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,159
Alienation.

792
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,040
Less facial expressions,

793
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,440
so that you can get more advanced photos.

794
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,560
What we want is a couple,

795
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,239
understand?

796
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,199
As much as possible to integrate the plot of the short music film,

797
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,520
do you have any props?

798
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,719
Put some cream here.

799
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,320
Right?

800
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,960
Let's kiss each other sweetly.

801
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,760
Or,

802
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,639
when a boy puts his arms around his waist from behind a girl,

803
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,440
Am I right?

804
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,600
More interaction.

805
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,840
It's so tacky.

806
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,320
We're not taking wedding photos.

807
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,000
Listen to me,

808
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,760
Since you want to sprinkle sugar, let's sprinkle it all at once.

809
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,400
Kill them.

810
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,880
Am I right?

811
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,080
Listen to my order,

812
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:41,639
Come on,

813
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,800
Two people face to face,

814
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,920
holding hands,

815
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,800
Hand in hand. Hurry up.

816
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,040
Girl, raise your head.

817
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,320
Boys with their heads down,

818
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,080
Okay,

819
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,360
affectionate

820
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,880
Closer.

821
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,560
Let's go.

822
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,680
Take a look.

823
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,080
It's better to do as I said,

824
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,920
and make a sense of alienation.

825
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,000
Look more advanced,

826
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
the intimate moves you're talking about,

827
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,400
They can't do it at all.

828
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,160
I don't feel like a couple at all.

829
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,960
Shoot and shoot,
