00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:08,990

2
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:13,714
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,954
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:19,254
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:24,529
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:30,287
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,127
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,439
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,800
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,287
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:44,301
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:48,388
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:51,088
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:53,928
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,475
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,842
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,478
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:05,804
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:10,645
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,478
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,233
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,340
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,079
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,712
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:31,231
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:45,111
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:48,824

28
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,467
Why did you ask to see me in such a hurry?

29
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,888
You did this, right?

30
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:15,948
What do you think?

31
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:18,788
The gift I gave you is pretty good, right?

32
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:22,068
You're focused on pursuing Xu Duo Cheng, but haven't made much progress.

33
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:27,048
So, I wanted to do you a little favor and make Jiang Nan misunderstand Xu Duo Cheng.

34
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,628
That way, you have a chance.

35
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:32,728
Gu Jia Yi, looks like I've underestimated you.

36
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:35,048
Isn't this what you want?

37
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:41,468
You haven't really fallen for that girl, have you?

38
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:46,068
I really don't understand.

39
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:48,428
What's so good about that little bean sprout

40
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:51,208
that makes both of you revolve around her?

41
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:55,968
Anyway, I have my own plans.

42
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:58,661
I hope your plans won't affect me.

43
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:01,626
Otherwise, it won't be so simple anymore.

44
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:12,508
 Everyone is threatening me.

45
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,928
Xu Duocheng, why should I apologize?

46
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,508
How am I wrong? Why are you making me apologize?

47
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,190

48
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,060

49
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:54,549
 Tomorrow six p.m., at my place. I have something to tell you.

50
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,094
You're here.

51
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:28,248
Come in.

52
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,588
Did you make all these?

53
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:36,308
What's so hard about that? Have a seat first.

54
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:48,108
Try this fish first.

55
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:57,688
What do you think?

56
00:04:58,248 --> 00:04:59,848
The fish is so tender.

57
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:03,368
Catfish is pretty expensive, right?

58
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:08,028
Yes, it is. It's really expensive and hard to get.

59
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:17,668
Well, is the delivery fee pretty expensive too?

60
00:05:21,248 --> 00:05:24,168
Â¥9.9 with a discount.

61
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:30,828
Go ahead. What did you invite me over to say?

62
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:35,608
I've invited you here to say...

63
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:37,288
You know.

64
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,988
I don't know.

65
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:47,388
What I mean is...

66
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:51,648
I had a bad attitude yesterday. I'm sorry.

67
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,328
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:00,728
Let me try that dish.

69
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,588
I don't think that's necessary.

70
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,428
It's not bad.

71
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,028
Wait, I'm still not experienced enough.

72
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,841
I'll get you a bowl of soup. It's delicious.

73
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:38,688
Since you already ordered takeout,

74
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:41,248
why did you make a dish yourself?

75
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:44,508
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

76
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:46,908
It can't all be fake, right?

77
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,108
Orange, what's going on?

78
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:03,508
Why did you ask me out in such a hurry to discuss it here?

79
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,348
Why can't we talk over the phone?

80
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:08,828
I know. Are you going to give me an exclusive scoop?

81
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,668
Stop joking around. I really ran into a big problem this time.

82
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:12,988
What is it?

83
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,988
Someone took pictures of me and Zhan Zhi Lin.

84
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,988
To avoid any suspicion, Jiang Nan asked me to move in with him.

85
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,608
Is that so?

86
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,668
Then move out.

87
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,308
It's not that easy.

88
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:25,828
The problem is, how will I tell my parents?

89
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:29,068
That's easy. Don't you have me?

90
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:30,748
You?

91
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:35,168
Just tell them... you're moving in with me.

92
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,388
That's a good idea.

93
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:39,168
 Here you go. Hurry, hurry.

94
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,848
I made Cheng Cheng's favorite Cabbage Mustard and Dry Pot Chicken.

95
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:44,348
- It's a well-balanced meal. 
 - Thank you, Big Lin.

96
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:46,468
In the future, you don't have to make these especially for me.

97
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,188
I'll just eat whatever you guys eat.

98
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:51,968
That won't do. Look at how skinny you've gotten.

99
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:53,148
You have to replenish your body.

100
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,568
Next time, I'll make you Silkie Chicken Soup.

101
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,368
Have a piece of Silkie chicken.

102
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,428
Here.

103
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,368
I have an announcement to make.

104
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,568
I found a job.

105
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,748
You found a job.

106
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,188
Why didn't you tell us earlier? What kind of job?

107
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,328
Is it an a state-owned enterprise, a private enterprise, or a Fortune 500 company? 
  (T/N: Top 500 companies)

108
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:18,828
Why are you such a nag?

109
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:20,628
Is it the bank?

110
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:24,288
I'm teaching piano at Xinhai Piano Company.

111
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,988
I've already been working for a while.

112
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,508
This job pays well and has good benefits.

113
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,008
It's mainly because I like the job.

114
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,587
Being a piano teacher is good. It's good.

115
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:36,148
Being a piano teacher is nice, Mrs Xu.

116
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,646
What's wrong? Our daughter found a job.

117
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,988
Why are you still frowning?

118
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,428
How great is it to be a piano teacher?

119
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,648
It's steady and decent.

120
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:47,588
I didn't say it's not a nice job.

121
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:50,068
Isn't Xinhai Piano Store really famous?

122
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:51,868
Isn't it really far away from our house?

123
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,962
Isn't the commute exhausting?

124
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:59,268
I was wondering why Cheng Cheng has been coming home late for dinner.

125
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:03,000
Daughter, it is a bit far indeed.

126
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:09,248
So... Dad, Mom, I have something to discuss with you.

127
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,408
I want to move out.

128
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,428
I disagree!

129
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,348
Cheng Cheng, you're a nice girl.

130
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,868
You can't go down the wrong path.

131
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:18,548
You must protect yourself.

132
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,508
Don't let that rascal take advantage of you.

133
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,468
Big Lin, take a seat first. Sit down.

134
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:26,328
Wait, dear, you just started dating Jiang Nan.

135
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,108
Some things don't need to be so rushed.

136
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,828
Enough, enough, enough.

137
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:33,136
What are you two talking about?

138
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:37,148
Is our daughter that type of person? Don't you know your own daughter?

139
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:38,913
Who will you live with?

140
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,027
Ke Qin.

141
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,887
Are you still worried if I live with Ke Qin?

142
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:45,307
Ke Qin?

143
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:48,908
Mom, I graduated from college and entered society, right?

144
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,668
I can't live under your protection forever.

145
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:54,748
I have to go out and take a beating from society.

146
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:57,268
Besides, look at how independent you were when you were young.

147
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,968
You're my role model.

148
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:02,388
You are quite like me in this aspect.

149
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,128
I agree.

150
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,500

151
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:15,788
 With such a big poster of me hanging in the house,

152
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,568
 you can immediately tell it's my house.

153
00:10:17,568 --> 00:10:19,068
 That won't work.

154
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,628
 Everything is ready.

155
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:07,408
Wait a minute,

156
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:10,808
why do I feel like I'm the assistant?

157
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:25,748
I didn't bring my medical records.

158
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:34,368
Slow down!

159
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,388
Mom, why are you home?

160
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:39,068
What do you mean by "why am I home"? Your dad asked me to check on you.

161
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,468
He's wondering what's taking you so long.

162
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,548
Why did you bring your medical record?

163
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:47,328
If I bring this with me, it's more convenient for doctor appointments.

164
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:51,128
But dear, if you're sick, you can't go to the hospital alone.

165
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:55,168
You should at least tell your dad and me. We have to go with you.

166
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,348
Which year is this medical record from?

167
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,248
Can you still use it?

168
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,608
 Oh, no. Oh, no.

169
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,808
Look at that doctor.

170
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,808
It's been so many years and his handwriting is still so hard to read.

171
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,948
Mom, stop looking at it. Dad will get anxious from waiting.

172
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,108
All right, all right. Let's go. Let's go.

173
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,708
Let's go. Let's go.

174
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:28,168
I'm so sleepy. How did I fall asleep?

175
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,768
My clothes!

176
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,548
You're here.

177
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:55,268
Jiang Nan, why are you here?

178
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,628
Auntie, it's like this.

179
00:12:56,628 --> 00:13:00,788
Cheng Cheng and Ke Qin previously told me they were looking for housing and asked me to help them look around.

180
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:03,748
It just happened that my friend's house is vacant.

181
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,588
This is your friend's house?

182
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:10,948
Auntie, look how nice the house is. It has excellent sunlight.

183
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:13,421
Judging by the furnishing, you can tell that the landlord really values this house.

184
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,535
What are you doing? You were fine living at home...

185
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,600
Come in, Dad.

186
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,328
Hello, Uncle.

187
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,028
- There's a basement too? 
 - Yes, there is.

188
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:59,028
Let me see.

189
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,068
Slow down.

190
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:08,288
This floor is pretty nice too.

191
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,028
Why are there so many instruments?

192
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:18,047
There are more here too.

193
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,483
Jiang Nan, why are there so many instruments?

194
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:21,808
Your friend...

195
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,860
My friend is a musician like me. He's very talented.

196
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:28,234
I was wondering why there are so many instruments here.

197
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,834
The photo.

198
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,208
Go.

199
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:37,968
This house fulfills all I wished for in a rental house.

200
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,668
Wait a minute.

201
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:52,028
Ke Qin, where's your luggage?

202
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:55,901
Uncle, girls have a lot of things.

203
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,968
I can't pack up that fast.

204
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,114
Besides, I've been constantly working overtime.

205
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:02,114
Right, Orange?

206
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,068
Yes, that's right. You're busy at work.

207
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:08,108
By the way, where's Cheng Cheng's room?

208
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,874
Upstairs.

209
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,768
Dad, Mom, I'll show you around upstairs.

210
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,148
Okay. Come on.

211
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:14,508
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

212
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:17,267
Mom, this is my room.

213
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:36,688
This bedsheet...

214
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,608
- What do you think? 
 - It's such a good combination.

215
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,748
- This is wonderful. 
 - Not bad.

216
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:45,308
This room is so nice.

217
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:46,808
Why didn't you tell me?

218
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,446
These cosmetics...

219
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:55,168
These cosmetics... I meticulously prepared for Orange.

220
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,388
Are you surprised? Are you shocked?

221
00:15:58,388 --> 00:16:01,461
Yes, I am.

222
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:06,892
You two remind me of me and my bestie.

223
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:08,847
Ke Qin, where's your room?

224
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,187
My room is over there.

225
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:14,934
Let's take a look.

226
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,768
This room is pretty nice too,

227
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:25,194
but why does it feel a little like a boy's room?

228
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,157
This is my style.

229
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:32,088
The closet is pretty nice too.

230
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:41,048
This is...

231
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:45,216
You have a boyfriend?

232
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,368
Auntie, I...

233
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,174
I was young once too.

234
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,908
Let me tell you, my mom was really pretty when she was young.

235
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:57,506
She's still pretty now.

236
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:58,948
You two.

237
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:01,908
All right, I've seen it all.

238
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,708
Your dad and I can rest assured now.

239
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,068
Happy Family Restaurant is about to get busy. We're leaving.

240
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,508
Mom, stay for a bit longer. Why are you leaving so soon?

241
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,027
That's enough. We're leaving.

242
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:13,340
We're leaving.

243
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,568
- Let's go. 
 - I'll call a taxi for you.

244
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,326
No, that's all right.

245
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:18,647
It's on the way.

246
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,747
You're too polite.

247
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,908
Well...

248
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,728
Auntie, what do you think of the house?

249
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:28,668
The house is wonderful.

250
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,588
Come to dinner at Happy Family Restaurant when you're free.

251
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,388
All right, Auntie.

252
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,328
That's right.

253
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,088
You're not leaving?

254
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,588
- You're not leaving? 
 - I'm leaving.

255
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm leaving too.

256
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,300
Then leave.

257
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,527
I'm waiting for my car.

258
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,154
Where can you find a car at this hour?

259
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:06,554
- It's not here yet. 
 - I'm waiting too.

260
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:09,041
Dad. Dad. Time to go.

261
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,368
- When does your car arrive? 
 - Right away.

262
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:12,748
Time to go. Time to go.

263
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:13,948
- He's waiting for his car. 
 - I need to tell him.

264
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,667
- What's the hurry? 
 - Time to go. Time to go.

265
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,847
What's going on with you?

266
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,628
Bye-bye!

267
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,808
He finally left.

268
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:26,008
Thank you.

269
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:28,148
- I know. To... 
 - That's enough.

270
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,828
I'll give you one day to clean up the room.

271
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:33,932
But... I've been busy all day too. I...

272
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:44,988
I bumped my nose.

273
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:49,088
Good thing it's real.

274
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,188
I'll clean up tonight.

275
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,220
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

276
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,168
 Jiang Nan listens to his heartbeat

277
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:06,628
 and thinks everything is so sudden and unrealistic.

278
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:10,168
 When Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu, and Ke Qin leave one after another,

279
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:13,408
 Xu Du Cheng and him will be the only two in this house.

280
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:17,028
 He can't help but feel nervous about that.

281
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:20,408
Wait a minute. Why am I nervous?

282
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,108
Why am I hiding in my bedroom?

283
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:25,228
This is my house.

284
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,420
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

285
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:37,508
 Jiang Nan is at a loss for what to do and is completely caught off-guard.

286
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:39,588
 He's starting to worry about whether

287
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:42,348
 life in the future will be how he imagined.

288
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:00,307
I'm done showering. You can shower now.

289
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:09,561
 Why did she run away so fast?

290
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,607
 Am I a beast?

291
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,608
 That's so awkward.

292
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,384
 Shouldn't Jiang Nan be working out at this time?

293
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,460
 Xu Duo Cheng, oh, Xu Duo Cheng. You have to be careful next time.

294
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:53,901
Forget it. Why should I care about what she thinks?

295
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:55,428
That's not right.

296
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm a singer-songwriter, not a muscular hunk.

297
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:03,408
Singer-songwriter?

298
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,288
 How can you ignore me? You even said you liked my song.

299
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,968
 I've been playing here for so long, yet you haven't even glanced at me.

300
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:42,828
 What's wrong with him now?

301
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,008
 You're so loud.

302
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:11,928
Dude, it's 10 p.m. Are you not going to sleep?

303
00:22:11,928 --> 00:22:14,228
It's only 10 o'clock. What sleep?

304
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:16,788
This counts as disturbing your neighbors, don't you know?

305
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:19,588
I'm playing a game at my own house, not singing karaoke.

306
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,188
Who am I disturbing?

307
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:22,988
Me.

308
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:27,088
If you sleep at 10 p.m., you can boost your immune system and detox your liver and spleen.

309
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:29,488
I'm not stopping you. Go to sleep.

310
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:00,948
 6 a.m.? What's that noise so early in the morning?

311
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:10,928
 Darlings, don't forget to put in the longan. Just put them in for 15 minutes.

312
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:14,668
 Isn't it really easy?

313
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:24,428
All right, darlings, that's all for my video today.

314
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:27,388
A beautiful day starts in the morning.

315
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:29,748
Make sure to eat your breakfast.

316
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:32,788
Also, that would keep you healthy.

317
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,828
If you like my health channel "Live Until 99",

318
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,888
make sure to double-click and "like" it.

319
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:39,488
Love you!

320
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,794
Don'y you make noise when you walk?

321
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,747
Why are you talking so much in the morning?

322
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:51,080
Are you going to let anyone sleep?

323
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,034
It's not like I'm singing karaoke at home.

324
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,774
Who am I disturbing?

325
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,828
I didn't know you live-stream.

326
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,708
Don't worry. I didn't show my face.

327
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,128
This is just my side job.

328
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:05,708
You sure have a lot of side jobs.

329
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:09,068
Since you're awake, come have breakfast.

330
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,508
Here.

331
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:24,408
We're having chicken soup with Ganoderma for breakfast?

332
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:27,748
This chicken soup can boost your immunity,

333
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:31,488
regulate your endocrine, and it's anti-aging.

334
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:36,288
If we have this for breakfast, what will we have for lunch and dinner?

335
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:39,508
For lunch, we'll have sea cucumber and angelica soup.

336
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:42,908
For dinner, we'll have stewed squab with astragalus.

337
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:45,308
Tomorrow, we should eat something lighter.

338
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:47,988
We'll have bird's nest and tremella soup.

339
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:52,028
If we keep eating like this, you can't afford it with your salary.

340
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:54,862
That's okay. You provide room and board here.

341
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:57,734
- Lord Bao will reimburse me for all of this. 
 -  Bao Rui?

342
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,148
I'll just pay for the Ganoderma today.

343
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:03,788
In the future, tell Lord Bao to prepare more Ganoderma, astragalus,

344
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:06,028
angelica, bird's nest,

345
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:08,468
and donkey-hide gelatin, etc.

346
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:11,308
Angelica enriches and invigorates the blood.

347
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:14,508
Astragalus nourishes one's vitality and strengthens the skin and exterior organs.

348
00:25:22,908 --> 00:25:24,988
Sister Shan, you're looking for me?

349
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:27,088
Come in and have a seat.

350
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:31,508
I want you to follow up with a case.

351
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:32,708
Okay.

352
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,828
Jiang Nan is releasing a new song next month.

353
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:36,668
He hasn't composed anything in a long time.

354
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,428
The virtual temperature  (online traction)   and fan anticipation values are extremely high.

355
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:44,028
Contact his agency and ask for an exclusive interview.

356
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,728
I want the first scoop.

357
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,148
This is his manager.

358
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:53,268
An exclusive interview?

359
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:56,334
We targeted Jiang Nan before.

360
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,794
Will his agency agree?

361
00:25:58,794 --> 00:26:01,948
We never target anyone.

362
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:05,808
As for whether they will agree, that'll depend on your skills.

363
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:08,188
I don't have to teach you the rest, right?

364
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:12,308
Sister Shan, can I ask you a question?

365
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:14,008
Go ahead.

366
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:17,648
You didn't want me to follow Jiang Nan's case.

367
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:19,068
- Why are you... 
 - You don't want to?

368
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:21,568
No, no, no.

369
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,808
I promise to complete the task.

370
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,308
You're indeed the best, Sister.

371
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,928
We have a deal. Just this once.

372
00:26:44,928 --> 00:26:46,721
Just this once.

373
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,674
 Such a strange smell.

374
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:15,348
Such a strange smell.

375
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:19,003
Xu Duo Cheng, what are you doing in my house? What's this smell?

376
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,108
Does it smell?

377
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:26,128
I'm boiling wormwood.

378
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:28,648
Boiling wormwood?

379
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:32,028
It promotes circulation, removes blood stasis, and warms up the body and uterus.

380
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,947
They only boil wormwood in royal court dramas when someone needs to prevent a miscarriage.

381
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,628
Are you preventing a miscarriage?

382
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:38,988
Who said only pregnant women boil wormwood?

383
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:42,628
You should look it up if you don't understand.

384
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:46,328
Wait a minute.

385
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,408
Give me a hand.

386
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:54,448
- This way. 
 - Are you trying to kill me with this stench?

387
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,088
Where did that foot-soaking basin come from?

388
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:02,548
I asked Lord Bao to buy it.

389
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,668
For what?

390
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,788
To soak our feet, of course.

391
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:07,548
What else can it do?

392
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:11,208
Hurry up.

393
00:28:17,508 --> 00:28:20,548
What else did you put in this? It smells so strong.

394
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:24,588
I also put Sichuan peppers, mugwort, safflower, and cinnamon in it.

395
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:27,448
Do you want the same thing?

396
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:30,428
You're so young, yet you're being so health-conscious.

397
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:35,528
If you don't take care of your health when you're young, it'll be too late when you get older.

398
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:38,968
Does that sound like something a 22-year-old girl would say?

399
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,788
That sounds like something a mature person would say.

400
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:46,348
Although you're a few years older than me, men usually mature later than women.

401
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:50,268
Your psychological age might even be younger than mine.

402
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,228
Where are you going with my pot?

403
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:58,568
When I come out, there better not be any strange smell in the house!

404
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:02,388
He can't stand it already?

405
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,340
What?

406
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:21,148
I can't stand it anymore.

407
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:23,528
Xu Duo Cheng is just like an old TCM doctor. 
  (T/N: Traditional Chinese Medicine)

408
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,128
Since she has been here, it's like my "sitting the month" period. 
  (T/N: Traditionally, Chinese women stay at home for a month postpartum to replenish and recuperate)

409
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:30,768
I want a supplemental agreement tomorrow. I can't let her continue like this.

410
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,868
Okay, what will it include?

411
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:35,248
I'll select the menu.

412
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:38,428
Also, do not cook strange things in the house.

413
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:41,348
Plus, no noise before 10 a.m.

414
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:44,028
Okay, I'll deal with that tomorrow.

415
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,401
What now?

416
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:55,141
Lord Bao, it's me.

417
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,788
Cheng Cheng, what's wrong?

418
00:29:56,788 --> 00:29:59,148
I want to sign a supplemental agreement.

419
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:02,708
Add a clause, "No talking after 10 p.m."

420
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,328
Okay, no problem.

421
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:05,828
Bye.

422
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:15,868
Wait, can you let me sleep?

423
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:18,228
If you don't let me sleep, you won't sign anything tomorrow!

424
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:41,028
Orange, what's wrong?

425
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:43,108
Why are you so sleepy?

426
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,948
It's all because of Jiang Nan.

427
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:49,588
I wasn't able to sleep all night.

428
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,668
You've already progressed to this point?

429
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:55,588
What are you thinking?

430
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:59,908
Let me tell you, I realized we have totally different lifestyles.

431
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:02,068
He works at night and sleeps during the day.

432
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,748
It's messing up my whole schedule.

433
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:05,868
Plus, we don't have the same palette either.

434
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:07,988
I make so much good food for him every day,

435
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:10,388
but he thinks they are too nutritious.

436
00:31:10,388 --> 00:31:14,628
Going from God Nan to quarrelsome lovers.

437
00:31:15,188 --> 00:31:18,668
If this goes on, I'll be having your wedding candy very soon.

438
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,488
What are you thinking?

439
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:23,668
I think my previous mental image of him is totally shattered.

440
00:31:23,668 --> 00:31:26,788
Some things are most beautiful from a distance.

441
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:31,068
Anyway, destiny has a hold on my neck now.

442
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:32,508
Enough about that.

443
00:31:32,508 --> 00:31:35,608
Why did you ask to see me in such a hurry?

444
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:38,308
That's right. I almost forgot the real business.

445
00:31:38,308 --> 00:31:39,468
Here's the thing.

446
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:42,548
That She-Devil suddenly gave me a task.

447
00:31:42,548 --> 00:31:44,748
She said Jiang Nan is releasing a new song

448
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:47,068
and asked me to get an exclusive interview with him

449
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:48,348
and she wants to be the first to publish it.

450
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,308
Ever since the photo incident,

451
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,308
she didn't allow me to be in charge of Jiang Nan's news anymore.

452
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:55,908
I don't really understand her intentions this time either.

453
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:59,308
You have to talk to Lord Bao about Jiang Nan's work-related issues.

454
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,488
The She-Devil offended all of you at the press conference last time.

455
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,928
Wouldn't I be asking for trouble if I go find Bao Rui?

456
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:09,468
So, can you do some pillow talk for me

457
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:11,368
and give me the first article?

458
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:13,788
What pillow talk?

459
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:16,288
If you keep speaking nonsense, I won't talk to you anymore.

460
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:18,608
All right, all right, I won't joke around anymore.

461
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:22,748
Orange, can you just flirt or play weak with Jiang Nan?

462
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:25,208
All men love that.

463
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,588
I'm begging you, Orange.

464
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:30,528
If I don't do this well, I will lose my job.

465
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,508
Then I'll think about what I can do,

466
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:35,008
but I can't promise Jiang Nan will agree.

467
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:38,248
I'm relying on you.

468
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:48,088
Sir and Madame, here is the supplemental agreement I drafted this morning.

469
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:50,188
Take a look.

470
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,488
Take a look.

471
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:05,828
This is good.

472
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,508
"Do not boil wormwood in the house again."

473
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:09,508
"No noises before 10 a.m."

474
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:11,228
"Party A will decide the daily menu."

475
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:13,928
"Party B is not allowed to make a decision without permission."

476
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:17,428
I only proposed two clauses and he proposed so many.

477
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,788
- That's not fair. 
 - What's not fair?

478
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,348
This is my house.

479
00:33:21,348 --> 00:33:23,208
Didn't you invite me here?

480
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,708
Well,

481
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:29,208
Orange, you can add whatever else you want.

482
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:33,468
Do not take up public spaces.

483
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:35,348
We'll each get half of the public spaces.

484
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,708
Since you're proposing clauses, I have some too.

485
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:41,228
Time spent in the bathroom cannot exceed half an hour.

486
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:45,308
Then after taking a shower, you must wrap yourself in a towel before coming out.

487
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:48,908
Then you must close the door when you're washing your things.

488
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:50,648
Wait a minute.

489
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:54,588
I don't think we need to add these clauses.

490
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:56,728
Pay attention. You two just have to pay more attention to these things.

491
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,248
No,

492
00:33:58,248 --> 00:34:02,668
I highly suspect you just want to find a housemaid who's willing to do anything.

493
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,588
If that's the case, I'm going home.

494
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:06,508
Fine, no problem.

495
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:10,368
Lord Bao, draft up a termination contract.

496
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,748
I need to take a call. My phone is ringing.

497
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:16,548
Continue.

498
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,747
- Are they done? 
 - They are at war.

499
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,370

500
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,508
You have less than Â¥2,000 on your card.

501
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:50,028
Either you pay off your debt all at once and terminate the contract,

502
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:54,428
or you stay here and sell yourself to pay off the debt.

503
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:08,848
Fine, I agree,

504
00:35:08,848 --> 00:35:11,368
but you have to agree to one condition of mine.

505
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:16,948
You don't have any right to negotiate with me now.

506
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,348
If you don't agree,

507
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:21,688
even if I need to sell my blood and kidney, I'll terminate the contract with you.

508
00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:23,088
Tell me first.

509
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,268
Ke Qin wants to do an exclusive interview with you.

510
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:27,108
Doesn't your friend work for Qin Shan?

511
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:28,828
Do you think I will do that?

512
00:35:28,828 --> 00:35:30,488
She's my best friend.

513
00:35:30,488 --> 00:35:32,688
Her business is my business.

514
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:35,548
Fine, I can accept an interview.

515
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:38,828
However, I need to propose another clause.

516
00:35:39,368 --> 00:35:41,408
Another one?

517
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:46,108
From now on, besides cleaning and cooking,

518
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:50,148
you have to report to me where you go every time you leave the house.

519
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,308
Plus, you cannot turn your phone off

520
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,888
and you must be on standby 24/7.

521
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:57,888
- I should just sell my kidney. 
 - I'll pay you overtime.

522
00:36:03,348 --> 00:36:06,268
- Really? 
 - It depends on your performance.

523
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:09,648
What if there's a special circumstance,

524
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:12,448
for example, I have a fever or I get sick.

525
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:14,468
You must ask for time off

526
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:17,088
if you're sick or there's a special circumstance.

527
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:21,028
Fine, I agree.

528
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:27,128
 Ke Qin, I sold myself for you.

529
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:35,888
Who won?

530
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:54,930

531
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:06,091
â™«  I walk past many side roads before you met me  â™«

532
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:12,295
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

533
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:20,392
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

534
00:37:20,392 --> 00:37:26,079
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

535
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,525
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

536
00:37:29,525 --> 00:37:33,705
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

537
00:37:33,705 --> 00:37:40,058
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

538
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:43,618
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

539
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:45,391
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

540
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:47,691
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

541
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:50,605
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

542
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:54,593
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

543
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:57,910
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

544
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,878
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

545
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:06,164
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

546
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,913
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

547
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:12,304
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

548
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:16,338
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

549
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,272
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

550
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:23,271
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

551
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:26,514
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

552
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:30,676
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

553
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:34,891
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

554
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:41,539
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

555
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,292
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

556
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:03,172
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

557
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:09,719
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

558
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:13,110
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

559
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,144
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

560
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:20,178
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

561
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:23,977
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

562
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:27,420
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

563
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,382
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

564
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:35,597
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

565
00:39:35,597 --> 00:39:42,045
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
