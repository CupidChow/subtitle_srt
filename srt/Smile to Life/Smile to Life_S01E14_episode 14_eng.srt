1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,950

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,650
♫  I've walked around in a big circle  ♫

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,860
♫  To finally meet you  ♫

4
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:19,201
♫  How can my love be restrained?  ♫

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:24,376
♫  My love for you is too obvious  ♫

6
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:30,234
♫  I guess you must have already discovered it  ♫

7
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:33,000
♫  On that clear evening  ♫

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,540
♫  It was romantic meeting you  ♫

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,835
♫  An unforgettable memory  ♫

10
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,310
♫  I heard that passionate love  ♫

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,330
♫  Can dissolve glaciers  ♫

12
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:48,335
♫  I say good night to you every night  ♫

13
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,062
♫  If you get used to it as well  ♫

14
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:53,775
♫  I like your eyes  ♫

15
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:58,622
♫  The years become gentle as the wind gently blows behind you  ♫

16
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:01,504
♫  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  ♫

17
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:05,745
♫  If I can travel across the entire universe  ♫

18
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:10,585
♫  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   ♫

19
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:13,450
♫  I'm willing to wait for you  ♫

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,140
♫  We cross time and space to grow old together  ♫

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,320
♫  Your gentleness  ♫

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,080
♫  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  ♫

23
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:25,659
♫  If I can rest on any planet I want  ♫

24
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:31,178
♫  I will run into you in this universe  ♫

25
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:45,163
    🎈

26
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:49,086

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,340
This one's nice.

28
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,980
Look. This one is nice, too.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,100
Look at this picture. Your smile is pretty sweet.

30
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,400
I squinted my eyes in this. It won't do, I'll delete it.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,660
I think this one is pretty nice.

32
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,460
Let's keep it, then.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,600
Du, is everyone who dates like this?

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,040
Brother Rui, why don't you try dating someone to experience it?

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,500
I have no interest in dating right now.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
All I want to do right now is help Lao Jiang become popular again.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,380
- Unless I make him popular, I'm not in the mood to date. 
 - This one is not good. I have a double chin!

38
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,620
It has to be deleted.

39
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,620
But it looks pretty nice to me, too.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,620
They're all nice. Keep them all.

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,660
I really can't take it anymore.

42
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,000
You two want to enjoy the photos, right?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,240
Can you do that at home? The photographer's hourly rate is pretty expensive.

44
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,320
My stomach hurts. I have to go to the bathroom first.

45
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,120
Lao Jiang, was today's arrangement okay?

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,720
Yes, pretty good.

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,020
Be serious.

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,620
Not bad.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,240
From now on, whatever event I arrange for Lao Jiang, he'll cooperate well.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,260

51
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,460
Let me ask you, what's new with you and Jiang Nan?

52
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,440
We took portraits together.

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,140
Portraits?

54
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,400
Did Jiang Nan take promotional photos?

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me see.

56
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,420
My goodness.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,080
You took wedding pictures?

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,180
Your fake act is even more realistic than real couples.

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,540
It's just for work.

60
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,960
It's for his second round of marketing for his new release.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,480
Yeah, right. If it's for work, why did he share the photos on his WeChat Moments?

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,100
I didn't expect that, either.

63
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,980
Take a look yourself. It's super sweet.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,280
Big Lin, can you change your ring tone?

65
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
It's ruining our mood.

66
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,420
Is it mine?

67
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,220
What's wrong with it?

68
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,866
I'll just change it.

69
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,660
My brother, can't you stop smiling? Your mouth is practically touching the back of your head.

70
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,690
Can we first think about Orange's parents' wedding anniversary celebration tomorrow at noon,

71
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,360
and the Happy Family Restaurant's official opening?

72
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,540
What should I do?

73
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,200
Your father-in-law called me at least three times telling me I have to be there tomorrow.

74
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
Then just go.

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,220
I'll continue being "a good son-in-law" and you'll continue being "President Bao".

76
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,980
That's easy to say. Don't blame me if I fail.

77
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,220
Right now, I have no time to think about this.

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,300
I've got more important things to do.

79
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,700
What are you doing now?

80
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,820
You'll find out later.

81
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,420
Hurry up and go pick up Orange.

82
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Sister, stop drinking.

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,660
Go to bed early, okay?

84
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,120
Come here.

85
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,120
Look at me.

86
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,320
Am I pretty?

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,280
Of course.

88
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,620
Then am I different from before?

89
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,240
No. You are as pretty as ever.

90
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,500
Liar.

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,780
Sister!

92
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,580
Go away.

93
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,940
 Why did Jiang Nan take wedding pictures with that bean sprout?

94
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,460
 That person should be me!

95
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,260
 Why?

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,400

97
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,900
Teacher Xu, a special guest specifically asked to take your class.

98
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,800
I'll take you to meet them.

99
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,860
Hello, Teacher Xu. I've come a long way to meet you.

100
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,580
Then, first take a break here. I'll go get ready.

101
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,460
Take a break.

102
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,700
 Why did Gu Jia Yi come find me?

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,620
 Is it for Jiang Nan?

104
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,820
 So should I teach her or not?

105
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,340
 If I don't teach her, I will not have other students at the moment.

106
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,760
 But if I teach her, will Jiang Nan get mad?

107
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,340
 Forget it. Don't overthink it.

108
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,560
 Hurry and finish the lesson, so you can go celebrate Mom and Dad's wedding anniversary at Happy Family Restaurant.

109
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,340

110
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,320
I'm so happy today!

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,780
What are you doing?

112
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,480
Let me tell you...

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
There's nothing else for you to do here.

114
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,560
Okay.

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,260
You.

116
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,460
Xu Da Qiang, have you gone crazy?

117
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,680
I haven't finished addressing your secret stash of money and you're asking for money again.

118
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,940
Have you gone crazy?

119
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,440
Dear!

120
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,360
How are you so unromantic?

121
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,200
It's a finger heart.

122
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,500
Finger heart.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,420
Isn't this the gesture for "give me money"?

124
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,220
Finger heart!

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,142
Shoo! Shoo!

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,420
Here.

127
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,760
For me?

128
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,039
Of course.

129
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,620
I bought this with the private stash of money I've been collecting for a long time.

130
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,100
I didn't have much money, so I could only buy you a moissanite ring.

131
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,580
I used to think when I got rich,

132
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,060
I'd definitely buy you a big diamond ring.

133
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,780
You'll look so beautiful.

134
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,000
When we were young,

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,740
you suffered a lot with me.

136
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,480
Our future life will be better and better.

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,400
What others have, you have to have too!

138
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,020
- What are you doing? 
 - Hurry! Hurry.

139
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,740
You're annoying.

140
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,760
- Jiang Nan! 
 - Jiang Nan!

141
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,680
- It's fine. 
 - See?

142
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,580
Uncle, Aunt, why don't you finish what you were doing.

143
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,960
- No, no, no. 
 - We're not busy at all. Come here.

144
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,900
Wait, why are you wearing a mask?

145
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,680
It's a big day for the Happy Family Restaurant.

146
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,460
I'd better keep a low profile.

147
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
- He's a star. 
 - A star.

148
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,500
- They're all like this. 
 - Right.

149
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
Where's Cheng Cheng? She's not here yet?

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,060
Forget it. She just called to say the piano store added a last minute piano lesson.

151
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,160
That girl.

152
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,980
It's such a big day. Why didn't she ask for a leave?

153
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,020
Exactly. Whatever, let her be.

154
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,740
It's your first lesson and I don't know too much about you.

155
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,960
You came to learn piano because...

156
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,160
One of my upcoming roles requires me to play a little piano.

157
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,700
As soon as I heard I needed to play the piano,

158
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,380
the first person I thought of was you, Teacher Xu.

159
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,120
Just call me "Xu Duo Cheng".

160
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,100
We're familiar with each other, so let's not pretend to be strangers.

161
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,600
I'll call you "Cheng Cheng" and you may call me "Jia Yi".

162
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,620
Okay, Jia Yi. Today,

163
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,060
you'll start learning the basics.

164
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,820
First of all, try to avoid contact between your nails and the keys.

165
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,200
Arch your hands into semicircles.

166
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Rest your fingers gently on the keys like this.

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,580
Actually, when I dated Jiang Nan,

168
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,780
he taught me this.

169
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,980
He was sitting next to me just like you are

170
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,960
and taught me hand over hand.

171
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,880
But if you don't lay a good foundation,

172
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,380
it's hard to correct later on.

173
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,620
That's okay.

174
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,340
Anyway, it's just for acting.

175
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,700
You won't be able to tell through the camera.

176
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,040
You're so good at acting.

177
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm sure you don't want to just do surface level work, right?

178
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,200
Plus, if you aren't careful with details while filming,

179
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,460
the camera will easily reveal any mistake.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,540
You're quite similar to who I was in the past.

181
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,120
By the way, Jiang Nan...

182
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,620
Is he still having insomnia?

183
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,740
He?

184
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,320
He sleeps so well.

185
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,420
He falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow every night,

186
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,180
and he's so hyperactive when he sleeps!

187
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,580
He snores, grinds his teeth, and even kicks the covers off!

188
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,520
He's so noisy.

189
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,240
Really?

190
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,800
Now I announce that Happy Family Restaurant is officially open!

191
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,300
Many thanks to our regular customers for coming!

192
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,440
Today, all dishes are 20% off!

193
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,420
- Everyone, please come in! 
 - Hooray!

194
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,400
- Welcome! 
 - Please, come in.

195
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,040
- Welcome! 
 - Please, come in.

196
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,100
- You're also here! 
 - Congratulations!

197
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,880
- Thank you! Thank you! 
 - Welcome!

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,440
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

199
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,340
Thank you for coming! Many thanks!

200
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,220
- Let's go inside. 
 - Boss Xu!

201
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,740
President Bao! You're finally here.

202
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,900
I'm so honored to have you here.

203
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,220
- President Bao? 
 -  Let me introduce you.

204
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,400
This is President Bao, the benefactor of Happy Family Restaurant.

205
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,140
- Hurry! Greet him! 
 - President Bao! Nice to meet you!

206
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,420
- Thank you so much! 
 - Let me tell you, Dear. President Bao is an investor!

207
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,900
His pockets are deep.

208
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,920
He backed by... What was it?

209
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,960
- Funds. 
 - Right! Funds.

210
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,020
- Funds! 
 - Young and talented!

211
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,180
President Bao, allow me to introduce someone.

212
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,540
This is my daughter's boyfriend, Jiang Nan. Look!

213
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,120
- Handsome and talented! 
 - He's a famous singer.

214
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,480
He's a singer-songwriter.

215
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,780
I'm not exaggerating. He's very talented.

216
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,340
Nice to meet you.

217
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
Nice to meet you.

218
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,140
Jiang Nan, be sure to toast President Bao at the banquet, now that you're acquainted.

219
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,240
Okay.

220
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,320
Well, President Bao. Let me tell you. Jiang Nan,

221
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,400
he's a big name in the music industry. He's really talented.

222
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
Is that so?

223
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,140
Young man, see?

224
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,280
Your father-in-law is so nice to you, isn't he?

225
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,720
All right, President Bao, don't stand here talking.

226
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,160
Hurry inside! Talk inside.

227
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,320
This...

228
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,260
Wait, what are you guys...

229
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,840
Y-You...

230
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,060
Hello, Uncle. My name is Zhan Zhi Lin.

231
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,100
- I'm also pursuing Cheng Cheng. 
 - What?

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,740
This...

233
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
This...

234
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,340
- What's going on here? 
 - How would I know?

235
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,040
We meet again.

236
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,720
You know each other?

237
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,380
- What? 
 - Are they fighting?

238
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,180
What fighting?

239
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,740
Would it be so quiet if they were fighting?

240
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,540
Are you stupid?

241
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,740
- What? What? 
 - Come here. Come here.

242
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,620
What do you want?

243
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,360
Jiang Nan is so pitiful.

244
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,680
I originally invited President Bao to invest in Jiang Nan and support his career.

245
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,580
I didn't expect another love competitor to appear.

246
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,760
Will President Bao still have a good impression of Jiang Nan?

247
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,660
You alway worry about other people's business.

248
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,780
Jiang Nan is a handsome, talented, and famous singer.

249
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,040
But this Zhan guy is also good-looking,

250
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,160
and looking at his clothes and accessories,

251
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,080
he's not an ordinary person either.

252
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,900
I always thought it would be hard for Cheng Cheng to find a boyfriend,

253
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,260
but it turns out Cheng Cheng is actually a hot commodity!

254
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,460
I'm telling you. Forget about reputation.

255
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,080
The main thing is our daughter has to like him.

256
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,680
Okay, no more eavesdropping. I'm going to help Big Lin.

257
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,920
He definitely can't manage everything by himself.

258
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
- Go. Go. 
 - Stop eavesdropping!

259
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,120
Just go!

260
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,840
What is Cheng Cheng doing? Why isn't she here yet?

261
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,760
Happy Family Restaurant isn't large

262
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,260
but the tea here is good.

263
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,460
Zhan Zhi Lin, what are you trying to do?

264
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,100
What's wrong? You're scared?

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,040
This game has become interesting.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,240
I have never treated Xu Duo Cheng and her family as a game.

267
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,980
Why?

268
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,560
Because to me, they are worth cherishing.

269
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
I won't allow you to hurt them in any way.

270
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,640
You cherish them.

271
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,360
What about my mom?

272
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,260
My mom is also someone I cherish,

273
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,400
but you killed her.

274
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,540
If you have any resentment, come at me.

275
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,860
What should I do to make you let got of  Xu Duo Cheng?

276
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,800
I won't let her go.

277
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,440
I want to make you worry about her every day.

278
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,960
I want to make you unhappy,

279
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,460
but also feel helpless toward me.

280
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,160
Zhan Zhi Lin!

281
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920

282
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,720
I'm sorry to delay your lunch.

283
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,260
Why don't we eat together?

284
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,780
No, thank you.

285
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,180
I should be the one thanking you.

286
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,700
You taught me piano so diligently,

287
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,720
and you're so cheap!

288
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,660
I mean your lesson prices are so cheap.

289
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,960
I'm even a little embarrassed.

290
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,600
It's good as long as you've learned something.

291
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,960
By the way, don't tell Jiang Nan that I came to learn piano.

292
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,100
You know him. He's sensitive.

293
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,080
I'm afraid he'll misunderstand something.

294
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,320
I won't tell him.

295
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,540
 Dad, it's me.

296
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,620
Cheng Cheng?

297
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,460
I called you many times but you never answered,

298
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,580
and you didn't even come to the opening ceremony.

299
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,880
Where are you doing? Where are you?

300
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,700
 Dad, I was giving a piano lesson and couldn't answer the phone,

301
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,160
 and I just got caught in the rain.

302
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,720
 I'll get changed and head over, okay?.

303
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,780
What? You could have borrowed someone's phone

304
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,580
and called us to let us know.

305
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,700
We were so worried!

306
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
 Dad, I was wrong.

307
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,840
 I'll go over right now and apologize.

308
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,420
Fine.

309
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,980
Jiang Nan left because he had something to do.

310
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,700
Thank him for me.

311
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,960
 - Okay.  
 - Xu Da Qiang!

312
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,700
What are you doing? Who are you calling?

313
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,140
We're swamped in the kitchen!

314
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,420
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

315
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
All right, all right. Your mom is calling me.

316
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,180
I'll hang up first.

317
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,760
 Bye-bye.

318
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,220
Welcome!

319
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,990

320
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,740
Just a moment, please.

321
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,320
Finished? Take care.

322
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,820
- Sister-in-law? 
 - Xiao Du? Why haven't you left?

323
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,840
Brother Nan said it's busy here and asked me to help out.

324
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,500
- Thank you. 
 - I'll continue serving.

325
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
Dad.

326
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
Sweetie, you're finally here.

327
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,180
I've created a new dish. Have a taste.

328
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,320
Here. Try it.

329
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,940
Slowly, slowly.

330
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,740
How is it?

331
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,060
Too salty?

332
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,660
Too bland?

333
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,540
Come on. Say something.

334
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,100
Delicious!

335
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,800
I want another piece.

336
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,680
Good. I'm afraid you can't have more.

337
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,820
The dish is for a customer. I'll cook it for you at home tonight.

338
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,160
I'm going to help my mom, then.

339
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,880
Hurry and go. Hurry and go.

340
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,560
Too salty? Too bland?

341
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,220
Young Master Zhan, how are you so free today

342
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
to ask me out for coffee?

343
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,760
Gu Jia Yi, why did you go find Xu Duo Cheng?

344
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,280
What do you mean?

345
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,720
I don't understand.

346
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,580
You could find anyone to teach you piano.

347
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,600
Why did you have to ask Xu Duo Cheng?

348
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,420
And only after Jiang Nan and her took wedding photos.

349
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,060
I... I just asked her because I knew her.

350
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,600
Gu Jia Yi, I'm warning you again.

351
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,840
Don't mess with Xu Duo Cheng.

352
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,040
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

353
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,560
Why are you so angry?

354
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,100
And we're two of a kind, aren't we?

355
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,180
Stop pretending to be a saint.

356
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,280
You're right but you're wrong.

357
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,200
I will compete fairly with Jiang Nan.

358
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,860
Cheng Cheng, there was a Xiao Zhan who came to the restaurant today.

359
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,080
Is he pursuing you?

360
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,500
Which Xiao Zhan?

361
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,720
That Zhan... Zhan Zhi Lin?

362
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,560
He's the owner of the piano store I'm teaching at.

363
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,440
Tell Mom the truth. Does he like you?

364
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,060
He even told us he was pursuing you.

365
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,480
Don't believe him.

366
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,080
It's not true.

367
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,560
Really?

368
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,100
Sweetie, I used to be at your age too.

369
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,500
I understand all of that.

370
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,600
You're so beautiful and so cute.

371
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,320
It's good for you to have admirers,

372
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,380
and I feel very happy too,

373
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,480
but Cheng Cheng, since you're dating Jiang Nan,

374
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,500
you must treat him wholeheartedly, got it?

375
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,820
Got it.

376
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,460
Don't worry.

377
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:08,438
♫  The bright color of caramel  ♫

378
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:10,336
♫  is the sign of summer  ♫

379
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,867
♫  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  ♫

380
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:17,569
♫  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  ♫

381
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:21,198
♫  You lift away my arrogant facade  ♫

382
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,548
♫  It isn't the best feeling  ♫

383
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:28,318
♫  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  ♫

384
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:32,124
♫  Maybe you added your favorite ingredients  ♫

385
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:38,491
♫  Every day becomes magical because of you  ♫

386
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,556
♫  I like the taste of cola chicken wings  ♫

387
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,027
♫  I want to be close to you, I'll never get tired  ♫

388
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:46,730
♫  The perfect amount of sweetness  ♫

389
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,491
♫  Secretly fermenting these memories in cola  ♫

390
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,920
 Xiao Du, has your sister-in-law left Happy Family Restaurant yet?

391
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,660
 Brother, she said she'd visit Dou Dou before going home.

392
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,260
 You'll need to wait  a little.

393
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,860
♫  There's sauce at the corners of your smile  ♫

394
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,820
♫  I want to grow old with you like this  ♫

395
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,220
 Doctor Sui, how is Dou Dou?

396
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,420
 You're familiar with the disease too.

397
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,820
 We're all trying our best.

398
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,720
 As for you, you must take Edaravone injections regularly.

399
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,380
 You can't miss them.

400
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,940
 No matter how I try to ignore it,

401
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,240
 this is my future.

402
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,180
 I must cherish the time I have now.

403
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,040
 This...

404
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,820
 Is he going to...

405
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,600
Cheng Cheng, I bought these flowers for you.

406
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,440
They're all your favorites.

407
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,340
Jiang Nan, there's something I need to tell you.

408
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm planning to move out tomorrow.

409
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,040
Cheng Cheng, do you not like this place?

410
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,480
If you don't like it, tell me what type of place you like.

411
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,240
Lord Bao and I will go look for it.

412
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm just thinking that all the gossip about you has subsided.

413
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,120
There's no point in keeping our contract.

414
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,180
Don't worry.

415
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,840
I'll return your money as soon as possible.

416
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,720
Give me some time.

417
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,560
If there's nothing else, I'll go upstairs.

418
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,160
Xu Duo Cheng!

419
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,700
I admit we agreed to date because of the contract,

420
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,340
but the contract doesn't matter anymore.

421
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,380
Let's just forget about it,

422
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,560
and don't mention anything about returning the money anymore.

423
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,280
- Actually, I want to tell you— 
 - I don't like you!

424
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,680
Xu Duo Cheng!

425
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,800
Look into my eyes and tell me.

426
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,780
You're lying, right?

427
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,100
Yes.

428
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,840
I like you.

429
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,580
But I only like you as your fan.

430
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,360
I'm not into you in real life.

431
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,960
We're not compatible at all.

432
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,200
 Jiang Nan, I'm someone without a future.

433
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,060
 I can't accompany you through life

434
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,620
 and witness your success.

435
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,240
 I can't be your partner for life.

436
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,200
 I'm sorry.

437
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,680
You're awake?

438
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,700
You stayed at my door all night?

439
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,000
I didn't dare go sleep in my room.

440
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,880
I was afraid you'd pack up your stuff and leave quietly.

441
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,120
Don't do that.

442
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,120
I thought all night.

443
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,020
If you think there are still things we need to work through, I'm willing to change for you.

444
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,520
You don't have to change for me.

445
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,140
I've really made up my mind already.

446
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,540
Hello, Lord Bao.

447
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,240
 Hey, Cheng Cheng. Is Lao Jiang there?

448
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,900
 He didn't answer his phone. Are you with him?

449
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,160
Wait a sec.

450
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,720
It's Lord Bao.

451
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,340
- Hello? 
 - The nursing home staff called you a dozen times, but you didn't answer at all.

452
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,560
They had to call me.

453
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,480
 The address of the nursing home was exposed.

454
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,760
A bunch of reporters are waiting there and want an interview.

455
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,200
You better go over and take a look.

456
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,520
Got it.

457
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,140
I have to go to the nursing home.

458
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Did something happen to Auntie?

459
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,440
Wait at home for me to return.

460
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,560
Wait.

461
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,180
I'll go with you.

462
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,020
Your mother is going through a critical stage.

463
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,980
She can recognize people once in a while.

464
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,400
If she's shocked again, all the progress will be lost.

465
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,660
I advise you to move her to another place.

466
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,900
Doctor, my mom once told me she wanted to go back to her hometown.

467
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,320
Do you think it's good for her?

468
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,880
Absolutely.

469
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,400
A place she's familiar with is the best.

470
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,040
Okay, I see.

471
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,120
Thank you, Doctor.

472
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,380
Thank you for all your help during this time.

473
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,980
You're welcome.

474
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,480
Chairman.

475
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,100
What has Zhi Lin been doing recently?

476
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,040
Recently, Director Zhan often asks Tao Tao to go to a nursing home.

477
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
What?

478
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,220
Ask him to come over here.

479
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,500
Director Zhan went out this afternoon and hasn't returned.

480
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,080
- Where did he go? 
 - I don't know.

481
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,580
He didn't mention it.

482
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,480
Get the car ready.

483
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,980
Yes, Chairman.

484
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,680
Jiang Nan?

485
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,700
What are you doing here?

486
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,780
You don't think you've hurt my mom enough?

487
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,980
You think this isn't viral enough?

488
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,480
I just got the news too.

489
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,140
She's doing well. Don't worry.

490
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,940
You may leave.

491
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,560
I...

492
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,500
Could I have a look at her from afar?

493
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,780
No need. Please, leave.

494
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,080
Jiang Nan, it's already been so many years.

495
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,493
I've always tried to ease the tension between our two families.

496
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:01,640
I think this would be good for your mother too.

497
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,920
You don't need to say anything else.

498
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,720
All these years, my mother doesn't even recognize me anymore.

499
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,060
Let alone, remember you.

500
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,900
So everything you're doing is in vain

501
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,600
and will only make you and me suffer more.

502
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,740
Then...

503
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Could you give your mother this bouquet?

504
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
 Where are you?

505
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,580
Just tell me what you want to say.

506
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,360
 Did you expose the address of the nursing home where Jiang Nan's mother is?

507
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,860
 Why can't you let this go?

508
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,960
 Let the past be in the past!

509
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,240
Past?

510
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,660
How do I let it go?

511
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,440
I'm telling you, I'll never let this go!

512
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,480
Nan Nan!

513
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,060
Our superstar is back!

514
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,860
Aunt.

515
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,760
Honey, who is she?

516
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,940
Sister-in-law, I'm A'Xia.

517
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,160
Your husband's biological younger sister.

518
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,380
A'Xia?

519
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,060
A'Xia, why have you gotten so old?

520
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,240
Where's your long braid?

521
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,920
Aunt, don't worry.

522
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,420
Take it slow.

523
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,460
By the way, I forgot to introduce someone to you.

524
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,360
This is Xu Duo Cheng.

525
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,080
Nice to meet you.

526
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,580
Very nice.

527
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,640
This girl is so charming.

528
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,340
Aunt, let's go inside first.

529
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,600
Look at me, I'm too busy talking.

530
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,360
- Come in! Let's put your stuff inside. 
 - After you.

531
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,080
A moment later, a decade has passed.

532
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,880
It's the first time I've come back.

533
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,580
Was this you when you were small?

534
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,320
That was when I was three.

535
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,000
So cute.

536
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,800
What about this picture?

537
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,280
I think that was when I first entered elementary school.

538
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,900
You're even wearing a red neck scarf.

539
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,980
You won so many trophies.

540
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
Of course.

541
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,100
When I was a kid, my mom noticed I liked music

542
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,060
and liked to sing on stage,

543
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,060
so she often took me to various singing competitions.

544
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,300
So you were a trophy child

545
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,480
and have always done well since then.

546
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,280
Since I'm so good,

547
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,940
are you really not going to reconsider?

548
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,000
Shouldn't we put these photos away?

549
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,100
So they won't be seen by Auntie.

550
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,840
Right. Good thing you thought of it.

551
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,740
Let's put them away.

552
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,680
This is my father.

553
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,460
He must be an excellent person as well.

554
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,639
As they say, sometimes the good die young.

555
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,300
Even though my dad passed away early,

556
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,160
he's always alive in my heart.

557
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,780
 Nan Nan, Cheng Cheng, time for lunch!

558
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,680
Okay, Aunt. We'll be right there.

559
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,560
Hurry. Let's put them away.

560
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,560
 Brother, Jiang Nan took his mother back to her hometown.

561
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,940
- Hello? 
 - Xu Duo Cheng, where are you?

562
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,300
I'm not in Xinhai.

563
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,420
Whatever it is, let's talk when I get back.

564
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,859
Xu Duo Cheng, are you really going to give up your life for him?

565
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:59,360
I don't have much free time anyway.

566
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
I don't want to have any regrets.

567
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,820
You...

568
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,100
Cai Yun, I'm going to wash my hands.

569
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,800
You enjoy it yourself.

570
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,900
Too much sun can make you dizzy when you stand up.

571
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,740
Cheng Cheng, go take a rest in your room.

572
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,160
It's fine, I'll stay here.

573
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,260
Okay, thank you, Aunt.

574
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,180
What are you eating?

575
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,740
Nothing. Vitamin C tablets.

576
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,540
I want one.

577
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,560
I didn't know how long I'd stay here, so I didn't bring that many.

578
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,740
Stingy.

579
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,780
Can't I just go buy you a new bottle at the pharmacy?

580
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,620
I only take this brand of tablets.

581
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
You can't buy it in pharmacies.

582
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,140
What's wrong?

583
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,740
Jiang Nan,

584
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,560
if...

585
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,660
If I...

586
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:32,040

587
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:43,702
♫  I walked past many side roads before you met me  ♫

588
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:50,316
♫  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  ♫

589
00:36:51,603 --> 00:36:58,113
♫  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  ♫

595
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,112

596
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:25,412
