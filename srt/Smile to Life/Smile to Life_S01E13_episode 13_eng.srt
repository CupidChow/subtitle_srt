00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:13,654
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:15,894
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:19,194
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:24,469
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:30,327
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:33,041
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,546
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:38,828
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:41,627
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:44,441
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:48,328
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:51,155
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:53,768
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,615
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:58,782
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you    â™«

17
00:00:58,782 --> 00:01:01,497
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:05,838
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:10,685
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:13,439
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,173
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,380
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,093
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:25,652
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:31,071
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:45,080
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,816

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,620
 Cheng, Cheng, it's your Dad!

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,620
 Open the door!

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,140
- What's wrong? 
 - My dad's here.

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,980
Your dad is here?

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,200
- What should we do? 
 - How would I know what to do?

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,620
Hurry and hide for now!

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,520
Cheng Cheng, open the door!

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,320
- Your clothes! 
 - Give it to me!

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,580
We'll talk through WeChat!

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,680
The door is opened?

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,200
Dad, why are you here?

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,860
What took you so long to open the door, Daughter?

40
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,680
This... Ke Qin is such a big eater.

41
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,860
She has a high workload, so she has to eat a lot.

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,900
Just now, she didn't even have time to get in a bite,

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
before she had to leave on a business trip again.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,500
I can tell it's takeout.

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,360
All right.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,100
I brought you delicious food.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,960
That... Dad, you can place the food here and hurry back.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
It's very late and Mom will get worried,

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,180
and it's not safe at night.

50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,120
Child, what are you saying? I just got here and you are trying to make me leave, right?

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,880
No, I'm not.

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
I miss you.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
I'll stay with you for two days.

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
There's no need to, Dad!

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,260
Both Mom and you don't have to worry.

56
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,100
The Happy Family Restuarant has been very busy recently.

57
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,880
My place is too far from the restaurant and will be inconvenient for you to get to and from work.

58
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,860
Daughter, I've been a cook for many years now.

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,520
I should get some rest.

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,960
Besides, I have to give my apprentices an opportunity too.

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,460
This way they can practice their skills.

62
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,060
Am I right?

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
Such a large living room!

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,300
Look!

65
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,880
This large sofa!

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,080
So soft!

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,540
Daughter, what's wrong?

68
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,199
Am I not welcome here?

69
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,760
You are!

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,620
But Dad, I think...

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,100
Ke Qin and I are two girls living here, but you're a man here...

72
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,580
It's really inconvenient!

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,700
And there are only two bedrooms here, so there's no room for you to sleep.

74
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,060
There's room! This sofa is great.

75
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,060
I'll sleep here!

76
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,800
 Besides, Daughter, it's a bit of a waste for just you two to live in such a big space.

77
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,560
 Since Ke Qin is on a business trip,

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,460
 it's not safe to stay here on your own!

79
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,200
Just now, I ran into a hefty fellow downstairs. He looked very fierce!

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,740
No, wait, Dad...

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,520
It's very safe since I'm here.

82
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,060
- Dad, where are you going? 
 - I...

83
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,900
To the kitchen.

84
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,660
The kitchen is there.

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,920
I was confused for a second.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I'll heat this food for you.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
It has gone a bit cold.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,340
In the future, don't always order takeout.

89
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,520
It's bad for your health.

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
Got it.

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,760
Be more diligent and cook your food.

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Dad, let me take you somewhere!

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,160
No, where are you taking me?

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,800
- The stove! 
 - Don't mind here!

95
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,680
- Wait, where are you taking me? 
 - Hurry up!

96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,520
- You'll know when you see it. 
 - But I need to heat the food for you.

97
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,900
- Let's go later. 
 - Let's go.

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,240
Slow down! Don't push me!

99
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,960
- No... wait, what are you doing? 
 - Sit over here.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,040
- Wait, Daughter... 
 - Sit down.

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,860
I can't just sit! The food is still heating on the stove. You...

102
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,620
- Dad! 
 - What are you doing?

103
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,800
We haven't watched a movie together in so long.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,340
- Yes! 
 - You love watching movies, right?

105
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,860
- I do, but I'll watch it later. 
 - No!

106
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,080
I've prepared your favorite movie today!

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,220
No, wait, you know my favorite movie?

108
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,360
Charlie's Angels.

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
S-S-Someone's here.

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,600
I'll answer it! Dad!

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,300
Who's it?

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,900
Uncle, you're here.

113
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,380
Jiang Nan? It's so late, you...

114
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,280
Why are you here?

115
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,600
I was with my friends and we wanted to eat some cola chicken wings,

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,320
but we didn't have any chicken wings. I came here to get some.

117
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,280
Why does he know you have chicken wings in your refrigerator?

118
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
He guessed?

119
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,260
Good answer.

120
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,660
Jiang Nan.

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,920
Uncle.

122
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,940
Cola chicken wings?

123
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,040
A friend gathering?

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
- You must be hungry. 
 - Yes.

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,580
Why don't you take a seat and eat here?

126
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,800
My friends are still waiting for me, so I won't...

127
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Take a seat.

128
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,940
Here, eat.

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,260
Eat.

130
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,633
- There are still two more dishes! 
 - Uncle, I can get it.

131
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,433
You sit.

132
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,540
Cola chicken wings.

133
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,980
Go ahead and eat!

134
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,380
Cola chicken wings.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How do you like the food?

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,520
- It's good! 
 - How do you like me?

137
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,140
I asked, "How do you like me?"

138
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,780
You're very nice!

139
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,980
Back then in 1990,

140
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,280
in order to get closer to your Auntie,

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I applied to become a dorm supervisor at my school.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,900
At that time, I only had a flashlight with me.

143
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,840
Where there was darkness, there was light.

144
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,020
Do you understand?

145
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
I do.

146
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,360
Just as the old saying goes,

147
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,720
"Even the most cunning fox is unable to escape from a good hunter."

148
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,620
Uncle, I'm not a fox,

149
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,240
and I understand everything you said.

150
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,840
You can rest assured.

151
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,180
Okay. I am rest assured then.

152
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,280
Eat up!

153
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,400
Uncle, I know you like to have a drink or two when eating.

154
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,780
I'll get you a bottle of beer.

155
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,280
Sit down!

156
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,540
Back then in 1994,

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,060
I resigned from my position of dorm supervisor

158
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,340
because your Auntie graduated.

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,960
Your Auntie loves eating and understands all kinds of food,

160
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,800
so I learned to cook all kinds of food for her.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,100
There is a saying,

162
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,160
"The way to someone's heart is through their stomach."

163
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,300
I managed to learn to cook all sorts of things starting from simple dishes.

164
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,100
In the end, I became the "dorm supervisor" of my culinary school.

165
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,400
Uncle, don't worry.

166
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,860
I'll be like you in the future and improve my cooking skills.

167
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,620
You don't understand it yet.

168
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,200
Look at our Cheng Cheng's hands.

169
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,060
These are the hands of a pianist.

170
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,540
You must protect them and care for them.

171
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,020
You just can't have her do any heavy manual labor, all right?

172
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,180
No problem, Uncle!

173
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,720
Uncle, don't worry. I can definitely do that!

174
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,340
You can rest assured.

175
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,580
My story is almost over.

176
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,820
- Eat! 
 - Eat!

177
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,620
 Hello, the phone number you just dialed is currently busy...

178
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,060
Xu Da Qiang, how dare you hang up my phone call!

179
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,700
This child, your long legs are really great!

180
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,520
One step of yours is equal to four steps of mine.

181
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,060
I'm almost running trying to keep up.

182
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,040
Good. It's really good!

183
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,620
That... when you don't have to drive next time,

184
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,040
you must drink with me, all right?

185
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,700
- All right, Uncle! 
 - Here, off you go!

186
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,700
- Get in here! 
 - Dad, Dad!

187
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
Wait, don't!

188
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,280
What's wrong?

189
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,820
Your father-in-law didn't like you?

190
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,360
Don't even mention it.

191
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,560
I can't even go back to my own home now.

192
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
I really understand her dad.

193
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
If my good cabbage was ruined by a pig, 
  (T/N: A humorous way of saying that one's daughter has been taken by an average man)

194
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,860
I'd also be unhappy.

195
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,980
You don't even have any cabbage to ruin yet.

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,580
Didn't you go to confess?

197
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,340
I never had the chance to.

198
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,520
I originally had it all planned out.

199
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,480
I wanted to have a romantic dinner with her tonight.

200
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,680
Who would have thought her dad would come barging in halfway?

201
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,620
Lao Jiang, even I feel sorry for you.

202
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,260
With your kind of temper

203
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,080
when you meet a girl you like,

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
you either keep hesitating or say nothing.

205
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,280
What can you do?

206
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,680
Aren't you a single dog too? 
  (T/N: A form of slang to self-deprecatingly say you're single)

207
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,240
Worry about yourself first.

208
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,900
Brother Nan, you're here very early.

209
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,140
Did you two make an appointment to come to my "temple" together?

210
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,680
I asked him to come with me.

211
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,660
Otherwise, I would have to listen to you whine myself.

212
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,480
I would be annoyed to death.

213
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,060
My sermons are expensive, yet you are so ungrateful for them!

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,020
I am grateful!

215
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,880
Lord Bao, please, teach me!

216
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
I did what you said and haven't contacted my Ke Qin for two days,

217
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
but she is still ignoring me.

218
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,400
What should I do?

219
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,060
"Great plans can be ruined by just a touch of impatience."

220
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,200
Look at you two.

221
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,680
One of you is worrying about his father-in-law and the other is worrying because of unrequited love.

222
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,560
And me? I can only worry about my temple.

223
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,340
So you don't like girls?

224
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,400
Chubby, do you not want to be with Yu Ke Qin?

225
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,520
I do! It's my dream!

226
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,440
- Call me Brother. 
 - Brother!

227
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,720
Say it more affectionately.

228
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,760
Brother, please, teach me!

229
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,720
- Say it one more time. 
 - Brother!

230
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,220
Bao Rui!

231
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,580
What kind of photo editing is this?

232
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,440
It looks too fake!

233
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,470
Let me see.

234
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,180
Look!

235
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,440
That's pretty good though.

236
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
It's very realistic.

237
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
Chubby, here.

238
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,600
Aren't you studying photography? You take a look!

239
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,840
How is the editing? Isn't it nice?

240
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,920
It's very good editing.

241
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,000
See?

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,700
- Do you have any taste? 
 - I do.

243
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,600
You edited Brother Nan to look like Sister Nan.

244
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,920
If you're so good, then you do it.

245
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,340
Don't edit Sister Nan to become Ke Qin, all right.

246
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,720
Chubby, I'll depend on you.

247
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,260
Here.

248
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,547
â™«  The bright color of caramel  â™«

249
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:32,345
â™«  is the sign of summer  â™«

250
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:35,976
â™«  Your laughter is like tumbling bubbles  â™«

251
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,578
â™«  The light vapor of the freezer; the taste of ice  â™«

252
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:43,207
â™«  You lift away my arrogant facade  â™«

253
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:45,657

254
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:50,427
â™«  My heart burns in a blaze of oil  â™«

255
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:54,133
â™«  Maybe you added your favorite ingredients  â™«

256
00:14:54,133 --> 00:15:00,900
â™«  Every day becomes magical because of you  â™«

257
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,540
They're so sweet!

258
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,700
It really feels different when they actually like each other.

259
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,960
Xu Duo Cheng can actually debut in the entertainment industry if she wanted to right now!

260
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,070
â™«  I can't abstain from the taste of liking you  â™«

261
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,320

262
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,880
 Chubby Zhu hasn't sent me anything for a couple of days now.

263
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,560

264
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,820
When I listen to Jiang Nan's new song, I think of my first love.

265
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,060
It seems the past Jiang Nan has returned!

266
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,080
I'll be his fan again!

267
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,540
I bought this Coke, so I could listen to the song and drink it.

268
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,100
They are so cute.

269
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,520
I believe in love once again.

270
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
Big news! Big news!

271
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
"The Sound of the Music World" wrote a comment! Did you see it?

272
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
"The song 'Cola Chicken Wings' has risen to the top three in the hottest new songs list in just half a day."

273
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,013
"With one song, he has answered back to the years-long criticism of his talents being of the past."

274
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,320
It's quite good.

275
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,150

276
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,190

277
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,060
The "Iron Lady" even liked my post.

278
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,610

279
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,320
You come to my place more and more often now.

280
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,620
That coffee is quite good. May I have a cup?

281
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,300
You really do choose the best time to come. Here.

282
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,380
All right, don't fool around here.

283
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,340
Ask what you are trying to ask.

284
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,300
How has the girl been?

285
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,280
I knew you would ask about her.

286
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,980
She didn't show up today, but she said she'd take injections next week.

287
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,160
Why?

288
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,560
She said she was busy.

289
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,120
Remind her if you get a chance.

290
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
Edaravone injections are very effective for neuron degeneration.

291
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,460
She has to persevere through fully.

292
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
Okay.

293
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,119
 Hello?

294
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,820
Xu Duo Cheng, Doctor Sui said you didn't come for an injection today.

295
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,040
 I've been busy these past couple of days.

296
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,439
Is it fine if I come in a few days later?

297
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,200
Cheng Cheng, I want to go to the movies.

298
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,540
 Jiang Hai used to take me to movie theaters in the past.

299
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,220
Okay. I'll go with you tomorrow.

300
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,340
Xu Duo Cheng, are you with Jiang Nan's mother?

301
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,620
How can you delay your own treatment for someone else?

302
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,420
 Don't you know when one neuron dies there's one less neuron you have?

303
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,660
I can handle my own business.

304
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,300
Don't worry.

305
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,100
Remember that you must come to the hospital for an examination.

306
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,560
Lao Jiang! Lao Jiang!

307
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,980
Why didn't you answer the phone? Have you seen the ranking?

308
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,860
Are you happy? Are you excited?

309
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,160
I saw it.

310
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,460
Hopefully, all these good things can continue.

311
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,820
- And comments. Have you read the comments? 
 - Not yet.

312
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm telling you that real couples are different.

313
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,020
Your interactions are so so sweet!

314
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,120
Really! Yeah.

315
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,720
Just like this.

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,480
You guys are so digusting!

317
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,040
Where are you going?

318
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,980
To meet Xu Duo Cheng and go home to eat the meal made by my father-in-law.

319
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,660
Father-in-law?

320
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,440
Calling him "Father-in-law". That's perfect.

321
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
He is worth teaching.

322
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,980
"Cola Chicken Wings" is quite well-received.

323
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,740
You just have to maintain this state.

324
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,500
You'll get new inspiration and create better songs.

325
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,360
You're still worrying about my dad?

326
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,300
Just endure it for a bit.

327
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,060
I'll definitely think of something.

328
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
How?

329
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,480
My dad enjoys drinking.

330
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,320
When he's tipsy and happy, he's nice to everyone.

331
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,720
Trust me.

332
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
Here.

333
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,620
You're back!

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,940
Dad, what did you do here?

335
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,300
They're all your favorite types of food.

336
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,000
It's convenient for you to eat here.

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,040
But...

338
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,440
Sit down. Why are you still standing?

339
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,780
This is Jiang...

340
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,860
This is the landlord's trophy.

341
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,640
How can you place it up there?

342
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,200
You can't touch things without permission if it's not yours.

343
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,240
Don't move it.

344
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,980
It's perfect to make the jar air-proof.

345
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,820
- No. Put it back. 
 -  Stop!

346
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,920
- I have to put it back. 
 - Stop! I made so many efforts to...

347
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,720
Uncle, it's okay.

348
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,260
If Uncle wants to use it, then he can.

349
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,540
I'll talk with the landlord later.

350
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,560
See? Jiang Nan is the one who can talk.

351
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,260
Have a seat. Have a seat.

352
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,780
From Mom?

353
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,900
No. Just a nuisance call.

354
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,480

355
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,400
See? Mom couldn't reach you so she's calling me now.

356
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,660
 Xu Da Qiang, how dare you!

357
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,660
 You hid a secret stash of money and got kicked out. Now you won't come back?

358
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,400
- It's not true. 
 - Dad, you were kicked out?

359
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,360
So you tried to hide a secret stash of money under my mom's nose and was caught?

360
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,640
Who tried to hide a secret stash of money?

361
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,740
And why use the word "hide"?

362
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,660
Jiang Nan, we're both men.

363
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,240
You understand, right?

364
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,260
- A man can't go out without money. 
 - Yes.

365
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,680
You have to have social niceties,

366
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,080
like having a drink, treating someone, or enjoying a Starbucks or a Coke, right?

367
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,380
- Uncle, don't be anxious. 
 - I am not.

368
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,860
- Hide it in a better place next time. 
 - I hid it in a really good place.

369
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,360
Wait, you're quite experienced, aren't you?

370
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,420
She's calling again.

371
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,700
 Who hung up on me?

372
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,940
 Xu Da Qiang, was it you?

373
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,320
 I'm begging you.

374
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,500
Mom, it's me.

375
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,600
 Cheng Cheng, is your dad at your place?

376
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,080
Dad is not with me.

377
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,960
 Tell me as soon as he comes to you.

378
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay, Mom. I'll let you know the second my dad comes.

379
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,180
 - All right. Bye.  
 - Hurry! Hang up!

380
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,580
I'll give it to you when I get back.

381
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,300
I didn't dote on you for nothing.

382
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,120
You really are my daughter.

383
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,540
I'll cook delicious food for you later.

384
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,680
I've decided.

385
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
I'm not leaving.

386
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,800
I want to live here for the time being.

387
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,480
I want to live here for the time being.

388
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,020
Permanently!

389
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Jiang Nan.

390
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,020
I'm so thirsty.

391
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,960
I... I'll get you a glass of water.

392
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,740
Okay.

393
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,560
Naive boy.

394
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,080
You want to make me drunk?

395
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,180
Wife... Why are you here?

396
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Why do you think I'm here?

397
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,980
- Get up! 
 - It hurts! Let go!

398
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,480
It hurts! L-L-Let go!

399
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,640
- Let go! 
 - Why did you use so much force?

400
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,460
Our daughter is here. Give me some face.

401
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,440
That's enough already.

402
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,020
I know. I know you're worried about our daughter,

403
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,460
but she's grown up now.

404
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,320
You must trust her.

405
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,980
You told your mom to come here?

406
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
Only my mom can control my dad.

407
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,460
This way is most effective.

408
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,900
I trust our daughter,

409
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,100
but not that lad.

410
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,640
Look at him. Look at his face.

411
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,280
He is very thievish-looking.

412
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,360
He doesn't look like a good kid.

413
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,380
Besides, aren't you afraid something bad will happen?

414
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,620
What may happen?

415
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,300
What are you thinking? I meant, that thing!

416
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,900
What are they talking about?

417
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,720
- No idea. 
 - Look at them!

418
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,940
- If they stay together... 
 - Come on, you!

419
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,840
- Do you know why I came here? 
 - Why?

420
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,180
My daughter called me!

421
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,960
Think about it.

422
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,380
If she really wants to "do something" with him, will she call me?

423
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,380
Will she ask me to come here?

424
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,920
If you go too far, it will go the opposite of what you want.

425
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,000
I just remembered that when I cooked the chicken, I didn't put a certain kind of seasoning in it.

426
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,440
I have to go home and get it. I...

427
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,460
if you go too far, it will go the opposite of what you want.

428
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,400
Go home early.

429
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,900
Mom, don't forget to ask my dad about his secret stash of money!

430
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,620
Don't worry!

431
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,580
You can't bear for him to leave?

432
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,860
Your parents have such a good relationship,

433
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,480
and your father is cute.

434
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,420
I'll chase after him to come back for you then.

435
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,480
Let him go.

436
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,420
- Hello, Ke Qin? 
 - Hello?

437
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,020
Uncle just messaged me on WeChat asking for me to keep an eye on Jiang Nan

438
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,500
and to stop him from visiting you at night.

439
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,780
 You didn't give us away, did you?

440
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,460
- I told my dad you were on a business trip. 
 -  Of course not.

441
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,280
As soon as I read the messages, I knew he was checking up on what you said.

442
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,960
My dad stayed at my place for two days.

443
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,240
Oh my God!

444
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,760
So Jiang Nan had to leave his own home?

445
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,060
Now that we are finally alone again,

446
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,660
she just goes into her own room without saying anything?

447
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,900
 I prepared some soup for you. Remember to drink it.

448
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,120
 I have a piano lesson in the morning, so I am off to the music store.

449
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,320
Chicken soup with Ganoderma Lucidum again?

450
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
Brother Rui, did you have breakfast?

451
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,460
No. Nobody cooked for me.

452
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,120
You are just in time.

453
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Nutritious soup.

454
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Xu Duo Cheng often shoots healthy eating videos,

455
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,720
and she makes all this weird stuff.

456
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,480
Some people have so much, but others have nothing.

457
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
- How do you like it? Is it good? 
 - Yes, it's nice.

458
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,160
Next time, when Xu Duo Cheng cooks, I'll call you over.

459
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,380
Your compliments will make Xu Duo Cheng very happy.

460
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,800
What's the schedule for today then?

461
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,820
Since "Cola Chicken Wings" is so well-received,

462
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,180
we should use popularity to take a pictorial.

463
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,860
Take a pictorial?

464
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,230

465
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
By myself?

466
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,320
Or else?

467
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,660
Since the pictures are for the popularity of "Cola Chicken Wings",

468
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,760
shouldn't the MV lead actress show up too?

469
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,800
Just say you hope to take pictures with Xu Duo Cheng, okay?

470
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,860
Why do you keep beating around the bush?

471
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Hurry and drink the soup. We'll leave after I get dressed!

472
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,500
Go.

473
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,480
If he had such understanding before,

474
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,580
Xiao Du could have been settled way earlier.

475
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,240
What? You're taking wedding pictures?

476
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,920
The viewers want to see the MV main lead's sweet interactions, right?

477
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,840
They'll be offered the sweetest.

478
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,260
What's wrong? You can't do that?

479
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,880
Teacher Xu.

480
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,380
Manager.

481
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,220
- The student asked for leave. 
 - Asked for leave? She's feeling sick?

482
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,120
I didn't ask.

483
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,060
Okay. Then, I'll come tomorrow.

484
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,980
And her parents want to switch over her lessons to Teacher Zhang.

485
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,520
Maybe it's because when she came over that day, she noticed your little mistake,

486
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,000
but don't worry.

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,580
There will be more students that come to take classes here later on.

488
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,920
Okay, I see.

489
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,140
Thank you, Manager.

490
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,340
All right, I'll go off to work then.

491
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Lord Bao.

492
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,640
Cheng Cheng, when do you finish over there?

493
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,180
 It's already finished.

494
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
Just in time. I'll ask Xiao Du to pick you up.

495
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,580
Jiang Nan is going to take a pictorial.

496
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,360
 Come and take some photos with him.

497
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,900

498
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,780
 Sister, are you busy?

499
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,320
What do you want? If there's nothing, I am hanging up.

500
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,640
 Don't be so aggressive.

501
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,660
I just want to ask how Ke Qin has been doing these days.

502
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,220
Zhu Lin Feng, can you actually do something important?

503
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,840
You just know to ask about Ke Qin.

504
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,540
I wouldn't have recruited her had I known you would be like that.

505
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,880
No!

506
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,300
I don't want to affect her work.

507
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,340
If you don't disturb her, you won't affect her work.

508
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,580
So she's been working these days?

509
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,580
You don't say. She's not like you passing by her days doing nothing.

510
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,920
Is there anything different about her?

511
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,480
 What are you expecting?

512
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
 You think her mind is just filled with dating like you?

513
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,540
You're an adult. Don't be so naive, okay?

514
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,860
Hello? Sister, you're also an adult and you can't be single all the time.

515
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,640
 You know nothing but work.

516
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,260
 Work is indeed important but so is dating.

517
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,160
I can help you put Auntie off for a while but not for life.

518
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,140
Who wants your help?

519
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,900
 Do you remember Auntie paid a lot of money to ask about your fortune?

520
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,200
The fortune-teller said you will have love that will come unexpectedly this year.

521
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,500
 Once you miss it, you may have to wait for another 60 years.

522
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,880
Let me do the math.

523
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,740
How old are you?

524
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,160
 Sixty years from now...

525
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,120
Chubby Zhu!

526
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,640
Brother Rui, you're too calculating.

527
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,140
You can't let a bull keep working without feeding it with grass.

528
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,000
What do you want to eat? My treat.

529
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,280
No, you know what I mean.

530
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
I...

531
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,500
You can't just invite Sister-in-law Nan.

532
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,680
What about calling Ke Qin over?

533
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,120
I'm telling you, not calling Ke Qin over is the greatest help I can give you, all right?

534
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,380
You have persisted in not seeing her for a couple of days.

535
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,660
I haven't seen her for days but she never contacted me either.

536
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,760
If the days go by, will she ever see me?

537
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,340
Brother,

538
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,880
endure it for a bit longer.

539
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,860
If you see her now, all your previous efforts will go to waste.

540
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,640
Brother Nan, I brought our Sister-in-law here.

541
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,920
Why are we here?

542
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,180
You're here!

543
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,140
We'll take photos here?

544
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,140
"Cola Chicken Wings" has been quite well-received.

545
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,520
We need to take a pictorial to promote the song further.

546
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,780
Sister-in-law, we've also prepared wedding dresses for you to choose from later.

547
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,520
For wedding photos?

548
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,960
Yes. Think about it.

549
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,040
The MV is so popular now.

550
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,440
Many people are commenting on what will happen next, so what will happen next?

551
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,960
The prince and the princess will take wedding photos

552
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,840
and start a sweet and happy life, right, Du?

553
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,080
Right, right.

554
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,400
I can't do it.

555
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,100
Assistant Xu,

556
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,940
it's just this much work.

557
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,120
Don't tell me you can't do it.

558
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,900
 So many dresses?

559
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,760
 It's so pretty!

560
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,040
 What style does Jiang Nan like?

561
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,440
 With lace?

562
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,340
 With trimming?

563
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,520
 Which exactly should I pick?

564
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,660
 It's hard to choose.

565
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,400
 Xu Duo Cheng, wake up!

566
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,300
 It's all fake.

567
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,300
 Forget it.

568
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,340
Don't be nervous. It's all fake.

569
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,940
You're fake...

570
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,130
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

571
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,710
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

572
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,010
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

573
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,400
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

574
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,060
Is this okay?

575
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,640
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

576
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,520
Keep some distance.

577
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,220
Hurry. Keep some distance.

578
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,920
Look at the camera.

579
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,460
Okay.

580
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,120
Good. One more.

581
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,020
One more!

582
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,000
Wait a sec.

583
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,139
Why do I think they're standing too far?

584
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,199
It's not sweet.

585
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,560
Can they get closer to each other?

586
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,020
It's dark backgrounds, alienation, and indifferent faces that are popular.

587
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,679
The photos will look more classy.

588
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,220
But we need couple photos, understand?

589
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,320
We're trying to integrate the MV story.

590
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,639
Are there any props here?

591
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,360
Put some cream over here, right?

592
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,040
Then they can have a sweet kiss.

593
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,520
Or the boy can put his arms around the girl's waist from behind, right?

594
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,819
- Have more interactions. 
 - Isn't that tacky?

595
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:35,400
They're not taking real wedding photos.

596
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,700
Believe me. Since you're going to do PDA, do it once and for all.

597
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,960
Satisfy the viewers to the best! Am I right?

598
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,199
Okay. Listen to me.

599
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,300
Hurry. Face to face.

600
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:47,820
Hand in hand.

601
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,620
Hand in hand. Hurry!

602
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,140
Girl, raise your head and look up.

603
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,820
Boy, look down.

604
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,680
Good.

605
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,920
Be affectionate.

606
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,320
A little closer.

607
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
Closer. Closer.

608
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,060
See? You might as well listen to me.

609
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,300
With alienation, their photos will look classy.

610
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,840
They just can't have intimate interactions as you expect.

611
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,660
They don't feel like a couple at all.

612
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,850
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

613
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,040
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

614
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,340
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

615
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,660
Capture this! Now!

616
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,390
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

617
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,012
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

618
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:37,659
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

619
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:41,026
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

620
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,841
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

621
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:48,182
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

622
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:52,829
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

623
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:55,683
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

624
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:58,417
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

625
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,624
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

626
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:03,437
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

627
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:07,996
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

628
00:36:07,996 --> 00:36:11,917
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

629
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:24,010

630
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:34,867
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

631
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:41,381
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

632
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:49,278
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

633
00:36:49,278 --> 00:36:54,865
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

634
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:58,411
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

635
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:02,491
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

636
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:08,844
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

637
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:12,404
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

638
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:14,177
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

639
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:16,577
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

640
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:19,391
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

641
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:23,379
