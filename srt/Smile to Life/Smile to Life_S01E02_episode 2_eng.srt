00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,020

2
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:13,714
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,954
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:19,154
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:24,429
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,287
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,101
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,506
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,788
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,687
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:44,401
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:48,388
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:51,115
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:53,828
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:55,475
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,742
â™«  As the wind gently blows behind you

17
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:01,557
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:05,998
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:10,645
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:13,499
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:16,233
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,340
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,153
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:25,712
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:31,031
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:45,166
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:49,059

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,800
 Xu Duo Cheng, you left me behind to meet with Jiang Nan?

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,660
 It's Brother Nan.

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,640
What are you doing?

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm afraid you'll get exposed.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,900
Did we expose ourselves?

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,180
They've noticed us. Let's go!

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,960
- Let's go. 
 - I wasn't exposed!

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,360
Let's go!

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,160
There was a period of time when I was feeling depressed,

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,940
but when I listened to your songs,

38
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,440
your voice seemed to be silently cheering me on in my head.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,080
You might think I'm exaggerating,

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,720
but you were the one who gave me the reason and motivation to survive.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,600
So, God Nan, you have to do your best.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,780
You should know that someone named Xu Duo Cheng is always supporting you.

43
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,400
I said everything I wanted to say.

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
Thank you for listening.

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,260
I should be the one saying, "Thank you."

46
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,460
Thank you for still being my fan.

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,140
Everyone has times in life when things don't go smoothly.

48
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,200
During these times, just think of it as a vacation!

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,720
God Nan, my friend sent me a message and said someone saw us.

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,400
You should hurry and leave!

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm leaving first then. You keep this.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Are you not leaving?

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,860
Party Involved? 
   (T/N: In the situation)

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm going.

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,960
This is the work you're showing me?

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,160
Where is he?

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,900
We didn't have a good angle.

58
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,060
Do you think people will let you get right in their faces to take their picture?

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,500
Sister, it was also my fault.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,880
I didn't take out my camera.

61
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,120
It was mainly because I don't have the strong mentality needed to take secret photosâ€”

62
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
Shut up.

63
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,320
Why are you chiming in? Get out!

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,980
Sister, calm down. Calm down.

65
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,000
With your competence, there's no reason you couldn't do this.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,360
You know what the truth is.

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,320
If this happens again,

68
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,720
I'll need to consider if you are truly suitable to work for True Image.

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,820
I'm sorry, Sister Shan.

70
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,360
I hate to hear apologies the most!

71
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,920
Remember, the last thing this industry is short of is people.

72
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,680
If you think you can't do this job right, please choose to leave on your own.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,900
Don't make me force you to find another job!

74
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,140
Say something!

75
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,000
I will do my best.

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
You don't have to follow Jiang Nan anymore.

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
Qi Qi will arrange other work for you to do.

78
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,120
Don't, Sister Shan.

79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,980
Please, give me another chance. I can do it!

80
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,380
I don't have a lot of patience. Get out!

81
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,540
Ke Qin!

82
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,960
I'm sorry for making you get scolded by Sister Shan too.

83
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,020
You really don't recognize me anymore?

84
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm Zhu Lin Feng.

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,460
Zhu Lin Feng?

86
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,940
Chubby Zhu.

87
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,400
You're Chubby Zhu?

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right!

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,540
How did you lose so much weight?

90
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,300
I started working out after I went abroad.

91
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,660
I lost 30 kg these past few years.

92
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,480
Chubby boys are all potential studs indeed.

93
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,780
I really didn't recognize you at all.

94
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,420
I have a picture for proof. Replacement is guaranteed if it's fake.

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,080
Why did you use that as your screen saver?

96
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,320
Oh, I know.

97
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,100
You're doing this to remind yourself at all times, not to gain weight again.

98
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,120
No, that's not it. It's because this is my only picture with you.

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,880
Then... why are you here?

100
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,000
Qin Shan is my cousin.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,020
What a coincidence.

102
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,820
I thought you were here for an internship.

103
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,800
I didn't expect to run into you here either.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,500
It's such a coincidence.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,840
If my cousin yells at you again, just come find me.

106
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,700
She can't do anything about me.

107
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,700
It's all right.

108
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,020
Sister Shan was right to scold me.

109
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,600
If there's nothing else, I'll leave first.

110
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,660
Let's have dinner together.

111
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,540
I already have plans.

112
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,020
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,500
I heard there has been a lot of news about you and Jiang Nan recently.

114
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,200
What? Did he return your warm passion with a cold rebuke?

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,820
Thank you for your concern, President Liang.

116
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,720
I can handle my own business myself.

117
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,480
What do you mean by "your own business"?

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,440
The entire Super Car Club knows you're my person.

119
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,780
You're really making me look bad.

120
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
President Liang, you're joking.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
I was never the one who made you look good.

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,200
Besides, I think your model girlfriend really suits you.

123
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,640
You two make a nice couple.

124
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,720
If there's nothing else, please excuse me, President Liang.

125
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,720
Thank you for inviting me, President Yang.

126
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,980
Come to my office, sometime, to discuss the endorsement contract.

127
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,780
That's for sure.

128
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,620
President Liang, when you made her popular three years ago,

129
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,640
you should've known her wings would harden. 
  (T/N: Become independent)

130
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,300
Director Zhan, sorry you had to see that.

131
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,640
How could I let her escape so easily?

132
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,580
Even if she escapes someday,

133
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,360
I will snap her wings.

134
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,900
It's rare that you're alone, Director Zhan.

135
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,440
If you act like this, he'll look really bad.

136
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
I already broke up with him.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,960
I'm free to do whatever I want now.

138
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,980
Just like how you broke up with Jiang Nan back then?

139
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,760
A good horse never grazes on an old pasture. 
  (T/N: Don't go back to the past)

140
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,000
What's the point of starting a scandal with Jiang Nan now?

141
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
Jiang Nan is no longer popular.

142
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,980
He has no value to you at all.

143
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,980
You have the biggest ad spaces in this city.

144
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,120
Isn't this what you want?

145
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,080
Since when did Director Zhan care so much about me?

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,400
You are well-dressed during the day and indulge in debauchery at night.

147
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,900
You're already busy enough.

148
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,400
You don't need to worry about me.

149
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm just giving you a kind reminder.

150
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,920
After all, if a bird that's been caged for a long time suddenly flies,

151
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,800
be careful not to fall.

152
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,780
Don't you need to be ready to work at anytime?

153
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,880
Why are you drinking?

154
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,680
I don't care today.

155
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,820
Order whatever you want.

156
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,440
It's my treat.

157
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,360
I'm not drinking.

158
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,500
Aren't we besties?

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,260
Of course we are. We have to be.

160
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,320
Then drink it all.

161
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,460
Be honest with me.

162
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,540
What's your relationship with Jiang Nan?

163
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,260
Me and him

164
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,520
have no relationship.

165
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,380
Haven't I already told you?

166
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,160
Then why would you meet him in the coffee shop?

167
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,640
You saw that?

168
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
That's because...

169
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,820
Forget it, forget it.

170
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,320
I can't explain it in a few words.

171
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,440
When I walked into the coffee shop

172
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,300
and saw you sitting in front of Jiang Nan,

173
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,580
do you have any idea how flustered I was?

174
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,660
I did all I could to prevent the photographer from photographing your face

175
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,840
and then I got scolded by Qin Shan afterward.

176
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Do you know how nasty her words were?

177
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,340
I couldn't even tell her about our relationship.

178
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,020
Ke Qin, I've really dragged you down with this.

179
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,860
How's this? I'll punish myself by drinking three cups.

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,500
 By the way, I saw this music score in your scrapbook.

181
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,520
 I found this music score by accident a few months ago.

182
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,860
 After I saw it, I thought it was such a pity.

183
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,900
 It's already halfway finished.

184
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,660
 If the composer continues, it will be perfect.

185
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,420
 You think it's a good song?

186
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,420
 I don't know why the owner of this music score tossed it away.

187
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,840
 He can't even write a complete song?

188
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,440
 Jiang Nan hasn't released a song in a long time.

189
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,600
-  No producer will accept a song that's only halfway finished. 
 - Yes, Teacher Dong. 
 (T/N: "Teacher" used as a respectful title)

190
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
 Teacher Dong, give him a few more days.

191
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,760
 He's right.

192
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,080
 I really can't finish it.

193
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,400
 Don't lose hope.

194
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,020
 No one has inspiration all the time.

195
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,100
 You need to be in the right state to compose music.

196
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,000
 Don't listen to their nonsense.

197
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,760
 You don't have to comfort me.

198
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,820
 I really hope I can meet the owner of this song someday.

199
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,220
 What will you do when you see him?

200
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,960
 I'll return the music score to him,

201
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,460
 and then tell him, "Not everyone in this world

202
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,920
 has the chance to pursue their dreams."

203
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,060
 If he has the chance, he shouldn't give up easily.

204
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,860
You just started working and I made you get scolded by your boss.

205
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,400
I'll drink another as punishment.

206
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,540
Let her scold me.

207
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,140
I'm mainly just worried about you.

208
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,680
Don't worry.

209
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,160
I won't see God Nan again.

210
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,680
Actually, looking at the picture of you two,

211
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,260
I think you guys look pretty good together.

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,640
Stop making fun of me.

213
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,500
Who is he?

214
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,960
He's a celebrity, a singer.

215
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,240
I'm an ordinary person.

216
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,920
Don't say that.

217
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,960
So what if he's a celebrity singer?

218
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,980
Forget it, forget it. Enough about him.

219
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,040
We already graduated,

220
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,800
but I'm still very confused about my future.

221
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
This is the last cup.

222
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm alone and helpless here.

223
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,140
I should drink that.

224
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,720
You still have me, and you have such a nice job.

225
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,540
I have nothing. I should drink this.

226
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,420
You have your God Nan.

227
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,080
I have no house and no car.

228
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,240
- I'll drink it. 
 - I don't have a house nor a car either.

229
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,720
- I don't have a boyfriend. 
 - I don't have a boyfriend either!

230
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,620
I... I...

231
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm sick.

232
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm sick too!

233
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,560
You're sick too?

234
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,720
What disease do you have?

235
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm crazy.

236
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,020
I'm crazy from being poor!

237
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,440
Don't try to trick me into letting you drink it.

238
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,400
Hello?

239
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,260
 Sir, two more bottles of beer!

240
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,020
 Xu Duo Cheng, I need to talk to you.

241
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,320
 Who are you?

242
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,860
Do you want to come and drink with me?

243
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,200
Send me your location.

244
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,620
- God Nan? 
 - God Nan?

245
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,640
- Why did you drink so much? 
 - Ke Qin, I still haven't gotten a picture with God Nan yet.

246
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,460
Hurry and take a picture of us.

247
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
Stand still.

248
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,060
Don't move.

249
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,040
Done.

250
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,880
You, take her home safely!

251
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,440
I'll take you both home.

252
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,880
You don't need to take me.

253
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,560
You two just go.

254
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,720
I'll call a taxi myself.

255
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I'm fine on my own.

256
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,660
Go.

257
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,640
Ke Qin, don't forget to send me the picture!

258
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,140
Send it to me now! Send it to me now!

259
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,240
I'll send it to you now!

260
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,480
Send the picture. Send the picture.

261
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,290

262
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,860
Careful.

263
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,099
Where do you live?

264
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,080
On the way!

265
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,040
- On the way. 
 - On the way.

266
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,460
It's past ten o'clock.

267
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,000
She won't reply to my WeChat messages or pick up my calls.

268
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,980
Cheng Cheng is already an adult. Don't worry about her.

269
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,720
Fine, just do your calculations.

270
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
Keep calculating.

271
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
All you care about is your stupid restaurant.

272
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
Boss Bai doesn't even care anymore.

273
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,080
Why should you care?

274
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,580
How can I not care about it?

275
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,160
Even if you dig out all the coins from our wall tiles,

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,040
you wouldn't even have enough for that Â¥300,000.

277
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,280
What are you worrying for?

278
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,620
Do you think Cheng Cheng is dating?

279
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,780
Dating?

280
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,740
With who?

281
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,600
Who was the one that just said, "She's an adult now,

282
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,820
stop worrying,"

283
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,920
who said that?

284
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,600
Can you use your head?

285
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,240
Look at the time.

286
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,380
She went out and hung out with some dubious people.

287
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,480
What if someone takes advantage of her?

288
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,960
And you're here chuckling.

289
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,980
Then why are you still calculating?

290
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,300
Hurry and call her.

291
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,800
That's right. Call her.

292
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,620
- It went through? 
  - Hello, the phone you called is turned off.

293
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,180
She turned off her phone.

294
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,480
That child really knows how to make us worry.

295
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
I-I-I'm panicking.

296
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,520
Do you think something happened to her?

297
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,440
What could happen? Don't worry. It'll be all right.

298
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,000
Wait a bit longer. She'll come back soon.

299
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,880
Don't worry. I'll go take a look.

300
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,040
That child is so worrisome.

301
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,340
This won't do. I'll call her again.

302
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,980
Ke Qin.

303
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,380
Where's the cellphone charger, Ke Qin?

304
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,580
Ke Qin!

305
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,680
 There's no one there?

306
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,080
 A hotel?

307
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,620
 Why am I here?

308
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,120
 Wasn't I with Ke Qin yesterday?

309
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,060
 My goodness.

310
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,340
 I'm wearing a robe too.

311
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,760
 Where did he go?

312
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,140
-  My goodness. Run!  
 - Come back.

313
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,260
 Oh, no. What do I do?

314
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,180
I prepared breakfast for you. Eat it.

315
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,320
You don't need to look at me like that.

316
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,540
Don't worry.

317
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,380
You were drunk last night and puked all over yourself.

318
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,760
I asked the auntie at the hotel to change and wash your clothes.

319
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,260
Sit down.

320
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,900
Xu Duo Cheng, your drunk behavior is so great.

321
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,920
 Don't go. Let's drink!

322
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,420
I'm really sorry to have troubled you.

323
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,900
About that video,

324
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,400
can you... delete it?

325
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,520
Eat breakfast first.

326
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
What happened?

327
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,040
The girl who was drinking with you last night, what does she do?

328
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,220
You mean Ke Qin?

329
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,900
She's an entertainment reporter.

330
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,580
Xu Duo Cheng!

331
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,230

332
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,980
I really don't know what happened.

333
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,780

334
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,940
 I'm going crazy.

335
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,100
 Send me the picture.

336
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,700
You're here right in time. I was just looking for you.

337
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,740
You did pretty well this time.

338
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,940
Thank you, Sister Shan.

339
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,580
Seems like you really took what I said yesterday to heart.

340
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm very curious.

341
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,780
How did you get those pictures?

342
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,720
Sister Shan, I have a request.

343
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,140
Go ahead.

344
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,580
Can you take down the pictures of Jiang Nan and that girl?

345
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,920
Didn't you send me those pictures?

346
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,440
I just think those pictures concern their privacy.

347
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,060
What do you think True Image is?

348
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,160
Are we invading people's privacy for attention?

349
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,200
That girl who's in the scandal with Jiang Nan... is your friend, right?

350
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,060
Yes.

351
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,240
No wonder.

352
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,800
Let me tell you, I'll dig deep into this matter for sure.

353
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,380
Now that your friend is involved,

354
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,060
I can't promise she won't be affected.

355
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,020
 But as a member of True Image,

356
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,860
I hope you can separate your work and your personal life.

357
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,740
Sister Shan.

358
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,300
If you can work, stay. If you can't, leave sooner rather than later.

359
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,240
Sister.

360
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,540
Why are you here again?

361
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,040
Sister, just work if you're working.

362
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,780
You'll get wrinkles from being so angry.

363
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,300
Enough with your glib tongue.

364
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,240
I'm telling you, either you come and work for me

365
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,060
or stop coming here all the time and making trouble for me.

366
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,820
Listen to what you're saying.

367
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,860
When I was overseas and couldn't see you, I missed you every day.

368
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,100
Now that I'm back, of course, I have to come often.

369
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,500
What's going on with you?

370
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,760
Be honest with me.

371
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,460
Sister, do you still remember when I told you I had a crush on a girl in high school?

372
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,420
It was Yu Ke Qin.

373
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,940
Sister, you're like the heavenly matchmaker coming to the mortal world.

374
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,560
Sister, thank you for bringing Ke Qin to me.

375
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,900
Don't you think this is fate?

376
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,760
You little rascal, didn't you miss me every day?

377
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,060
Turns out you're here to see Ke Qin, right?

378
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,140
Sister...

379
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,700
I'm warning you, you can't delay the work here.

380
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,980
I promise... I promise not to delay the work.

381
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,120
Also, don't count on me favoring her because of you.

382
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,600
I understand.

383
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,180
- Don't be mad anymore, Sister. 
 - What the hell is this?

384
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,950
Don't be mad anymore.

385
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,700
Hello, Mom.

386
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,060
 Where did you go last night?

387
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,940
I slept over at Ke Qin's place last night. I didn't see your calls until this morning.

388
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,000
 Why didn't you tell me? I was so worried.

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
I know, I know.

390
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,460
From now on, if I come home,

391
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,300
I'll make sure to tell you and dad in advance.

392
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,620
I'm hanging up now.

393
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,800
That Yu Ke Qin. How could she entrust me to a man when I was drunk?

394
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,480
 Yu Ke Qin, what's with the photo of me and Jiang Nan?

395
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,980
 What happened to our sisterhood?

396
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,920
Our profit from the first half of the year increased by 20 points.

397
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,780
Nice job, everyone.

398
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,180
However, profit isn't Kanglin Group's only indicator.

399
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,860
Recently, the Purchasing Department added a new batch of suppliers.

400
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,060
Let me reiterate, we are in the medical equipment business.

401
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,520
Our bottom line is safety and sanitation.

402
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,480
What do you know about this new batch of suppliers, Director Zhan?

403
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,060
Director Zhan already told them

404
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,480
to send a copy of their background checks to me.

405
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,140
Director Zhan needs to review all of them.

406
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
That's it for today's meeting.

407
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,380
Everyone get back to work.

408
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,340
You... Wait,

409
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,640
put your phone down.

410
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,320
You've been at the company for almost three years and you haven't really done anything.

411
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,300
Whose time do you think you're wasting?

412
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,620
Your own time!

413
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,820
When I was your age, I already founded Conlin.

414
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,540
Don't even mention Conlin.

415
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,000
If it wasn't for my mom, would you have been able to establish it?

416
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,460
You...

417
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,320
You told me to join Conlin and I did.

418
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,260
As for what I do and how I do it, that's all up to me.

419
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,580
On what basis?

420
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,860
Just because my mom left me half of this company.

421
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,960
I'm still the Chairman of Conlin Group right now!

422
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,140
If I want to keep it, I can keep it. If I want to destroy it, I can destroy it.

423
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,180
What kind of impudent remark is that?

424
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,060
- President Liang. 
 - Take a seat. Relax.

425
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,040
Qi Qi, I must thank you for publishing such a big scoop on Jiang Nan.

426
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,000
Not bad. You've lived up to my great expectation of you,

427
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,320
but what are you planning to do next?

428
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,420
Here's the thing, President Lang.

429
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,480
Because the picture of the girl and Jiang Nan was taken by one of my coworkers.

430
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,280
But I heard Qin Shan say she'll continue to dig into the story.

431
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,200
Didn't I tell you to follow this matter?

432
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,720
Why didn't you discover it?

433
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,800
Well, I was previously following someone else's case.

434
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,220
All right, all right.

435
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,180
It's already on the news.

436
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,080
We'll leave it at that.

437
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,300
You know I've never liked Jiang Nan.

438
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,520
Can you find a way to join the case and do something for me?

439
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
I know what you mean.

440
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,640
However, as of now, Qin Shan has always been in charge of this case.

441
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,440
I don't have the authority to do that.

442
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,100
It will be hard for me to get involved now,

443
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,940
but I can keep you posted on the situation.

444
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,160
You know I never keep useless people around.

445
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,080
I chose you because I value the impact of True Image in this industry.

446
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,280
If you can't play your part,

447
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,600
I'll need to think about whether I should keep using you.

448
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,580
President Liang,

449
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,500
I will find a way to get involved in Jiang Nan's case.

450
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,120
I promise I won't let you down next time.

451
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,420
Let me tell you. First of all, I don't speak nonsense.

452
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,300
Secondly, I don't listen to nonsense.

453
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
That photo is nothing.

454
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,600
You're worrying too much. Don't worry.

455
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,760
- Hey. 
 - Put it down.

456
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,160
Something this big happened. Why aren't you anxious at all?

457
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,120
If I'm anxious with you, will the hot search be removed?

458
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,000
But can't you try to think of a solution?

459
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,320
How do you want me to deal with these pictures that were suddenly exposed?

460
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,920
Weren't you the one who said you loved how it felt to become a hot search?

461
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,960
I do like being a hot search, but there's a limit.

462
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,440
Come on, you tell me, what the hell is this?

463
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,400
Just release a statement and explain it.

464
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,440
Come on, Brother. With your experience, will anyone believe my statement?

465
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,660
Then don't release a statement.

466
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,500
Just admit it then. We're about to sign the contract for two events.

467
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,280
It will fall through again after something like this.

468
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,020
Things were just looking up for us, and now we're stuck in this gossip.

469
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,540
It's really not worth it.

470
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,100
Plus, what are you going to do about your mom?

471
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Now you're anxious? Sit up.

472
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,260
Go on.

473
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,280
Forget it. The less trouble, the better.

474
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,800
Brother Rui, go on.

475
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,800
Instead of being full of a thousand holes,

476
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,660
it's better to hit the target with one strike.

477
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,360
What do you mean?

478
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,600
I think it's time for you to date.

479
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,140
You and Xu Duo Cheng can really give it a try.

480
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,720
You've been single for so long. You're both single.

481
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,420
Maybe Xu Duo Cheng is really the girl for you.

482
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,820
Other managers try to stop their artists from dating.

483
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,380
You, on the other hand, arranged a blind date for me.

484
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,020
Don't joke around! I'm being serious.

485
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm telling you, Gu Jia Yi never forgot you.

486
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,440
What does she have to do with me?

487
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,000
Of course, she has something to do with you.

488
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,720
Look at the hot searches you were in yesterday.

489
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,640
They are either related to Gu Jia Yi

490
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,340
or about you and your ambiguous relationship with your fan.

491
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,840
You guileful boy.

492
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,480
Each one of them is enough to prove that Gu Jia Yi wants to get back together with you.

493
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,880
As long as you are with Xu Duo Cheng, she will naturally give up on you, right?

494
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,480
But there's really nothing between Xu Duo Cheng and I.

495
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,800
Is that a problem?

496
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,080
The feeling can be slowly nurtured.

497
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,820
Both of you just have to nurture some feelings for each other.

498
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,520
Fine, how about this?

499
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,080
Let's not talk about dating right now.

500
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,620
As a friend, she can just pretend to be your girlfriend, right?

501
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,780
We are just trying to get rid of Gu Jia Yi.

502
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,320
Just leave the rest to me, okay?

503
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,860
Old Jiang, we really can't be capricious anymore. 
  (T/N: "Old" used as a term of endearment here)

504
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,760
As long as we get rid of Gu Jia Yi and say goodbye to the gossip,

505
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,420
we can steadily focus on your career.

506
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,560
That's the best solution at the moment.

507
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,180
You should think about it.

508
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,340
It's me.

509
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,660
It's you?

510
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,260
Well, this bookstore is pretty empty.

511
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,140
Are you sure you need to disguise yourself like this?

512
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,560
I just got on the hot search, I should be more careful.

513
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,040
Sorry!

514
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,360
We both drank too much last night.

515
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,460
I'll surely ask Ke Qin about it and find a way to make her...

516
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,640
Stop.

517
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,520
I didn't come to criticize you.

518
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,300
Then, you're...

519
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,420
We count as friends in need now, right?

520
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,640
Yes.

521
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,980
If there's something I need your help with, will you help me?

522
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,540
Yes.

523
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,560
Although it was your friend's fault for this hot search incident,

524
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,060
aren't you also jointly liable for it to some degree?

525
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,760
Yes.

526
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,160
I have a solution, now, that needs your cooperation.

527
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,860
I will cooperate for sure. What do you need me to do?

528
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,360
- Be my girlfriend. 
 - Okay!

529
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,120
Be what?

530
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,040
My girlfriend.

531
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,360
Your girlfriend?

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,680
Well, we haven't seen each other that many times,

533
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,420
and you don't know me very well.

534
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,880
Isn't that a little too fast?

535
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,780
Besides, I've never been in a relationship.

536
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,420
Isn't it too casual to start my first relationship like this?

537
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,100
That's enough. You're overthinking.

538
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,300
I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend for Gu Jia Yi to see.

539
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,400
It's not real.

540
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,080
You want me to pretend?

541
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,679
- You agreed? 
 - No.

542
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,279
What?

543
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,260
Hello, Miss Xu.

544
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,180
Hello, Miss Xu. I'm Jiang Nan's manager, Bao Rui.

545
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,500
You can call me by my nickname "Lord Bao".

546
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,820
Old Jiang just has a sour face,

547
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,960
but he's really easygoing.

548
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,800
You should think about it carefully and say yes.

549
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,700
I know I am liable for this incident,

550
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,920
but this is too sudden.

551
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,480
If I don't do a good job, I think I'll make things difficult for God Nan.

552
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,420
Besides, my parents won't agree either.

553
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,260
- As for me... 
 - I told you this was a bad idea.

554
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,180
- Let's go! 
 - Wait...

555
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,300
- Miss, let me add you on WeChat! 
 - Let's go.

556
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Miss, my WeChat username is "Lord Bao" spelled out, all lowercase!

557
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:52,100

558
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:04,271
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

559
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:10,975
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

560
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:18,572
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

561
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:24,259
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

562
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:27,860
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

563
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,800
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

564
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,138
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

565
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:41,698
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

566
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:43,571
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

567
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,871
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

568
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,685
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

569
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:52,673
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

570
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:55,990
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

571
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,958
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

572
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:04,344
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

573
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:06,993
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

574
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:10,384
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

575
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:14,418
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

576
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:17,352
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

577
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:21,351
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

578
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:24,694
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

579
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:28,756
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

580
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:32,971
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

581
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:39,619
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

582
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:57,472
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

583
00:37:57,472 --> 00:38:01,352
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

584
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:07,899
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

585
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:11,290
â™«  One ,two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

586
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,324
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«
