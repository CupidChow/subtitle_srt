00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,420

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,727
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,918
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:19,272
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,272 --> 00:00:24,542
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:30,274
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:33,119
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,539
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,906
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,771
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:44,465
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:48,406
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:51,179
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,918
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,918 --> 00:00:56,559
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,746
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

17
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:01,561
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,796
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:10,642
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

20
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:13,490
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,259
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,337
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:21,166
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:25,640
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,249
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,172
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:49,022

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,580
You only asked me to see me again because of Xu Duo Cheng, right?

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,540
Why else?

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,160
In the end, an unattractive girl like Xu Duo Cheng ended up being the biggest winner.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,600
She has you and Jiang Nan at the palm of her hands.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,680
Do you know Xu Duo Cheng?

33
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,340
Don't think you're safe now because you're back with Liang Zhe.

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,980
What do you mean?

35
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,320
I don't understand.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,180
That's better.

37
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,440
Besides, I'll make you understand soon.

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,120
By the way, I already paid the check.

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,740
Drink more of it.

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,180
Director, public opinion is completely one-sided.

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,280
They said Jiang Nan is a great boyfriend and a responsible man

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,420
who won't leave or forsake his sick girlfriend.

43
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,560
Did you hear anything from Jiang Nan?

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,780
Jiang Nan's statement already went viral on the internet.

45
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Bao Rui also sent us a notification to terminate the contract.

46
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm afraid there's no way around it.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,580
I'll figure something out.

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,460
Director Wang, I'm really sorry.

49
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,820
Have you seen the news lately?

50
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,780
Jiang Nan hasn't been in a good state lately.

51
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,646
We'll certainly write that song for you.

52
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,920
Please, give him some time to recuperate, okay?

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,260
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,100
Bao Rui...

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,580
I have a call.

56
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,180
Director Chen.

57
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,000
Director Chen, I've been so busy.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,140
You want to see me?

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,380
You're already downstairs?

60
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,420
Well... but... I can't leave yet.

61
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,540
There's someone in my office.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,940
All right then.

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
Alex, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,600
As you can see, I'm really busy here.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,300
Let's talk another day, okay?

66
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,900
Stop playing these tricks with me.

67
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,180
I am really busy.

68
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,860
How about this. Let's make a long story short, okay?

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,900
The final competition will be in two days.

71
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,500
How should we handle Jiang Nan's situation?

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
Look at what you're saying. You were the one who stirred up trouble.

73
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,540
How can you ask me to help you handle it?

74
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,020
- Is that a refusal? 
 - Of course.

75
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,380
Look, this could've been a great thing,

76
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,740
but you just had to expose Orange's condition.

77
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,040
You drove a dagger right into Jiang Nan's soft spot.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
Think about it, with Jiang Nan's temperament,

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,040
not even an eight headed donkey can make him take his words back.

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
You should think it through.

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,800
If he refuses to participate in the competition, all of the efforts he made previously will be in vain.

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,700
Besides, he would also have to pay a huge penalty sum.

83
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,740
Look, Alex. None of us are new to the business.

84
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,140
How can you try to hoodwink us with that?

85
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,120
How much revenue did Jiang Nan bring to the show?

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,800
You must know that better than us.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,960
Who knows which one of us will sue the other?

88
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,680
Please, be on your way.

89
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,460
I won't walk you out, okay?

90
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,580
Director Chen, come on up.

91
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,140
A man in a white shirt is going downstairs now.

92
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,060
He'll press the elevator for you.

93
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,440
Hello, Chief Director.

94
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,280
 How did you handle the situation of the final competition?

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,820
 A few ad agencies already called

96
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,360
 and clearly stated they only became titled sponsors because of Jiang Nan's commercial value.

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,700
 They are accusing us of fraud now!

98
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,540
No, Chief Director, how is that fraud?

99
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,700
The show already generated a lot of heat.

100
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,560
Even if Jiang Nan doesn't participate, they'll still get their money's worth for their advertising fees.

101
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,380
 You call that heat?

102
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,460
 Go check online. Look at how everyone is criticizing the production team.

103
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,400
 They are saying you used unscrupulous means to increase the viewer rating

104
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,100
 and are heartless for using a sick person to hype up the show.

105
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,720
 They are jointly boycotting the final competition!

106
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,420
They're boycotting it?

107
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,460
 Alex, I put you in charge of Cool Singer-Songwriters Season 2

108
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,900
 because I trusted you,

109
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,420
 but you messed it up.

110
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,620
 I think Jiang Nan is very determined to quit the competition.

111
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,800
 If he quits the competition, you can pack your things and leave too!

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Wait, Chief Director, I...

113
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,440
President Liang, don't be anxious.

114
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,940
Look, she's here.

115
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,540
Jia Yi, come here.

116
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,820
Let me introduce you.

117
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,960
Didn't you say it's a gathering?

118
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,260
He's President Huang from FT Real Estates.

119
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,020
He's a big shot.

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,360
President Huang, Jia Yi is here.

121
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,840
Come on, Jia Yi. Let me introduce you.

122
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,200
This is President Huang from FT Real Estates.

123
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,860
Come on. Jia Yi, let's make a toast to President Huang together.

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,640
Here's to you, President Huang.

125
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,140
I'm a fan of yours.

126
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,820
President Huang.

127
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,240
Have a seat.

128
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,580
Have a seat. Come on.

129
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,220
Here's the thing, you two should sit down

130
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,140
and have a nice chat about the project.

131
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,660
There's no rush.

132
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,580
Jia Yi, make President Huang happy.

133
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,820
Hello.

134
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,200
How dare you hit me, b*tch!

135
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,840

136
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,100
Liang Zhe, you bastard!

137
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,180
How could you do that to me?

138
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm calling the police.

139
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,000
Jia Yi, you're a superstar.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,180
Aren't you afraid of making a big scene?

141
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,479
Aren't you afraid that the reporters out there will find out?

142
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,500
All right, if you're not afraid,

143
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,680
call the police.

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,540
Come on, call the police.

145
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,020
What do you take me for?

146
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,580
At least, I used to be with you.

147
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,200
Shut up!

148
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,900
How do you have the audacity to say that?

149
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,406
Do you have no idea what kind of person you are?

150
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,040
Did you forget how you threw yourself at me?

151
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,040
If Jiang Nan didn't collapse after a setback, why would I...

152
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
That's enough!

153
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,220
How dare you bring up Jiang Nan with me?

154
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,640
Jia Yi, if you loved me wholeheartedly,

155
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,200
I would never stir up so much trouble.

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,540
Just because you always had Jiang Nan in your mind.

157
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,280
Do you think I'm stupid?

158
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,760
Let me tell you,

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
I can make you a star and I can also destroy you.

160
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,460
What about Jiang Nan?

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,040
Wasn't he popular at the time?

162
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,260
I still managed to ruin his career.

163
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,040
What do you mean?

164
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,560
You set Jiang Nan up at the time?

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,320
Yes, it was me.

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,460
I was the one who set him up.

167
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,300
How could he fight against me with his abilities?

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
You were the one who framed him for the assault too?

169
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,080
Yes,

170
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
it was me.

171
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,820
I'm telling you, Gu Jia Yi.

172
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:05,480
A woman like you means nothing to Jiang Nan.

173
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
When Jiang Nan collapsed after a setback,

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,820
you left him and presented yourself to me.

175
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,280
I believe you're already a slut...

176
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,840
in Jiang Nan's eyes.

177
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,760
A slut?

178
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,560
Cheng Cheng, don't take anything on the news to heart.

179
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,320
Let's not have a wedding.

180
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,960
We can't do that.

181
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,913
Marriage is a once in a lifetime event.

182
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:07,540
I want to give you a unique and unmatched wedding.

183
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,860
But I think for me at the present,

184
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,240
no matter how fancy the wedding is, it's meant for the guests.

185
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I only care about the ordinary days we have together.

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,100
Besides, if we have a wedding, we'll surely have to invite family and friends.

187
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,320
My parents finally accepted the reality and calmed down.

188
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,240
- I don't want to... 
 - All right, our marriage is just between the two of us anyway.

189
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
We'll do it the way you want.

190
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,880
Jiang Nan, I'm already very happy to be with you.

191
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,520
Me too.

192
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,260
I'm tired.

193
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,260
Got it.

194
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Come on.

195
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,580
One, two, three!

196
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's go!

197
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,704
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

198
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:02,445
â™«  The years become gentle   â™«

199
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,632
â™«   As the wind gently blows behind you   â™«

200
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:07,447
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

201
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:11,682
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

202
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:16,628
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet   â™«

203
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:19,376
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

204
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:22,045
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

205
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,223
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

206
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:27,052
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

207
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:31,526
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

208
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:37,035
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

209
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,900
Are you slacking off so early in the morning?

210
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,240
No, Master. Come take a look.

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,340
They are talking about Happy Family Restaurant online.

212
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,520
Happy Family Restaurant?

213
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
What's wrong now? Don't scare me!

214
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,340
Teacher's wife, look.

215
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,680
Master, isn't that Gu Jia Yi's assistant?

216
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,860
Gu Jia Yi was the one who planned her allergy incident last time.

217
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,960
No wonder Gu Jia Yi admitted she'd quit the entertainment business on Weibo.

218
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
That's good.

219
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,220
It's a good thing.

220
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,980
In any case, we finally understand what really happened.

221
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,700
Happy Family Restaurant can open for business with dignity.

222
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,060
- It's a good thing. 
 -  You're right.

223
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,040
Big Lin, go check in the kitchen and see what ingredients we need.

224
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,620
- Go prepare them now. 
 - Yes, Master.

225
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,400
Honey, it's a good thing.

226
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,020
You should be happy.

227
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,640
Yes. We finally saw some hope after all.

228
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,740
Let's do a good job running our restaurant

229
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,320
and make more money to treat Cheng Cheng's disease.

230
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,900
 About P2P, we've already done it many times.  
  (T/N: Peer to peer lending)

231
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,740
 Don't tell anyone about it.

232
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,200
 We'll be doomed if anyone hears about it.

233
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,060
 Don't worry, President Liang. Everything is okay.

234
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,720
 Don't worry.

235
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,300
The long-term rental apartment, Steel Villa, that Liang Zhe and the others worked on is busted.

236
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,680
This was obviously a P2P illegal fundraising project

237
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,360
that made someone's poor relative the legal person to take the fall.

238
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,340
Now, they're disinvesting and trying to escape.

239
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,060
He was able to find such important evidence.

240
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,800
Your informer is pretty good.

241
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,340
What do you mean by "pretty good"? I don't know him at all.

242
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,500
Which stranger would record something so important and send it directly to you?

243
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,400
Gu Jia Yi?

244
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,740
I received this email right after she announced to quit the entertainment business.

245
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,600
Gu Jia Yi has the best chance of getting close to Liang Zhe's dirty deeds.

246
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,220
Was Liang Zhe the one who posted the video to expose Mei?

247
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,760
It must be him. Gu Jia Yi and Liang Zhe's confrontation crashed the top search system.

248
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,180
Popular star, Gu Jia Yi, admits to framing the restaurant. Goddess turns to hypocrite.

249
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,980
This really is the most shocking news.

250
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,020
Well, I shouldn't let Gu Jia Yi's determination go to waste.

251
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,540
I recently collected a lot of evidence on Liang Zhe.

252
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,460
It's time to make him pay the price.

253
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,260
That's right! Liang Zhe stirred up so much trouble in secret.

254
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,020
We'll settle the scores all at once.

255
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,440
I heard Qi Qi is leaving today.

256
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,840
How can she stay after her patron collapsed?

257
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,200
I heard she submitted her resignation letter and left overnight.

258
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,840
The entire industry knows about her getting paid to write slanderous articles.

259
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm afraid no one will hire her in the future.

260
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,340
That's for sure. Come on, take a look.

261
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,100
Popular star, Gu Jia Yi, quits the entertainment business.

262
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,720
Entertainment tycoon, Liang Zhe, involved in illegal fundraising.

263
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,440
Sister Shan.

264
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,060
Thank you, everyone.

265
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,240
Wang Fei,

266
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,580
what would you like to drink?

267
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,860
Milk tea.

268
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,280
I've made a major decision today!

269
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm planning to take you all on a team-building trip!

270
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,340
- That's great! 
 - Awesome!

271
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,580
Take a guess. It's a very beautiful place!

272
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,580
- Where is it? 
 - Sanya, Sanya!

273
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,559
Aren't you a know-it-all?

274
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,259
 What are you doing?

275
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,420
 It's for you.

276
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,319
 What do you mean by this?

277
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,000
 Take it.

278
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,680
 Are you crazy?

279
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,060
 What are you doing? Put me down!

280
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,840
 Bao Rui! Are you crazy?

281
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,060
 Bao Rui! Bao Rui.

282
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,680
What are you doing?

283
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,480

284
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
May you be happy.

285
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Stop right there!

286
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,860
I'll keep the promise I just made to you.

287
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,240
As long as we make it into the top three this month,

288
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,840
I'll take you all on a seven day trip to Sanya!

289
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,660
You can bring a family member!

290
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,680
Sister Shan!

291
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,380
Are you happy?

292
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,560
I have one more ticket available.

293
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,380
Wish me happiness!

294
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,140
What are you smiling about?

295
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,900
I have first-hand information.

296
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,940
Lord Bao and Sister Shan are officially together.

297
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,580
Really?

298
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,760
In that case, we'll have to tease them when Qin Shan invites us to lunch later.

299
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,960
I really didn't expect the two of them to be together.

300
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,080
That's serendipity, just like us.

301
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,180
Someone is taking pictures.

302
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,790
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

303
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,544
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

304
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,910
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

305
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,823
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

306
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:39,678
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

307
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,009
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

308
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:47,030
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

309
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,283
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

310
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:54,013
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

311
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:57,363
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

312
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,543
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

313
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,483
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

314
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:08,377
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

315
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:11,690
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

316
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,694
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

317
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:20,010
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

318
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,960
Come on. Let's celebrate Sister Shan's victorious return!

319
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,260
- Let's take a drink. 
 - Come on.

320
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,500
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

321
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Sister Shan, please, look out for me in the future.

322
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,240
With our relationship, that's no problem.

323
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, you should hurry up and make this relationship more stable.

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,640
Okay. Don't worry.

325
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,580
Well, I appreciate you all.

326
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,560
Thank you for being so supportive of me all along.

327
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,540
It's my treat today. Have whatever you want.

328
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,780
- Thank you, Sister Shan. 
 - Thank you, Sister Shan.

329
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,020
Eat something first.

330
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,080
Don't drink a cold beverage on an empty stomach. It's bad for your stomach.

331
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,560
Okay.

332
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,880
Are you still the Sister Shan I know?

333
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,960
What's your impression of me?

334
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
You're vigorous, resolute, pays no attention to trivial conventions,

335
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,340
eats apples with the skin, and eats grapes without spitting seeds.

336
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,600
You probably had indigestion back then.

337
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,160
I used to think that you should get credit for your hard work while I was away from True Image.

338
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,640
- I should give you a promotion, now that I'm back. 
 -  Really?

339
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,340
But I don't think you were quite sensible right now.

340
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,300
Sister Shan, my bad.

341
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,360
It was my fault.

342
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,260
All right, all right. I'm happy today.

343
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,580
You can have your promotion.

344
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,220
Yes! Thank you, Sister Shan.

345
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,340
Congratulations, Ke Qin.

346
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,980
Thank you.

347
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,960
By the way, we still haven't published the big scoop on Gu Jia Yi and Liang Zhe's dogfight.

348
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,860
Don't tell anyone else.

349
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,240
Got it.

350
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,700
You'll be so busy when this explosive hot topic gets out in a few days.

351
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,740
Eat some more.

352
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,720
You're truly concerned about my cousin, Brother-in-law.

353
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,640
Don't call him that.

354
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
He's still on his trial period.

355
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,420
Let's eat. Let's eat.

356
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,400
- Let me tell you, I'll continue to... 
 - Peel a shrimp.

357
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,680
Okay.

358
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,540
I want a shrimp too.

359
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,120
I'll peel it for you.

360
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't want it.

361
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,800
Does it taste good?

362
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,580
That's so over-the-top.

363
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,360
How can you be so lovey-dovey in front of single people?

364
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
It's too dangerous for you to be holding this right now.

365
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,500
Give it to me.

366
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,580
I just want to make a dish for you.

367
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,720
Are you crying?

368
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,980
No.

369
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,020
It's the onion.

370
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,260
Even more reason for me to do it.

371
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,780
Don't you forget?

372
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,400
I learned my skills from my father-in-law.

373
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,000
Jiang Nan.

374
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,360
Xu Duo Cheng, out of everything, why did you have to cut the onion?

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Thank you.

376
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,060
Orange, you and Jiang Nan are so sweet.

377
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
You will be all right.

378
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,000
Ke Qin, I want you to be happy too.

379
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,360
Don't miss out on your Mr. Right.

380
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,100
What Mr. Right?

381
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,640
We've been besties for years.

382
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,200
Do you think I can't tell?

383
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,460
Would you dare say that you don't have a bit of feelings for Chubby Zhu?

384
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,260
This is from him.

385
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,940
 Are you free?

386
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,880
 Let's meet up at Lake Yingyue Park at 8 p.m. tonight

387
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,900
 and give each other an answer.

388
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:09,895
Hi, are you Mr. Right?

389
00:26:09,895 --> 00:26:12,244
Hi, Yu Ke Qin.

390
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:14,100
Why are you wearing a mask?

391
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,460
I think I'm more like

392
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,360
a virtual person to you.

393
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,640
That's why I'm wearing a mask.

394
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,360
I was never meant to be in your life.

395
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,020
A virtual person?

396
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,460
Are you saying you're AI? A code?

397
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,580
Or a robot that was programmed to my liking?

398
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,040
That's not the point.

399
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,860
The point is I'm leaving.

400
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,660
I came specially to bid you farewell this time.

401
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,820
Farewell?

402
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,580
You came just to say goodbye?

403
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,820
I was afraid you'll...

404
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,860
Afraid of what?

405
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,720
Afraid that I'll miss you?

406
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Actually, I'm planning on immigrating.

407
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,340
I won't come back again.

408
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,840
So, it won't work out between us.

409
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,100
Since it won't work out,

410
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,980
why won't you show me your true self during our one and only date?

411
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,120
I... My appearance is no longer important.

412
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,240
You've already met my soul.

413
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,100
Chubby Zhu, you're still putting on an act in front of me?

414
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,280
What Chubby Zhu?

415
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,100
You are still pretending?

416
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,900
Stop! Stop right there!

417
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,900
Stop!

418
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,540
Don't run!

419
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,480
Ke Qin!

420
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,740
Ke Qin! Ke Qin!

421
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,700
Chubby Zhu!

422
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,480
Are you going to keep up with the disguise?

423
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,720
I said I like Modigliani's paintings

424
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,220
and you posted Modigliani's paintings on Weibo.

425
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,620
I said I like William Russel and you forwarded all of his works.

426
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,880
I said I want to see the aurora in Iceland

427
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,040
and you posted aurora photos for three days straight.

428
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,640
You're still not going to admit you're Mr. Right?

429
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm sorry, Ke Qin.

430
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,660
I know you don't like Zhu Lin Feng,

431
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,280
but I want to show you another side of me.

432
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,420
When I saw you falling head over heels for Mr. Right,

433
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,540
I really didn't know how I should face you in the future.

434
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,800
That's why I had to put on a mask when you suddenly asked to see me.

435
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,960
I was really afraid you'd hate me more when you found out

436
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,300
Zhu Lin Feng was Mr. Right.

437
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,460
You are

438
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,860
really annoying.

439
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,860
I've decided to sell this house.

440
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,800
What?

441
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,960
I mean, I want to sell this house and move to another place.

442
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,440
Why?

443
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,120
Don't you think the decoration of this house is completely wrong?

444
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,760
You were the one who designed every detail of this house.

445
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,920
Why is it completely wrong now?

446
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,600
Look at this staircase.

447
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,460
How can Cheng Cheng go up and down in the future?

448
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,880
And the bathroom, the floor tiles aren't skid-resistant.

449
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,260
The hallway is too narrow.

450
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,880
Anyway, the house should be modeled based on Cheng Cheng's needs.

451
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,920
Most importantly, there's no privacy in this place.

452
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Everyone knows I live here now.

453
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,020
Cheng Cheng's condition will only worsen over time.

454
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,100
I don't want too much attention on her.

455
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,240
You're very thoughtful.

456
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,060
Do you have any requirements? Let me hear them.

457
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,740
It needs to have spacious hallways, a garden, and a lawn,

458
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,220
so we could sunbathe during the day and look at the stars at night.

459
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:31,120
Cheng Cheng wouldn't be bored if she stayed at home.

460
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,240
There's more, it needs to be close to Happy Family Restaurant.

461
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,060
That way, it would be convenient for her parents to visit.

462
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,320
It can't be too far from the hospital either,

463
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,160
within a 20 minutes driving distance.

464
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,880
There's more. Cheng Cheng likes dogs.

465
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,560
It would be better if we can keep one.

466
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,660
Are you finished?

467
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,060
That's all I can think of for now.

468
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,760
In conclusion, there are just two requirements.

469
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,040
One, it needs to be convenient for her condition.

470
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,780
Two, it needs to have a nice environment and privacy.

471
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,540
That's it.

472
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
Just two requirements?

473
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,980
I can't do it.

474
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,240
I'm begging you.

475
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,260
As long as you find the house for me,

476
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,340
I will give all my exclusive interviews to Qin Shan.

477
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,920
Well, let me tell you, not everyone can handle Qin Shan's interviews.

478
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,760
Can you do it?

479
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,480
Why can't I?

480
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,780
- Go claim your credit. 
 - Okay!

481
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,280

482
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,800
From now on, you are legally Mrs. Jiang.

483
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,760
Mr. Jiang, please, take care of me in the future.

484
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,720
Mr. Jiang?

485
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,940
Husband.

486
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,520
- What is it, Wife? 
 - Where are we going later?

487
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,000
It's a secret. You'll know when we get there.

488
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,800
Where are we?

489
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,260
This is our new home.

490
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:39,518
â™«  Remember the first time we met  â™«

491
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:47,526
â™«  Both of us were caught unprepared  â™«

492
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:55,453
â™«  No time to hesitate, we're already running out of time  â™«

493
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,680
Why did you hang it here?

494
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,080
This music score is our token of affection.

495
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,633
Of course, I have to hang it in the most prominent place.

496
00:33:07,621 --> 00:33:15,628
â™«  You and I will both try hard to be reasonable  â™«

497
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:18,285
â™«  All we can do  â™«

498
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:23,135
â™«  Is give each other our tacit understanding  â™«

499
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:26,767
â™«  We'll put away our words  â™«

500
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,448
â™«  And end it with a smile  â™«

501
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:32,485
â™«  Oh, at this moment  â™«

502
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:35,882
â™«  The past ends with one final note  â™«

503
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:39,450
â™«  The skill to forget  â™«

504
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,500
â™«  But I can never perfect  â™«

505
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,981
â™«  I wish you would hold my hands  â™«

506
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:50,630
â™«  But you're stuck in the memories of the past  â™«

507
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,487
â™«  Ten thousand kilometers  â™«

508
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:57,662
â™«  Is the distance between the dawn and midnight  â™«

509
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,791
â™«  Oh, at this moment  â™«

510
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:04,165
â™«  It's clearly not how it used to be  â™«

511
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:07,648
â™«  But it feels so real  â™«

512
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:11,998
â™«  I cannot turn my eyes away  â™«

513
00:34:11,998 --> 00:34:15,294
â™«  My heart is in the most painful story  â™«

514
00:34:15,294 --> 00:34:19,007
â™«  The late winter when I long for you  â™«

515
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,480
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

516
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,039
That's not enough.

517
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,940
There's more.

518
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,480

519
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,520

520
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,650
â™«  But I can never perfect  â™«

521
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,990
â™«  I wish you would hold my hands  â™«

522
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,670
â™«  But you're stuck in the memories of the past  â™«

523
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,760
â™«  Ten thousand kilometers  â™«

524
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,740
Cheng Cheng, I will always stay by your side.

525
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,720
â™«  Oh, at this moment  â™«

526
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,190
â™«  It's clearly not how it used to be  â™«

527
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,680
â™«  But it feels so real  â™«

528
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,000
â™«  I cannot turn my eyes away  â™«

529
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,240
â™«  My heart is in the most painful story  â™«

530
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,910
â™«  The late winter when I long for you  â™«

531
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,640
â™«  Love gradually fades away  â™«

532
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,160
What is this?

533
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,280
It's you.

534
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,760
Me?

535
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,660
An orange tree?

536
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,880
I have an orange tree.

537
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,980
More precisely, it's an orange sapling.

538
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,260
Little orange, when will you grow up?

539
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,880
Little orange sapling, please, grow up fast.

540
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,480
We have such a big yard.

541
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,300
Why didn't you plant it on the ground?

542
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
I looked it up.

543
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,560
Orange saplings need to be planted in a pot first.

544
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,480
When its roots and branches become slightly stronger,

545
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,080
we can transplant it to the ground.

546
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,460
You even did the research?

547
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,760
Well, do you know how to water it?

548
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,680
I already planted the orange sapling for you.

549
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,560
What's so hard about watering it?

550
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,920
Is it like this?

551
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,500
Xu Duo Cheng!

552
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,960
 Jiang Nan, I used to think destiny has been cruel to me.

553
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,940
 When I met you, I finally realized

554
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,540
 the chances of encountering extreme good luck or bad luck

555
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,080
 are as slim as hitting the jackpot.

556
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,380
 But for me, I hit the jackpot twice.

557
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,660
 Destiny is already kind enough to me

558
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,280
 for having you during the last days of my life.

559
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,980
 I will surely try my best to stay by your side for as long as I can.

560
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,860
 If I really can't speak

561
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,200
 or move someday,

562
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,260
 I believe I can still put on a smile for you.

563
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,440
 Thanks to our Channel Manager: gonghina

575

â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

576
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,917
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

577
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:23,771
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

578
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:29,417
â™«  You shine a light to all my loneliness  â™«

579
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,743
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

580
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:37,007
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

581
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:43,404
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

582
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,823
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

583
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:48,677
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

584
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:51,043
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

585
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:53,856
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

586

â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

587

â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

588
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:05,063
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«
