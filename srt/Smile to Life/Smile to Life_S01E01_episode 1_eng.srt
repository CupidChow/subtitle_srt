1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:08,980

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:13,649
â™«  I've walked around in a big circle  â™«

3
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:15,889
â™«  To finally meet you  â™«

4
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:19,189
â™«  How can my love be restrained?  â™«

5
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,464
â™«  My love for you is too obvious  â™«

6
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:30,322
â™«  I guess you must have already discovered it  â™«

7
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,136
â™«  On that clear evening  â™«

8
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,541
â™«  It was romantic meeting you  â™«

9
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,923
â™«  An unforgettable memory  â™«

10
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:41,722
â™«  I heard that passionate love  â™«

11
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:44,436
â™«  Can dissolve glaciers  â™«

12
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:48,423
â™«  I say good night to you every night  â™«

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,150
â™«  If you get used to it as well  â™«

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,863
â™«  I like your eyes  â™«

15
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:55,410
â™«  The years become gentle  â™«

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,777
â™«  As the wind gently blows behind you  â™«

17
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:01,492
â™«  I walk slowly with you, hand in hand  â™«

18
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:05,833
â™«  If I can travel across the entire universe  â™«

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:10,680
â™«  And roam around the Milky Way with you to pick a planet  â™«

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,434
â™«  I'm willing to wait for you  â™«

21
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:16,168
â™«  We cross time and space to grow old together  â™«

22
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:18,375
â™«  Your gentleness  â™«

23
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,088
â™«  It's like being among a magnificent galaxy of stars  â™«

24
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:25,747
â™«  If I can rest on any planet I want  â™«

25
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:31,166
â™«  I will run into you in this universe  â™«

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,027
    ðŸŽˆ

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,120
 Today, we have not gathered here

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,920
 to bid farewell to Miss Xu Duo Chen's remains in sorrow.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,700
 We just simply and happily hope that from now on,

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,740
 Miss Xu Duo Cheng can enter a new world to start a new life.

31
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,919
The unknown is always frightening,

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,160
so we must give her courage

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,240
like how she once did with all of us.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,500
In the past few years, when Cheng Cheng fought against her disease,

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,090
we were able to witness such powerful courage

36
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,900
coming from such a petite body.

37
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,920
Let's all stand in silence as a tribute to Miss Xu Duo Cheng.

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,900
Let's congratulate Miss Xu Duo Cheng for successfully completing the challenge!

39
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,920
She's also the first to break the record set for "The Death Experience" since its opening!

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,180
It has been two hours and five minutes.

41
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,080
You have to pay more for the extra five minutes.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,940

(T/N: From the poem collection "Let Life be Beautiful like Summer Flowers" by Tagore)

43
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,520
 How much more money do we have to give her?

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,860
Two thousand.

45
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,060
You are such a prodigal!

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,760
Brother Liu.

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,820
I transferred it to you.

48
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,960
Thank you, Brother Liu.

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,000
Please remember to come to me for more events where I can earn money lying down.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
After this event, our business will officially open.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,600
You have to pay if you come in the future!

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,300
But you are quite good at lying still.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,140
An average person can't lie still for that long.

54
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,860
Did you fall asleep?

55
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,280
I was wide awake the whole time.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,080
Also, I gained a deep understanding of what death feels like.

57
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:51,200
Brother Liu, something has come up, so I have to get going. Bye-bye!

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Take your time!

59
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,020
 My name is Xu Duo Cheng.

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,240
 This year, I've just graduated from the piano department of Xin Hai Music Academy.

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,360
 Participating in the death experience was a way for me to prepare.

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,740

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,900
 It all started three months ago.

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,820
 I was diagnosed with ALS that day.

65
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,480
 It's a very rare and unknown disease that is fatal.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,280
 I was shocked, terrified,

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,740
 unwilling, and helpless.

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,040
 A countdown for my life suddenly started.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,580
 I kept the bad news to myself.

70
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,780
 I couldn't find any purpose in living on.

71
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,460
 Luckily, a ray of light shined into my desolate and gloomy life.

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,520
 My light was the singer, Jiang Nan.

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,480
 He said death is like an upright lighthouse

74
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,780
 that waits quietly for everyone's arrival.

75
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,640
 We are all born to die.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,720
 We must cherish the present and make the best of our time here.

77
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,820
 I want to be like him in expressing myself courageously

78
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,780
 and chasing after my dreams.

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,300
 My first stop will begin with the Starry Sky Orchestra.

80
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,370

81
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,220
- You may begin. 
 - Okay.

82
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
She has a good sense of rhythm.

83
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
She's really good.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,020
- She's really amazing. 
 - Yes, she's good.

85
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,580
 You chose a very difficult piece,

86
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,160
 and you played it well overall.

87
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,960
 However, you made a mistake on the most important section of the piece.

88
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,540
 We need a professional player who's more mature and steady.

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
 Although I wasn't chosen,

90
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,260
 I persisted till the end.

91
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,600
 I don't have any regrets about it.

92
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,600
Hello, Miss. May I help you with anything?

93
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,880
I want to buy my best friend a present for getting a new job.

94
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Take a look at this bracelet.

95
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,800
It has a wishbone design. It's simple and sophisticated.

96
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,940
It also has a nice meaning of bringing good luck to the one who wears it.

97
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,840
You can also take a look at these earrings.

98
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,980
They are from the same set the bracelet is in.

99
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,180
I won't get the earrings this time.

100
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,740
Please, wrap the bracelet up for me.

101
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,560
Okay, please wait for a moment.

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,920
 It's really pretty,

103
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,880
 but I can't spend my money recklessly.

104
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,340
 There are many things I need to spend money on.

105
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,540
Brother, can you lend me some tissues?

106
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,780
Pervert!

107
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Wait! I'm not a pervert.

108
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,380
You're in the women's bathroom!

109
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,560
If you aren't a pervert, who are you then?

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
Women-Women's bathroom?

111
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry when I came in,

112
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,700
so I didn't see this was the women's bathroom.

113
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,300
That... can you lend me some tissues?

114
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,820
How about this? I'll trade with this ticket.

115
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,480
I don't want your ticket.

116
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
This is a ticket to see Jiang Nan.

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,000
At the very least, it's worth a pack of tissues.

118
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,720
I'm a diehard fan of Jiang Nan's.

119
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,060
How come I didn't know he is holding a concert?

120
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,100
You're his fan?

121
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,140
Of course.

122
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,240
I've been waiting for him to hold a concert for three years already.

123
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,400
I follow his updates every day.

124
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,780
Your ticket must be fake.

125
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,560
It's not fake. Take a careful look.

126
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,880
It really is for Jiang Nan.

127
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,020
- I didn't think you would be more well-informed about him than I am. 
 - That's right.

128
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,880
I can't take your ticket for free.

129
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,040
Name your price.

130
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
I don't want money.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
I just want some tissues.

132
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,920
Wait!

133
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,080
Can you help me see if anyone is outside right now? I'll come out when no one is outside.

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,560
All right.

135
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,340

136
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,180
There is no one out there. You can come out now.

137
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,540

138
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,420
Why did you take so long?

139
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,540
Don't you know to bring tissues with you?

140
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,220
You have an upset stomach again?

141
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,460
What kind of illness do you have?

142
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,060
Let's go, Du.

143
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,980
Ke Qin.

144
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,400
Orange.

145
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,880
It's their loss for not wanting you.

146
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,180
Auntie, Uncle, and I are your powerful backing. Don't be sad.

147
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm fine.

148
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,200
I already moved on from being upset.

149
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,160
Besides, my skills weren't as good as the others.

150
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,860
I'll continue working hard in the future.

151
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,460
I ordered juice for you.

152
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
Do you want some? You can have a sip.

153
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,080
No.

154
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,760
Don't tempt me. I'll drink this.

155
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,320
I really don't understand why you suddenly stopped drinking coffee.

156
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,140
You've always loved coffee.

157
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,760
Didn't I tell you?

158
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,380
I am sleeping and waking up early now.

159
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,660
Coffee has a severe impact on my sleep.

160
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,780
Also, I have a regular life routine now.

161
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,140
Must you be so healthy now?

162
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,140
You're only 22 years old.

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,520
You can be jealous when my skin becomes smooth and soft later on.

164
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,160
By the way, if you aren't joining the orchestra, what kind of work are you planning to do?

165
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
I don't know yet.

166
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,940
I'll do whatever pays well.

167
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
You can be a piano teacher.

168
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,420
- You can also... 
 - Don't worry about me.

169
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,620
The important thing right now is to congratulate you.

170
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,060
Congratulations on surviving the probation period and becoming an official employee!

171
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,180
That's right. Let me tell you, ever since I started working for True Image,

172
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,380
I haven't been able to live like a normal person.

173
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,980
Wait just a second.

174
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,580
This is a small gift for your employment.

175
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,080
Thank you.

176
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,840
This wishbone bracelet is very efficacious.

177
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,400
Right after I bought it, I got a concert ticket.

178
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,500
Jiang Nan?

179
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,120
Where did you get this ticket?

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,340
I gave someone a pack of tissues in the bathroom yesterday.

181
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,400
After, he gave me this ticket.

182
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,040
You changed a pack of tissues for a ticket to Jiang Nan's concert?

183
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,540
Do you think there is a lot of fate between God Nan and me?

184
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,140
I think it counts as a good thing that happens to good people.

185
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,480
Why can't I encounter something like that?

186
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
The She-Devil is summoning me again.

187
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,280
I need to head back to the office. Remember to record the concert tonight.

188
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,480
- Be careful on your way there. 
 - I'm leaving now. Bye-bye!

189
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,940
Bye-bye.

190
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:57,913

191
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,100
  : What's going on?

192
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,400
 Well... there was a last-minute change.

193
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,360
 You... will have to bear with it.

194
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,060
 Then, I can't go.

195
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,240
 It's required by our sponsor.

196
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,700
 They will still pay your appearance fee.

197
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,900
 Are you kidding?

198
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,540
 I've been preparing for this solo concert for over a year.

199
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,740
 Now, I have suddenly become an appetizer (opening act). I will become the laughing stock.

200
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,960
 Is this how you are as a manager?

201
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,480
 It's my fault, but I have no other choice. 
 (Voice Recording)

202
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,180
 As a manager, I must face reality.

203
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,080
 If you don't go on stage tonight, there will be a one million penalty sum.

204
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,840
 My ancestor, I'm begging you. 
 (T/N: Sarcastic form of addressing others to show exasperation)

205
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,140
 I will definitely find a way to make this concert up for you.

206
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,020
 Trust me, okay?

207
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,100

208
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,920
Opening act guest singer, Jiang Nan?

209
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,840
Hi. Help me tonight.

210
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,500
 Although God Nan was changed to a guest singer for the opening act,

211
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,700
 as long as he performs, I'm very happy.

212
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,920
How did you get assigned here?

213
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,100
I heard person would be coming tonight.

214
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,700
For such a big scoop, I have to be here myself.

215
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,200
But this is such a big difference.

216
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,620
Now, Jiang Nan has been reduced to  an opening act for new artists.

217
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,760
You really only see the new stars laughing, and no interest in the old stars crying.

218
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,320
Tell me about it.

219
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,560
Besides, his songs are very outdated.

220
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,740
Is he not embarrassed singing those songs?

221
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,360
 Currently, it's the off-season of this industry.

222
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,840
 Advertising companies prioritize celebrities with a huge, devoted fan base.

223
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,800
 You're not young anymore, and you don't have a large devoted fan base.

224
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,480
 We really can't be headstrong right now.

225
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,960
Is it about to start?

226
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,780
- It's starting! 
 - It's starting!

227
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,420
He has come out! He's here!

228
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,500
God Nan!

229
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,740
Who's he?

230
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,890
Hello, everyone. I'm Jiang Nan.

231
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,970

232
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,080
I'll be singing the song "Island" for everyone.

233
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,040

234
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:27,689
 â™ª I dreamt of sailing alone â™ª

235
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,964
 â™ª Every day and night, under the starry sky â™ª

236
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:36,189
 â™ª I dream of drifting in the vast ocean alone â™ª

237
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:42,833
 â™ª My eyes become bloodshot and my lips are parched â™ª

238
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:53,264
 â™ª I see an island, perhaps it is not far â™ª

239
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:57,662
 â™ª Stormy waves rush against the shore, the ocean encircles me â™ª

240
00:16:57,662 --> 00:17:08,663
 â™ª I see an island up ahead, covered by flowers and its fragrance â™ª

241
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:23,735
 â™ª I see an island, I sail toward you â™ª

242
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:32,391
 â™ª I see an island, I swim toward you â™ª

243
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:39,820
 â™ª I see an island â™ª

244
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:48,503
 â™ª I run to you; I see you â™ª

245
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,860

246
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,380
 I want to go backstage to get Jiang Nan's autograph!

247
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,460
 Gu Jia Yi, why did she come here?

248
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,180
Let go.

249
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,820
Jiang Nan, I'm very happy to see you perform on stage again.

250
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,800
Jia Yi, in what capacity are you here today?

251
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
Are you two getting back together?

252
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,400
Jiang Nan is an old friend of mine.

253
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I came specially to support him today.

254
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Also, we'll have a new song collaboration coming out soon.

255
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,780
I hope everyone can support us.

256
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,820
I also hope everyone can give more support to Jiang Nan.

257
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,800
Please, move your cameras onto him.

258
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,180
If you don't want other people's attention,

259
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,600
you shouldn't appear on this stage.

260
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,700
Jiang Nan, how are you feeling right now?

261
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,440
Did you plan this in advance to gain more support?

262
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,760
 Orange?

263
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,060
 What's this?

264
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,780
 What's going on?

265
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,560
 So this was your true purpose.

266
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,040
Why is he leaving?

267
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,540
- Don't go! 
 - Don't go!

268
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,800
God Nan!

269
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Hurry and take pictures!

270
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,260
- Let's go. 
 - Hurry up! Hurry up!

271
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Hurry!

272
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,660
- They are over there! 
 - Don't run, Jiang Nan!

273
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,320
Hurry and take photos!

274
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,760
Hurry, hurry!

275
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,460
Be careful!

276
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,840
Hurry and follow them!

277
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,400
- Where is he? 
 - Over there!

278
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,940
Where did he go?

279
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,320

280
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,680
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,320
I didn't do it on purpose.

282
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,500
I know.

283
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,300
Those people are just trying to stir up trouble.

284
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,880
- I don't want them to use me for attention. 
 -  This voice...

285
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,800
 Brother, can you lend me some tissues?

286
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,460
 How about this? I'll trade with this ticket.

287
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,200
The person in the women's bathroom yesterday...

288
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,760
What women's bathroom?

289
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,460
You mustn't mention this to anyone.

291
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,260
Do you hear me?

292
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,140
Do you hear me?

293
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
 No wonder his voice sounded familiar.

294
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,320
 I have such a pig brain. Why did I just realize it now?

295
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,160
 Why aren't they here? Let's go look upstairs!

296
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,060
What are you laughing at?

297
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,440
I...

298
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,800
Your... hand is making it so that I can't breathe.

299
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,060
We can't just keep waiting here.

300
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,640
We have to hurry and get out.

301
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,960
 I drank some wine. Can you drive?

302
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,460
 Yes.

303
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,420
 Let's run together then.

304
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,220
 Do you really know how to drive?

305
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,740
 Are you sure you can drive?

306
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,400
 One moment you're going fast and the other you're slow.

307
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
 Hurry and pull over!

308
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,120
 I can't stand it! I am about to throw up!

309
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,560
- Do you really know how to drive? 
 - I just got my driver's license.

310
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,120
God Nan, wait for me!

311
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,660
Can I get your autograph?

312
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,860
I'm sorry about what happened today. There was a mishap at the venue.

313
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,800
Thank you for driving me home.

314
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,340
Thank you, God Nan.

315
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,440
Xu Duo Cheng, you were so lucky today!

316
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
You actually sat in the same car as God Nan!

317
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,460
That's right. God Nan even gave you his autograph!

318
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,940
A signed photo!

319
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,340

320
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,740
I'll put you in my scrapbook.

321
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,440
It can't be...

322
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,940
 God Nan!

323
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,820
 The only thing I can do is send a private message to God Nan on Weibo.

324
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,060
 I'll leave him my number, so he can return my scrapbook back.

325
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,820
 God Nan, I am Xu Duo Cheng.

326
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,640
 I'm the girl who gave you tissues in the women's bathroom.

327
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,700
 I also just drove you home.

328
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,320
 I left my scrapbook in your car.

329
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,640
 If you see it,

330
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,252
 can you contact me with the phone number below?

331
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:07,654

332
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,140
Brother, the paparazzi are following us.

333
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,440
You're hiding something from me?

334
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,700
No.

335
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,380
You hired those people in that car?

336
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,680
It's because of the dating rumors you caused at your concert last night.

337
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,320
- Hello, hello. 
 - Jiang Nan, you're here.

338
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,380
- Hello. 
 - Come on in.

339
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,920
Teacher Gu is already here.

340
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,220
Why is it Teacher Gu?

341
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,180
Didn't you say their surname was Hu?

342
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,260
What? I didn't hear you.

343
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,560
Let's go.

344
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,380
Let's go.

345
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,900
We're going to start. Is the program all set?

346
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,280
It's all done. We can start at any time.

347
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,980
Teacher Jia Yi, we are ready now.

348
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,680
We can start at any time.

349
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,400
Thank you for your trouble.

350
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Jiang Nan, even though you declined my invitation,

351
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,760
but the producer insists on a male and female duet.

352
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,640
I still want to invite you.

353
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,160
Is this the Teacher Hu you were talking about?

354
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,560
I'm sorry.

355
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,220
What is he so arrogant about?

356
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,460
He has been past his prime for a long time already.

357
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,060
Why is he still so rude?

358
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,800
If it weren't for Sister Jia Yi...

359
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,400
Shut up.

360
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,020
My ancestor, please, listen to me!

361
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,220
No, wait!

362
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,140

363
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,580
You really can't leave today.

364
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,400
I know you look down upon Gu Jia Yi and that you're really angry.

365
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,980
If I had any other choice,

366
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,700
I wouldn't take this job for you.

367
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,000
If there isn't any work, we can wait.

368
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,600
We can't wait anymore.

369
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,720
Almost everyone left our studio.

370
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,160
Look at Xiao Du. His girlfriend nags him to marry her every day.

371
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,200
How long has he been putting her off?

372
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,140
It's because he doesn't have the money to get married.

373
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,240
Can you bear to see everyone struggle with you?

374
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,360
Fine, if you really want to leave,

375
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,380
I'll go inside and tell them.

376
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,240
Wait.

377
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,520
This will be the only time and the very last time.

378
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,340
Okay, the last time!

379
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,940
Make sure to control your emotions.

380
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,920
- Got it. 
 - All right, all right.

381
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,480
 â™ª My longing still asks me at night â™ª

382
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,140
 â™ª "How much do I mean to him in his heart?" â™ª

383
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,740
Stop.

384
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,280
 What are you singing?

385
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,060
I sang it like the demo.

386
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,560
Is there a problem?

387
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,480
What do you think? You either are going off rhythm or off-key.

388
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,000
 Do it again.

389
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,920
 â™ª I raise my head to gaze into your eyes â™ª

390
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,180
 â™ª I share all my joy and sorrow with you â™ª

391
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,580
Stop!

392
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,060
 Relax your mouth and sing with your diaphragm.

393
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,580
How can you resonate if your mouth is clenched so tightly?

394
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,600
Teacher Jia Yi probably hasn't fully warmed up her voice yet.

395
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,880
We can try it a few more times.

396
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,100
 Do it again.

397
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,080
 â™ª I raise my head to gaze into your eyesâ™ª

398
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,960
 â™ª I share all my joy and sorrow with you â™ª

399
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,380
 â™ª As we walk side by side â™ª

400
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,590
 â™ª I reach out my hand â™ª

401
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,000
Stop.

402
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,620
This song is supposed to express the emotions of a young girl who would do anything for love.

403
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,780
Do you think what you sang expressed that kind of emotion?

404
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,980
Teacher Jia Yi is an actress after all and not a professional singer.

405
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,160
Besides, we can autotune it later.

406
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,600
The most important thing is to finish recording the entire song.

407
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,780
 It's okay.

408
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,220
I asked Jiang Nan to come here because I hoped to receive his professional guidance.

409
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,900
Teacher, let's record my part first.

410
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,300
Okay.

411
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,020
 â™ª I walked past many side roads before you met me â™ª

412
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,920
Look, he really was born to sing.

413
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,020
These past few years have been unfair to him.

414
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Yes.

415
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,080
If you really want what's good for him,

416
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,560
with my current abilities, I can make him popular again.

417
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,860
This is also your wish, right?

418
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,040
I always believe that gold will always shine. 
  (T/N: Talent will always be noticed and recognized)

419
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,680
I believe in Jiang Nan.

420
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
Thank you for today,

421
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,800
but remember, you owe this to Jiang Nan.

422
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,120
Let me tell you. You really can't keep being so headstrong.

423
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,680
How old are you?

424
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,660
Just like how awkward you made it today.

425
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,600
It's not wrong to have high standards, but we have to learn to be flexible.

426
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,900
You didn't give any face to her. At the very least, she's very established right now.

427
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,360
Times have changed.

428
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,900
No matter how established she is, she's still a bad singer.

429
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,100
True, I also think she's a bad singer.

430
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,640
Although you're a good singer, you still need a chance to sing.

431
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,220
Even if you won't think for me, right?

432
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,460
Even if you won't think for the company,

433
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,300
shouldn't you think for Auntie?

434
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,240
Think about your mom. Am I right, Du?

435
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,620
Yes, what you said is very reasonable!

436
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,380
Hello, Ke Qin.

437
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,620
 What took you so long to answer my calls?

438
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,180
I'm working on my scrapbook.

439
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,260
A scrapbook? You have the time to do that now?

440
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,460
Quickly, take a look at our official social media account. You're famous!

441
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,680
Why are you speaking nonsense this early?

442
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,460
Look at it now. Hurry up!

443
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,360
This is such a big misunderstanding.

444
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,480
Brother, I found this when washing your car.

445
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,260
I didn't look through it.

446
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,740
I'll get going.

447
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:43,450

448
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,290

449
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,880

450
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,520
 Why does she have this?

451
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,640
You're finally here! What's the situation?

452
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,420
Let me tell you, the person I met in the bathroom was Jiang Nan.

453
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,960
But when someone secretly took photos of us, I don't know that.

454
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,500
After, things progressed to how it is now.

455
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,400
Ms. Xu, let me interview you.

456
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,900
What does it feel like to have dating rumors with your dream man?

457
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,340
Stop joking around. My heart is still beating hard right now.

458
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,900
I think everything feels like a dream now.

459
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,780
What are you planning to do next?

460
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,560
Plan for what?

461
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,940
We shouldn't go into battle unprepared!

462
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,920
Let me think of some countermeasures for you.

463
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,340
Stop messing around.

464
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,600
I already told you everything.

465
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,060
Why won't you believe me?

466
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,900
Of course, I believe you,

467
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,060
but no one would believe you if you told them.

468
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,100
I told you, only, about this matter.

469
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,960
I promised Jiang Nan not to tell anyone.

470
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,980
You mustn't let anyone know, especially your boss.

471
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,020
You can put your heart back into your body.

472
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,940
I do have this kind of loyalty to our sisterhood.

473
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,940
However, even if I don't say anything,

474
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,400
our boss has started to pay attention to Jiang Nan.

475
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,640
You have to be careful.

476
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,100
Hello?

477
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,920
 I'm Jiang Nan. I'm at Sakura Coffee. Come get your things.

478
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,140
A-All right.

479
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,155
Ke Qin, something has come up last minute. I have to get going.

480
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,680
- Let's meet again some other time. 
 - Who called you?

481
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,200
You're just going to leave me behind?

482
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,040
Hello, Chief Editor.

483
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,540
- Hello, Chief Editor. 
 - Hello, Chief Editor.

484
00:34:09,539 --> 00:34:11,639
Chief Editor Qin.

485
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,919
You scared me! Why are you here?

486
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,860
Sister, I really missed you!

487
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,300
Stop putting on a false display of affection.

488
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,500
You're not going to tell me beforehand that you're coming back?

489
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,040
You think you're all grown up now?

490
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,120
Well, I'm here now.

491
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,400
Let me massage you.

492
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,619
Tell me. What are your plans after coming back?

493
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,400
I don't have any right now. I'll see how it goes.

494
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,820
I still need time to adjust to the environment here.

495
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,120
The best way to get adjusted is by working.

496
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,059
Why don't you be an intern at my company?

497
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:46,339
The job suits your education anyway.

498
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,880
Sister, I appreciate your kindness,

499
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,180
but I'm a promising young man who came home after studying abroad.

500
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,080
It's the perfect time to be self-reliant, fearless, and with high aspirations.

501
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,640
I don't want to use your connections.

502
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,680
Knock it off! Do you think I don't know?

503
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,460
Sister Na, something came up last minute and the photographer can't make it.

504
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,180
I have an urgent task that I need more people for!

505
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,740
Yu Ke Qin, do you know how to knock?

506
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,360
I'm sorry. I was too anxious.

507
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,040
Hurry and go borrow someone from another team.

508
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,960
I did. They are all busy.

509
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,760
I'll go!

510
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
I can go.

511
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,400
You have changed this quickly?

512
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,340
God Nan!

513
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,720
Keep an eye on your belongings. Don't lose it next time.

514
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,440
I won't.

515
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,540
You didn't look through it, did you?

516
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,040
No.

517
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,240
It flipped open on its own for me to read.

518
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,340
Since you already looked through it, as your fan,

519
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,160
I have something to tell you. Is that okay?

520
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,060
Don't directly call out my name in a place like this.

521
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,220
Go ahead.

522
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,920
Okay.

523
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,600
I will buy every album and EP of yours.

524
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,000
I listen to them while I eat and sleep.

525
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,440
As a singer and composer, you wrote a lot of songs.

526
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,960
Your lyrics tend to describe the first time people meet.

527
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,640
You mentioned in your interviews that no matter what joy or sorrow you may face,

528
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,220
you must have a memorable first impression of each other before you can start a future story together.

529
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,740
It's like how we first met predestined our future story.

530
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:32,187
Can you stop always indirectly hinting at how we first... met?

531
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:36,740
Besides, it's impossible for a story to happen between us.

532
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,940
No, that's not what I mean.

533
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,240
Our first impression wasn't only in the women's bathroom,

534
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,080
there was also the concert, being chased by paparazzi...

535
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,280
Stop!

536
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
Are you certain you aren't hating on me?

537
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,140
Can you do that?

538
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,420
Do you know what to do?

539
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,500
I know. I studied photography.

540
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,460
Did you bring your equipment?

541
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,480
Yes.

542
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,040
My surname is Zhu.

543
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,820
My surname is Yu.

544
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,740
Why are you always staring at me? I'm not the target.

545
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,200
Let's start!

546
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:46,110

547
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:58,370
â™«  I walked past many side roads before you met me  â™«

548
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:04,974
â™«  Destiny's plan makes me very flustered  â™«

549
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:12,771
â™«  Your eyes are like another kind of starlight in the darkness  â™«

550
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:18,358
â™«  You shine a light to all my lonliness  â™«

551
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,004
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

552
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:25,984
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

553
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:32,337
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

554
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:35,897
â™«  One, two, three, you opened the door to my heart  â™«

555
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,670
â™«  I suddenly became very foolish  â™«

556
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,970
â™«  I was just like a wooden person  â™«

557
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,884
â™«  My longing still asks me at night  â™«

558
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:46,872
â™«  "How much do I mean to him in his heart?"  â™«

559
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:50,189
â™«  Why have I become so strange?  â™«

560
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:54,257
â™«  It has become difficult to guess your every word  â™«

561
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:58,443
â™«  The best arrangement is to cross over the sea of people  â™«

562
00:38:58,443 --> 00:39:01,192
â™«  I don't want to wait any longer  â™«

563
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:04,583
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

564
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:08,717
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

565
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:11,551
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

566
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:15,550
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

567
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,893
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

568
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:22,955
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

569
00:39:22,955 --> 00:39:27,070
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

570
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:33,818
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«

571
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:51,571
â™«  I only dare to secretly practice my love confession  â™«

572
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:55,551
â™«  I only dare to imagine hugging you from behind  â™«

573
00:39:55,551 --> 00:40:01,998
â™«  I only dare to tell my thoughts to the Wishing Tree  â™«

574
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:05,389
â™«  One, two, three, from now on I hold your hand  â™«

575
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:09,523
â™«  Day and night, I won't let you escape again  â™«

576
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:12,557
â™«  I raise my head to gaze into your eyes  â™«

577
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:16,356
â™«  I share all my joy and sorrow with you  â™«

578
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:19,699
â™«  Don't be shy, I'll give you all my gentleness  â™«

579
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:23,761
â™«  In this universe, I will hold nothing back  â™«

580
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:27,876
â™«  As we walk side by side, I reach out my hand  â™«

581
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:34,424
â™«  Our two planets will finally never drift apart again  â™«
