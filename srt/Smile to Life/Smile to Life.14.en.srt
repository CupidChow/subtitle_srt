1
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,920
This one looks good. Look,

2
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,080
this one looks good, too.

3
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,640
Look at this one,

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,680
you look quite sweet when you smile.

5
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
I narrowed my eyes on this one.

6
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I can't delete it.

7
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,720
I think this one is pretty good.

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,720
Then keep it.

9
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,960
Du,

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
Do you think it's always like this when you're in a relationship?

11
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Rui,

12
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,200
why don't you have a relationship and feel it?

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,280
Your brother Rui is not in the mood to fall in love now,

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,840
I just want to help Jiang become famous.

15
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,040
He's not popular and I'm not in the mood to fall in love.

16
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,040
I even have a double chin.

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
It has to be deleted.

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,920
I think this one looks good, too.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,840
They all look good.

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Keep them all.

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
I can't take it anymore.

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,200
You two

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
don't want to see the photos,

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
Can we go home and have a look?

25
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,560
This hour is quite expensive.

26
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,520
My stomach hurts.

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,480
I have to go to the toilet first.

28
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,400
Jiang,

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
is the arrangement okay today?

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,400
It's good.

31
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
Seriously?

32
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Not bad.

33
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,600
In this way,

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,640
arrange an announcement for Jiang in the future.

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
He must be very cooperative with me.

36
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
Let me ask you,

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,760
what's new between you and Jiang Nan recently?

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,080
We took a photo together,

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,560
a photo,

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,200
Did Jiang Nan take a promotional photo?

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,240
Let me see.

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,520
Oh my god.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,280
You took wedding photos?

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,480
This is a fake play. It's

45
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
more real than real.

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,520
This is just work,

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,840
to cooperate with the second marketing of his songs.

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,240
Forget it.

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
Post your work photos on Moments.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,160
I didn't expect him to post it on Moments.

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Take a look.

52
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
It's so sweet.

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,960
Lin,

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,400
can you change your ringtone?

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,800
It's ruining the atmosphere.

56
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,600
Mine?

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,160
So what?

58
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,920
Just change it.

59
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,920
Brother,

60
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
stop laughing,

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,640
Your mouth has gone to the back of your head,

62
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
can we think about it first?

63
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,720
Tomorrow at noon, Orange's parents'wedding anniversary, as

64
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,400
the official opening day of the family reunion,

65
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,040
What should I do?

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Your father-in-law called me three times.

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,960
He said I must be there tomorrow at noon,

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,720
so go ahead.

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I'll continue to be my good son-in-law.

70
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,920
You can continue to act as Mr. Bao.

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
It's easy to say.

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Don't blame me if I messed it up.

73
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,960
I don't have time

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
to think about it now.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,920
I have more important things to do.

76
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
What are you doing?

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
You'll find out later.

78
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Hurry up and pick up Orange.

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,320
Sis,

80
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,240
Stop drinking.

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,760
Let's go to bed early.

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,360
Come here.

83
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,640
Look at me.

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Am I pretty?

85
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It's beautiful.

86
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,520
Is there any difference

87
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
between me and before?

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,440
No.

89
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,120
I think you are

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
as beautiful as before.

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,400
Liar!

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,480
Sis,

93
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
Go away!

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
Why did you take wedding photos with that bean sprout?

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,760
It should be me.

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,480
Why?

97
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,280
Mr. Xu,

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,840
we have a special guest today,

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,920
I want to attend your class by name.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
Let me show you.

101
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,160
Hello, Mr. Xu.

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
I've come

103
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,600
all the way here,

104
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,600
Have a rest here.

105
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll go get prepared.

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,760
Take a break.

107
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,200
Why did Gu Jiayi find me?

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,920
Is it because of Jiang Nan?

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,320
Should I teach her or not?

110
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,880
No,

111
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,920
there are no other students now.

112
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,320
Will Jiang Nan be angry

113
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,960
if I teach him?

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,200
Forget it.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
Don't think too much.

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,520
Finish your class.

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,320
So we can have a family reunion

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,800
to celebrate our parents'wedding anniversary.

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm so happy today.

120
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
What are you doing?

121
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,640
Let me tell you.

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,960
There's no work for you here.

123
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,440
Okay,

124
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,520
Xu Daqiang,

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
are you out of your mind?

126
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,600
I haven't figured it out with you

127
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
about you stealing private money.

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
You asked me for money again,

129
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
are you out of your mind?

130
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,960
Honey,

131
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
why don't you know anything about romance?

132
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,040
My name is Bixin.

133
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,840
Bi Xin

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,440
Don't you want money? Money? It's not

135
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,400
like heart.

136
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,200
Go.

137
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,760
Here,

138
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
For me?

139
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,640
Of course.

140
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,679
This is my private money that I've been hiding for days.

141
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,480
I bought it for you.

142
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,520
I don't have enough money.

143
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,480
I can only buy you a Mosang stone.

144
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
I've been thinking about it,

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
When I'm rich,

146
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,560
I'll buy you a big diamond ring.

147
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,080
Make my daughter-in-law beautiful.

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,760
When we were young,

149
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
we suffered a lot.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,040
Our future life will be better and better.

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,400
If someone else has it,

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,640
you must have it.

153
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,600
What are you doing?

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,720
Hurry up!

155
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,800
You're annoying

156
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Jiang Nan,

157
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,920
Jiang Nan

158
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,280
Uncle and aunt,

159
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,360
why don't you go back to work?

160
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,120
No, no, no.

161
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
We're not busy.

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,840
Come on,

163
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,400
Why are you

164
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,200
wearing a big mask?

165
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,560
Today is a big day for our family,

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
so I'd better keep a low profile.

167
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,480
All stars

168
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,040
are like this.

169
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,800
Exactly

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,120
Where's Chengcheng?

171
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Haven't you arrived yet?

172
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,040
Don't mention it.

173
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,960
I just called and said that

174
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,000
the musical instrument store is temporarily adding classes,

175
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,080
but on such a happy day,

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,960
I didn't ask for a leave,

177
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,640
but,

178
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,400
Leave her alone.

179
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,440
It's my first time in class,

180
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,720
I don't know much about you.

181
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
You learned the zither

182
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
because of a role I'm going to play later,

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,880
I need to know how to play the piano,

184
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,680
and when I heard that I want to learn piano,

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
The first thing that comes to my mind is Mr. Xu,

186
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,240
you'd better call me "Many Orange".

187
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
We know each other so well.

188
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't be a stranger.

189
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,080
I'll call you Chengcheng.

190
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,520
You call me Jiayi.

191
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,080
Okay

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,680
Jiayi,

193
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,640
what about today?

194
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,560
Let's start from the basics.

195
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,640
First of all,

196
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,280
we should try our best

197
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
to prevent the nail cover from touching the keys

198
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,920
and arch the hands into a semicircle.

199
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,520
Finger falling down gently like this,

200
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,280
actually,

201
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,560
When I was with Jiang Nan,

202
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,600
he taught me,

203
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,720
Just like you,

204
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
he's sitting next to me.

205
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Teach them hand-by-hand,

206
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,960
but if you don't lay a good foundation,

207
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,360
It won't be easy to correct it later.

208
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,160
It doesn't matter. It's necessary

209
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
for filming anyway.

210
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
I can't see it in the camera.

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
Your acting is so good.

212
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm sure you don't just want to do superficial work,

213
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,600
do you?

214
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,880
And in the camera,

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,160
I can't handle one detail well,

216
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,760
It'll be easy to get through.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,480
You and me back then,

218
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,840
are a bit like each other.

219
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,960
By the way,

220
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,800
Jiang Nan

221
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,360
Do you still have insomnia lately?

222
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,560
I don't know

223
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,480
how well he sleeps.

224
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,040
Every day when he touches the pillow,

225
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,720
and he's so dishonest when he sleeps.

226
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,880
If I snore, grind my teeth and kick the quilt,

227
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,920
I'm really going to be so noisy by him.

228
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
Really?

229
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,680
Now I announce,

230
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,200
Family Fun is officially opened.

231
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,280
Thank you very much for coming.

232
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,320
20% off all the dishes today.

233
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,520
Hello, everyone.

234
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Come on, please.

235
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,920
Come on.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,760
Come in. Come in. Come in. Come

237
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,120
and join us.

238
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Thank you.

239
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,800
Please come in.

240
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,360
Thank you.

241
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
Thank you for your support.

242
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,200
Thank you.

243
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,400
-Let's go. -Boss Xu, Mr.

244
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,960
Bao,

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,720
You're finally here.

246
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm honored to have you here.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,320
Mr. Bao,

248
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,120
let me introduce him to you.

249
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,720
This is Mr. Bao,

250
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,520
the great noble of our family,

251
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,400
Hurry up! Hurry up!

252
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
Hello, Mr. Bao.

253
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
Thank you so much. Let me tell you, honey,

254
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Mr. Bao is an investor,

255
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
That one is strong.

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,480
There's something behind it. There's

257
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,560
a fund,

258
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,280
Yes.

259
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,080
Fund,

260
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,760
a young talent

261
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,760
with a fund,

262
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,560
Mr. Bao,

263
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,760
let me introduce you,

264
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,840
This.

265
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,640
He's my daughter's boyfriend.

266
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,640
Jiang Nan,

267
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,480
Look,

268
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,000
A good-looking singer

269
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
who usually writes songs,

270
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,240
You can still sing.

271
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm not the one who plays.

272
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
Very talented.

273
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,440
Nice to meet you.

274
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,240
Nice to meet you.

275
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,080
Jiang Nan,

276
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,200
at dinner later,

277
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,640
I must make a toast to Mr. Bao.

278
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,800
I do know him,

279
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,760
Okay,

280
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,920
Well,

281
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,640
Mr. Bao,

282
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm telling you,

283
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,600
Exactly

284
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,440
Jiang Nan,

285
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,360
he's in the music industry,

286
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,400
It's amazing.

287
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Very talented.

288
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,160
Really?

289
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
Young man,

290
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,120
take a look.

291
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,520
Your father-in-law is so attentive.

292
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,440
Am I right?

293
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
All right, Mr. Bao.

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,640
Stop standing here and chatting.

295
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,480
Go in.

296
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,400
Let's talk inside.

297
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,360
Well

298
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
-Not you. -This is you. -Your

299
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,920
uncle.

300
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,680
Hello,

301
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,040
My name is Zhilin Zhan,

302
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm also Chengcheng's suitor,

303
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Well.

304
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,920
What's

305
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,040
going on?

306
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
How would I know?

307
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,120
We meet again.

308
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,920
Why do you know

309
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,520
each other?

310
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
They're fighting.

311
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Why did you hit him?

312
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,720
How can there be no movement in the fight?

313
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,040
What are you doing?

314
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,720
Come here. Come here?

315
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
What are you doing?

316
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Just tell me Jiang Nan

317
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,960
is so pitiful.

318
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,560
I was going to find Mr. Bao,

319
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,400
invest in him,

320
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Packaging and packaging

321
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,600
He didn't expect to meet a guy who took love with him,

322
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,720
Does Mr. Bao have a good impression on him?

323
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
You're just worrying about it.

324
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,560
Where's Jiang Nan?

325
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
Handsome,

326
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,000
Talented,

327
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
A famous singer,

328
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,680
Zhan,

329
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,920
He's good-looking.

330
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Look at what he's wearing,

331
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,080
look at how he's dressed,

332
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,520
He's not an ordinary person.

333
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
I always thought it was hard for Chengcheng

334
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to find a girlfriend,

335
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,160
I really didn't expect that.

336
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,360
Chengcheng is still a hot commodity.

337
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm telling you,

338
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
you don't have to lose face,

339
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
The point is, our daughter has to like it. Okay,

340
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,880
stop eavesdropping.

341
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,640
I'm going to help Lin.

342
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,840
He won't be able to do it alone.

343
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,360
Okay, go ahead.

344
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,080
Stop listening.

345
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
Just go.

346
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,800
Chengcheng is really something.

347
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
He hasn't come yet.

348
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,960
Family Fun is not a big store.

349
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
But the tea is good.

350
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,920
Zhan Zhilin,

351
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,760
what exactly do you want?

352
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,200
What's wrong?

353
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,360
Are you scared?

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,240
This game has become interesting.

355
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,600
I will never treat many oranges

356
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
and her family as games,

357
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,440
Why?

358
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
Because to me,

359
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,960
they are all people worth cherishing.

360
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,040
I won't allow you to hurt them

361
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
in any way.

362
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,040
They are the people you cherish.

363
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,560
What about my mom?

364
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
My mom is also someone I cherish.

365
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
But she was killed because of you.

366
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,040
If you have any resentment, come at me.

367
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,360
How on earth can you let go of many oranges?

368
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
I won't give up many oranges,

369
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,120
I just want you,

370
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,840
Worrying about her every day,

371
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
I just want you to be unhappy.

372
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,760
But,

373
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,440
you act like I'm helpless.

374
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Zhan Zhilin.

375
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm sorry

376
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,600
to have delayed your meal.

377
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Let's have dinner together.

378
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
No, thanks.

379
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Thank you.

380
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,160
I should thank you.

381
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,720
You taught me piano so seriously,

382
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,120
and you're so cheap.

383
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,600
I mean,

384
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,480
your class time is so cheap,

385
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm a little embarrassed.

386
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,360
As long as you get something.

387
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,160
By the way,

388
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,520
about the fact that I came to learn the zither today,

389
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,880
Don't tell Jiang Nan.

390
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
You know how thoughtful he is,

391
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,560
I'm afraid he might misunderstand something.

392
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,680
I won't tell him.

393
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,640
Dad, it's me.

394
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,320
Chengcheng,

395
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,480
you didn't answer my calls.

396
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,520
You didn't come to the opening ceremony.

397
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,240
Where did you go?

398
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,840
Where is it?

399
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,560
Dad,

400
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,560
I can't answer the phone in class,

401
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,120
and I was caught in the rain just now.

402
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,880
Get changed.

403
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,680
I'm on my way.

404
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,280
Can I

405
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,800
borrow someone's phone?

406
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,640
Why don't you call us and tell us?

407
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,760
Do you want to make us anxious?

408
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Dad,

409
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
I was wrong.

410
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,240
I'm going to apologize to you.

411
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,640
Okay,

412
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,840
Jiang Nan just left and said he had something to do,

413
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
thank him for me.

414
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,120
Okay,

415
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,920
Xu Daqiang,

416
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,839
what are you doing?

417
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,760
Who are you talking to?

418
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,200
You're so busy.

419
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,400
Hurry up. Hurry up.

420
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,160
All right, all right.

421
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,079
Your mom called me.

422
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,920
I'm hanging up.

423
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,760
Bye.

424
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,520
Welcome.

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,040
Please wait a moment.

426
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,640
It's almost done.

427
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,520
Take care.

428
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,400
Sister-in-law,

429
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:32,920
Du,

430
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,840
Why didn't you leave?

431
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,640
Brother Nan said he was busy here,

432
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,440
so he asked me to do him a favor.

433
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,400
Thank you.

434
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,640
I'm going to serve the dishes.

435
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,560
Dad,

436
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
Miss, you're finally here.

437
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,760
I made a new dish.

438
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,400
Try it.

439
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,360
Come on,

440
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,600
Try it.

441
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
Slow down. Slow down.

442
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,800
How about slow down?

443
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,280
It's salty.

444
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,720
It's too light.

445
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,040
Say something if it's not you.

446
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,720
Delicious.

447
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,520
Give me another piece of this.

448
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,440
That's good.

449
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
I don't want to have another piece.

450
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
It's for the guests.

451
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,080
I'll cook for you when I get back tonight.

452
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,120
I'm going out to help my mom.

453
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,280
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

454
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
It's salty.

455
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,960
Mr. Zhan,

456
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,080
you're so free

457
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,520
to ask me out for coffee today.

458
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,760
Gu Jiayi,

459
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,960
why are you looking for a lot of oranges?

460
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
What do you mean?

461
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,240
I don't understand.

462
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,120
Who do you want to teach piano to?

463
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,120
Why are you looking for so many oranges?

464
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,720
It was after she and Jiang Nan took wedding photos.

465
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,560
Me,

466
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm looking for her because I'm familiar with her,

467
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,520
Gu Jiayi,

468
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,160
I warn you again,

469
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,320
don't mess with many oranges,

470
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,600
Otherwise,

471
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,480
don't blame me for being rude to you.

472
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,960
Why are you so angry?

473
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Besides,

474
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,080
we are half a kilo.

475
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
Why are you pretending to be a good person?

476
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,760
Yes.

477
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,440
But you're wrong.

478
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,800
I will compete fairly

479
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,600
with Jiang Nan.

480
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,280
Chengcheng,

481
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,280
the exhibition that came to our restaurant today,

482
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
Is he pursuing you?

483
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,800
Show

484
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,960
whatever you want,

485
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,360
Zhan Zhilin,

486
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,320
he.

487
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,000
He's the owner of my musical instrument store.

488
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,120
Then.

489
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,800
Tell me the truth,

490
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,960
does he like you a little bit?

491
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,560
He even told us that

492
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,760
he was pursuing you.

493
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,400
Don't listen to him.

494
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,160
That's not true,

495
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,000
is it?

496
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,760
Honey,

497
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,800
I came from your age.

498
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I know all those things.

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,760
Look how pretty Chengcheng is.

500
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,480
So cute.

501
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
It's a good thing that someone is chasing you.

502
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm very happy, too.

503
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,760
But Chengcheng,

504
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,160
are you with Jiang Nan now?

505
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
You have to be single-minded about her.

506
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,960
Got it?

507
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,120
Got it.

508
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,640
Don't worry.

509
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,520
Du,

510
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,320
has your sister-in-law left Family Fun?

511
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:55,960
Brother,

512
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,760
My sister-in-law said

513
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,440
she would go check Doudou first and then go home.

514
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,640
Just wait a little longer.

515
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,280
Dr. Sui,

516
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
how is Doudou now?

517
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
As you know, we are all working hard

518
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
on this disease.

519
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,520
And you,

520
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,680
edaravone must be injected regularly.

521
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,480
We can't delay it.

522
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,440
No matter how hard I try not to think about it,

523
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,640
this is my future.

524
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,480
I want to cherish the present time.

525
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,280
Well.

526
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,120
He doesn't want

527
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,240
Chengcheng,

528
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,440
Are these flowers for you?

529
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,560
They are all your favorites.

530
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,280
Jiang Nan,

531
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
I have something to tell you.

532
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,600
I plan to move out tomorrow.

533
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,840
Chengcheng,

534
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,440
don't you like this place?

535
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,360
If you don't like it,

536
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,320
can you tell me what kind you like?

537
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
Mr. Bao and I will look for it together.

538
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,520
I think,

539
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,040
your scandal has been settled.

540
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,800
There's no point

541
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,680
in continuing our contract.

542
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,880
Don't worry.

543
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,560
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.

544
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,120
Give me some time.

545
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,120
If there's nothing else,

546
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I'll go upstairs first.

547
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,280
Many oranges.

548
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,160
I admit,

549
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,280
when we first got together,

550
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
It's because of that contract,

551
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,400
but that contract doesn't matter anymore.

552
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,920
Let's stop thinking about that contract.

553
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,040
Also,

554
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,720
don't talk to me

555
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
about paying back the money again.

556
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,480
Actually,

557
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,680
I want to tell you today,

558
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,560
I don't like you.

559
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,800
Many oranges.

560
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,200
Look me in the eye and tell me that

561
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,880
you lied to me.

562
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,960
Am I right?

563
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,240
Yes,

564
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,160
I like you.

565
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,680
But,

566
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,920
it's just the fans'love for the singer,

567
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,960
It's not who you are in reality.

568
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,360
We are not suitable at all.

569
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,920
Jiang Nan,

570
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,000
I have no future.

571
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,160
I can't accompany you over the mountains and rivers,

572
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,720
and witness

573
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,440
the future life of Xingtu.

574
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm sorry.

575
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,800
You woke up.

576
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
You stayed at my door all night,

577
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
I didn't dare to go back to my room

578
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,040
because I was afraid you'd pack up,

579
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,360
She left quietly.

580
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,520
Don't be like this.

581
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,320
I've been thinking about it for the whole night,

582
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
if you think

583
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,160
we still need to work together.

584
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,160
I'm willing to change for you.

585
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
You don't have to change for me.

586
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,440
I've really thought it through.

587
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Hello, Mr. Bao.

588
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,320
Chengcheng,

589
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,120
is Jiang here?

590
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,000
No one answered his phone.

591
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,200
Are you with him?

592
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Wait a minute.

593
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,880
It's Mr. Bao.

594
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,040
Hey,

595
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,720
The nursing home called you a dozen times,

596
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,320
but you didn't pick up.

597
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,240
They all called me.

598
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,200
The address of the nursing home has been exposed.

599
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,680
Now there are a bunch of reporters at the gate of the sanatorium who want to interview,

600
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,800
you should go and have a look.

601
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,320
Got it.

602
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
I need to go to the nursing home first.

603
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,520
Did something happen to Auntie?

604
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Wait for me at home.

605
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,040
Wait.

606
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
I'll go with you.

607
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,960
At this stage, it's very important for your mother,

608
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,400
she can recognize people now and then.

609
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
If you get stimulated again,

610
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,080
all your efforts will be wasted.

611
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
Why don't we change her environment first?

612
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,240
Doctor,

613
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,880
my mom told me before,

614
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,880
She wants to go back to her hometown.

615
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,040
Do you think it's feasible?

616
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,360
Of course.

617
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,800
The new environment had better be one she's familiar with,

618
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,040
Okay,

619
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,800
I got it.

620
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,800
Thank you, doctor.

621
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,200
Sorry to have troubled you these days.

622
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,120
You're welcome.

623
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,440
What has

624
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
Chairman Zhilin been up to lately?

625
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,240
Mr. Zhan often asks Taotao to go to the nursing home recently.

626
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,240
What?

627
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,360
Get him here.

628
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,520
Mr. Zhan will go out this afternoon.

629
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,600
She hasn't come back yet.

630
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,240
Where did she go?

631
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,920
I don't know.

632
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,760
I didn't say.

633
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,280
Prepare a car for me now,

634
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
It's the chairman.

635
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,280
Jiang Nan,

636
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,560
what are you doing here?

637
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,360
Do you still think it's not bad enough to hurt my mom?

638
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
Do you still think it's not lively enough on the Internet?

639
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,880
I just got the news.

640
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,520
She's fine.

641
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,600
Don't worry.

642
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,880
You can go now.

643
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,760
Me

644
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,320
Can you take a look at her from afar?

645
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,120
No need.

646
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,960
Please go back.

647
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,600
Jiang Nan,

648
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,800
it's been so many years,

649
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,360
I've been trying to ease

650
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,760
the conflict between our two families,

651
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,480
I think it's also good for your mom.

652
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,440
You don't have to say anything.

653
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,640
All these years,

654
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,480
my mom doesn't even know me.

655
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,360
Not to mention if I still remember you.

656
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,200
So, everything you did,

657
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,440
was in vain.

658
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
It will only increase the pain between you and me.

659
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,000
Then.

660
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Can you bring this bouquet of flowers to your mother?

661
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,640
Where are you?

662
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,280
In other words,

663
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,160
did you reveal the address

664
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,280
of Jiang Nan's mother's nursing home?

665
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,680
Why can't you just let bygones

666
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,800
be bygones? Let bygones be bygones.

667
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,760
In the past,

668
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm telling you,

669
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,640
I'll never get over it.

670
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,800
Nannan,

671
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,840
isn't our superstar back?

672
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,640
Aunt,

673
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,840
Honey,

674
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,120
Who is this?

675
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,440
Sister-in-law, I …

676
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,320
Xia,

677
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,360
Your husband's sister.

678
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,680
Xia.

679
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,000
Xia,

680
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,240
why are you so old?

681
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,640
Where are your braids?

682
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,080
Auntie,

683
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,800
it's okay.

684
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,640
Take your time.

685
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,080
By the way,

686
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,160
I forgot to introduce it to you.

687
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,960
This is Many Orange.

688
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,560
Hello,

689
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,800
Okay,

690
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,040
This girl is pretty,

691
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,720
Auntie.

692
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,040
Let's go in first.

693
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,400
You see,

694
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,560
you're too busy talking,

695
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,040
Come on.

696
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,720
Let's put the stuff in first.

697
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,440
Come on. You go first.

698
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,480
It's been more than ten years.

699
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,920
It's my first time back.

700
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,080
Is this when you were little?

701
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,720
This is when I was three years old.

702
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
It's so cute.

703
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,000
What about this photo?

704
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,680
I think when I was just in elementary school,

705
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,200
I was wearing a little red scarf.

706
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
You won a lot of trophies.

707
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,880
Of course.

708
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,880
When I was little,

709
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,960
My mom found out that I like music,

710
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
and then she likes singing on the stage,

711
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,720
So he often took me to some

712
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,120
big and small music competitions,

713
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,240
You must be someone else's kid.

714
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,520
Since I grew up outstanding,

715
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,280
since I'm so outstanding,

716
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

717
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,920
Shouldn't these photos be put away?

718
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,200
Don't let me see you.

719
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,720
Yes,

720
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
it's very thoughtful of you.

721
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,680
Let's take it.

722
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,240
This is my dad.

723
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,760
Uncle must also be a very good person.

724
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,960
It should be said that

725
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,639
the sky is jealous of talents, right?

726
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,800
My dad left early,

727
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,480
but in my heart,

728
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,480
I'm still alive.

729
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,600
Nannan, Chengcheng,

730
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,360
time to eat.

731
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,679
Okay, Auntie.

732
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,480
I'll be right there.

733
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,679
Let's take it.

734
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,719
Brother,

735
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,679
Jiang Nan took his mother back to her hometown.

736
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,320
Hey,

737
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,400
Many oranges,

738
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,679
where are you?

739
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,320
I'm not in Xinhai. Let's talk about it

740
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
when we get back.

741
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,159
Many oranges,

742
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
are you really doing this for him,

743
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,600
Are you dying?

744
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,040
I don't have much free time anyway.

745
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,560
I don't want to have regrets.

746
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,920
You.

747
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,840
Caiyun,

748
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
I'm going to wash my hands.

749
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Eat it yourself.

750
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,960
If you stay in the sun for a long time,

751
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,200
you'll feel dizzy if you come here together,

752
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,360
Chengcheng, go to your room and have a rest.

753
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,080
I think it's fine here,

754
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,720
Okay,

755
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,720
Thank you, Auntie.

756
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,120
What are you eating?

757
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,080
Nothing.

758
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,320
V-C,

759
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,680
I'll have one too.

760
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,520
I don't know how many days I've been here

761
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
but I didn't bring a few tablets,

762
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,600
You're so stingy. I'll go to the drugstore

763
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,600
and buy you a new bottle.

764
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,120
I only eat this brand.

765
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,640
I can't buy it at the drugstore.

766
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,640
What's wrong with you?

767
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,920
Jiang Nan.

768
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,960
If.

769
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,880
If I,
