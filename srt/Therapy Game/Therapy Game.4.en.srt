1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,270
How did it come to this?

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,600
My whole goal was...

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,530
to make Shizuma fall for me.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,440
Minato...

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm in love with you.

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,920
All you had to do was hold me.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,630
It doesn't matter if there are feelings involved.

8
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,540
Let's not overthink it and just have fun.

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,660
I won't ask for any commitment.

10
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,160
Shizuma...

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,450
I can't do that.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,510
To me, you're already...

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,200
not someone I can just fool around with anymore.

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,520
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,750
This isn't funny.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,980
I don't think we can go back to that night.

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,680
But if...

18
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,170
If we could do it over...

19
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,340
I don't want it to be just getting caught up
in the moment like that time.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,150
I want us to hold each other knowing
that we're truly in love.

21
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,910
Huh?

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,510
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,430
I was just trying to get my revenge.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,510
A guy like him...

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,720
There's no way I could take him seriously.

26
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,940
Because I want to cherish you.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,550
I'll sleep in the other room.

28
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,710
Good night.

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Minato.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,880
Oh, for crying out loud.

31
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,580
How many more times am I gonna
let him wrap me around his finger?

32
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,880
I can't believe he actually fell for me...

33
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,570
He was way too easy.

34
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,590
Wait.

35
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,450
I'm one to talk.

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,000
I talked a big game about getting revenge,

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,420
but now I'm the one catching feelings?

38
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,050
No.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
I haven't.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,380
Calm down.

41
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,820
If I just stay calm,

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,190
I don't have any feelings for Shizuma.

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm fine.

44
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,410
Totally fine.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
"Therapy Game"

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,200
(Episode 4)

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,150
Huh?

48
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,930
Shizuma.

49
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,150
Oh.

50
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,320
There you are.

51
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,820
Morning.

52
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,230
You were in the shower forever.

53
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,070
I got tired of waiting.

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,060
That was so...

55
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,940
- Not okay!
- Hey.

56
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,380
- You... you idiot!
- What's gotten into you?

57
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,920
- You're an idiot, an idiot!
- What... are you in elementary school?

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,830
Idiot, idiot.

59
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,940
Yeah, I'm childish. So what?

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,740
You're so annoying...

61
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,230
What?

62
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,210
Nothing.

63
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,870
- I was just thinking it's good to see you're back to your usual self.
- Huh?

64
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,450
After I confessed so suddenly,

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,540
I thought you might have run off
in the middle of the night.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,020
I was a little worried.

67
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,510
I'm...

68
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,280
a really horrible person.

69
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,740
You're going to regret this.

70
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,080
I think you're...

71
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,470
a really great person.

72
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,340
How so?

73
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,150
Because...

74
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,920
Even though I got blackout drunk

75
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,680
and hurt you,

76
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,350
you still stayed by my side

77
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,000
and helped me get over my broken heart.

78
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,280
Your kindness

79
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,290
is what saved me.

80
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,770
That's...

81
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,260
That was because I wanted revenge.

82
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,720
I wanted to hurt you even more.

83
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,480
You've got it all wrong.

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
I'm...

85
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,160
not the good person you think I am.

86
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,310
Your smile is cute.

87
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,390
Huh?

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,690
Your pouting face is cute too.

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,950
And I kind of like how blunt you are.

90
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,090
The way you got all excited like a kid
at the amusement park was also really cute.

91
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,240
Also, how you calm down when I pat your head,

92
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,990
like a cat. It makes my heart skip a beat.

93
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,150
Oh, but you are a little violent.

94
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,980
I'd really appreciate it if you'd be a little more gentle.

95
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,830
So what's your point?

96
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,630
So,

97
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,540
even if you don't see it yourself,

98
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,980
I can see all the good things about you.

99
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,890
Which means,

100
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,440
you're a good person.

101
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,930
Why?

102
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,920
Why do you trust me so much?

103
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,650
You don't even know why I approached you.

104
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,460
You're such an idiot...

105
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm sorry...

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,700
That's enough. I have to stop.

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,360
This whole revenge thing...

108
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,690
I don't want to hurt Shizuma.

109
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,870
I don't want to leave him.

110
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,010
Um...

111
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,730
Shizuma.

112
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
I...

113
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,840
(You'd better bring us back some souvenirs!)
(I want sweets.)

114
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,400
(Oh, the mamasan wants you to get rice crackers.)
(And White Tiger Pie Sticks, a box for each person~)

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Oh...

116
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,350
Jeez.

117
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,240
Seriously, who's been telling everyone?

118
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,690
Everyone's asking me to buy them sweets.

119
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,410
But,

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
you still bought them anyway.

121
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,800
Well, they do take care of me.

122
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Oh.

123
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,840
By the way, you were about to say something earlier.

124
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,690
Oh, right.

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
What was it?

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,740
I'll tell you properly some other time.

127
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,100
The view is beautiful.

128
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
Do you know where this is?

129
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,060
It looks a lot like where I lived as a kid.

130
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,070
Oh?

131
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,300
Is it a famous tourist spot?

132
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,580
I don't remember.

133
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,220
After I came to my grandma's place here in the fifth grade,

134
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,760
I never went back.

135
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,920
The memories have all become a blur.

136
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I see.

137
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,880
I can barely even remember the house I used to live in.

138
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,780
You should go visit sometime.

139
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,970
Going there might bring back a lot of memories.

140
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,870
You're right.

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,870
I wish I could.

142
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,630
It's impossible.

143
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,650
I can't go near that town.

144
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Shizuma.

145
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm hungry.

146
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,600
Let's get something to eat before we head back.

147
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,490
Okay.

148
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,530
I'm stuffed.

149
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,290
Yeah.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Oh.

151
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
You can drop me off here.

152
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,520
There's somewhere I want to stop by before I go home.

153
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,850
Thanks for walking me.

154
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,790
Yeah.

155
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,450
When are you taking those to the bar?

156
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,440
I'm actually going tomorrow.

157
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Thanks.

158
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,550
I see.

159
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Bye...

160
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,690
Bye...

161
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,580
- Minato.
- Shizuma.

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,060
Oh, sorry.

163
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,790
You go first.

164
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,780
Okay, I'll go.

165
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,830
Um...

166
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,730
Can I ask you out again?

167
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Huh?

168
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,610
I want to thank you for
spending these last two days with me.

169
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,080
Is that okay?

170
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,080
I don't mind.

171
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,450
Thank you.

172
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Great.

173
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,200
Oh, so what were you going to say?

174
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,850
Oh.

175
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
It's nothing.

176
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,220
I just wanted to say good night.

177
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,970
Yeah.

178
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
Good night.

179
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,900
See you.

180
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,510
Ah...

181
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Goodbye.

182
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,890
In the end...

183
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,570
I still couldn't say it.

184
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,470
- Bro.
- Hmm?

185
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,580
What's with all the sighing?

186
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,900
Nothing... I just can't get him out of my head.

187
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,170
The person you said you liked,

188
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,330
that's who you went to the amusement park with, right?

189
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,230
Yeah.

190
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,650
We had a lot of fun,

191
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,970
but whenever I think about it,

192
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,880
it just hurts right here.

193
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,400
Huh?

194
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,260
- You, bro?
- It's weird, huh?

195
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,610
Not really...

196
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,410
I think it's perfectly normal.

197
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,740
But you, bro...

198
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,210
You always wait for someone to
confess to you before you start dating.

199
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,800
I've never seen you be the one to fall for someone first.

200
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,030
That's true.

201
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,260
Even I'm surprised at myself.

202
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,420
Why don't you plan our next date?

203
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,400
That's your strong suit, isn't it?

204
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,550
That's true.

205
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,410
Yeah.

206
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,730
You're right.

207
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,520
- I'll think of something.
- Okay.

208
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,900
- Okay!
- I'm home.

209
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,520
- You're back.
- Welcome home.

210
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,740
I'm so tired.

211
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,970
I vaccinated a Siberian tiger today.

212
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
Huh?

213
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,720
Sho-chan, are you heading out?

214
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,810
What about dinner?

215
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,570
Oh, I'll eat later.

216
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,910
I'm just meeting up with a friend.

217
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,980
Don't be out too late.

218
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,270
Ah, he's messaging me.

219
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,790
Okay, I'm off then.

220
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,920
Itsuki-san.

221
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,450
I was just heading out.

222
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,570
Oh, no problem. I'll be right there.

223
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
That Itsuki person...

224
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,620
- Is he just a friend?
- Hmm?

225
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,210
No.

226
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,990
He seemed especially happy.

227
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,480
Isn't Sho-chan always like that?

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
That's true.

229
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,190
- That's just how he is.
- Yeah.

230
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,300
(Search results: Popular date spots in Tokyo)

(Tokyo Date Guide)

232
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,390
Shizuma, your internship starts soon, doesn't it?

233
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Yeah.

234
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,830
It does.

235
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,030
You should have some fun before you get busy.

236
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Minato.

237
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,040
What would be a fun place to go?

238
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,310
Delicious.

239
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,350
I'm so glad.

240
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,810
Your brother...

241
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,260
Sounds like it's going well for him.

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,580
I hope so.

243
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,020
I don't know what the other person's like...

244
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,720
but I want my brother to be happy, too.

245
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,530
That's sweet of you.

246
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
You think so?

247
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,010
Yeah.

248
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,950
You're a very kind person.

249
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Heh heh.

250
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,960
Shohei, are you free on Friday?

251
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,750
I happen to have the day off.

252
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,170
If you're up for it,
would you like to go on a date?

253
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Really?

254
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,350
I'd love to go on a date.

255
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,580
In that case...

256
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,060
I just got some movie tickets.
Want to go together?

257
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,400
We can grab dinner afterward.

258
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,250
Yeah!

259
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,860
Of course, I'd love to.

260
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,030
Yes, I'll definitely go.

261
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,590
Wow, I'm so excited. What movie is it?

262
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,260
I can't wait.

263
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Oh.

264
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,380
I wonder if they have couple seats.

265
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,530
What should we eat afterward?

266
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,670
But as long as I'm with you, Itsuki-san,

267
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,790
I'd be happy eating anything.

268
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,250
- You're so cute, Shohei.
- Heh heh.

269

(Aquarium, movie, fall foliage viewing...)

270
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360

(Go to Minato's hometown)

272
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,690
Anyway...

273
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,140
That's about it.

274
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,750
Yeah.

275
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,130
Hmm?

276
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,670
Oh.

277
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,640
Um, I'll just leave this here.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,500
Huh?
Ah.

279
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,080
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:30,850
Minato's...

281
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
I completely forgot.

282
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,480
Is this the place?

283
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,380
I don't remember at all.

284
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Oh my.

285
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,660
Well, well, well.

286
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Oh, if it isn't you, mister.

287
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,740
Do you remember me?

288
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,370
Uh...

289
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,510
Um...

290
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,650
You're just like Minato-chan said you'd be.

291
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,880
And after you poured your heart out to me.

292
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,230
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
So?

294
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,060
Your broken heart...

295
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,280
has it healed?

296
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,350
Yes.

297
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,540
It's all thanks to Minato.

298
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,940
Oh, is that so? That's wonderful.

299
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,720
- Um... he said he'd be here today.
- He's here.

300
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,450
Did you two have plans?

301
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,650
Oh, no.

302
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,000
He forgot something, so I brought it over.

303
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,130
My, you're so thoughtful.

304
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm heading out.

305
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,310
The door's unlocked.

306
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,630
Just let yourself in.

307
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,450
Okay, thank you.

308
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,680
See you next time, then.

309
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,670
To think he said, "It's all thanks to Minato."

310
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,730
You're something else, Minato-chan.

311
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,560
My instincts are never wrong.

312
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,890
- So cute.
- I'm having this one.

313
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,090
So cute.

314
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,210
Mmm, this is delicious!

315
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,030
That's our Minato-chan.

316
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,010
He even has great taste in souvenirs.

317
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,000
That's rich coming from the one
who was blowing up my phone this morning.

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Hey!

319
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,890
Were we interrupting something?

320
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,600
Ah, he's not denying it.

321
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,900
I told you, it's nothing.

322
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,090
How can it be nothing?

323
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,210
You went to an amusement park
and then you stayed the night.

324
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,610
Jeez! Keep your voice down.

325
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,690
So what exactly happened?

326
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,830
- Tell us already!
- Leave me alone.

327
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,390
Just eat your dessert.

328
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,150
- At least show us a picture.
- Yeah!

329
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,130
- I told you, there are no pictures.
- You didn't even take a picture of the guy you like?

330
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,190
- Some photographer you are.
- What?

331
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Hey, wait a second.

332
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,760
Does this mean Minato-chan won the bet?

333
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Oh.

334
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,350
Yeah.

335
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,280
Didn't I tell you guys?

336
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,970
I don't care how straight a guy is.

337
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,670
I can always...

338
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,950
make him mine.

339
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,030
It was too easy to even call it a bet.

340
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,270
But a deal's a deal.

341
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,980
No way. Shaving my head is too much.

342
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,910
But hey, Minato-chan...

343
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,050
I still don't think getting revenge is a good idea.

344
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,110
Because that guy...

345
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
he has real feelings for you now, doesn't he?

346
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,180
About that...

347
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,280
My feelings for Shizuma...

348
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,680
I can't feel that way anymore.

349
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,540
This.

350
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,540
You forgot this.

351
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,510
Ah.

352
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Shizuma.

353
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,810
Wait, Shizuma.

354
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,150
Wait, just wait.

355
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,390
Hey.

356
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,510
Was it all...

357
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,320
Was it all a lie?

358
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,010
No, that's not it.

359
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
I have to tell him.

360
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,310
Hurry.

361
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,510
The truth is, my feelings for you, Shizuma...

362
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,570
I should've learned my lesson
when Yuka broke up with me.

363
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,380
I never learn, do I?

364
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,570
What an idiot.

365
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,970
Congratulations.

366
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,500
You got exactly what you wanted.

367
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,090
You know,

368
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,970
I saw you do this before.

369
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,050
If you keep pulling stunts like this,

370
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,910
you're never going to win anyone's heart.

371
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,760
You'll be alone for the rest of your life.

372
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,230
I didn't understand what you meant back then.

373
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,150
But now...

374
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,970
I see exactly what you meant.

375
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,700
(Next Episode)
Sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,670
Why?

377
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,950
The Minato who was with Shizuma...
was all of that really a lie?

378
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,830
I don't care anymore.

379
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,550
I want you to hold me.

380
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
Minato.
