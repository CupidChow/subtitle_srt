1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,590
Hey, Shizuma.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,610
- Hmm?
- All you do is spoil me.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,310
Are you sure this is okay?

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,530
I just wanted to pamper you today...

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,280
Want more?

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,800
This is more than enough.

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,880
Don't you have school tomorrow?

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,690
But I don't want to go.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,320
I want to stay like this forever.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,250
You can't.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,390
That friend of yours with the glasses will get mad.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,900
Are you that eager for me to go home?

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,470
That's not what I meant.

14
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,590
I don't know the details,

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,550
but vet school must be really busy, right?

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,010
If I get used to having you around,

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,200
I'll be lonely when you're not here.

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,680
I won't let you get lonely.

19
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,530
Really?

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,660
If you neglect me,

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,250
I'll show you my fangs.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,230
If they're your fangs, Minato,

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
they'd still be cute.

24
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,550
You're such an idiot.

25
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
I love you so much.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Let's get to sleep.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Good night.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Good night.

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
"Therapy Game"

31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,300
(Episode 6)

32
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,440
So the internship finally starts next week.

33
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,050
What a drag.

34
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,560
What's there to be down about?

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,520
- There are tons of animals waiting for our help.
- I know, but...

36
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,480
during last year's internship,

37
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,340
none of the dogs would come near me.

38
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,280
I heard that dogs can size people up

39
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,400
and see right through to their core.

40
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,350
No way. My core is all about

41
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,740
love and peace.

42
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
Did my feelings

43
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,130
really get through to him?

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,490
It was a good chance for us
to understand each other's feelings.

45
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
From now on,

46
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,690
I just need to show him through my actions.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,470
It's a good learning experience, right?

48
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,430
Right, Shizuma?

49
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,910
Shizuma.

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Are you listening?

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh, sorry.

52
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,790
What did you say?

53
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,590
I said,

54
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,670
our ranch internship starts next week.

55
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,440
Oh, right.

56
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,720
It starts next week.

57
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,260
Hey, are you seriously okay?

58
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,240
A senior who did the internship last year said that

59
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,960
we can forget about having any personal time.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,720
- Is it that busy?
- Yep.

61
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,210
I heard that last year,

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,020
his girlfriend of just a few months
dumped him right after he started.

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,040
Good thing you don't have a girlfriend.

64
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,850
Shut up.

65
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,740
It's that

66
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,150
inconsiderate side of you

67
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,360
that dogs can sense.

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Hmph.

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,430
When I met Shizuma,

71
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,000
I saw him genuinely wish happiness
for the woman who betrayed him.

72
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,020
Seeing that foolish look on his face,
my heart skipped a beat for the first time.

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,360
He so easily believed my lies.

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,920
Even though I tricked and hurt him,

75
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,030
he still accepted me.

76
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,450
(Shohei: Please take care of my brother.
Minato: Same to you. Take care of my brother.)
(Shohei: Sending you the photos from yesterday.)

77
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,190
He's gentle and naive.

78
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,630
So straightforward.

79
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,210
He's too good for me.

80
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,530
That's why,

81
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,610
the more serious I get about this,

82
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,020
the stronger this foolish insecurity inside me grows.

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,680
If I let myself sink any deeper,

84
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,410
I'll...

85
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm sure I'll...

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,300
(Shizuma: Can we meet later?
There's something I need to tell you.)

87
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,530
Sorry to keep you waiting.

88
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,510
Oh.

89
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,730
Are you working?

90
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,830
No, just taking a breather.

91
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,130
I've wrapped things up for now.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
By the way.

93
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,740
Here. If you don't mind, please accept this.

94
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,170
Oh.

95
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,310
Thanks.

96
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
Mhm.

97
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,590
So...

98
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
What did you want to tell me?

99
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Oh.

100
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,990
Um... my ranch internship starts next week.

101
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,050
Okay.

102
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,610
For how long?

103
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,730
Three weeks.

104
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,750
Even though we officially get weekends off,

105
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,370
it's really busy there,

106
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,080
so I might not be able to get away.

107
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,030
I see.

108
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,660
I promise I'll contact you every night.

109
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,880
And I'll come see you the second I get a day off.

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,570
- It's not like we're actually dating.
- So...

111
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,240
You can't see anyone else either, Minato.

112
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,700
I won't give you any reason to worry.

113
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,980
I didn't want to fall for him.

114
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,580
But when he says things like that...

115
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,180
Okay, I get it.

116
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,550
Minato.

117
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
What's your answer?

118
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,340
What's with that tone?

119
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,270
Acting all high and mighty. No way.

120
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,300
It's not really a "no way" kind of question.

121
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,410
No means no! No, no, no!

122
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,130
Are you a child?

123
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,430
No way, meow.

124
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,980
Acting like a cat won't work. No means no.

125
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Jeez.

126
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,610
I won't be able to stop myself from falling for you.

127
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,010
I guess you can act like a puppy instead.

128
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,010
You're back late again today.

129
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,750
Want something to eat?

130
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,680
No, I'm just going to shower and go to bed.

131
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,410
I see.

132
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,660
What is it?

133
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,720
Did something happen with you and Itsuki-san?

134
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
No, not at all.

135
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,880
We're doing just fine.

136
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,560
But, just so you know,

137
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,340
"Does he think so little of me
that he'd ghost me right away?"

138
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,390
Itsuki-san said Minato is furious right now.

139
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,600
He's probably just worried.

140
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
All right.

141
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,620
"Sorry it's so late. Heading home now."

142
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,940
"Just got home. Going to bed. Good night."

143
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,950
"Sorry, I fell asleep on you yesterday."

144
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,990
"Sorry, I fell asleep again today."

145
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,850
Well, you are still contacting him.

146
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,290
After my shower,

147
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,290
I'm definitely calling him today.

148
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,660
That seems unlikely.

149
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,870
Hup.

150
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,490
Oh.

151
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,820
That looks heavy. You okay?

152
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,290
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Keep up the good work.

153
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,080
Okay, thank you so much.

154
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,900
(Incoming call: Minato)

155
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Hello?

156
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,150
Minato.

157
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Shizuma.

158
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,460
Why haven't you been calling me?

159
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,440
Huh? What was that noise?

160
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Are you okay?

161
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,210
Sorry.

162
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,990
My books fell.

163
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,610
Oh, sorry about that.

164
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,540
I just haven't been able to call.

165
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,150
It's fine.

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,880
Are you home now?

167
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Yeah.

168
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,220
I just got back.

169
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,260
I'm looking up the cases for today's sick animals.

170
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,820
"Sick animals"?

171
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,570
At the animal hospital,

172
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,070
we don't call them "patients."

173
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,210
We call them "sick animals."

174
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,410
I see.

175
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,710
How about you?

176
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,080
Is everything okay?

177
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,350
Me?

178
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,760
I went with my brother to do some volunteer work.

179
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,520
I took pictures of rabbits.

180
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,040
Oh, really?

181
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,290
Rabbits, huh?

182
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,380
Show me the pictures next time.

183
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,530
Sure.

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Hey.

185
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,930
When do you think you'll get a day off?

186
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,260
Did you fall asleep, Shizuma?

187
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,380
Shizuma?

188
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Mmm...

189
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,330
Sorry.

190
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
You should get some sleep.

191
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,630
You have your internship tomorrow.

192
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,010
Can we talk for just a little...

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Shizuma.

194
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,600
He probably fell asleep.

195
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,680
Getting to talk at all should be enough, right?

196
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,230
Five minutes?

197
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,610
Five minutes after not talking for two weeks?

198
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,780
That's way too short.

199
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,790
He's that exhausted, though.

200
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,210
It'd be annoying if I kept pestering him, wouldn't it?

201
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,000
But if that's the case,

202
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,100
won't you be lonely, Minato-san?

203
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,160
If Itsuki-san and I end up like that...

204
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,950
I couldn't bear it.

205
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,020
I'm not like you, a clingy little kid
who's always hanging on his brother.

206
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,890
I'm a grown-up, so I'll be fine.

207
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,490
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

208
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,240
Jeez.

209
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,230
Don't take it out on me, will you?

210
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,190
What are you, a child?

211
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,090
Shut up.

212
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,440
You're one to talk, you kid.

213
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,580
- You're the child! - No, you are!
- I'm home.

214
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,980
- Sounds like you two are having fun.
- Itsuki-san, welcome home.

215
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,210
Hey, you're back.

216
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,250
What's that you've got, bro?

217
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,150
- Cosmos flowers?
- Huh?

218
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,020
I stopped by the bar,
and the mama-san gave them to me.

219
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,240
They're pretty, aren't they?

220
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,180
Shohei, could you get me a vase?

221
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Sure.

222
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,090
Is Shizuma still working?

223
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,510
Yeah.

224
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,560
He seems to be really focused.

225
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,410
I see.

226
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,630
Minato, are you heading back already?

227
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,560
I already emailed you the photos you asked for.

228
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,500
Why don't you take a few flowers with you?

229
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,940
Oh...

230
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,660
Well...

231
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,530
Hey, bro...

232
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,790
Is this one dead?

233
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,880
It's still alive.

234
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,780
Can I have this one then?

235
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,580
I guess, but...

236
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,340
The bud is still so small.

237
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,540
It'll probably be hard to get it to bloom.

238
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,700
But this is the one I want.

239
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,850
All right.

240
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
Here you go.

241
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,030
Thanks.

242
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Well, I'm off.

243
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,060
Take care.

244
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,570
Huh?

245
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,880
Where's Minato-san?

246
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,310
He just left.

247
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,700
Will this vase do?

248
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
Yeah, thanks.

249
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,060
Sorry to ask...

250
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,750
but could you grab one more for me?

251
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,850
I'd like to put some by my bedside, too.

252
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,900
By your bedside...

253
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,930
Imagine looking at them together in bed.

254
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,060
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

255
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Yes.

256
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,500
That would be wonderful.

257
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
It bloomed.

258
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,070
It should be fine to send him a picture.

259
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
There.

260
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,400
(It bloomed this morning.)

261
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
(Can I come see it tomorrow afternoon?
I finish up here before noon.)

262
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,930
No way.

263
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,530
Seriously?

264
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,150
What is this picture?

265
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,910
I can't even tell what I'm looking at.

266
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,060
Feeling good?

267
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,530
Huh?

268
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,180
You've been looking forward to this, haven't you?

269
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,770
Once this is over, I can finally go home.

270
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,440
You must be happy.

271
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,450
I'm happy, too.

272
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,850
Shizuma.

273
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,070
Don't you have plans?

274
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,890
I can clean up for you.

275
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,410
No, it's all right.

276
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,340
You must be tired too, Chikazawa.

277
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,800
(Shizuma: Foal. I can head over around 19:00.
Minato: Can't wait.)

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
Look.

279
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Besides...

280
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,060
all I'm going to do is go home and sleep.

281
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,390
So, in that case...

282
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,510
just let me do this for you.

283
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,250
Thanks.

284
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,610
Then I'll take you up on that.

285
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,550
I'm definitely going to get some rest today.

286
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,450
I'm definitely, definitely...

287
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,430
going to get a good night's sleep.

288
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,270
Sorry!

289
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,100
There's a pony in the stable that can't move.

290
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,100
It might be a fracture.
I need you two to check right away.

291
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,380
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

292
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Right!

293
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Yeah, okay.

294
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,810
Minato-chan?

295
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,630
You're letting that pretty face go to waste.

296
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,380
This is what you look like
when you get stood up for a date.

297
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,230
Hasn't your phone been buzzing this whole time?

298
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,900
(Shizuma)

299
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,990
I'm definitely...

300
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
not answering.

301
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,040
When you're working,

302
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
sometimes you just can't be reached, right?

303
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,200
But, Mama-san...

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,460
I was perfectly fine being on my own until now.

305
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,440
We've only been apart for two weeks.

306
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,510
So why am I this miserable?

307
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,650
And here I was wondering what happened.

308
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,180
Don't worry. This is just what it's like to be in love.

309
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,370
If that's the case, then it's really not for me.

310
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,660
This whole "love" thing.

311
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,870
But...

312
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,450
I like the Minato-chan you are now.

313
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,830
More than the one who used to go around nonchalantly
ruining other people's relationships.

314
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,770
You're much cuter now.

315
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,560
Ugh, but I can't stand it.

316
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,330
I feel like such a pain in the neck. I hate it.

317
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Minato-chan.

318
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,940
I don't want to... be like this anymore.

319
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,270
Hey, Minato-chan.

320
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,260
What is it?

321
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,350
You don't want to be what?

322
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,210
Huh?

323
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,880
Sorry I'm late.

324
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,670
How...?

325
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,870
Because you weren't answering your phone,

326
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,250
and you weren't home.

327
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,260
I figured you'd be here,
so I came to pick you up.

328
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,310
I'm glad, though.

329
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,500
I found you right away.

330
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
What a shame.

331
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,160
You just missed it.

332
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,630
I should have come sooner.

333
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,570
Wait for me a minute.

334
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,820
What are you doing?

335
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,210
Watering it.

336
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,250
This should help it perk up a little.

337
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,470
Maybe the other buds will bloom now, too.

338
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,910
But... waiting is hard.

339
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,630
I'm sorry I made you wait.

340
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,130
I'm sorry.

341
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,390
It's not your fault.

342
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,190
It was for work.

343
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,640
And you did text me.

344
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,820
Stop pretending.

345
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,130
You missed me, didn't you?

346
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,150
I did.

347
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,410
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,230
For being such a handful.

349
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,310
Not at all.

350
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,420
I've been wanting to see you this whole time, too.

351
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,440
The thought of you running off somewhere...

352
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,880
it made me so anxious.

353
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,670
I'm not going anywhere.

354
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,140
Even if I wanted to run...

355
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,500
I don't think I could escape.

356
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,550
Whenever I get scared and try to run...

357
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,690
you always come after me.

358
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,950
(Next Episode)
- Want to move in together? - Really?

359
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,150
Living together?

360
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,670
I want to be supportive of them.

361
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,910
I knew it. Those two...

362
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,110
When are you going to let it go?

363
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,780
We're over.
