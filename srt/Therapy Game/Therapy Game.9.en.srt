1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,790
I want to be yours right now.

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,100
"Therapy Game"

3
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,000
(Episode 9)

4
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,230
To think you looked this cute that night too.

5
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,530
And I can't even remember it. It's killing me.

6
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,270
Ah.

7
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,200
Well...

8
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,590
We didn't do it.

9
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Huh?

10
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,340
We didn't go all the way.

11
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,690
You lied about that too?

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,660
I just asked you...

13
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,010
what you would do if I took advantage of you.

14
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,380
You'd almost stripped me naked.

15
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,020
And then the moment I looked away,

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,050
you fell asleep.

17
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,060
It was pure torture.

18
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,170
But...

19
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,050
we had just met.

20
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,060
Isn't it a good thing that nothing happened?

21
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,330
That's not right, either.

22
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,680
Even though we had just met,

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,830
I felt like I had finally found you.

24
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,570
I wanted to see where things went with you...

25
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,300
that's what I was thinking.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Huh?

27
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,830
Back then,

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,790
my brother and Shohei had just started dating.

29
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,580
I thought I might really be alone from now on.

30
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,070
So I was feeling pretty down.

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,530
It was right then...

32
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,690
that some weird drunk was bothering me.

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,140
You should've had a friend take you home.

34
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,530
You even cared about me, a total stranger.

35
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,320
You're such a good little brother.

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,620
There's no need to get over your brother complex.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,970
Not at all!

38
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,980
It was the first time someone's touch felt so comforting.

39
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,650
Since you're so bummed about it,

40
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,450
why don't you get your revenge?

41
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,390
You get hurt precisely because you trust people.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,910
And while it's true I was upset,

43
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,690
that's no reason to...

44
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,220
There's no point in hurting the other person.

45
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,510
To be able to forgive someone who betrayed you...

46
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,010
Since we chose to end it this way,

47
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,370
if she doesn't end up happier than before,

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,510
it would really bother me.

49
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,510
So people like that really do exist.

50
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,190
I thought to myself,

51
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,180
There are people out there, unlike my mom,
who can love someone gently.

52
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,080
You can be open and let me spoil you.

53
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,200
I want to feel these big, warm hands more often.

54
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,690
I felt it right then.

55
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,070
With you, it would be okay.

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
So that's why you were so angry then.

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,260
Yeah.

58
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,250
But we've finally made it this far.

59
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,820
I'll never...

61
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,210
make you feel that way again.

62
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,490
I know.

63
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,140
Don't look at me like that.

64
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
I'm going to...

65
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,240
I'm going to take in all of you.

66
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,560
So I'll never forget again.

67
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,450
Is that okay?

68
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,400
Wait.

69
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,650
Be gentle.

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Ah...

71
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,470
Morning.

72
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Morning.

73
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
You've been up for a while?

74
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
Yeah.

75
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,300
Um, Shizuma.

76
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,580
About our future...

77
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,520
I need some time to think.

78
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,210
I want to...

79
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,300
become someone who can properly return your feelings.

80
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,790
Okay.

81
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,610
I understand.

82
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,770
I'll wait for you.

83
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,050
I had a good talk with Minato.

84
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,610
That's a nice photo.

85
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,370
It is.

86
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,840
So, what about Minato-san?

87
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,460
He said he needs time to think.

88
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,170
Huh?

89
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,110
He's still saying that?

90
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,490
No, that's not it.

91
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,810
He said he wants to properly return my feelings.

92
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,100
So he needs some time to think.

93
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,750
Minato said that?

94
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,030
Yes.

95
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,410
I see.

96
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,000
He's trying to move forward on his own.

97
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,360
That's what I think too.

98
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,730
So how long are you going to wait?

99
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
I don't know.

100
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
But...

101
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,460
I think he's doing his best to figure things out right now.

102
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
Even though you're already prepared...

103
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,580
to accept everything about him.

104
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,590
That alone isn't enough.

105
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,750
Because Minato has a habit of expecting the worst.

106
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,330
I...

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,810
When faced with a future with no guarantees,

108
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,220
what can I do to make him feel secure?

109
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,770
Brother...

110
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,780
Thank you, Shizuma.

111
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,720
Meeting you...

112
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,570
Minato is a very lucky guy.

113
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,070
So...

114
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,550
my brother came to our place...

115
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,120
to fill us in on everything.

116
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,520
And?

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,590
If you guys want to be together,

118
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,500
you should just dive headfirst into the arms
of the one you love, like I did.

119
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,570
You're really something else in that regard.

120
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,910
Back when I was worried about my brother,

121
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,420
and told you all those nasty rumors,

122
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,670
you weren't discouraged at all.

123
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,530
Oh, right.

124
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,700
You're not like me. You're strong.

125
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,310
Someone like me...

126
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,590
just imagines things that haven't happened yet...

127
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,030
and gets anxious.

128
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,270
You're always making your brother worry.

129
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,330
You have a point.

130
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,920
I know it must be tough feeling anxious.

131
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
But...

132
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,520
is that really such a bad thing?

133
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Huh?

134
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,320
Doesn't it just prove that you...

135
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,550
really, really like my brother, Minato-san?

136
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,540
I see.

137
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,230
When you're feeling anxious,

138
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,350
just remember the happy things he's done for you,

139
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,350
or the fun things you've done together.

140
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,470
Think about them one by one.

141
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,230
If you do that,

142
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
you'll...

143
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,630
realize how much he cherishes you.

144
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,770
You'll feel reassured.

145
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,840
And you'll remember how much you love him.

146
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
It'll make you feel better.

147
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,580
Things that made me happy...

148
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,930
huh?

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,290
Even though I've always...

150
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,530
avoided getting close to people,

151
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,360
before I knew it, Shizuma was by my side.

152
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,170
Morning.

153
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,370
Just having him look at me,

154
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,530
just touching each other,

155
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,790
could make me feel so content.

156
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,990
I never would have imagined.

157
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,390
Even though I was so happy,

158
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
I love you.

159
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,190
Minato.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,810
I want to make you happy.

161
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,990
I won't let you regret it.

162
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,190
Choose me.

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,550
So, how are things?

164
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Um...

165
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,870
Are things going well with that guy?

166
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,640
By the way, what's his name again?

167
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Oh.

168
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Minato.

169
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Minato.

170
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,090
Right.

171
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,580
I haven't properly introduced you guys yet.

172
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,850
No need. We're just...

173
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,740
As long as you're feeling better,

174
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
that's all that matters.

175
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,850
Yeah.

176
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,770
If you ever have any problems,

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,270
you can always talk to us.

178
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Thanks.

179
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,510
Once things settle down,

180
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,940
I'll introduce him to you guys properly.

181
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Oh.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,300
- Are you two dating?
- Hey, Yuka...

183
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,200
He already said that.

184
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,860
- Once things settle down...
- What's that supposed to mean?

185
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
You know.

186
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,950
Let me reply to a message.

187
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,900
(Minato: Where are you now?
Shizuma: Just got out of class. At the university cafe.)

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,200
(Minato: I see. Okay.)

189
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
(Minato: Then come over to my rooftop.)

190
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,130
Sorry.

191
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm going to see Minato.

192
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,170
Now? Seriously?

193
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,070
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

194
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,710
Nice.

195
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

196
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,100
It's beautiful.

197
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
Yeah.

198
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
This camera...

199
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,850
was a gift from my brother when I was a kid.

200
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,760
Oh, really?

201
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,080
It's old...

202
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,740
but it's like a good luck charm to me.

203
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
You know...

204
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,020
I was looking at the photos from this camera again today.

205
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh?

206
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,870
Shohei...

207
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,050
he told me whenever I'm anxious...

208
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,730
to think about happy memories.

209
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
That guy...

210
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,090
Thinking about my time with you...

211
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,280
my heart was just so full.

212
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,340
And that's when I realized...

213
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,950
I've been lonely this whole time.

214
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,420
My mom always looked so stern...

215
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,050
but she was just lonely.

216
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,960
I bet she wanted to cry, too.

217
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,620
Me...

218
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,900
I was so happy you were there for me.

219
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,840
The way you're so serious all the time...

220
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
your terrible photography skills...

221
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,020
even how cute you are when you're drunk...

222
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,870
I love everything about you.

223
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,390
That's why I'll never... ever leave you.

224
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,210
I'm going to get...

225
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,540
stronger.

226
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,630
So you better be by my side to watch me.

227
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,950
I'll be watching.

228
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,530
I'll always be right here by your side.

229
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
Okay.

230
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,140
- Hey, there's no way I'm losing!
- Ugh...

231
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,230
Isn't that triple points?

232
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,460
- Doesn't that mean I win?
- It's triple!

233
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,030
Oh, welcome!

234
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,730
- Look who's here together!
- This is great!

235
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,060
Sorry for all the trouble.

236
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,530
Oh, stop.

237
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,220
Did you two come all this way
just to tell us that?

238
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,830
- What a stud.
- So cool.

239
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,270
All right, stop teasing them.

240
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,270
I had a feeling you two would show up.

241
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,040
I saved you the best seats in the house.

242
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,790
Just for you two.

243
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,050
Wow, that's so nice.

244
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,300
He said they're the best seats.

245
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,730
Mind if we join you?

246
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,120
I want to hear Minato's side of the story, too.

247
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,320
Huh?

248
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,520
Of course.

249
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,010
- Hey, no fair! I wanna listen too!
- What is it?

250
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,600
- Come on, sit down.
- Me too, me too!

251
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,880
Me too!

252
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Come on, come on, come on.

253
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,530
Have a seat.

254
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
It's so lively in here.

255
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,600
- Yeah, this is really great.
- It really is.

256
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,460
- We're all so happy for you guys.
- So happy, so happy.

257
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,950
- But really, I'm sorry for all the trouble.
- It's nothing.

258
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,550
(Message from Tatsumi)

259
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,990
I didn't really do anything to help...

260
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,290
(Tatsumi: Take care of Shizuma for me.)

261
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,140
My world used to be just my brother.

262
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,430
Somehow, it's become so much bigger.

263
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,000
- I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
- But I'm so sorry... It's all my fault...

264
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,420
Exactly.

265
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,570
If the old me could see this now...

266
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,700
he'd probably pass out from the shock.

267
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,870
I love you, Minato.

268
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,350
I love you too.

269
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,660
Ever since the day we first met...

270
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,730
I've been in love with you.

271
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,950
I'm all yours.

272
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,880
You better take good care of me.

273
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,460
You okay?

274
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,170
What's this?

275
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,270
("For Those Considering Same-Sex Marriage")

276
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,050
Aren't you jumping the gun a little?

277
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,450
I was just doing some research, you know?

278
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Looking for anything that
might help put your mind at ease.

279
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,430
I see.

280
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,250
So, did you find anything?

281
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
This.

282
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,500
I want this to be us.

283
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,730
No way... Absolutely not.

284
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,930
Old guys wearing matching heart sweaters?

285
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,190
We'd be a laughingstock.

286
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,880
You think so?

287
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,500
By the time we get that old...

288
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,750
it might not be so strange.

289
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,490
If I'm going to grow old with anyone...

290
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,140
I want it to be you.

291
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,670
Even so...

292
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,040
I don't want to look like "that".

293
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,560
I know, I know.

294
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,690
It was just an example.

295
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,470
What are you doing?

296
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,540
As long as it's not the hearts...

297
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,630
I might consider it.

298
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,870
- Mmm...
- I told you, you're jumping the gun.

299
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,820
I'm not going to forget you just said that.

300
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,350
Growing old with me won't be easy, you know.

301
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,310
If you ever cheat on me...

302
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,290
I might just kill you and eat you.

303
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,290
The feeling's mutual.

304
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
But...

305
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,030
if I can, I want to grow old with you.

306
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,770
And...

307
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,440
I want to wear matching heart sweaters...

308
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,710
in a field of cosmos flowers.

309
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
I'm telling you...

310
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,380
no heart sweaters.

311
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,470
- It's too embarrassing. - What's the big deal?
- Then you can wear it by yourself.

312
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,820
No way.
