1
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,670
- Just hold me tight tonight.
- Huh?

2
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,830
I want to be in your arms

3
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,610
and sleep soundly.

4
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,850
Okay.

5
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,280
It's been a while, hasn't it?

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Spending time together like this.

7
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,000
I've made you feel lonely, haven't I?

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can say that again.

9
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,240
Because I've been lonely, too.

10
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,050
If Shizuma and I could connect on a deeper level,

11
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,420
maybe I wouldn't be so afraid anymore.

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
"Therapy Game"

13
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,400
(Episode 7)

14
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,550
They're so beautiful.

15
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,030
Yeah.

16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,710
I wonder how long they'll be in bloom.

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Itsuki-san.

18
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,530
What's wrong?

19
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,730
Well,

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,040
it's because I'm so happy
when we're together like this...

21
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,190
that the thought of being alone again
makes me a little sad.

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
That's true.

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Being alone can be lonely.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,640
I wish we could be together forever.

25
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,870
Do you really mean that?

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Of course I do.

27
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Then...

28
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,510
Let's live together.

29
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,050
Huh?

30
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Really?

31
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,060
Really.

32
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,250
Hey, you're not kidding, are you?

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm serious.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,440
But only if your family agrees.

35
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
Oh.

36
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,330
If you don't mind, I could go and talk to them.

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,750
No,

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,840
that should be fine.

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,700
But what about what I think?

40
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,090
Did you just assume I'd say yes?

41
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,370
You wouldn't?

42
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,710
Shohei.

43
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
Of course.

44
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,430
I'd love to.

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,030
(Shizuma: My internship is over. I want to see you.)
(Minato: I'm busy with a big project,
so I can't meet for a while.)

46
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,370
For a while?

47
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,230
How long am I supposed to wait?

48
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,310
Bro.

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,860
Sorry, I know you're tired.

50
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,430
Can I talk to you for a second?

51
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,110
Oh.

52
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,780
Yeah, sure.

53
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,970
Have a seat.

54
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,940
Actually,

55
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,740
- there's something I need to ask you.
- Hm?

56
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,900
The thing is,

57
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,310
Itsuki-san and I are going to...

58
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Huh?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Move in together?

60
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,420
It's less like living together
and more like being roommates.

61
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,700
Shohei also told his mom

62
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,950
that living at my place would be more convenient for school,

63
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,220
so she agreed.

64
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,690
Is that really okay?

65
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,830
You mean about Shohei and me being a couple?

66
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,690
What else?

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Well,

68
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,060
I think his mom has a vague idea.

69
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,780
I offered to meet and introduce myself in person,

70
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,900
but she said it was his decision to make,

71
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,460
so I didn't need to do anything.

72
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
So?

73
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,140
And you just took her word for it?

74
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,920
Because I believe Shohei really thought
this through before deciding.

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Oh, really?

76
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,530
That's impressive.

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,420
What about you, Minato?

78
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,770
Haven't you seen Shizuma lately?

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Well...

80
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,380
I've been busy with work, too.

81
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,610
Even though you're just lazing around at home.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,290
If I don't play a little hard to get,

83
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,350
it wouldn't be fair, would it?

84
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Anyway,

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,700
just leave me out of it.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Right.

87
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,930
Hey, Minato.

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,290
Even though Shohei and I will be living together,

89
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,960
you can still come over anytime.

90
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,020
Look at him.

91
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,100
What happened now?

92
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:51,970
What do you think happened?

93
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,600
Doing this and that

94
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,520
with some pretty lady?

95
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,880
Shizuma would never do something like that.

96
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,940
It's about that guy

97
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,390
from the bar, isn't it?

98
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes.

99
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,090
I'm telling you,

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,810
he's totally lovesick.

101
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,290
Let's go.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
(Shizuma: When will you be done?
Minato: I'll text you when I'm free.)

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,960
How long are you going to make me wait?

104
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,030
What?

105
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,630
How long are you going to stare?

106
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,810
Can't I?

107
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,280
It's been a long time since we've seen each other.

108
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
I want to get a good look at you.

109
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,530
Oh yeah? Haven't you had enough?

110
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,390
I really want to hold you.

111
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,100
Forget that.

112
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,090
Did you hear about my brother and his boyfriend?

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,730
That they're moving in together?

114
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,330
What else would it be?

115
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,970
Moving in together right after
they started dating is just weird.

116
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,710
Shizuma, you have to stop them.

117
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Minato,

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
are you against it?

119
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,540
Of course I am.

120
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,030
Deciding to move in together when they're that lovesick

121
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,690
is a recipe for disaster.

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Well, I...

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,600
I want to support them.

124
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,210
What?

125
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,450
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,670
Ever since Shohei met Itsuki-san,

127
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,260
he seems so happy.

128
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,250
When they're together,

129
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,010
they both look great.

130
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
No, but...

131
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,740
Living together isn't as simple as it sounds.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,670
When you spend more time together,

133
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,510
you might end up fighting.

134
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,360
It's not always going to be good.

135
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,970
Shohei...

136
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,950
wanted to be by Itsuki-san's side

137
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,590
because he looked lonely.

138
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,160
What kind of reason is that?

139
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,060
He still has me, doesn't he?

140
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,990
Of course.

141
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,040
Minato, you're Itsuki-san's family.

142
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,750
But...

143
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,700
if you can live with the person you love,

144
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,060
anyone would be happy, right?

145
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,810
That's just your way of seeing things.

146
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,630
I've never even thought about living with anyone.

147
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,920
And I never will.

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,110
And my packing is perfect.

149
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,400
Wow, I'm so excited.

150
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,660
Perfect? Hardly.

151
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,950
Your room is such a mess.

152
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,760
Are you planning to just go and leave it like this?

153
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,090
Because,

154
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,800
you told me

155
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,010
to just take what I need for now.

156
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Hello.

157
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, Itsuki-san.

158
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,850
Are you Shohei's mother?

159
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,780
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Mito Itsuki.

160
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,320
Hello, welcome.

161
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm Shohei's mother.

162
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,000
Thank you for having him.

163
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,570
Not at all.

164
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,310
You're here early, Itsuki-san.

165
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,960
I was wondering if there was anything
I could do to help.

166
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,080
No, I'm all set.

167
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,040
My luggage is all packed right there.

168
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,720
That's it?

169
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Yes.

170
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,140
What about your school supplies

171
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,250
and all that? Did you pack them properly?

172
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,140
Probably not.

173
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,020
There's no need to rush.

174
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,080
No, I'd feel bad making you wait.

175
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
It's fine.

176
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
Shohei's move today

177
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,190
is the top priority.

178
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,300
Thank you.

179
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Hey.

180
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,970
So they really are...

181
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,090
Yeah...

182
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,850
Hm?

183
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,050
Alright.

184
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,230
Nevermind.

185
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,990
- Bro, can you give me a hand?
- Sure.

186
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,620
I know you're busy,

187
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,990
so thank you for coming all this way

188
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,510
to help out.

189
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,530
Not at all. Today is an important day.

190
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,770
Um...

191
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Shohei...

192
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,020
He's not very good at doing laundry or tidying up.

193
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,520
Are you sure this is okay?

194
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Of course.

195
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,910
We've agreed to do the chores together from now on.

196
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,920
Besides, I have a lot of trust...

197
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,070
- in Shohei.
- Trust?

198
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,550
Yes.

199
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,980
Because I've seen how upright and honest Shohei is.

200
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,240
If I'm with him...

201
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,980
Sorry for the wait.

202
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,770
Now this is perfect.

203
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,660
Is something wrong?

204
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
No.

205
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,630
Nothing's wrong.

206
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,230
Well then...

207
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,810
- Let me get this suitcase.
- Okay, thanks.

208
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,450
Mom, I'm sorry.

209
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,930
I'll come back to clean my room.

210
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,800
You can clean your room anytime.

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,430
Don't cause Itsuki-san any trouble, okay?

212
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,520
Do your best, okay?

213
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Yeah.

214
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Thank you.

215
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,870
I'll leave him in your care then.

216
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,150
Bye now.

217
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,530
Let's go.

218
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,820
He said he thinks Sho-chan

219
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,080
is an upright and honest guy,

220
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,370
so he trusts him.

221
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,030
After he said that,

222
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,660
there was nothing left for me to say.

223
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,410
I guess you're right.

224
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,160
But that kid will be fine.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
(Minato: Come over.)

226
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
Come on in.

227
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,940
Make yourself at home.

228
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,940
Thanks for having me.

229
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,390
I'm looking forward to living with you.

230
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,210
Okay, same here.

231
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,910
I can't believe I get to live
with my favorite person, Itsuki-san.

232
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,500
It feels like a dream.

233
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,660
This is a total miracle.

234
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,070
I'm so happy.

235
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,670
Me too.

236
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
So...

237
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,760
what should we do first?

238
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,330
Want to have some tea?

239
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,820
Or unpack?

240
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,010
Or...

241
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,860
I'm going to unpack.

242
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,220
Will you...

243
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,790
be lonely?

244
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,070
No, not at all.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm an adult now.

246
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Are you sure?

247
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Well...

248
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,920
seeing the look on my mom's face,

249
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,520
I did feel a little sad.

250
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,190
I was surprised she cried. I didn't expect that.

251
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,110
But...

252
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,260
today is our very first day living together.

253
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,570
I'm only thinking about you, Itsuki-san.

254
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,790
Our first day, huh?

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
In that case, today...

256
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,930
I'll only think about you too, Sho-chan.

257
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,580
Awesome!

258
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,420
By the way, Shohei,

259
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,080
how do you want to spend the day?

260
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,110
Huh?

261
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,510
What do you want to do?

262
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,130
Um...

263
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
"Moving-in soba."

264
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,020
I've always wanted to try that.

265
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Good idea.

266
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,910
Let's have soba for dinner then.

267
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,110
Anything else...

268
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
that you wanted to do...?

269
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,920
Isn't it obvious?

270
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,820
I really want to be with you.

271
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Don't you

272
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,610
have something you need to do?

273
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,590
Not at all.

274
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,460
You must be tired from helping with the move.

275
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,040
Why don't you come to my place and get some rest?

276
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,780
I would like to get some rest.

277
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,050
But is that really okay?

278
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,870
Yeah.

279
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,350
Then...

280
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,750
how about we grab something at the convenience store

281
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,010
and watch a movie at my place?

282
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,000
That sounds good, but...

283
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,850
you seem like the type to watch animal documentaries.

284
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,410
Huh? What's wrong with that?

285
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,590
Then we can watch whatever you want, Minato.

286
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,450
Okay.

287
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,030
Hey.

288
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,450
Stay at my place tonight.

289
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,660
I...

290
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,950
don't want you to go home, Shizuma.

291
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Okay.

292
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,530
So, what should we watch?

293
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,110
Hmm...

294
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,390
What would be good?

295
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,150
It's my phone.

296
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Sorry, one second.

297
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
(Incoming call from Yuka)

298
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Aren't you going to answer?

299
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,410
Huh?

300
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,410
Yeah.

301
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,040
- Hello?
- Shizuma, help!

302
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,850
I'm in the cowshed. Yuki is going into labor.

303
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,800
But... delivering a calf...
the breeding team knows more about this than I do...

304
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,510
I can't get a hold of anyone.

305
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,060
The professor is at a conference.

306
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,310
And Chikazawa is useless.

307
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,390
You're the only one I can count on. Please, hurry.

308
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,930
I'm a little busy right now...

309
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,550
Go.

310
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But...

311
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,580
Yuka can't handle it by herself, can she?

312
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
I get it.

313
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,500
I'm on my way. Get things ready in the meantime.

314
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Sorry.

315
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,450
I'll be back as soon as I'm done.

316
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,790
It's fine.

317
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Just hurry and go.

318
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,760
You're drunk? That's rare for you.

319
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,840
Hey, so did you break up with that straight guy?

320
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,700
What "break up"?

321
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,070
We weren't even dating.

322
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,980
That's a shame. He was really hot, wasn't he?

323
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,290
Can we please drop it?

324
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,950
I'm just here to party tonight.

325
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,000
You're right.

326
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,080
Forget that straight guy.

327
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,490
Let's just have fun!

328
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,510
Let's drink to that!

329
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,180
Hey, let's get more drinks!

330
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,500
That's one option.

331
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,450
But shouldn't we find a new spot?

332
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,940
Why don't...

333
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,980
the three of us go have some fun together?

334
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
No, thanks.

335
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,990
Minato.

336
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,190
Let's go home.

337
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
No.

338
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm staying with them tonight.

339
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Well then...

340
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,720
since it's a rare occasion,

341
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,160
why don't the four of us have some fun tonight?

342
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,490
If you dare...

343
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,770
lay a hand on Shizuma,

344
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,870
I will make you regret it.

345
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Minato.

346
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
Minato!

347
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,170
Why do you always just disappear like that?

348
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,790
I was worried about you!

349
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,240
What were you talking to those guys about?

350
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,190
If there's something bothering you,

351
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,490
you can just tell me.

352
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,580
- Minato, wait!
- Keep your hands off me.

353
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,410
What are you so angry about?

354
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,470
I'm not.

355
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,770
I'm not angry at all.

356
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,110
Yes, you are.

357
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,890
Is it because I went to see Yuka?

358
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,570
- Of course not!
- Are you sure about that?

359
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,790
- If you don't like it, just say so.
- And what good would that do?

360
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Shizuma...

361
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,550
seriously...

362
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,410
could you really have left that calf to die?

363
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,340
That's...

364
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,590
I'm not...

365
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,040
saying I wanted you to do that.

366
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,210
But...

367
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,180
But what?

368
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
I knew it. This isn't going to work.

369
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,850
What do you mean, "this isn't going to work"?

370
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,080
Do you really trust me that little?

371
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,070
Please...
just talk to me.

372
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,090
Shizuma...

373
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,520
there's no way you could understand how I feel.

374
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,280
Why do you always shut me out?

375
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,050
If things stay like this,

376
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,760
I'll never be able to truly reach you.

377
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,150
Let's just end this.

378
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,730
The game is over.

379
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,890
(Next Episode)
Shizuma...

380
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,500
He asked me to tell him about the town
where we grew up...

381
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,870
and then he disappeared.

382
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,960
- Shizuma.
- Minato.

383
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,270
Look at me! I'm standing right in front of you!

384
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,030
I want to make you mine, Shizuma. Right now.
