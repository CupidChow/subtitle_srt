1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,060
Hey.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,040
What's wrong with him?

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,300
He's been like that all week.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,250
It's less like he's studying...

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,900
and more like he's trying to clear his head.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,930
Oh yeah?

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,000
(Incoming call from Minato)

8
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,970
Hello?

9
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,220
You finally picked up.

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
It's been a while.

11
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,910
Shizuma.

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,550
What's the matter?

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,010
So cold.

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,090
You were so sweet to me before.

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,650
Are you still trying to mess with me?

16
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,720
That's not it.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,080
It's not what you think.

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,640
I wanted to apologize properly.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,480
For what I did.

20
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,010
It's in the past.

21
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,250
- If that's all, I'm hanging up.
- Wait.

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,010
I haven't...

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Please.

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,150
I'm begging you.

25
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,060
Just hearing your voice hurts.

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,870
Falling for you, believing you so easily...

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,670
I was like a fool being played.

28
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,380
Haven't you had your laugh?

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,020
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,880
I did make a bet.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,780
But I never wanted to make a fool out of you.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,130
When you were kind to me, I was genuinely happy.

33
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,220
I never intended to keep deceiving you.

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,010
Please, believe me on that.

35
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,030
Sorry.

36
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,850
I can't trust you anymore.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,500
(Call ended - Shizuma)

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,000
I brought this on myself.

39
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,610
I wanted to cherish him.

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
And yet...

41
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,010
I ruined it with my own hands.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,000
"Therapy Game"

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,000
(Episode 5)

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Bro.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,690
I'm talking to you...

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Oh.

47
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,990
Sorry, what is it?

48
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,620
Well...

49
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,330
This.

50
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,720
It was in the bag I lent you yesterday.

51
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Is it yours?

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,500
Uh, oh.

53
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,270
It's my friend's.

54
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,920
I thought so.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,390
It's not your style.

56
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,730
Here.

57
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,050
Thanks.

58
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,560
So by "revenge"...

59
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,540
you meant what happened that night.

60
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,320
What you did to me.

61
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,170
I won't just pretend it never happened.

62
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,550
That night...

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,030
what on earth happened?

64
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,330
Mom...

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Minato-chan...

66
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
No...

67
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,650
Don't go...

68
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,030
Minato?

69
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Bro.

70
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,060
Having that dream again?

71
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,130
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,090
For beling like that on your day off.

73
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,300
Don't be silly.

74
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,520
So you went there to hang out?

75
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,450
Yeah.

76
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,790
Really?

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,050
You used to hate it so much.

78
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,340
How was it?

79
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
Did you have fun?

80
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,010
Well...

81
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,070
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

82
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,380
But I'm not going back.

83
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,010
I see.

84
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,130
Then this...

85
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,800
- Shohei said he wants to go. Can I have it?
- No.

86
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,310
Hey,

87
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,690
I've noticed something.

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
What?

89
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,030
Minato.

90
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,130
You're in love, aren't you?

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Are you okay?

92
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,430
I'm fine.

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,680
Anyway, bro.

94
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,330
What kind of joke is that?

95
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,140
It's not...

96
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
funny at all.

97
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,010
Stop making that face.

98
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,080
But, looking at you now...

99
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm guessing it's not going well?

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
It's over.

101
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,260
Because I hurt him.

102
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,030
But it's for the best.

103
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,290
I've had my fun.

104
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,420
This is where it ends.

105
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,040
Nothing good ever comes from
getting involved with people.

106
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,580
I almost forgot.

107
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,340
I told you that's a bad way to think.

108
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,820
- Not everyone is like them.
- I know that.

109
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,380
But I'm scared.

110
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,790
Once I admit I like someone...

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,510
what will I do when I lose them?

112
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,230
What if I get hurt so badly that the pain is unbearable?

113
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,950
So you just don't let anyone in?

114
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,950
As long as I have you, bro, that's all I need.

115
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,060
Can I sleep a little more?

116
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,460
Of course.

117
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,450
Get some rest.

118
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,950
He has a cold?

119
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,050
- Minato?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,420
I heard he got caught in the rain the day before yesterday.

121
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,460
And has been sick in bed ever since.

122
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,420
The day before yesterday...

123
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,150
I never intended to keep deceiving you.

124
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,020
Please, believe me on that.

125
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,830
What do you want with him?

126
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,550
- If you have a complaint, take it up with me.
- It's not like that.

127
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,900
It's about the night I first met Minato.

128
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,650
I wanted to ask you about it.

129
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
About that night?

130
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,030
If I really did something
that made him want to get revenge...

131
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,520
then I can't blame him anymore.

132
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,760
That kid...

133
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,870
he's especially harsh with people he's just met.

134
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,300
If anyone tries to hit on him,

135
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,630
he'll chase them off like he's about to throw a punch.

136
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,300
But with you, it was different.

137
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,450
Different?

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
That's right.

139
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,550
You were drinking next to him,

140
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,540
and you suddenly started comforting him.

141
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,850
I thought he'd get mad,

142
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,010
but he actually seemed to be enjoying it.

143
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,070
I don't know what was so funny,

144
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,130
but he just quietly listened to you ramble on,
drunk as a skunk.

145
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,780
I'd never seen him like that before.

146
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,420
I don't know what happened after you left the bar.

147
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
But the next morning,

148
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,500
he said you'd forgotten everything that happened.

149
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,440
He seemed devastated.

150
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,130
That's all I know.

151
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,820
- I'm not sure if that answers your question.
- Um...

152
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,230
Minato's address...

153
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,620
could you please tell me?

154
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,130
It's not that I've sorted out my feelings.

155
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
But...

156
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,550
he lives alone, and I'm worried.

157
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,150
I'll just drop off some food...

158
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,040
and this, and then I'll leave.

159
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,950
Hello?

160
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,000
Can I help you?

161
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Oh.

162
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
Could you be...?

163
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,120
Are you here for our Minato?

164
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
(Take care)

165
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,490
I thought I'd lost this.

166
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
(Incoming call from Minato)

167
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,210
You're awake?

168
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Bro.

169
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,710
- Did Shizuma come by?
- Shizuma?

170
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,090
Oh, so the guy who came to see you is named Shizuma.

171
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,960
Huh? What did he say?

172
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,290
He said he was returning something
you'd left at his place.

173
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,720
Oh, but...

174
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,400
I think I might have given him the wrong idea.

175
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,460
He left in a hurry, looking pretty flustered.

176
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,210
The wrong idea...?

177
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,390
You did tell him, right?

178
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,520
That you're my brother?

179
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,170
I didn't.

180
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,340
Because, Minato,

181
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,710
aren't you afraid of getting involved with people?

182
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,490
Isn't this what you wanted?

183
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,340
I was hoping this would make you
be more honest with yourself.

184
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,190
Minato-san...

185
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,870
Um...

186
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,510
That man who was just here, Shizuma...

187
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,730
Yes.

188
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,390
Minato's boyfriend came to see him.

189
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Um...

190
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,810
My brother's name...

191
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,870
is also Shizuma.

192
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Huh?

193
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,430
Minato.

194
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,510
What a beautiful day.

195
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,900
This park is nice, isn't it?

196
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,500
Why do I have to meet that guy's brother?

197
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm the one who took care of you when you were sick.

198
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,850
- Just come with me, please.
- Such a pain...

199
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,350
You just got over a bad cold.

200
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,330
Oh, there he is.

201
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,230
Sorry for the wait.

202
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,240
- Why?
- Why?

203
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,570
So, where should we go next?

204
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,560
We can go wherever you want, Shohei.

205
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,000
Hmm...

206
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,580
Well then, I want to...

207
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,290
I want to go wherever you want to go, Itsuki-san.

208
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,050
Oh, you.

209
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,070
When did you find out?

210
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,500
The same time you did.

211
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,310
Just now.

212
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,770
Oh.

213
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,070
I heard you came to visit me the other day.

214
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,510
Oh.

215
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,390
Your brother was there.

216
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,810
My brother?

217
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Yeah.

218
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,540
He said he's your brother.

219
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,620
- And he said you were asleep.
- What?

220
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Minato-san.

221
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,750
Let's go get something to eat.

222
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Huh?

223
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,320
We're both the younger brothers here.

224
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,140
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey, wait.

225
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,590
Shizuma.

226
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Have a seat.

227
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,450
Oh.

228
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,530
Okay.

229
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,060
About your visit the other day...

230
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
Thank you.

231
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,890
Of course.

232
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,090
The reason he got sick...

233
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,420
It might have been my fault.

234
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,420
That's not true at all.

235
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,080
You took him out on that date, didn't you?

236
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,560
It wasn't so much me taking him...

237
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,840
as it was him keeping me company.

238
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,710
He was so grumpy at first.

239
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,070
I can imagine.

240
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,960
Minato's world...

241
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,810
has been very small since he was a child.

242
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,550
I've always wanted him to see more of the world,

243
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,730
but he's so timid.

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
About the bet...

245
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,420
You have every right to be angry.

246
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
But...

247
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,940
The Minato you were with, Shizuma...

248
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,040
Was all of that really a lie?

249
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm sorry...

250
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,510
You know...

251
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Shizuma.

252
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
I...

253
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,600
I'm sure some of it was real.

254
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
My brother...

255
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,420
has been really down.

256
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,060
It's not over between you two.

257
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,060
- But he said he can't trust me anymore.
- Seriously?

258
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,880
You're just going to back down
because he pushed you away once?

259
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,560
That's not like you at all.

260
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,870
I'm not backing down.

261
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,920
Right? Good.

262
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,610
Shohei.

263
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,440
- You've got some cream on you.
- Huh? Where?

264
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Right here.

265
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,530
I'm going to get us some drinks.

266
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,210
So cute. Should we take a picture together?

267
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,120
Yeah, let's. We should ask someone to take it.

268
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Oh, here comes someone.

269
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,970
Oh, excuse me?

270
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,500
Would you mind taking a picture for us?

271
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,900
Oh, sure.

272
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,110
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

273
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,980
Okay, get a little closer.

274
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,100
Okay, I'll take a few.

275
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,560
Three, two, one.

276
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,050
Three, two, one.

277
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,380
- I think these came out great.
- Thank you so much.

278
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,490
You're welcome.

279
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,870
- Wow, this is perfect!
- You like it?

280
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,390
- I love it. Thank you.
- Great. If you're not busy...

281
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,390
why don't you hang out with us?

282
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,980
- Oh, well...
- Or maybe get your number?

283
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,480
We could exchange numbers?

284
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,480
- No, thank you.
- This guy here...

285
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,420
- He's mine.
- Huh?

286
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,230
Can we go now?

287
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,270
Oh, okay... Um...

288
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,470
Never mind.

289
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,160
- Sorry about that.
- Let's go.

290
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Huh?

291
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
Hey.

292
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,120
I didn't know you could be so assertive.

293
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,850
Well, that's because you were wandering off.

294
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,050
Huh?

295
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,790
Well...

296
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,120
Thanks for walking me home.

297
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,690
Yeah.

298
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,070
Minato.

299
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,390
I need to properly apologize to you, too.

300
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,320
You've already apologized to me so many times.

301
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,980
It was wrong of me to push you away
without hearing you out.

302
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,650
You don't have to say you're sorry.

303
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,550
I want you to hold me.

304
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,280
We can skip the foreplay.

305
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
No.

306
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,550
Tonight, I want to make you feel good.

307
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Minato.

308
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
I love you.

309
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,450
Maybe if...

310
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,140
If I'm with Shizuma,

311
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,470
I can finally get past this.

312
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,880
(Next Episode) My internship finally
starts next week. Will I really be okay?

313
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,680
I didn't mean to fall for him.

314
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,800
But then you'd be lonely, wouldn't you, Minato-san?

315
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,030
Minato, you're not allowed to look at anyone else.

316
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm not going anywhere.
