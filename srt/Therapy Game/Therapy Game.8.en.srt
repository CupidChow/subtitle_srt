1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,320
Just like Itsuki-san said...

2
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,380
It's a beautiful town.

3
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,640
I wanted to know about the town
where Minato grew up.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Could you please tell me about it?

5
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,050
Why?

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,230
I want to go there and take some pictures.

7
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,750
He mentioned before...

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,040
that he can't remember
what his childhood home looked like.

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,190
I see.

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,420
He had this pained look on his face...

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,070
saying he couldn't...

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,860
bring himself to go near that town.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,280
He seemed so sad,
and it's been on my mind ever since.

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,090
So I thought I'd go see it for him.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
That's a wonderful idea.

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,750
Hold on a second.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,420
In that case, this...

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,480
I'd like you to hold onto it for now.

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,820
A standalone house by the sea.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,680
The attic there...

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,000
was Minato's favorite place.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,070
It's a really beautiful town.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,670
It really is.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,700
"Therapy Game"

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
(Episode 8)

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,530
I was wondering what this place would be like.

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
It's even more beautiful...

28
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,720
than I ever imagined.

29
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,670
Let's check out the beach.

30
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,900
(Phone battery below 3%.
Shutting down soon.)

31
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,920
Oh, crap! Is there a convenience store?

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
(Call from Itsuki)

33
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,410
What's up?

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,680
You finally picked up.

35
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,710
I've been trying to call you since yesterday.

36
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,030
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

37
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,770
Shizuma...

38
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,430
He came to my place.

39
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,060
Are you just going to keep avoiding him?

40
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,990
Listen, Minato.

41
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,900
Isolating yourself because you're scared of
getting hurt is just foolish.

42
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,200
I know what it's like to be afraid of getting close to people.

43
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,810
But you know...

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,520
if you just take that first step...

45
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,800
you'll realize it's not a big deal at all.

46
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,080
There's no need to be scared.

47
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,110
It'll be more freeing...

48
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,080
than you can possibly imagine.

49
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,110
I want to, I really do...

50
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,280
but I just can't be like you.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Shizuma came to see me.

52
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,410
He wanted to know about the town
where we grew up.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
What?

54
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,350
The reason for that...

55
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,310
you of all people should know, right?

56
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,490
Shizuma...

57
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,300
hasn't given up on you yet.

58
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,970
I bet right now...

59
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,260
he's in that town.

60
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Huh?

61
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,700
Since when was my little brother such a wimp?

62
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
Bro...

63
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,700
If I mess up again...

64
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,060
will you be there to comfort me?

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
What are you talking about?

66
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,470
You're the brother I'm most proud of.

67
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,620
There's no way you'll fail.

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,130
Everything will be fine.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,740
You have to believe in yourself.

70
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,030
Thanks.

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,050
Bro.

72
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,190
Why couldn't I understand him back then?

73
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,800
From the very beginning...

74
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,320
he was always suffering.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Mom, I found a seashell!

76
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,610
You did?

77
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,910
Wow.

78
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,790
You really did.

79
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,770
Our family...

80
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,460
used to be just a normal, happy family.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Yeah.

82
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,190
But...

83
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,890
when Minato was still in elementary school...

84
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,640
our father started seeing another man.

85
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,050
After that...

86
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,030
Dad ran away with him.

87
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,760
Our mother had a nervous breakdown and killed herself.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,800
In a small town like this, it became a huge scandal.

89
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,730
After that...

90
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,510
our father's body was found.

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,980
Apparently, his lover was a con artist
who was just after his money,

92
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,090
and then killed him.

93
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,760
Before our mom took her own life...

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,970
she would often take her anger out on us.

95
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,770
Minato was just a little kid back then.

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,800
It was truly agonizing for him.

97
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
This place...

98
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,750
it's so beautiful.

99
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,510
You know this place?

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
It's dead.

101
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,030
It's okay.

102
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,380
Shizuma is here.

103
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,600
The number you have dialed...

104
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,780
is currently out of the service area.

105
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,220
No way.

106
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,560
The number you have dialed...

107
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,830
- Hello?
- Shohei.

108
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,540
Shizuma won't answer his phone.

109
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
You must have heard where he went, right?

110
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,070
I have no idea.

111
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,030
Hold on, I'm gonna hang up for a sec.

112
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Huh?

113
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,460
Shizuma...

114
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,030
- I heard he's unreachable.
- What?

115
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,710
You're the guy who returned his student ID, right?

116
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,160
You're the one from back then...

117
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,780
- Yep.
- Speakerphone, put it on speaker.

118
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,290
Um...

119
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,880
No matter what, I need to
see Shizuma and talk to him.

120
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,610
That's why I followed him to Miura.

121
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,130
But I can't get through to his phone.

122
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,590
If you know anything, please tell me.

123
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,170
What are you going to do when you see him?

124
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,850
I don't care if he ends up hating me.

125
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,450
I want to face him with everything I've got.

126
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Please...

127
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,830
How long are you going to be a jerk about this?

128
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,670
Sorry about that.

129
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,190
We were worried too. He's been...

130
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,070
in a really bad mood lately.

131
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,010
Ah, but...

132
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,180
all we heard today...

133
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,300
was that he wasn't coming to school.

134
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,980
I found him.

135
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,810
I hadn't deleted the location-sharing app.

136
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,560
I can only see his last location
before his phone died, though.

137
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,540
Think of this as me repaying you
for helping with the calf birth.

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Huh?

139
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,540
Even though you two had plans...

140
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,490
you said it was okay
and let him come find me.

141
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,300
Right?

142
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,850
That's what Shizuma told me.

143
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
Ah.

144
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,330
Found it.

145
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,750
His last location was...

146
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,760
at 2:24 PM.

147
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,400
Enami Pebble Beach.

148
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,670
Somewhere around there.

149
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,020
Enami Pebble Beach?

150
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,870
I heard the temperature drops around there at night.

151
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,050
You should be careful.

152
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,710
Thank you.

153
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,970
This helps a lot.

154
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Shizuma...

155
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,290
That's all I can do to help.

156
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,130
Right.

157
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,850
By the way,

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,020
why wouldn't you delete the app after you broke up?

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,000
People will think you're creepy.

160
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,510
Sorry, I totally forgot about it.

161
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,850
I'll delete it now.

162
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
Shizuma!

163
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Minato?

164
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
Hey, why are you here...?

165
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't mind...

166
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,860
But why are you here?

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,070
Why wouldn't you answer your phone?

168
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Sorry.

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,480
- What are you doing in a place like this?
- Ouch, that hurts!

170
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,830
I came all this way to find you.

171
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,360
Minato...

172
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,390
Damn it.

173
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,620
You shouldn't make people worry like that...

174
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,270
You came to find me?

175
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,330
Yeah.

176
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,900
This must be hard for you.

177
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,350
Coming here.

178
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,710
It is hard.

179
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,830
But I found you.

180
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,060
I wanted to understand why
you said what you did back then.

182
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,660
The only thing I could do...

183
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,400
was come here myself.

184
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
Yeah.

185
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,640
You didn't give up on me.

186
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,390
Thank you.

187
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Hey.

188
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,800
By the way, how did you know I was at the beach?

189
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,400
Yuka found you.

190
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Yuka...

191
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,210
The location-sharing app.

192
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,880
She never deleted it.

193
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,150
Tatsumi and...

194
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,190
someone else helped too.

195
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,070
You and Tatsumi?

196
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Huh?

197
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,370
And Chikazawa.

198
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,320
Never mind all that.

199
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,010
I just really wanted to see you.

200
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
This...

201
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,790
Itsuki lent it to me.

202
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,970
The keys to my family's house.

203
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,710
He said he kept it because it's full of family memories.

204
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,070
He couldn't bring himself to sell it,
so he's been maintaining it.

205
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,730
Brother...

206
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,540
If you don't want to go back, you don't have to.

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,820
We can always do this another time.

208
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,150
I...

209
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,450
Let's go.

210
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,100
I want to go with you.

211
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
This road...

212
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,960
My brother and I used to walk down it all the time.

213
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,430
Back in elementary school?

214
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Yeah.

215
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,780
I had piano lessons down the street,

216
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,160
and my brother would always come and get me.

217
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,950
Oh, so you play the piano?

218
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,720
Just a little.

219
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,580
My mom liked it.

220
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,530
She always made such a big deal out of my recitals.

221
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,940
I'd only play a simple piece,

222
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,280
but she'd show up with this huge bouquet of flowers

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
for me.

224
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,360
It was so embarrassing.

225
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
But...

226
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,240
I was actually really happy.

227
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,830
I was so proud of my beautiful mom.

228
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,030
Yeah.

229
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,250
My dad was gentle back then, too.

230
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,010
But...

231
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,400
he's the reason our family fell apart.

232
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,860
And while I hated him for abandoning us...

233
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,830
it was my mom, who completely lost it after he left,

234
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,950
that I was truly afraid of.

235
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,020
Even now, I can still picture
my mom's face, twisted with jealousy.

236
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,810
Does falling in love with someone...

237
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,890
turn you into that?

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,440
I couldn't help but wonder.

239
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
We're here.

240
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,570
Are you okay?

241
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,620
So nostalgic.

242
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,060
It's been over ten years,

243
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,820
but it looks exactly the same.

244
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
It's so spacious.

245
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,330
Right?

246
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,770
It's a loft.

247
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,940
This was your favorite place.

248
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,690
That's what Itsuki said.

249
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,970
It's just as I remember.

250
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,910
Was it always this small?

251
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,180
I can't believe I had a secret hideout like this as a kid.

252
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,970
My brother and I would hang out here every night.

253
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,390
It was cramped and dusty,

254
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,560
so my mom would never come up.

255
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,010
But blood ties are a scary thing.

256
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,050
When I look in the mirror,

257
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,570
I look just like my mother.

258
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,250
Just like that face, twisted with jealousy.

259
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,000
Getting betrayed hurts,

260
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,800
but hurting someone you care about...

261
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,350
that's what scares me most.

262
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,730
You only get betrayed because
you expect things from people.

263
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,540
If that's the case, then from the start,

264
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,160
all this stuff about love and affection...

265
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,060
isn't it better to just not believe in any of it?

266
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,650
That's the messed-up way I've lived my life.

267
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,630
Hey, Minato.

268
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
This house...

269
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,620
Do you know why Itsuki

270
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
never sold it?

271
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,400
No, I don't.

272
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,940
He said that no matter what happened in the past,

273
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,300
this was the precious home he shared
with you.

274
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,550
That's why he couldn't bring himself to sell it.

275
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,380
He worked so hard

276
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,130
for this house.

277
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,870
He told me that with a smile on his face.

278
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,240
He never told me any of that.

279
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,150
Oh.

280
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,500
And there's this.

281
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,660
- Please, you have to believe in Minato-chan.
- That's right.

282
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm begging you, please believe in Minato-chan.

283
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,600
To get you to believe in Minato-chan...

284
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,120
I shaved my head.

285
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,050
Me too... I'll do anything.

286
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,490
- Please believe in him.
- I mean it.

287
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,060
Me too.

288
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,680
The guy actually shaved his head.

289
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,360
Just hurry up and open your shop already.

290
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,750
Why would they go so far for me...?

291
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,210
Because everyone truly loves you.

292
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,030
You're cherished by so many people.

293
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,430
Don't you think

294
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,070
you should start valuing yourself more?

295
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,890
What happened in the past

296
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,060
doesn't determine your future.

297
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,580
The only one who can

298
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,400
is the you right now.

299
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,560
The me...

300
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,050
right now?

301
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,020
I've made more mistakes than I can stand myself.

302
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,150
And I hurt you deeply.

303
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
That's why

304
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,220
I don't want to make the same mistakes again.

305
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,050
What about you?

306
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,090
Do you want to be with me?

307
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,020
Or not?

308
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,020
Of course I want to be with you.

309
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
But...

310
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,090
If that's how you feel,

311
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,080
then look at the man standing in front of you.

312
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
I love you,

313
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Minato.

314
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,490
I want to know you better.

315
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,660
I want to be with you.

316
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,520
I want to make you happy.

317
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,720
No, it's cold.

318
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,970
Don't.

319
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
Don't you run away.

320
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,170
Decide.

321
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,250
I promise you won't regret it.

322
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,900
Choose me.

323
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,460
I've made my decision.

324
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,320
With everything you said...

325
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,720
I believe you.

326
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Minato.

327
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,610
- We can't, Minato...
- I want to.

328
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,010
I want to be yours, right now.

329
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,030
(Next Episode)
Before I knew it, Shizuma was there.

330
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,410
With him, I thought everything would be okay.

331
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,390
Just your gaze,

332
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
just your touch...

333
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,000
is enough to make me feel so complete.

334
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,770
I'm holding nothing back.

335
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,350
You'd better treasure me.
