00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,180
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,950
But

4
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,830
that woman is quite pitiful,

5
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,470
for she completely depends on my boyfriend
for her livelihood.

6
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,240
Can you still find such people these days?

7
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,720
She acts so proud,

8
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,990
but deep down she knows that

9
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,990
without my boyfriend,

10
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,350
she'd be nothing,

11
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,550
have nothing.

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,680
You know,

13
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,410
how could she dare to leave?

14
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,650
It's simple.

15
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,750
As long as you two get married,

16
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
she'll give up.

17
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,600
It's not like

18
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,040
she'd go become the other woman.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,350
In this day and age,

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,840
being the other woman is very costly.

21
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,230
Once it's out on the internet,

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
oh my god, her reputation is ruined,

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,560
and it'll be hard for her to find a job.

24
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,120
So it's better if you get married soon.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,190
Marriage is just a certificate,

26
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,630
I'm not that concerned about it.

27
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,190
After all, my boyfriend can't live without me.

28
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,890
That's good.

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,900
Actually, my boyfriend likes me

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,620
not just because

31
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,860
we support each other at work.

32
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,980
It's more because we connect.

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
That woman,

34
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,420
she just has a fling with my boyfriend,

35
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,660
but she doesn't understand

36
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,020
or feel the pain he's going through.

37
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,940
So every time my boyfriend's at his lowest,

38
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,340
he always comes to find me first.

39
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,620
I think

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,420
we're true soulmates.

41
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,580
Ms. Ning, do you know?

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,580
My last birthday with my boyfriend

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,740
- (Honey, I've arrived.)
- was so romantic.

44
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,820
He gave

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,300
me a unique gift.

46
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,100
Wait.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,140
Waiter,

48
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,710
we want

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,350
one more set of tableware, thank you.

50
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,060
Isn't Director Qin not coming?

51
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,420
It's not him.

52
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,220
Honey,

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,140
over here.

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,340
Honey.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,460
Sit.

56
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,060
Manager Tian.

57
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,590
Mr. Hu.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Honey,

59
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,940
is Manager Tian is in charge of
your new project?

60
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,340
Manager Tian takes good care of me

61
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,380
and even treated me to a meal.

62
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,860
You're paying the check.

63
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,900
Honey,

64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,740
it's surely on me.

65
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,340
What were you two talking about?

66
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,780
About her boyfriend.

67
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,660
Manager Tian said

68
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,980
her boyfriend

69
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,380
is an entrepreneur like you.

70
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,660
Not as good as Mr. Hu.

71
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,380
And Manager Tian is quite impressive.

72
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,700
She said

73
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,180
whether it's love

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,340
or work,

75
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,020
she keeps her boyfriend

76
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,660
wrapped around her finger.

77
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
So...

78
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,540
her boyfriend can't live without her.

79
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,940
For real?

80
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,860
Yes.

81
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,180
Manger Tian,

82
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,860
you're very good to your boyfriend,

83
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,660
so he…

84
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,340
must be very happy, right?

85
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,620
Not as happy as you and Ms. Ning.

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,180
You two are the perfect match,

87
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,980
respectful and loving,

88
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
making people envious.

89
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,540
Manager Tian also told me

90
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,580
her boyfriend is really romantic

91
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,160
and gave her

92
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,000
a unique gift.

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,340
Honey, doesn't that sound just like you?

94
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,820
A few days ago,

95
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
my husband

96
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,460
also gave me a gift.

97
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,460
A hotel membership card.

98
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,020
The password is your birthday.

99
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,580
I really love this place.

100
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,300
I hope we can

101
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,860
create our memories here.

102
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,460
I hope when you come back here next time,

103
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,820
you'll only

104
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,220
think of me.

105
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,340
This card

106
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,940
is very special to me,

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,740
because this hotel

108
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,340
means a lot to us.

109
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,900
Mr. Hu, you're really romantic.

110
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,860
What's so romantic about him?

111
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,260
He doesn't understand romance.

112
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,540
But there's no perfect person

113
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,100
in this world, right?

114
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,220
As long as we love each other,

115
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,380
and we can tolerate

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,940
and understand each other's flaws,

117
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,580
we can overcome

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,100
any problems.

119
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,900
After all,

120
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,420
we're one, aren't we?

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,420
She also said that

122
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,700
she and her boyfriend

123
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,180
are soulmates,

124
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,660
truly in sync.

125
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,780
I've always wanted to ask you, honey,

126
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,180
what about us?

127
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,180
Are we soulmates?

128
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,980
Us?

129
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,420
We…

130
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,340
of course, we…

131
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,180
Mr. Hu,

132
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,500
Ms. Ning,

133
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,060
it occurs to me

134
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,620
that I have a case to be wrapped up.

135
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,100
Excuse me.

136
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,500
She has left.

137
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,420
What are you looking at?

138
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,900
Honey,

139
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,420
I think you've changed.

140
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,500
You didn't used to

141
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,380
show off your love in public.

142
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,580
She is right in front me.

143
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
If I don't change,

144
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,070
what am I waiting for?

145
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,540
Honey,

146
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,420
are you misunderstanding something?

147
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,060
Was her boyfriend you?

148
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,180
What are you talking about?

149
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,020
That's nonsense.

150
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,220
Absolute nonsense.

151
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,940
Then why did she react so strongly?

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,860
Is that hotel membership card

153
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,460
from you?

154
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,500
Of course not.

155
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,460
What did you...

156
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,340
talk about just now?

157
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,900
That's not your concern.

158
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,380
I want to hear what you have to say.

159
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,300
Manager Tian and me,

160
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,060
we're merely business partner.

161
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,300
If…

162
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,220
I said something wrong
at business dinner,

163
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,700
I don't even remember.

164
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,060
It doesn't matter.

165
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,820
But if she misunderstood,

166
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,940
that's on her.

167
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,860
Honey, how about this?

168
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,940
I'll talk to the people

169
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
at Ruixin Investment Bank

170
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,980
and ask them to switch out the manager

171
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,180
for a guy.

172
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,460
That should put your mind at ease, right?

173
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,140
Honey,

174
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,820
why don't you trust me?

175
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,060
You're judging me

176
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,260
because of something

177
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,700
an outsider said.

178
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,780
Are you really not believing me?

179
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,180
Honey,

180
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,900
when did you

181
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,220
stop trusting me?

182
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,460
Since you started hiding things from me.

183
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,300
Honey,

184
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,060
I'm going to sleep with Hu Ziyuan.

185
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,700
What are you doing?

186
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,540
Stop overthinking it, okay?

187
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,300
I'm your husband, your family,

188
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,660
the closest person to you.

189
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,820
How could I hurt you?

190
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,140
Sometimes men have to socialize,

191
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,700
that's unavoidable.

192
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,020
And you're so righteous about it.

193
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm downstairs.

194
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,380
Why did you go find her?

195
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,100
What do you want?

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Forget it.

197
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,780
No point in arguing.

198
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,270
We should focus on solving the problem now.

199
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
What kind of problem?

200
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,260
She hasn't gotten any solid proof yet.

201
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,660
As long as I don't admit it,

202
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,420
she can't do anything.

203
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,300
So you're always going to

204
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,260
keep me hidden, right?

205
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,260
Do you have any friends

206
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,860
in Ruixin Investment Bank

207
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,180
who could help me out?

208
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,540
Preferably a male.

209
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,980
You'll have to lay low for a while.

210
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,820
Once she gets past this,

211
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,340
I'll come back to you.

212
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,540
Don't worry,

213
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,820
I won't treat you badly at work.

214
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Please find a new male manager.

215
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,460
Hu Cheng,

216
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,860
she already knows.

217
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,060
Yeah, she does.

218
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,780
So we should figure out a solution.

219
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,860
To solve what?

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,260
Go back to the way things were?

221
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,860
What's your purpose inviting her
to dinner today?

222
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,100
Just because I didn't go
to see your grandmother?

223
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,380
Qiuzi,

224
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,540
I've always thought

225
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,940
you were a strong person inside.

226
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,180
I always thought you were so open about it

227
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,580
because you're not afraid of your wife.

228
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,540
If you came here to argue,

229
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,460
then let's not talk anymore.

230
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,380
I know you're feeling bad,

231
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,260
but my pressure is even greater than yours.

232
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,600
You know,

233
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,620
after all, the path we've chosen

234
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
is much harder than most people's.

235
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,180
Let's stop hurting each other, alright?

236
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,180
It's getting late now.

237
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,420
Why don't you

238
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,260
head back now?

239
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,860
I'll meet you,

240
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,300
tomorrow, or this weekend.

241
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,820
We can talk these through.

242
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,940
You can't leave her, right?

243
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,380
Is that even a question?

244
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,620
I think

245
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,420
we reached an agreement a long time ago.

246
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,940
I didn't ask you before

247
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,060
because I thought you didn't care.

248
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,860
I thought your wife

249
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,060
is not important in your family,

250
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,860
who you'd never really care about.

251
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,780
So, you do care, right?

252
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,140
Like just now,

253
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,620
you were still protecting her.

254
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,380
When she's around, I'm nothing.

255
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,900
Or what. What else can I do?

256
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,660
What should I do back then?

257
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,540
If you didn't bring her,

258
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,740
nothing would've happened.

259
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,140
When you're weak

260
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,460
and indecisive,

261
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,580
you come to me.

262
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm happy about that.

263
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,900
I always thought you were mine.

264
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,380
But in reality,

265
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,500
I am no match for her, aren't I?

266
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,060
I can share in your misfortunes,

267
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,780
but I'll never

268
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,540
be the clown that highlights your happiness.

269
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,740
What exactly do you want to say?

270
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm not afraid of fighting,

271
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,140
of competing.

272
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,580
No matter how embarrassing the process is,
I don't care.

273
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,220
But in the end,

274
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,220
I want to have you all to myself.

275
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,380
Let me ask you one more time.

276
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,620
Have you ever considered

277
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,500
leaving her?

278
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,260
Are you threatening me?

279
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,860
Do you remember

280
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,100
what I said

281
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,660
the last time we argued?

282
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,420
Don't say things

283
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,100
you'll regret.

284
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,860
I won't regret it.

285
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,460
I hate

286
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,180
being threatened by others.

287
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,540
This isn't a threat.

288
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,740
I used to think

289
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,980
we could understand each other.

290
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,220
I used to think

291
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,140
you'd always stand in my shoes.

292
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,660
And I knew you'd never betray me.

293
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,260
Manager Tian,

294
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,220
I think this is very unprofessional of you.

295
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,860
I can't work with you anymore.

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,100
Also,

297
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,340
please don't disturb me

298
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,460
and my family again.

299
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,380
I've already fired her.

300
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,260
Are you satisfied now?

301
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,740
Go back to bed.

302
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,740
(Behind a perfect marriage)

303
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,260
(might be one lie after another.)

304
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,740
(Just like one dream after another)

305
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,820
(from which one
doesn't want to wake up.)

306
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,640
(When the dream ends,)

307
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,940
(the beautiful life is shattered.)

308
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,860
(Do we continue with more lies)

309
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,220
(or rebuild from the ruins?)

310
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,000
- Honey.
- Ziyuan.

311
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,620
Have you finished eating?

312
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,140
We need to head out.

313
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,380
Dad,

314
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,580
hurry up.

315
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,340
We should be leaving soon.

316
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,460
- Okay.
- He won't come with us.

317
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,380
Hurry up, Ziyuan.

318
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,980
Don't run.

319
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,280
Mind your step.

320
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,550
Grab the coat.

321
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,700
- Okay.
- Yes, grab the coat.

322
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,420
Why won't you let dad come?

323
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,060
Ziyuan, let's go faster,

324
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,740
a lot of other kids are waiting for us.

325
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,300
Why won't you let dad come?

326
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,580
Why is your nose bleeding?

327
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,540
Did you sneak some chocolate?
Look up.

328
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,980
I didn't.

329
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,180
You definitely did.

330
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,820
How else could you have a nosebleed?

331
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,780
Look up.

332
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,500
If you feel uncomfortable,

333
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,060
you have to tell me, okay?

334
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,900
I want dad to come with me.

335
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,500
Am I not good enough for you?

336
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
All the other kids

337
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,580
have both parents with them.

338
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,580
I want daddy with me.

339
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,020
I want daddy.

340
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,210
So what are you going to do now?

341
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,100
Are you going back or staying here?

342
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,020
You decide.

343
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,860
Hu Ziyuan.

344
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,800
I just want dad with me.

345
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,890
I… you…

346
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,800
Hu Ziyuan!

347
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,980
Qin Can.

348
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,700
Someone's calling Hu Ziyuan.

349
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,700
Keep it down.

350
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,940
Hu Ziyuan!

351
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,980
Hu Ziyuan!

352
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,860
Fish.

353
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,100
Ziyuan.

354
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,540
Yue.

355
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,740
- Director Qin.
- Mom.

356
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,470
Should I call him Uncle Qin

357
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,340
or Qin Can?

358
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,100
You should call him

359
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,450
Little

360
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,750
Uncle Qin.

361
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,180
I see, you wanna call me Little Qin, don't you?

362
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,140
Hu Ziyuan, there's a mantis over there.

363
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,700
Where?

364
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,100
Are there many fish?

365
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,100
Not bad.

366
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,260
As I get older,

367
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,740
I tend to be forgetful.

368
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,300
For getting the official approval,

369
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,780
thanks for running the errand.

370
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,940
It's the least I could do.

371
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,780
Thank you, Director.

372
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,620
By the way,

373
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,780
I heard Ning Yue's working in your company.

374
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,100
How is she doing?

375
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,280
She's doing well.

376
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,140
Director,

377
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,020
what did Ning Yue go through
a few years ago?

378
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,340
At that time, Ning Yue's husband

379
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,820
repeatedly rejected

380
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,180
the company's offer to reinstate her,

381
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,900
claiming that

382
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,420
she had serious mental health issues.

383
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,460
But Ning Yue said

384
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,380
she had no idea about this at all.

385
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,140
If that's true,

386
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,130
then her husband

387
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,300
has just ruined her career
with his own hands.

388
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,540
What a bad teacher you are!

389
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,740
Call the parents over here.

390
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
Sir, calm down.

391
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,770
Control your kid!

392
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,820
Sir.

393
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,920
Ziyuan.

394
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,550
- What do you want to do?
- What's going on?

395
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,710
- Is everything okay?
- What happened?

396
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,260
Mom, Xiao Hu bullied Qin Jiaojiao first.

397
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,980
You're the kid's parent, right?

398
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,820
Why is your kid bullying mine?

399
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,380
Nonsense.

400
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,980
- Make it clear.
- Educate your child

401
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,100
or I…

402
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,340
- Stop!
- Don't start a fight!

403
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,740
- Calm down!
- Back off!

404
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,060
- Just stop!
- Mom, are you okay?

405
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,340
I'm fine.

406
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,060
Let's call the police.

407
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
Sure.

408
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,700
(Bindao City Police Station)

409
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,620
Director Qin,

410
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,900
thanks a lot today.

411
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,580
- Never mind.
- Sorry for the trouble.

412
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,300
Hu Ziyuan,

413
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,180
on behalf of Qin Jiaojiao's parents, thank you.

414
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,700
You're righteous and brave.

415
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,260
You're a good boy.

416
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,980
Jiaojiao is lucky

417
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
to have a friend like you.

418
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,260
Thank you, Little Uncle Qin.

419
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,460
We'll always be good friends.

420
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,470
We'll always be good friends.

421
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,100
Well,

422
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,220
let's go.

423
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,290
Let's go.

424
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,820
Dad!

425
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,140
Ziyuan.

426
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,620
Why are you guys so late getting back?

427
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,140
Honey.

428
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,780
Honey!

429
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,260
Why are you ignoring me?

430
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,940
I tried calling, but you didn't pick up.

431
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,540
Do you know how worried I was?

432
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,420
I almost called the police earlier.

433
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,020
We just came back
from the police station.

434
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,820
What happened?

435
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,130
What's going on?

436
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,590
Dad,

437
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,940
I fought with Li Xiaohu.

438
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,460
That's the reason?

439
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
Ziyuan,

440
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,380
tell me,

441
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,540
did you start the fight,

442
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,780
or the other way around?

443
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,820
He bullied me first.

444
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,140
Zi Yuan has nosebleed again.

445
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,540
Again?

446
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,580
It's fine, already stopped.

447
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,860
Honey,

448
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,940
what happened?

449
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,980
What happened to your foot?

450
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,060
Why have you had the bruise?

451
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,020
I'm good.

452
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,780
- Bye.
- Bye.

453
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,680
Bye.

454
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,380
The police's taken Li Xiaohu's father
in for questioning.

455
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,220
What?

456
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,500
- For real?
- Ms. Li.

457
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,420
Ziyuan's here.

458
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,820
- Go inside.
- Goodbye, Mom.

459
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,780
See you.

460
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,030
Ms. Li.

461
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,540
What are they saying?

462
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,700
What happened?

463
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,090
Something happened to Li Xiaohu's family.

464
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,160
His dad was taken in by the police last night.

465
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,880
They don't know why yet.

466
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,280
So his grandma sent him to school today.

467
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,140
I heard from other parents that

468
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,020
his dad was reported for an economic crime.

469
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,740
I see. Thank you, Ms. Li.

470
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,660
Honey,

471
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,700
you left something behind?

472
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,540
The kindergarten teacher said

473
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,380
Li Xiaohu's dad

474
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,780
was taken away by the police.

475
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,980
Isn't that a good thing?

476
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,940
It's karma.

477
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,100
He's such a thug,

478
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,940
doing so many bad things,

479
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,550
and now, any small thing

480
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,660
could get him arrested.

481
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,500
Honey,

482
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,780
I'll never let anyone

483
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,140
hurt you and Ziyuan.

484
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,940
You don't let anyone

485
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,460
bully your wife and son,

486
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,180
but you're fine with doing it yourself?

487
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,460
Mr. Hu,

488
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,620
Mr. Zhou and the others have arrived,

489
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,100
they're waiting for us.

490
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,820
Let's talk later.

491
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,660
He's just planning to deny everything,

492
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,530
pretending like nothing happened,

493
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,220
and trying to get away with it.

494
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,940
But it's okay,

495
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,780
it doesn't matter

496
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,660
whether he admits it or not.

497
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,900
Tonight,

498
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,180
I'm definitely going to get a divorce.

499
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,060
What are you worried about?

500
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,820
I'm worried about

501
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,780
that Ziyuan...

502
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,100
He's not willing to leave his dad.

503
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,980
Ning Yue,

504
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,140
do you want your child

505
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,780
to grow up to be like him?

506
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,580
This restaurant is so good,

507
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,940
I usually don't treat myself to it.

508
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,220
I came here just for this.

509
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,300
It's pretty fresh.

510
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,580
Yue, is there something to celebrate today?

511
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,540
You're already drinking.

512
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,260
Come on, let's drink together.

513
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,300
I'll be free.

514
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,180
You'll be free?

515
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,100
Are you gonna send Ziyuan to your parents?

516
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,060
Come on, cheers.

517
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,700
To freedom.

518
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,740
To freedom.

519
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,060
They're always

520
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,700
playing like crazy together.

521
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,900
Look at Ziyuan,

522
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,340
he's growing so fast.

523
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,820
He's shorter than Tongtong before.

524
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,820
When it comes to staying at your home,

525
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,180
he gets so excited.

526
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,060
You should come over more often.

527
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,100
My wife loves playing with kids.

528
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,380
Wei,

529
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,700
you're really lucky.

530
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,060
You really haven't realized that.

531
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,780
I misjudged before.

532
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,140
Yue is really generous.

533
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,380
She doesn't hold grudges,

534
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,580
and didn't make a big fuss.

535
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,900
Tonight,

536
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,540
you should apologize to her.

537
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,540
She really treats you well.

538
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,340
Don't take her for granted.

539
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,100
Don't blame me for saying too much.

540
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,140
You've already failed in marriage once.

541
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,700
You can't go through that again.

542
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,020
Even if you glare at me, I'll still speak out.

543
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,580
Yue is different from your ex-wife.

544
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,220
Wei,

545
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,220
I have always had

546
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,660
only one wife,

547
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,140
Ning Yue.

548
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,460
Alright.

549
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,620
As long as you keep it to yourself.

550
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,020
Drink up.

551
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,060
We'll drink more later.

552
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,260
Later.

553
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,460
Manager Tian got promoted

554
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,140
to senior manager

555
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,100
and moved to Guangzhou.

556
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,340
Forget it.

557
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,900
Just live your life well.

558
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,260
I remember now.

559
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
I saw you in an industry magazine.

560
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,060
When I was a freshman,

561
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,380
Yue was already on the magazine cover.

562
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,420
She's the rising star of our industry.

563
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,140
- Really?
- You guys didn't know?

564
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,700
- Did you know?
- No way.

565
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,380
- Did you know?
- That's an internal magazine.

566
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,540
They just print whatever they want.

567
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,760
But it's still impressive.

568
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,300
Back then, I was also aiming to be a lawyer.

569
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,610
Oh my god, you're my goddess, my idol.

570
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,780
Let me toast you.

571
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,780
That's an exaggeration.

572
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,980
Cheers to Yue.

573
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,470
Your idol isn't your sister?

574
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,740
My sister is great too.

575
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,020
Yue,

576
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,860
if there's a chance, I'll introduce her to you.

577
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,620
You two will definitely become good friends.

578
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,820
You have a sister?

579
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,100
She's my half-sister.

580
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,060
Ning Yue, don't listen to her.

581
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,060
They are actually

582
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,060
not that close.

583
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,500
Her love is unrequited.

584
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,020
Her sister doesn't care about her.

585
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,220
It's your love that's unrequited.

586
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,300
Exactly,

587
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,500
he's been in unrequited love.

588
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,340
Haven't you, Tianming?

589
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,380
Unrequited love?

590
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,740
Stop making stuff up, Qian.

591
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,660
Yue, I respect you.

592
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,380
- Here.
- Drink up.

593
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,220
Drink up.

594
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,220
To your goddess.

595
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,460
Cheers.

596
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,300
To your sister.

597
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,740
Yu, I really like you.

598
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,340
You're so great.

599
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,660
Are you okay, Pan Jie?

600
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,900
- Qian.
- Are you okay?

601
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,740
Are you alright?

602
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,660
I'm fine.

603
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,660
Tianming,

604
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,820
you make sure

605
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,700
to send them back safely, alright?

606
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,100
Bye, Yue.

607
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,580
- Bye.
- Bye.

608
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,020
No problem.

609
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,460
Did you have fun?

610
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,100
It was okay.

611
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,340
It was more than okay.

612
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,460
Is it only when we drink

613
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,380
that you can have this much fun?

614
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,060
Didn't you drink too?

615
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,980
You get along well with your colleagues.

616
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,180
And what?

617
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,420
You don't like it that I get along

618
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,420
with my colleagues?

619
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,900
Are you really envious of

620
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,460
living a free life?

621
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,900
The one with no family constraints?

622
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,060
Yeah,

623
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm really envious of it,

624
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,500
and I miss it.

625
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,020
Friends, colleagues,

626
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,860
they're so important to me.

627
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,220
I really can't figure out

628
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,980
how I've spent all these years.

629
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,500
How could I let go of my friends,

630
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,420
one by one?

631
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,420
I hate that you're drunk.

632
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,820
Do you know what I hate about you?

633
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,370
I hate that you like to drink,

634
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,660
but don't let me drink.

635
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,140
I hate you

636
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,260
for making me lose

637
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,180
all my friends,

638
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,540
for making me so lonely.

639
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,980
I hate you use "protecting me" as an excuse

640
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,420
to keep me locked in the house,

641
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,820
not letting me do anything,

642
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,180
and have all these weird people

643
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,940
stalking and spying on me.

644
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,580
I hate you for always saying,

645
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,620
"Men, you know,

646
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,780
sometimes have to socialize. It's unavoidable."

647
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,020
I hate you

648
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,700
for still acting like everything is fine

649
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,250
and lying through your teeth

650
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,260
even when she's come for me.

651
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,700
I hate you

652
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,930
for ruining my career,

653
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,590
and my dignity.

(Wei)

680
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Hey, Wei,

681
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,020
Ziyuan's in the emergency room.

682
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,020
(Haikang Hospital)

683
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,180
Yue.

684
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,300
Cheng.

685
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,860
He already had medicine,

686
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,680
but it gets even worse after more than an hour.

687
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,260
I tried calling you, but you didn't pick up,

688
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,740
so I brought him to the hospital.

689
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,380
I only test you once, okay?

690
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
Ziyuan, are you okay?

691
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,020
Leave me alone.

692
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,810
Mom.

693
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,980
- Ziyuan.
- You're so late.

694
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,060
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not feeling well.

695
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,300
I'm really sorry for being so late.

696
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,940
Doctor, what's his condition now?

697
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,260
He doesn't want me to listen to his chest.

698
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,900
I'm not feeling well, Mom.

699
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,540
Ziyuan, I know you're not feeling well.

700
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,540
Now,

701
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,020
listen to me.

702
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,100
Let the doctor

703
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,660
give a call to the elf

704
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,580
in your body,

705
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,490
see which rascal is bullying you, okay?

706
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,560
- Ziyuan.
- No.

707
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,780
You're a man.

708
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,020
Be tough, okay?

709
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,320
You have to be strong.

710
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,500
I don't want to man up.

711
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,620
Mom, I don't feel good.

712
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,460
Look,

713
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,260
the elephant told you,

714
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,340
"you're not feeling well,

715
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,380
because the elf inside you

716
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,100
are fighting the rascal."

717
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,580
So you can't hold it back.

718
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,900
You have to cheer for them,

719
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,340
and

720
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,540
let the doctor listen, okay?

721
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,340
- Alright, hold it.
- Okay?

722
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,680
- Hold it and listen to it.
- I'll be quick.

723
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,580
- Just a second.
- Okay?

724
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,230
- Let's lift your clothes up.
- Good boy.

725
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Don't be afraid.

726
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,420
No fear, it'll end soon.

727
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Okay, let's be quiet now,

728
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,260
the doctor's making the call.

729
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,820
Don't talk, shh.

730
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,060
How is it?

731
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,140
Let's talk outside.

732
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,860
Okay, you go.

733
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,900
I'll stay here.

734
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,820
Okay, Wei.

735
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,460
Mom will be back soon.

736
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
Let's talk over there.

737
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,100
Before you guys arrived,

738
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,060
we did a basic blood test

739
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,100
on the child.

740
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,740
Right now, besides the high fever,

741
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,380
we also found enlarged lymph nodes

742
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,380
in his neck and armpits.

743
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,140
His throat

744
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,740
is also slightly swollen.

745
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
The blood test showed that

746
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,660
his white blood cells are increasing,

747
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:27,100
and atypical lymphocytes above normal levels.

748
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,020
We also found that he's slightly anemic.

749
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,100
So next,

750
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,820
we need to do further tests

751
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,340
to rule out blood diseases.

752
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940
Blood diseases?

753
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,140
It won't be

754
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,580
leukemia, right?

755
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,900
We can't rule out that possibility.

756
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,100
Don't worry,

757
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,180
it's still an unknown at this stage.

758
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,620
But the next few tests

759
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,820
will be quite painful for him,

760
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,500
so I hope you parents

761
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,900
are mentally prepared.

762
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,740
What kind of tests

763
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,580
will they be?

764
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
I'll need to do a lumbar puncture on him,

765
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,220
take a sample

766
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,340
of his bone marrow.

767
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,260
Okay,

768
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,100
you do your job

769
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,700
as long as the child is fine.

770
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,060
Good.

771
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,180
Then you can go handle the paperwork.

772
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,020
Okay.

773
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,060
Don't worry,

774
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,820
he'll be fine.

775
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,300
Stay strong.

776
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,170
Pan Jie,

777
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,620
get this contract ready as soon as possible,

778
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,740
it is really urgent.

779
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,460
Also, Ning Yue has taken sick leave,

780
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,060
so the contract she proofread

781
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,300
has been sent to the chat group,

782
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,140
you guys check it out.

783
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,300
Yue is sick?

784
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Her child is sick.

785
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,500
For women,

786
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,420
once they get married and have a baby,

787
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,740
their career will be affected.

788
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,060
Not for her.

789
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,260
Just focus on your work.

790
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,300
Why are you crying even in your sleep?

791
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,500
Did you have a nightmare?

792
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,620
Dad's wiping Mom's eye boogers.
