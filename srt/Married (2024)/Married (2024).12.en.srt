=Episode 12=

3
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,640
Let me take another shot.

4
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,120
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

5
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,760
I also invited an old friend.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
A playing partner.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,320
There you go.

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,450
Sorry, Mr. Mo.

9
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,450
I am late.

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
It's ok.

11
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,200
Let me introduce you.

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,920
Mr. Hu, Hu Cheng from Yaofeng Tech.

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
This is my friend Tian Qiuzai.

14
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,010
Do you know each other?

15
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,920
Old friends?

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,850
We have worked together

17
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,690
before.

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,920
Long time no see, Mr. Hu.

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,550
Long time no see,

20
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,140
Manager Tian.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Take a club.

22
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,220
Mr. Mo,

23
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,450
thank you

24
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,450
for the strong support for Yaofeng Tech.

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
Please let me propose a toast to you

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,170
on behalf of all employees.

27
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,360
Let's toast to our tacit cooperation.

28
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,130
I heard

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
that you are solely responsible

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,450
for several important projects

31
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,680
at Ruixin before.

32
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
The leaders valued me highly.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,170
They really gave me a lot of opportunities.

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
So why did you leave Ruixin later?

35
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,450
Someone

36
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,200
faked rumors and slandered me.

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Although they were all baseless matters,

38
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,130
I felt particularly uncomfortable.

39
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,050
So I resigned.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,680
That's because you have strong work abilities.

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,410
It's normal to be envied.

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,920
With such strong abilities,

43
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
you must have looked for a good company now.

44
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,080
Mr. Mo, you still have a chance.

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Good.

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,800
That's right.

47
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,730
Manager Tian's work ability

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,010
is beyond doubt.

49
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,410
I can vouch for that.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
See?

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,760
With Mr. Hu's

52
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,920
guarantee,

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,200
I will really take action.

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
Here.

55
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm going to the restroom.

56
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,960
You go ahead.

57
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,340
(When the melody starts, I am by your side)

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's have a drink.

59
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,360
You can also play the piano, right?

60
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Do you think she plays well?

61
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,570
Pretty good.

62
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,240
Qiuzi, how do you get home?

63
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
I...

64
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
Does your boyfriend come to pick you up?

65
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,440
Mr. Mo, Mr. Hu,

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,410
please rest early.

67
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,250
I'm leaving first.

68
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,190
Ok.

69
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,200
Take care.

70
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,610
By the way,

71
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,120
tomorrow morning,

72
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,880
remember to bring the contract,

73
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
let me see,

74
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,650
to me by 8:50.

75
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,170
- Ok, no problem
- Don't be late.

76
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,210
Let's go.

77
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,530
Go.

78
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,700
Why don't you introduce me?

79
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
No need for that.

80
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,820
You are tired?

81
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,660
Take a break first.

82
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,820
When we get there, I will call you.

83
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,340
You dislike this so much?

84
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,500
(General Manager's Office)

85
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,820
Come in.

86
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,340
The investigation results came out,

87
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,180
Director Qin.

88
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,460
The investigation confirms

89
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,900
those reporting materials

90
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,460
are all fabricated.

91
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,260
There is no solid evidence.

92
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,420
Director Qin,

93
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,340
the company knows that this matter

94
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,820
has hurt you deeply.

95
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,780
The company will clarify

96
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,900
all inappropriate statements

97
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,580
that defame you and your department

98
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,860
as soon as possible.

99
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,140
I hope you understand.

100
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,340
From the company's perspective,

101
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,340
upon receiving these reports,

102
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,100
we have to verify.

103
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,660
I understand.

104
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,340
After verification,

105
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,580
it was found that Qin Can

106
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,460
did not exploit his position

107
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,980
to illegally accept property

108
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,620
or harm the company's interests

109
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
for the benefit of others.

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,700
(Announcement)
Related reports

111
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,700
are inaccurate.

112
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,620
We hereby clarify that.

113
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,550
- Congratulations.
- To Director Qin

114
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,420
for finally

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
clearing his name.

116
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,620
Cheers!

117
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,580
Boss, I wish you the courage to start fresh

118
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,420
and keep up the good work.

119
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,580
Thank you.

120
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,220
This doesn't need to be celebrated.

121
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,500
Boss, I toast to your broad-mindedness,

122
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,460
your original aspiration...

123
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,940
- and...
- Persistence.

124
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,220
He's at a loss for words again.

125
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,340
You all seem excited, don't you?

126
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,180
Don't you?

127
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,700
- Here.
- Have a drink.

128
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,860
Stay humble and calm,

129
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,850
and achieve new heights again.

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,700
Yue,

131
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,980
you're also joining in the fun.

132
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,780
Yue,

133
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,180
congratulations to you

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,180
for becoming a regular worker.

135
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Welcome to join us.

136
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,740
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

137
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,420
- Welcome Yue.
- Welcome Yue.

138
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,180
Boss, you have to drink it up.

139
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,980
Above the bird.

140
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,180
Yue hasn't come back yet, has she?

141
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,340
It's so late already.

142
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,700
- The last time she got back,
- On the food.

143
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,820
- she was reeking of alcohol.
- Want it?

144
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,620
Tonight,

145
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,940
she didn't go drinking again, did she?

146
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,460
She hasn't come back home so late.

147
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,820
What a life!

148
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,500
Come on, little bird.

149
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,410
Director Qin,

150
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,980
congratulations

151
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,860
on clearing your name.

152
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,220
Nothing to congratulate.

153
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,100
However, I still want to thank you.

154
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,450
What are you thanking me for?

155
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,860
You should thank yourself.

156
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,460
You didn't do anything wrong.

157
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,060
I invite you to talk about the follow-up work.

158
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,500
Do you want to continue the investigation

159
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,030
that you were responsible before

160
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,180
or hand it over to other departments?

161
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,780
The materials for the investigation

162
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,900
are all relatively complicated.

163
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,020
I believe no one is willing to take it.

164
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,500
How about our team continues with it?

165
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,660
Save time and cost.

166
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,700
Very good.

167
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,420
You are the most familiar with it.

168
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
But

169
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,420
it has delayed quite a bit of progress.

170
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,420
I have

171
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,300
to ask you

172
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,420
to speed up the progress.

173
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,620
Ok, Ms. Luo.

174
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
If there is nothing else,

175
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,180
I will get back to work.

176
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,620
Ok.

177
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,860
Director Qin.

178
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,580
Have you met with Mr. Zhang?

179
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,420
I have.

180
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,180
He didn't mention anything to you?

181
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,260
What?

182
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
Take a look.

183
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,620
(Layoff list of this quarter)

184
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,900
Ms. Luo,

185
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,420
now the Legal Department

186
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,660
is short-staffed.

187
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,900
There is still a lot of work to be done.

188
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
In any case,

189
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
you can't lay off our department.

190
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,020
Director Qin,

191
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,820
this is the decision

192
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,780
made by the company.

193
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,390
I hope you can understand.

194
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,260
Ms. Luo...

195
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
I have another meeting in five minutes.

196
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,100
Sorry.

197
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,780
I am going.

198
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,420
Bad news! Bad news!

199
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,740
Tianming,

200
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,780
I just heard from the HR Department

201
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,780
that this quarter

202
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,420
there's someone from our department

203
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,820
on the group's layoff list.

204
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,900
- Let me help you.
- Ok.

205
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,900
He has been like this...

206
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,300
- You mentioned the layoffs.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,380
- It's ok.
- Someone in our department.

208
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Guess who it is.

209
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,380
It definitely isn't Yue.

210
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,260
She just became regular.

211
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,260
Yue.

212
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,380
Come over here.

213
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,620
(Ms. Ning Yue, I am sorry to inform you...)

214
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,020
(the company will terminate the labor...)

215
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,060
Me?

216
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,140
Grandma, look.

217
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,020
The little bird has recovered now.

218
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,020
It's true.

219
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,500
Are you really willing to let it go?

220
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,140
It looks better when it flies.

221
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,300
There.

222
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,380
Be good.

223
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,860
Little bird,

224
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,820
fly.

225
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,300
Just fly.

226
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,900
Go find your mom.

227
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,250
Cheng,

228
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,940
the little bird's injury has healed.

229
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,420
Let it go.

230
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,900
I won't.

231
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,980
Why?

232
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,140
Are you going to keep it locked up?

233
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,060
I saved it.

234
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,820
I want to keep it forever.

235
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,780
It needs to stay with me all the time.

236
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,300
Goodbye, little bird.

237
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,300
Goodbye.

238
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
It's the company's decision.

239
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,140
And they say they will compensate you.

240
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,660
I just became regular.

241
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,660
I asked you not to be arrogant.

242
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,420
This is so ridiculous...

243
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,500
Yue,

244
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,660
as long as I don't sign it,

245
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
you can't leave.

246
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,660
I'll find someone to think of a solution.

247
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,660
These two days,

248
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,940
just focus on your work.

249
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,540
Yue.

250
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Our department has always been short-staffed.

251
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,980
Layoffs never fell on us before.

252
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,980
It is default all these years.

253
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,980
What's going on this year?

254
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,220
Not just you,

255
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,340
I've been here for so many years.

256
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,100
Our department has never laid off anyone.

257
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,820
It's really unusual this time.

258
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,220
Could it be a mistake?

259
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,180
Exactly.

260
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,620
She is laid off just after becoming regular.

261
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,820
Isn't this just messing with people?

262
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,900
Yue,

263
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,100
why do I feel like

264
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,620
this seems to be directed at you?

265
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
Press it. One, two, three. Open it.

266
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,820
Ok, it is lit up now.

267
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Once it's lit up, select the time.

268
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,700
One hour is fine.

269
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,300
There's not that much oil.

270
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,180
There is a small arrow here.

271
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,460
Just press it to start.

272
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,060
It has started working.

273
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,580
Not complicated.

274
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,100
Let me say it again.

275
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,060
See.

276
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,580
It has started working now.

277
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,690
The water is gone. Refill the water.

278
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,580
Look, here.

279
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,420
This.

280
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,860
One, two, three.

281
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,980
Do it again.

282
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,960
What are you doing?

283
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,620
The tea is finished. Didn't you hear?

284
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,820
The water is right there.

285
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,580
Why don't you just do it yourself?

286
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,460
You are quite funny.

287
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,320
I didn't call you anyway.

288
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,580
Press this arrow and start working.

289
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,700
Is it?

290
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,100
- Remember it now?
- Right.

291
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,100
- Come on, look.
- Remember.

292
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
This one.

293
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,870
One, two, three.

294
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
One...

295
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,220
Do it yourself.

296
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,580
Don't just remember. Do it.

297
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,700
Do it.

298
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,300
You will get it after doing it once.

299
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
It's not difficult.

300
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,620
One hour.

301
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,460
Right.

302
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,740
See? One hour. One hour.

303
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,780
Press next step.

304
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,100
Right, this one.

305
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,100
Good.

306
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
It worked.

307
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,900
Pretty good.

308
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,540
You are quite smart.

309
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,940
You learn it so quickly.

310
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,900
Look at you.

311
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,220
With me every day,

312
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,860
you always have a long face.

313
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,040
You are not used to wearing it.

314
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
Because you can't touch it.

315
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,180
You don't know if it's clean.

316
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,060
Yes, I don't know how to wash it.

317
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,730
What's wrong?

318
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,820
Well,

319
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,220
how could you hit her randomly?

320
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,460
Who hit someone?

321
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,780
It still hurts here.

322
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,660
Why can't you be more careful?

323
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,900
- What the hell!
- Go take a break.

324
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,260
Hello? Mom, what's wrong?

325
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,060
What?

326
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Speak slowly.

327
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,340
Who started this?

328
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,620
I'll be back soon.

329
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,580
Both of you

330
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
all rely on my son

331
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,700
at my house.

332
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,620
My son feels pity for you and your daughter,

333
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,300
so he allows you to stay here for free.

334
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,300
You don't know how to be grateful,

335
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,060
but slander and spread rumors

336
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,540
- and frame me.
- Hey.

337
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,740
Don't mention

338
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,140
your son.

339
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,100
Let me tell you,

340
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,580
my daughter has half of this family.

341
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,980
My daughter also works.

342
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,540
My daughter also earns a salary.

343
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,260
Even if we eat and drink for free,

344
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,060
it's not up to you to criticize here.

345
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,820
Mom, what's going on?

346
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,300
- No...
- I'm fine.

347
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,260
- You take a look.
- It's fine.

348
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,100
Take a look.

349
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,140
Mom,

350
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,750
how did you get this injury?

351
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,590
- Does it hurt?
- It's ok.

352
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,540
- Who did this?
- It's ok.

353
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,580
You take care of him all day,

354
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,620
eating and drinking.

355
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,500
He actually hit her today.

356
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,580
Didn't I just tell you that?

357
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,020
We bumped into each other.

358
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,300
I have injuries here too.

359
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,540
Can you come up with something more convincing?

360
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,620
I'll tell you the truth as well.

361
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,780
I've been tolerating you for days.

362
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,220
You are going too far.

363
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,740
Don't think you're the husband,

364
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,260
and you can do whatever you want.

365
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,780
We are now in a society ruled by law.

366
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,940
There are laws that protect women's rights.

367
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,220
How dare you hit your wife today!

368
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,900
It's a crime, you know that?

369
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,740
- Who hit her?
- I'm fine.

370
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,940
- You hit her.
- Who broke the law?

371
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,980
- I saw you hit her.
- All right.

372
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,100
- Wait a minute.
- It was you.

373
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,220
- You tell him.
- Mom.

374
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,860
I want to hear you say.

375
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,700
Who did it? What's going on?

376
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,540
Just say it.

377
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,100
No worries, Mom.

378
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,580
Today we are standing here.

379
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,820
We will make the decision for you.

380
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,860
Just now,

381
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,220
your dad and I

382
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,300
bumped.

383
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,140
Did you hear that?

384
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Did you hear that?

385
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,060
What else do you have to say?

386
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,460
- So ridiculous!
- It's ok now.

387
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,380
I tell you,

388
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,420
old lady,

389
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,860
mind your own business

390
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,980
from now on.

391
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,780
No wonder

392
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,860
you don't even have a home.

393
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,300
And your temper is so bad.

394
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,500
Your husband must die of anger because of you.

395
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,540
- Dad!
- Shut up!

396
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,580
Don't say it that way.

397
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
You're being excessive.

398
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,540
What's wrong with you?

399
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,330
- Hey.
- Mom, Mom.

400
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,600
- Mom.
- Hey.

401
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,620
- Are you ok?
- Mom.

402
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,060
- Hello?
- Mom!

403
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,740
- Oh my.
- Give her some water.

404
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,580
Wake up.

405
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,140
- Drink some water.
- Hello?

406
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,620
Oh, you...

407
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,300
She woke up! She woke up.

408
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,380
Oh my!

409
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm fine now. It doesn't hurt.

410
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,740
It doesn't hurt. See? It doesn't hurt.

411
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,060
I really don't know

412
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,380
you have such a big temper.

413
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,100
You really shouldn't argue with people.

414
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,980
- I have...
- Hello?

415
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,020
...some pills. Take some.

416
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,140
Come on, have some first.

417
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,540
Dad,

418
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,960
- apologize to my mom.
- It's all right.

419
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,220
It's all right.

420
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
Oh no,

421
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,980
I am the victim.

422
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,820
Why should I apologize?

423
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,020
Apologize to my mom.

424
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,860
Ning Yue.

425
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,780
I didn't expect

426
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,980
to bump your mom so hard.

427
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,260
My head is hard.

428
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,460
It doesn't hurt at all.

429
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,500
Your mom's head was bumped very hard.

430
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,460
I really didn't do it on purpose.

431
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,300
Ziyuan's grandma

432
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,060
insisted that I hit your mom.

433
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,740
She got me wrong.

434
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,740
You know I've never

435
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,260
laid a finger on your mom.

436
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,220
Moreover, I personally think

437
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,460
men

438
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,500
should not hit women.

439
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,300
A man who hit a woman

440
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,100
is the most incompetent,

441
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
the most useless

442
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,240
and the most disgusting.

443
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,780
At that time, I was really

444
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,340
furious.

445
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,780
I spoke recklessly and said those words.

446
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,260
I regret it now.

447
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,140
I mean it.

448
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,340
No one has ever dared to talk to me like this.

449
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,980
Even your dad has never spoken to me loudly.

450
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,980
Even if there was a quarrel,

451
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,020
thinking back, it was also my fault.

452
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,580
He is too uncivilized.

453
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Drink some water to calm down.

454
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,140
Just thinking of him...

455
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,980
Mom, I'm sorry.

456
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,700
I have made you feel wronged.

457
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,180
Well,

458
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,700
how did Ziyuan's grandpa

459
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,580
die?

460
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,060
Car accident.

461
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,740
That's pretty tragic.

462
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,820
This family

463
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,540
is quite pitiful.

464
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,260
Dad, have you thought

465
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,100
about why others frame you?

466
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,220
How many times have I told you?

467
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,620
Be nicer to Mom, be nicer to Mom.

468
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,940
When have you ever listened?

469
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,780
I am really good to your mom.

470
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,900
Really.

471
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,220
In my heart.

472
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,260
I can't see that.

473
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,940
I can't help it.

474
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,780
The men of the Hu family

475
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,740
are all like this.

476
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,700
Your grandpa

477
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,140
treated your grandma like this.

478
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,700
And your grandpa also said,

479
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,140
women

480
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,100
should be disciplined properly.

481
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Look at your mom.

482
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,620
She can cook

483
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,700
and do housework.

484
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,980
This is all my contribution.

485
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,820
Dad!

486
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,260
All right.

487
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,780
I'll take your mom to the hospital tomorrow.

488
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,620
Is that ok?

489
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,860
Ziyuan's grandma...

490
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,460
Do you want me to apologize?

491
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
Don't worry about it.

492
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,860
Ok, ok, ok.

493
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,780
Ok, you handle it.

494
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,620
You handle it.

495
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,340
What the hell!

496
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,980
My mom needs an apology.

497
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,540
I have looked into this matter.

498
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,140
It's just a misunderstanding.

499
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,060
Both sides had impulsive words and actions.

500
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,460
There is no absolute right or wrong.

501
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,780
My dad was just confused.

502
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
How about this?

503
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,580
I apologize to you on his behalf.

504
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,420
However,

505
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,740
your mom

506
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,540
spoke nonsense

507
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,380
without seeing it...

508
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,460
Your dad usually likes to bully people.

509
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,300
In the eyes of outsiders like you,

510
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,940
it seems like my dad is bullying my mom.

511
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,540
But the two of them

512
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,860
have been together for decades.

513
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,860
If there is any discomfort,

514
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,260
they broke up long ago.

515
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,780
Every couple

516
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,260
and every family relationship

517
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,580
have their own unique way of getting along.

518
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,300
The way of getting along that I understand

519
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,380
is about mutual understanding,

520
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,580
mutual tolerance,

521
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,340
rather than one-sided accommodation.

522
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,380
But

523
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,500
my dad is already at such an old age.

524
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,140
Some things are deeply rooted in him.

525
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,940
I can't change him anymore.

526
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,100
If your dad can't change,

527
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
if he can't learn

528
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,060
to respect my mom and your mom,

529
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,940
then I can only

530
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,700
ask him to leave our home.

531
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Ziyuan is currently

532
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,060
at the stage of establishing his own values.

533
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,300
It's very important.

534
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,340
I don't want him to go bad,

535
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
I don't want him to learn

536
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,020
to be disrespectful like your dad.

537
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,140
You have improved now.

538
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,540
You weren't like this before.

539
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,380
I said

540
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,380
now is important stage for Ziyuan's growth.

541
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,780
Principles can not be changed.

542
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,340
Ok.

543
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,820
I'll listen to you.

544
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,340
Are you now

545
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,860
earning a salary outside

546
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,580
and feeling more confident?

547
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,620
Our department has always been short-staffed.

548
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
Layoffs never fell on us before.

549
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,780
Yue,

550
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
why do I feel like

551
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,540
this seems to be directed at you?

552
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,940
I asked someone close to me about it.

553
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,260
Luo Yating took the initiative.

554
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
She just arrived.

555
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,780
How could she know about my situation?

556
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,980
She wants to establish her authority.

557
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,540
It's easy for others to use her as a pawn.

558
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,060
I suspect

559
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,540
someone is using her

560
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
to dismiss you.

561
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,540
But who wants you to leave?

562
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,820
(Zhongzhi Group)
Do you all understand

563
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,940
the plan we just discussed?

564
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,180
Yes, we do.

565
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,380
Let's proceed according to the plan.

566
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,220
That's it.

567
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,900
Mr. Chen,

568
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,540
are you available now?

569
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,140
Yes. Please come in and have a seat.

570
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,780
What do you want, Lawyer Ning?

571
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,620
Please speak.

572
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,380
It's still about the investigation.

573
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,540
This is a summary of the contracts

574
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,100
of our company's Procurement Department

575
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,380
and subsidiaries from last year.

576
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,460
Please take a look.

577
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,180
Haven't you received

578
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,860
received the HR notification?

579
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,220
Are you referring

580
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,340
to the layoff notification?

581
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,540
How do you know about this matter?

582
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,780
I'm not quite sure.

583
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,100
I happened to hear someone

584
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,980
mentioning it

585
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,860
the other day.

586
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,780
You are incredibly busy every day.

587
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,780
But you still pay attention to some

588
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,060
like me, a legal assistant.

589
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,300
You are not an ordinary legal assistant.

590
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,340
You are the wife

591
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,820
of the president

592
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,980
of Yaofeng Tech.

593
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,300
Few people in the company know about this.

594
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,340
You'd better not mention it.

595
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,060
Thank you for helping Hu Cheng.

596
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,940
Come over for dinner when you have free.

597
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,940
Of course, I will definitely go.

598
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,380
I have to taste your skills.

599
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,940
Actually,

600
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,540
I have been struggling

601
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,300
with whether to continue or not.

602
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,740
After all, I have a kid.

603
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,780
He needs my care.

604
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,300
This way is also pretty good.

605
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,620
This time,

606
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,100
is it also Hu Cheng

607
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,460
who let you do it?

608
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
I think

609
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,220
you'd better to stay at home.

610
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,780
You have such a good husband.

611
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,980
Well,

612
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,780
you do these chores every day

613
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,300
as a worker.

614
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,260
It's tired and annoyed.

615
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,980
It's not worth it.

616
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,540
Right.

617
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,460
It's good to stay at home.

618
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,140
By the way, I have another appointment.

619
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,500
I am going.

620
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,660
Ok.

621
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,740
If you need, feel free to contact me.

622
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,860
Ok, Mr. Chen.

623
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,540
Ms. Luo,

624
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,980
I have sent you

625
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,780
a total of three emails before.

626
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,740
They all show as unread.

627
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,940
So I think it's better for me

628
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,100
to come and talk to you in person.

629
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,460
It saves time.

630
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,540
If it's about the layoffs,

631
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,100
you should go to the HR Department.

632
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,980
I have already been there.

633
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,540
Mr. Zhang's original words is

634
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,840
that Ms. Luo had no choice.

635
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,840
This is the company's decision.

636
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,100
I hope you can understand.

637
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,460
Ms. Luo,

638
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,850
Director Qin was framed by someone,

639
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,380
which has caused a significant delay

640
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,260
in the progress of the investigation.

641
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,340
If out department gets laid off,

642
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,620
this is a very serious mistake.

643
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,700
It will harm the company's interests.

644
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,020
At your age,

645
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,980
you haven't worked for three years.

646
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,260
I don't need to check what you did before.

647
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,300
I know that you get into Zhongzhi

648
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,460
because of personal connections.

649
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,820
Look at your own attendance record.

650
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,300
Not a single overtime.

651
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,780
Not a single business trip.

652
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,380
Your kid

653
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,780
is still in the kindergarten, isn't he?

654
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,740
I believe you can only spare

655
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,860
a little energy for work.

656
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,380
You join Zhongzhi

657
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,900
because

658
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,500
it's easy to fish in trouble waters.

659
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,100
Ms. Luo,

660
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,020
when the company lays off employees,

661
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,540
the Legal Department is usually exempt.

662
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,780
The department has always been

663
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,380
in a state of manpower shortage.

664
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,260
I don't know if you are aware of this.

665
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Maybe you've only heard

666
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
that others have opinions about this.

667
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,380
But do you know

668
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,460
how much my performance

669
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,220
and how much work

670
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,780
I have done in the past three months?

671
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,460
Please think carefully.

672
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,260
Why do you only see my resume

673
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,060
and my attendance record?

674
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,540
The reason

675
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,940
you let me go

676
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
is that someone is pushing from behind.

677
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,220
The list has already been distributed.

678
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,940
I can only wish you the best

679
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,380
on your future path

680
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,380
on behalf of the company.

681
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,000
Ms. Luo,

682
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
you have achieved such success today.

683
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,380
You must be someone extraordinary.

684
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,780
I don't hope

685
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,060
or don't believe that you have become

686
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,860
someone else's gunman

687
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,780
without realizing it.

688
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
I'll go out first.

689
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,100
Wei,

690
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,100
you have to urge them

691
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,780
on the new project with Ruixin.

692
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,540
Sure, be rest assured.

693
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,780
Mr. Mo said he has something to do,

694
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,820
so he can't come over.

695
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,020
Hello? Mo,

696
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,260
why didn't you come?

697
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,100
I'm currently in a meeting.

698
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,540
I might not be able to leave.

699
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,700
Have Qiuzai play with you first.

700
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,460
Manager Tian plays better than I do.

701
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,060
If you don't like playing golf,

702
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,860
next time we can do

703
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,300
some other outdoor sports instead.

704
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,620
Sure, sure.

705
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,740
We can go hiking

706
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,780
next time.

707
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,100
Sure, no problem.

708
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,700
I will definitely accompany you.

709
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,140
Mr. Hu,

710
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,060
when you make a decision about something,

711
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,300
you must consider maximizing benefits.

712
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,780
If emotional factors are mixed in

713
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,380
and impact decision-making,

714
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,060
that is extremely unwise.

715
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,020
What do you mean by that?

716
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,540
I heard ever since the project manager changed,

717
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,500
the risk audit for the project

718
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,540
between Yaofeng and Ruixin has never passed.

719
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,260
You still have to deal with verifications.

720
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
The progress has slowed down quite a bit.

721
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,340
Manager Tian,

722
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,140
Yaofeng Tech

723
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
is now highly regarded by the market.

724
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,980
For investors,

725
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,780
we don't really need your company at all.

726
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,100
And

727
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,540
you

728
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,580
have already left

729
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,220
from Ruixin Investment Bank.

730
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,460
Why are you still concerned

731
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
about Yaofeng's project?

732
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,940
Thank you for your kindness.

733
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Yaofeng Tech

734
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,940
doesn't need your concern.

735
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,300
What you said

736
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,820
is really too hurtful and

737
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,540
lacks grace.

738
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,540
Between us,

739
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
is there still feelings?

740
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,380
The more people care about something,

741
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,980
the more they will vehemently deny it.

742
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,260
Don't you hate go hiking the most?

743
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,660
Your posture is wrong.

744
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
Manager Tian,

745
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,340
my principles in dealing with people

746
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,700
is just like playing golf.

747
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,700
When it's time to swing, then I swing,

748
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,180
without any delay.

749
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,980
Mr. Hu, don't be in a hurry to leave.

750
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,420
I haven't finished my sentence yet.

751
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,020
Is there anything else, Manager Tian?

752
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,060
I am very busy.

753
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,100
I didn't expect

754
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,900
Mr. Mo is such a trustworthy person,

755
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,380
unlike some people

756
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,460
in our circle.

757
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,540
The terms he offered me

758
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,940
were truly impossible to refuse.

759
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,180
I'm going to Xianbin Capital.

760
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,220
So maybe in the near future

761
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,620
we will work together again.

762
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,980
I hope you will take care of me,

763
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,020
Mr. Hu.

764
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,060
You go ahead. I will go in now.

765
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,140
I will come to pick you up later.

766
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,660
This is for you.

767
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,940
Grandma said you liked this the most.

768
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,620
I'll go see Grandma next week.

769
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Is that your boyfriend?

770
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,500
What do you think?

771
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,900
I think he is quite handsome.

772
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,660
He is my colleague.

773
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,100
He really doesn't deserve you.

774
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,220
So what kind of man do you think

775
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,140
deserves me?

776
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,140
First of all,

777
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
he must be a good person.

778
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,020
He must be upright and kind.

779
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,940
He should share the same values as you.

780
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,300
Most importantly, he should treat you well.

781
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,980
You are so outstanding.

782
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,740
Eat.

783
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,900
Please arrive downstairs

784
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,740
before 9:30.

785
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,980
Not much luggage.

786
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,020
Ok.

787
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,740
Thank you so much.

788
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,260
Mom.

789
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,060
Are you leaving like this?

790
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,980
Yes.

791
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
I'm sorry, Mom.

792
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,540
I didn't protect you well.

793
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,060
Don't say sorry.

794
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,500
Haven't I talked to you before?

795
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,340
I am no longer angry.

796
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
It is a rational choice

797
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,620
for me to leave.

798
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,940
It's not suitable to live together.

799
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,100
This is your home.

800
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,540
- This is your life.
- I don't want it.

801
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,100
I know you don't want me to go.

802
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,380
But I won't go far.

803
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,380
If you need anything, just call me.

804
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,220
I can come right away, you know.

805
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,260
If you miss me, you can come see me.

806
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,740
Mom,

807
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,100
it's my fault.

808
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
It's my fault.

809
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,580
Nothing.

810
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,060
I am fine.

811
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,940
Don't be like this.

812
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,060
Ok.

813
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,420
Grandma, look.

814
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,580
Good boy.

815
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,540
Is this fun?

816
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,700
Yes, this is fun.

817
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,100
Grandma,

818
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,420
does it still hurt?

819
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,700
It doesn't hurt anymore.

820
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,060
Let me rub it for you.

821
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,980
No...

822
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,740
- Good boy.
- Pain, pain, fly away.

823
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,940
Fly, fly.

824
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,270
Mom and Grandma said

825
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,540
you need love even more.

826
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,820
They let me treat you

827
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,340
a little better.

828
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,220
Here.

829
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Thank you, Grandma.

830
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,660
Mom and Grandma

831
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,180
are good people.

832
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,580
Good boy.

833
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,740
Good boy.

834
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,020
Good boy.

835
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,740
How about

836
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,220
I lend you a hand?

837
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,460
I have hands and feet.

838
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,060
I can do it myself.

839
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,940
Why do I always rely on others?

840
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,940
I just don't understand

841
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,820
whether you are really stupid or not.

842
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,380
I have been pretending

843
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,420
all this life.

844
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,380
I really become a fool.

845
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,860
Sit here.

846
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,620
Let me help you.

847
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,020
It's fine.

848
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,800
I think this clothes looks good on you.

849
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,060
I'll take it.

850
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,020
- Hello, I'm here to extend the stay.
- Hello.

851
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,100
Please wait a moment.

852
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,460
Please confirm the room and the charges.

853
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,500

855
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,380
Ok.

(Charges)

857
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,860
Ma'am, it's already paid until next year.

858
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,860
Paid until next year?

859
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,580
When was it paid?

860
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,860
Let me check this for you.

861
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,740
Mrs. Hu, right?

862
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,540
Mr. Hu came by in the morning.

863
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,240
He has paid the room.

864
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,740
In the morning?

865
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,120
Yes.

866
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,100
Mr. Hu said you will come in the afternoon.

867
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,220
He also said

868
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,060
