=Episode 2=

3
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,910
Once upon a time,

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,630
there was a scorpion

5
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,960
who wanted to cross a river,

6
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,910
but it couldn’t swim.

7
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,470
At that moment,

8
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,910
a frog came by.

9
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,080
The scorpion asked the frog,

10
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,330
"Can you carry me across the river?"

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,700
The frog replied,

12
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,840
"No, I can't.

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,000
If I carry you across,

14
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,440
you'll sting me on my back."

15
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,000
The scorpion said,

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,790
"Don't worry,

17
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,580
I can't swim.

18
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,300
If I do that,

19
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,300
we'll both drown."

20
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,540
So the frog trusted the scorpion's words

21
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,700
and agreed to carry it across the river.

22
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,040
But who would've thought,

23
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,220
halfway across,

24
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,730
the scorpion still stung the frog.

25
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,660
(peaceful sleep every day.)

26
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,100
At the very moment

27
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,060
when they were about to sink,

28
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,100
the frog asked the scorpion,

29
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,700
"Why did you do that?"

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,380
The scorpion replied,

31
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,820
"Because

32
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,500
It's just

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,700
in my nature.”

34
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,660
Mr. Hu,

35
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,900
The post I put online,

36
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,510
was seen by Congcong.

37
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,100
I didn't expect that kid to jump off the building because of it.

38
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,580
What should I do now?

39
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,660
What can we learn from the story?

40
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,940
The scorpion is a bad guy.

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,020
It tells us that the little frog

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,020
Shouldn't have trusted the scorpion's words.

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,860
You need to understand one thing:

44
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,300
no matter where or

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,260
no matter when,

46
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,780
you should never trust others.

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,940
Just trust yourself.

48
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,100
What about you and mom?

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,300
Can I trust you?

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,940
Just trust yourself.

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,780
This is a pop-up book made by Ning Yue for him

52
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,620
You're giving him this?

53
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,620
Don't think like an adult.

54
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,060
He's a little kid.

55
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,020
Kids love these kinds of things.

56
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,740
My baby wife is always right.

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,300
What's wrong?

58
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,420
This color

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,020
doesn't suit you at all.

60
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,340
Darker shades look better on you.

61
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,180
This family really can't do without you.

62
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Of course!

63
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
Dad.

64
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,980
- Hello, Mr. Hu.
- Hello, Mr. Hu.

65
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
- Mr. Hu.
- Mr. Hu.

66
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,020
- Hello, Mr. Hu.
- Take a seat.

67
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,820
Let me see…

68
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,700
Mr. Hu, their noodles are really good.

69
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,020
Right, super chewy.

70
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,500
- Smells amazing.
- Alright.

71
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,500
I'll have this too.

72
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,780
Let me.

73
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,820
Mr. Hu,

74
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,900
Song, come join us for lunch.

75
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,200
These noodles are really delicious.

76
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,060
Want a serving?

77
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,940
The doctor said I need to eat something light for now.

78
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,140
I still need some time

79
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,100
to recover.

80
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,300
Stay back.

81
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,340
This sauce might stain your clothes, it'll be hard to wash off.

82
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,380
Look,

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,020
how considerate Song is.

84
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,700
Yes.

85
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,020
Mr. Hu,

86
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,940
I remember

87
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,180
your old tie was a dark color,

88
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,260
why did you switch to a lighter one?

89
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,020
The dark ones

90
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,340
are much more dignified,

91
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,620
they really match your aura,

92
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,820
don't you think?

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,500
I think

94
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,260
you have the same taste

95
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,220
as my wife.

96
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
Am I?

97
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,900
Song,

98
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,020
how's your health recovering?

99
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,940
The doctor said the surgery went pretty smoothly.

100
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,660
But it needs time to recover.

101
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
I've been thinking,

102
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,780
with so many new products coming out in our company,

103
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,580
I couldn't rest easy.

104
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,780
So I had to come by.

105
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,940
You're worrying too much.

106
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,740
We have so many employees,

107
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,580
you're not indispensable.

108
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,380
Well, Song,

109
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,620
I think you should rest

110
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,940
when you need it.

111
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,740
Our company

112
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,100
values humanistic care a lot.

113
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,900
You're telling me to exploit and pressure

114
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,580
someone who's sick?

115
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,740
Wouldn't that be unethical?

116
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,780
No, I…

117
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,380
Song,

118
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,380
What you've done for the company

119
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,940
I'll keep it in my heart.

120
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,420
But

121
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,580
I really think you should take the rest you need.

122
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,020
Listen to me,

123
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,820
just go home.

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,420
Give the younger folks

125
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,580
a chance to show their talents,

126
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,660
right?

127
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,460
Cheng,

128
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,180
Song

129
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,900
is one of the pioneers who helped us build the company.

130
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,500
Think it over.

131
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,780
I know he has his issues, but I can handle it.

132
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,660
Haven't I given him a decent severance?

133
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,420
That's not the point.

134
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,380
I'm just worried that

135
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,420
if you let him go,

136
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,740
it might hurt the team's morale.

137
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,220
Don't worry.

138
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,220
It won't.

139
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,260
Everyone, listen up.

140
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Today,

141
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,260
I've made

142
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,620
a very painful decision.

143
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,180
I've just let go of

144
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,980
an old employee who started the business with me.

145
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,620
Why did I let him go?

146
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,020
It's simple.

147
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,740
He's been taking a high salary,

148
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,660
but he's gotten too comfortable.

149
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,420
He's no longer contributing to the company.

150
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,340
On top of that,

151
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,540
he's been lining his own pockets.

152
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,420
I, Yao Feng,

153
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,500
don't keep freeloaders.

154
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,580
And today, I've made another decision.

155
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,180
The team in charge of launching new product,

156
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,940
besides the year-end bonus,

157
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,900
will get a 20% salary increase

158
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,020
starting next month.

159
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,420
Good.

160
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,820
Well said.

161
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,180
Darling,

162
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,540
this isn't the same cheongsam you wore last time, right?

163
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,740
By the way, how's the charity going?

164
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,020
I've stopped doing it.

165
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,500
I understand.

166
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,020
Not everyone can keep up with

167
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,160
this self-sacrificial act of helping others.

168
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,370
By the way,

169
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,260
our company's in-house lawyer is on leave for a few days.

170
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,870
I've got something I need to consult you about.

171
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,420
I'll pay you of course.

172
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,820
Let me send you a screenshot of the contract.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,180
Can I have your WeChat?

174
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,390
Sure.

175
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
Ms. Lan,

176
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,020
your company's in-house lawyer

177
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,260
hasn't come back yet?

178
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,900
Mr. Hu,

179
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm borrowing your big lawyer for a bit.

180
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,780
You won't mind, right?

181
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,580
When my wife was a lawyer,

182
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,460
she handled all the big cases in the company.

183
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,220
She charged by the minute,

184
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,260
you know.

185
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,860
Well then,

186
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,940
how about a friendship discount?

187
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,540
I told you,

188
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,740
my wife doesn't drink.

189
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,940
Ms. Lan,

190
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,220
actually, I'm pretty familiar with

191
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,620
your company's situation.

192
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,980
I'll be free the day after tomorrow afternoon.

193
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,620
You can come by Yao Feng.

194
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,060
I'll have our legal team

195
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,620
go over the contract for you.

196
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,220
Honey,

197
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,580
can you check if Ziyuan is asleep?

198
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,100
Sure, I'll go check.

199
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,100
Enjoy your meal.

200
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,460
Cheers, Ms. Lan.

201
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,300
Cheers.

202
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,740
If that's the case,

203
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,900
it's great.

204
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Indeed, this way,

205
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,780
our three-party cooperation will bring more benefits.

206
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,780
- Rest assured. I'll handle it.
- Exactly.

207
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
Sure.

208
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,500
I'll leave it to you.

209
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,860
No problem.

210
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,420
Ms. Lan,

211
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,460
you can trust Mr. Zhou.

212
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,340
Okay.

213
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,420
Cheng is responsible for supervising me.

214
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,380
He's my boss.

215
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,070
I'll go cut up some fruit for you all.

216
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,300
You changed your clothes.

217
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,700
It's too tight.

218
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,780
Alright, Mr. Hu,

219
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,740
We're leaving.

220
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,980
- Okay, then.
- Alright.

221
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,540
I'll walk Ms. Lan and the others out.

222
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,100
- Bye.
- Yue, bye.

223
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,510
- Don't you want some fruit before you go?
- Yue.

224
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,900
- No, we're good.
- Thanks for hosting us.

225
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,180
We're full already.

226
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,580
Zhou Wei,

227
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,780
why do I feel like

228
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,620
Mr. Hu

229
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,540
doesn't really like me interacting too much with his wife?

230
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,820
No way.

231
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,060
You're overthinking it.

232
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,260
No WeChat,

233
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,860
no drinking,

234
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,870
and I'm the one overthinking?

235
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,300
Mr. Hu,

236
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,620
He just loves his wife very much.

237
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,660
That's how he protects his family.

238
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,180
Stop looking at it.

239
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,020
It'll get better.

240
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
Honey,

241
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,060
you drank.

242
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,260
I did.

243
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,540
You know

244
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,740
I don't want you to drink.

245
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,820
My wife is the best.

246
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,100
(Qi Ming Law Firm Qin Can Practicing Lawyer)

247
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,940
A fine case of biting the hand that feeds.

248
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,900
Mr. Qin, honestly,

249
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,940
my request is pretty simple.

250
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,300
I just want to

251
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,420
get more compensation.

252
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,380
Mr. Song,

253
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,980
I can't guarantee anything

254
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,380
unless we have solid evidence.

255
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,060
But if what you say is true

256
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,740
and the evidence is sufficient,

257
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,260
I believe I can help you seek justice.

258
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,460
Make sure to handle things well with the hospital,

259
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,980
especially the cost issues.

260
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,580
Everything needs to

261
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,740
be resolved properly.

262
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,700
No more complications.

263
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,940
Don't worry, Mr. Hu.

264
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,020
I'll take care of it.

265
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,740
I've already arranged

266
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,180
everything in Shanghai.

267
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,020
After you finish this,

268
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,420
you can head there immediately.

269
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,740
After some time,

270
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,380
if you want to return to the company, you're welcome to.

271
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,340
Alright.

272
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,220
- Zhu.
- Mr. Zhou.

273
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,320
Long time no see.

274
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,460
Mr. Hu.

275
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,100
Mr. Zhou, I'll take my leave.

276
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,060
When did Zhu return to the company?

277
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,940
Didn't you assign him to the service station

278
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,100
to look after Yue?

279
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,580
Yue isn't there anymore,

280
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,980
so I think

281
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,450
we don't need the station anymore.

282
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,220
By the way,

283
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,540
Song's lawyer will be arriving soon.

284
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,330
Do you still want to meet him in person?

285
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,980
This needs to be handled cautiously.

286
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,260
Let's see what they have to say.

287
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.

288
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,300
I got delayed by a meeting.

289
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,980
Pour them a glass of water.

290
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,140
Mr. Hu, nice to meet you.

291
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,740
(Qin Can)
I'm Mr. Song's attorney.

292
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,100
Qin Can.

293
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,380
Hu Cheng from Yao Feng Technology.

294
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,000
I didn’t expect Song

295
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,900
to hire such a young lawyer.

296
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,340
Please, have a seat.

297
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,260
I was going

298
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,220
to let my lawyer talk to you directly,

299
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,540
but then I figured

300
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,580
I'd better say a few words myself.

301
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,740
I am not

302
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,220
an unscrupulous capitalist.

303
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,300
Mr. Song

304
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,900
is a veteran employee of ours.

305
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,860
What he's contributed to the company

306
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,420
I've kept them in my heart.

307
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,620
During his hospitalization

308
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,820
and surgery,

309
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,940
you can check,

310
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,180
our company provided him with a lot of support,

311
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,820
That's the rights he should have under labor laws.

312
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,780
I'm a busy man

313
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,620
and don't have time to argue here.

314
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,980
What I want to say is,

315
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,980
during Mr. Song's employment,

316
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,420
there were no personal grievances

317
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,260
between us.

318
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,860
We fairly, reasonably, and lawfully terminated

319
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,500
an employee who no longer brought any value to the company,

320
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,540
and we gave him full compensation.

321
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,140
And what did we get in return?

322
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,820
His betrayal

323
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,940
and gross slander

324
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,340
have put my company

325
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,980
at great risk.

326
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,180
I won't tolerate it,

327
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,380
nor will I let this kind of thing happen.

328
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,830
An incapable employee gets dismissed

329
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,460
and then retaliates against the company.

330
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,620
If I allow this precedent,

331
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,180
how will I answer to my employees in the future?

332
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,500
What I must do

333
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
is to protect the company's interests,

334
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,420
and the interests of every employee in this company.

335
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,250
Alright.

336
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,620
I've said my piece.

337
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,420
You two

338
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,820
can handle the rest.

339
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,380
Mr. Hu, wait.

340
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,820
I hope you're prepared.

341
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,460
We do not accept a settlement.

342
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,180
Nonsense.

343
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,380
Song must have acted rashly.

344
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,580
Today.

345
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,700
I'll go talk to him again today.

346
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,260
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Hu,

347
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,460
Ms. Tian.

348
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,900
our legal department has a contract

349
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,620
that needs Mr. Hu's review.

350
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,020
Alright,

351
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,310
you all go ahead and talk.

352
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,460
Why didn’t you let me know you were coming?

353
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,820
Upset?

354
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,340
That's okay.

355
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,060
I know how to cheer you up.

356
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,900
This is

357
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,100
the compensation Mr. Hu is giving you.

358
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,380
You must accept it.

359
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Don't worry,

360
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,780
I'll settle all your hospital bills.

361
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,580
(Emergency Observation Room)

362
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,140
Ms. Ho,

363
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,700
The one who just came in was my colleague Zhu, right?

364
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,340
What was he here for?

365
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,460
Ms. Ning,

366
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
Let's just end this here.

367
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,500
My family doesn't want to see you anymore.

368
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,150
Please don't come again.

369
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,500
Sorry,

370
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,420
The number you've dialed is temporarily unavailable.

371
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,940
Zhu,

372
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,180
Zhu,

373
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,860
Zhu!

374
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,940
Didn't you say she wouldn't come here?

375
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,820
She hasn't come before.

376
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,140
She doesn't come to check up on things.

377
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,700
So why are you so nervous?

378
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,500
It has nothing to do with checking up.

379
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,290
Then what does it have to do with?

380
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,020
I don't like surprises.

381
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,760
If you're coming next time,

382
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,820
let me know in advance.

383
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,820
It's going to rain.

384
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,740
Let me drive you back.

385
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,140
Okay.

386
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,460
Do you enjoy

387
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,580
this kind of thrill

388
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,860
that something's always at your beck and call?

389
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,660
The things I raise,

390
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,620
why can't I control them?

391
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,540
Honey,

392
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,020
What's wrong?

393
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,860
Why do you

394
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
look so down?

395
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,620
Why did Zhu give Ms. Ho money?

396
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,420
You already know?

397
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,740
What else are you hiding from me?

398
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,540
Where's Zhu?

399
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,780
Zhu is my employee.

400
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,500
I intentionally arranged for him to go to the service station.

401
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,220
I thought

402
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,180
since you haven't worked for a while,

403
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,660
you might have trouble adjusting.

404
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,300
I wanted to have someone who can look after you.

405
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,260
And as for

406
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,900
the incident with Congcong getting hurt,

407
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,020
it has nothing to do with you.

408
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,340
Even Congcong's mom knows this.

409
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,820
She's just taking her anger out on you.

410
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,140
I gave her money for two reasons.

411
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,700
First,

412
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,780
she'll stop talking online.

413
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,660
Second,

414
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,180
I think, taking the child into account,

415
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,180
it's right

416
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,460
to close this chapter for you.

417
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,960
Honey,

418
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,620
the reason I didn't tell you earlier

419
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,310
was because I didn't want

420
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,900
to put too much pressure on you

421
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,620
or

422
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,100
make you upset.

423
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,580
Actually,

424
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,780
Niuniu's mom was also arranged by me.

425
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,220
I admit,

426
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,340
I've been a bit over-involved.

427
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,700
But

428
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,620
I just want you to be happy.

429
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,820
Honey,

430
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
You've suffered these past few days.

431
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,620
I really want to share some of that burden.

432
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,820
Is there anything else?

433
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,500
What else do you want to know?

434
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,780
Confession gets leniency.

435
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,500
I confess.

436
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,660
Honey,

437
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,860
everything I do

438
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,340
is for you

439
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,740
and for this family.

440
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,620
Everything I do

441
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,860
is for you

442
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,420
and for this family.

443
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,260
Mom,

444
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,620
have some water.

445
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,500
Mr. Hu

446
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,180
really cares about your mother.

447
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,940
He calls every day to check on her.

448
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,300
I've never seen such a good son-in-law.

449
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,940
Isn't that right?

450
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,040
Since your mother fell last time,

451
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,080
Mr. Hu has been constantly reminding us,

452
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,620
saying we must make sure nothing happens to her again.

453
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,540
My son-in-law is a smart man.

454
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,380
He knows

455
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,300
that treating me well means treating my daughter well.

456
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,500
As for my son-in-law,

457
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,740
I would say

458
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,860
he's pretty much perfect.

459
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,820
I can’t find any faults.

460
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,660
That's what I'm talking about.

461
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,140
Mr. Zhou,

462
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,540
Mr. Zhou.

463
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,500
The contract with Ms. Lan is brilliant.

464
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,900
You've brought the company tremendous profits.

465
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,140
Great job!

466
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,460
Cheng,

467
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,980
about Song,

468
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,580
considering Yao Feng is preparing to go public,

469
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,940
we should give him more compensation.

470
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,900
It's better to settle this peacefully.

471
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,340
He's already promised me

472
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,940
he won't cause us any more trouble.

473
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,340
He'll sign the settlement agreement and send it to me today.

474
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,860
Mr. Zhou

475
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,100
I'll leave everything

476
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,020
to you to handle.

477
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,100
I knew you

478
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,020
was magnanimous

479
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,100
and tolerant,

480
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,060
with great composure.

481
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,980
What's been settled?

482
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,380
You heard me.

483
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,250
It's been settled.

484
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Mr. Song, given Mr. Hu Cheng's usual style and demeanor,

485
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,820
I don't believe he'll give you a fair and satisfactory result.

486
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
And such case,

487
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,070
if he's not punished as he should be,

488
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,060
will continue

489
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,780
to happen at Yao Feng Technology.

490
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,260
Does Mr. Hu get something on you?

491
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,860
If so, tell me everything.

492
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,620
I'll make sure we win this lawsuit.

493
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,420
You're absolutely right

494
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,840
about fairness and justice.

495
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
I totally agree.

496
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,100
But Yao Feng's standing in the industry

497
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,400
is something I can't afford to offend.

498
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,540
I have a family to feed,

499
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
and I'm already dealing with my own health problems.

500
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,860
So all the overtime and late nights

501
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,220
we’ve put in recently

502
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,900
will go to waste?

503
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,260
Mr. Qin,

504
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,660
I appreciate it.

505
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,820
As for…

506
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,340
the fees we discussed earlier,

507
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,460
I'll pay them in full.

508
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,300
Alright?

509
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,020
Really, thank you so much.

510
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,770
- You've worked hard.
- Wait. Let me pour you a glass of water.

511
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
It's not about the fees.

512
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,790
It's that Hu Cheng should have been punished...

513
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,420
Li!

514
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,540
Are you okay?

515
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,740
(Haikang Hospital)

516
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,500
He already has a stomach ulcer.

517
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
How could you let him work overtime like this?

518
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,940
He can't even guarantee

519
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,260
a basic regular diet

520
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,220
right now.

521
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,900
From the preliminary results

522
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,100
of the gastroscopy,

523
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,220
the ulcer has already developed into a proliferative lesion.

524
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,100
The nature of it still needs further tests

525
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,740
to make a proper judgment.

526
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,660
Are you vampires?

527
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,460
Draining people dry…

528
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,780
Isn’t that enough?

529
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,540
Sorry, madam,

530
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,620
We'll cover all of Li's medical expenses.

531
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,580
Money, money, money.

532
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,220
All you care about is money.

533
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,780
I'm sorry.

534
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,380
Ms. Lan, this project…

535
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,900
It's not easy for us

536
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,860
to collaborate smoothly

537
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,100
and sign the contract.

538
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,380
- No, it's not.
- Cheers.

539
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,180
- Cheers.
- To a successful partnership.

540
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,000
- To a happy collaboration.

541
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,300
Thank you, Ms. Lan, for your trust.

542
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,740
We'll do our best.

543
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,380
- Let's work hard together.
- Sure.

544
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,290
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

545
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,300
Enjoy the meal.

546
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
Try this.

547
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,940
This was made by Yue.

548
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,500
My wife is a pretty good cook.

549
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,020
Yue is really impressive now.

550
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,780
- Ms. Lan.
- Zhou Wei, have more.

551
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,900
- Okay.
- Thank you.

552
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,660
Ms. Lan.

553
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,060
- Help yourself.
- Okay.

554
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,860
Mr. Hu, I toast to you.

555
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,300
I hope we have more opportunities to work together in the future.

556
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,740
Yeah, yeah, more communication.

557
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,100
Definitely.

558
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,880
(Your husband is staying at my home. Why haven't you divorced him yet?)

559
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,800
Cheers.

560
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,460
This wine's pretty good.

561
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,540
Yue,

562
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,020
you took the wrong phone.

563
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,340
Sorry about that.

564
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,440
No problem, I often grab the wrong phone too.

565
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,540
My job is to take care of you.

566
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,380
That last project...

567
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,420
Yue, what's wrong?

568
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
Honey.

569
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,500
Excuse me, nature calls.

570
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,740
Cheers.

571
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,180
Thank you for leading us.

572
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,340
Yue,

573
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,660
that text message earlier

574
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,940
was from my best friend.

575
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,740
She's just messing with me.

576
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,340
Actually,

577
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,340
I didn't even read it clearly.

578
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,620
Honestly,

579
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,860
my relationship with my husband is pretty good.

580
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,660
A message like that,

581
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,900
how could that be?

582
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,100
Right?

583
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,060
(Back in the car)

584
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,180
Honey,

585
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,340
what did Ms. Lan talk to you about?

586
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,460
Affair.

587
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,620
Her husband…

588
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,940
You knew about that already?

589
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,300
I just found out.

590
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,100
Her husband

591
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
is bad news.

592
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,100
I don't understand,

593
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,460
why would such a capable woman like Ms. Lan

594
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,700
put up with it?

595
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,820
Maybe it's because

596
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,940
their interests are so deeply tied together.

597
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,740
Some things,

598
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,490
if you don't deal with them,

599
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,620
they don’t exist.

600
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,660
Ms. Lan is a smart woman,

601
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,820
she knows what's what.

602
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,420
I'm not that smart,

603
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,260
and I don't want to

604
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,780
be like her.

605
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,660
Honey,

606
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,500
how could I let you be like her?

607
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,060
When you used to watch horror movies,

608
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,300
You'd always hug me.

609
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,340
Why…

610
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,780
Why aren't you scared today?

611
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,340
Who told you

612
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,580
I hugged you

613
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,900
because I was scared?

617
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,980
to settle with us

618
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,220
must have surprised you.

619
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,980
You're an ambitious person.

620
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,340
You want to defeat me, an evil capitalist,

621
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,060
to show off your heroism.

622
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,700
Let me give you a piece of advice:

623
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,700
Try some creative work

624
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,380
or write articles criticizing the world.

625
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,260
That'll be more helpful

626
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,940
to achieve your ideals.

627
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,700
Goodbye.

628
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,180
I hope you can approve.

Qin,

632
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,100
in just five years,

633
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
you've gone from assistant

634
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,220
to a senior lawyer.

635
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,700
You've worked hard,

636
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,980
and your professional skills

637
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,640
are outstanding.

638
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,860
You're now a role model for those interns.

639
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,180
But I feel ashamed.

640
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,300
I watch my clients suffer unfairness,

641
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,340
yet can't provide them

642
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
with practical help.

643
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,740
As their lawyer,

644
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,260
I feel powerless.

645
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,060
Qin,

646
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,060
you're still too young,

647
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,420
and you view things too one-sidedly.

648
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,300
You still need more experience

649
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,180
to grow and improve.

650
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,620
Anyway,

are the prettiest.

do you know

681
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,660
why we trim the water plants?

682
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,340
Because if you don't trim them,

683
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,900
they’ll take nutrients from others,

684
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,620
occupy their resources.

because
