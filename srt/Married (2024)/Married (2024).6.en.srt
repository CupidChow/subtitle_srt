Yes,

4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,990
I kept it open for you all along.

5
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,200
But then your

6
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,110
severe postpartum depression

7
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,550
made it impossible for you to return.

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,160
How did you

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,310
hear about this?

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,470
Your husband told us.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,840
My husband?

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,190
Please give us your full support.

13
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,230
Please.

14
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,510
It's quite lively here.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,840
I'll be heading back first.

16
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,030
Director Qin,

17
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not sure if there's any

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,750
grudge between you two,

19
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,600
but he already gave us an out.

20
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,320
Why not just clear the air

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
and talk it out?

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,510
Even if you don't want

23
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,600
to save face for him,

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,630
couldn't you save some for me?

25
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,470
Mr. Chen,

26
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,350
is it inappropriate for you to meet
with clients privately like this, repeatedly?

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,160
We're long-term partners.

28
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,050
Partnerships require
communication and understanding

29
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,000
to deepen the collaboration,

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
don't they?

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,750
- Mr. Chen.
- Manager Tian.

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,560
Hi, I'm Tian Qiuzi
from Ruixin Investment Bank.

33
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,470
Did he also say

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,720
that I had severe postpartum depression

35
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,790
and violent tendencies,

36
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,230
and that I could

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,670
harm people around me,

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,840
including my child?

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,880
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,440
I'm not surprised at all.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,910
This is exactly
the kind of thing he would do.

42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,100
(Yaofeng Tech Appreciation Banquet)
Sorry for being a bit late today.

43
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,070
No worries.

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,600
The traffic must have been heavy today.

45
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,470
Thank you for your hard work
during this time.

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,520
I apologize for any lack of care.

47
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,720
Excuse me for a moment.

48
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,750
This project,

49
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,750
Manager Tian's been a great help to us.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
- It's my duty.
- The investments have been made.

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,950
We're just waiting for Director Qin

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,630
to approve the contract.

53
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,440
We'll be counting on you, Director Qin.

54
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,600
It's not the first time
we've collaborated with Mr. Hu.

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,350
Every time, the results
have been satisfactory,

56
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,160
a true win-win situation.

57
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,560
This time, we've shown our

58
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,670
utmost sincerity to Zhongzhi Group.

59
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,040
Whether it's the planning,

60
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,600
feasibility,

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,840
or efficiency,

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,230
everything has been top-notch.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
Mr. Hu.

64
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Mr. Chen.

65
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,190
This collaboration
is quite large in scale.

66
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,440
Being cautious is

67
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,750
for the benefit of the company.

68
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,320
Given Director Qin's capabilities,

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
even with caution,

70
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,750
there should be results by now.

Dragging things out

72
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,400
like this

73
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,470
makes your company seem

74
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,040
insincere about the collaboration.

75
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,030
Mr. Hu,

76
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,190
I'm just following

77
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,190
the standard audit procedures.

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,000
If you feel there's a delay,

79
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,560
it's certainly not on my end.

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,420
Everyone here

81
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,380
has been my partner for years.

82
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,260
Are you suggesting

83
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,860
all of them have issues?

84
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,300
I'm not sure about others,

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,620
but I've studied

86
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,340
your style and behavior

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,460
carefully.

88
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,020
It didn't come in handy before,

89
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,860
but this time,

90
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,460
I need to be cautious.

91
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,340
Director Qin,

92
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,420
you've already successfully
transitioned your career.

93
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,180
Then do it with grace.

94
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,980
Why dwell on the past?

95
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Wouldn't it be better to embark

96
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,780
on a pleasant collaboration?

97
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,860
To a fruitful collaboration.

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,900
Mr. Hu, it's about time.

99
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,220
Then

100
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,140
I'll be leaving now.

101
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
Mr. Hu.

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,420
Ms. Jiang.

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

104
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,660
My apologies,

105
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,540
I've been very busy recently.

106
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,980
I've been meaning

107
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,740
to invite you to my home.

108
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,500
Thank you for looking after my wife.

109
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,500
Actually, I wanted to ask you.

110
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,140
Didn't you mention that your wife
was planning to work with us?

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,820
She hasn't reached out to me yet.

112
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,500
You're saying

113
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,140
my wife

114
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,140
hasn't contacted you at all?

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,020
That's right.

119

Mr. Hu Cheng,

120

President of Yaofeng Tech,

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,980
to deliver a speech.

122
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,060
A round of applause, please.

123
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Honored

00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,460
dear investors

126
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,260
and friends,

127
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,500
thank you all for being here.

128
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,540
Yaofeng Tech

129
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,820
will continue to lead

130
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,660
at the forefront of technology.

131
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,980
At the same time,
we will strengthen our products

132
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,740
to provide

133
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,780
the best services and maximum benefits

134
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,380
to all our customers

135
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,220
and investors.

136
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,460
Today, I feel deeply moved.

137
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,780
I've weathered countless storms

138
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,980
to make it to where we are today.

139
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,860
It wouldn't have been possible
without your support and trust,

140
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,220
and especially without

141
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,260
the help of a very important friend.

142
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,220
Though she's new in her role,

143
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,820
she has immense potential.

144
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,940
And

145
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,780
she's also

146

193
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,260
Thank you, honey.

194
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,380
You should have told me earlier.

195
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,620
I did mention it before,

196
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,420
but you were so busy at the time,

197
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,380
you didn't notice.

198
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,780
That being said,

199
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,780
being an assistant

200
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,460
feels a bit beneath you.

201
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,140
How about

202
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,060
I talk to Xia and see

203
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,620
if we can reopen the center?

204
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,460
Honey,

205
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,760
this time

206
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,420
I want to

207
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,500
try relying on my own strength.

208
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,060
Honey,

209
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,170
just promise me

210
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,060
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

211
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,730
Think about it,

212
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,100
you've been out of the workforce
for five years.

213
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,540
It's normal to feel

214
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,580
out of depth at first.

215
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,820
Anyway,

216
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,220
just remember,

217
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,900
you're the wife of Yaofeng's boss,

218
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,700
and a happy mother.

219
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,620
That should give you confidence.

220
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,940
No matter what happens,

221
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,980
you still have me.

222
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,820
Ziyuan, say bye-bye to Daddy.

223
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,100
Daddy, bye-bye!

224
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,940
Bye-bye!

225
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,540
Listen to your teacher, okay?

226
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,780
Okay.

227
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,140
Honey, see you tonight.

228
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,140
See you tonight.

229
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,100
- Alright, we're off!
- Bye-bye.

230
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,100
Bye-bye.

231
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,740
Mr. Chen,

232
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,420
I want to ask you something.

233
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,380
My wife, Ning Yue, recently

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,860
joined the Legal Department at Zhongzhi.

235
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,060
Who?

236
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,940
Qin Can?

237
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,860
She's working directly under him?

238
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
Okay.

239
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,580
Got it. Thank you.

240
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,660
Looks like Director Qin and I

241
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,780
are truly fated to cross paths.

242
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,900
Director.

243
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,980
Do you have a moment?

244
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,140
Have a seat.

245
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,220
Okay.

246
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,180
Just now,

247
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,220
someone from the Procurement Department
came by again,

248
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,620
still asking about
Yaofeng Tech's contract.

249
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,940
You saw the contract
Yaofeng sent back this morning.

250
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,260
Do you think we can approve it?

251
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,580
What's the point of rushing?

252
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,340
If there's an issue with the contract,

253
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,190
will the Procurement Department
take responsibility?

254
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,740
All the other contracts
have already been approved.

255
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,220
Yaofeng's is the only one left.

256
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,060
Look.

257
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,940
There's no harm in being a little slow

258
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,540
about Yaofeng's contract.

259
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,980
Director Qin,

260
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,020
enjoying yourself, aren't you?

261
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,620
Mr. Hu,

262
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,460
I'm not like you.

263
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,380
I've always

264
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,340
kept my work
and personal life separate.

265
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,100
Outside of the office,

266
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,420
I don't discuss work.

267
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,460
The contract is going through
the normal process.

268
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,700
There's no need for you
to worry so much.

269
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,460
Let's not talk about work today.

270
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,020
Look at

271
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,260
this beautiful scenery.

272
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,780
It's perfect for clearing up

273
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,140
misunderstandings.

274
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,220
Whether or not

275
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,660
we end up working together,

276
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,250
we could at least become friends.

277
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,840
We're not the same kind of people.

278
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,230
We can't be friends.

279
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,060
Why isn't the fish biting yet?

280
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,260
Looks like I'll have to change spots.

281
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,100
A small fish,

282
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,940
what a shame.

283
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,180
You're too impatient.

284
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,780
The fish hasn't even
gotten familiar with you,

285
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,140
and you're already
moving to another spot.

286
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,260
You might end up

287
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,700
becoming the big fish instead.

288
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,700
Who says I can't catch a big fish?

289
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,580
Director Qin,

290
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,100
whether or not we become friends,

291
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,500
I have one request for you.

292
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,460
Please,

293
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,820
don't mix personal grudges
with business.

294
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,940
Mr. Hu, I've already told you,

295
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,880
the contract is being processed.

296
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm not talking about that.

297
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,940
My wife, Ning Yue,

298
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,660
recently joined Zhongzhi Group

299
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,020
as your assistant.

300
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,620
If you have any issues with me

301
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,820
or want to target me,

302
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,140
I can take it.

303
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,820
It's fine.

304
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,210
But

305
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,960
I don't want her to get caught up in it

306
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,820
because of me.

307
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,100
Especially since

308
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,300
she's been dealing with
some very difficult things lately.

309
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,000
Her heart is very fragile right now.

310
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,740
What's Yue been through?

311
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,340
This place is beautiful.

312
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,530
Mommy, Mommy,

313
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,100
look at the sunset!

314
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,260
Mommy,

315
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,980
I don't like the sun going down.

316
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,340
Why not?

317
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,760
Because it'll get dark.

318
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,820
Mommy,

319
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,620
I hate the dark.

320
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,920
Ziyuan,

321
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,980
don't be afraid of the dark.

322
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,620
The more scared you are,

323
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,340
the darker

324
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,140
it will feel.

325
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,780
Be brave.

326
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,500
The sky will brighten again very soon.

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,180
I'd like to introduce to you all,

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
my wife,

333
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,460
Ning Yue.

334
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,780
My husband is the pillar of our family,

335
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,380
the protector of me and my son.

336
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,940
Honey, I'm so grateful to you

337
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,540
for giving me everything
I've ever wanted.

338
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,380
No one can replace you.

339
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,580
Our family has been together
for five years.

340
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,420
For the next five years,

341
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,420
and the five years after that,

342
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,700
I want to always,

343
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,660
always be by your side.

344
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,500
Don't close the door.

345
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,820
Leave it open.

346
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,220
Why are you here?

347
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,780
My grandma is almost ninety.

348
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,780
I'd like to take you to meet her.

349
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,420
Does your grandma know about me?

350
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,980
Don't worry,

351
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,300
she's already quite senile.

352
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,220
Even if she knows you,
it won't bother her much.

353
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,420
I've told you before,

354
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,840
I've been closest to my grandma
since I was young.

355
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,900
She's my only family.

356
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,020
Now that she's so old,

357
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,020
her only wish

358
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,580
is to see me happy.

359
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,020
I'm not asking you

360
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,700
to make any immediate decisions.

361
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,420
Just to meet the person dearest to me.

362
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,060
Alright,

363
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,100
when I have time...

364
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,420
Next time we meet,

365
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,220
we'll go.

366
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,900
What's wrong?

367
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Weren't you saying
you wanted to be closer to me,

368
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,020
to understand me better?

369
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,220
You should go first.

370
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,020
I'll think about it.

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,020
Alright, we'll go then.

380
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,830
Didn't you eat?

381
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,740
I just got here

382
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,380
and don't know what's good around here.

383
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,500
Qin, how many times have I told you?

384
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,700
Just walk over and put it in.

385
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,740
Is that so hard?

386
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,060
Sorry,

387
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,580
I slipped back into our old dynamic.

388
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,300
It's fine, Yue.

389
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,340
Still the same bad aim.

390
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,180
Jiaojiao,

391
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,140
the teacher just called.

392
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,660
Your parent will be here soon.

393
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,420
Wait a little longer, okay?

394
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,380
Teacher,

395
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll play with Qin Jiaojiao.

396
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,860
Good job, Ziyuan!

397
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,060
Jiaojiao, you're a good girl.

398
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,460
You two play nicely here.

399
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,740
I will be back soon.

400
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
Qin Jiaojiao,

401
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,580
time to go home!

402
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,100
Qin Jiaojiao,

403
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,420
you look like a koala bear!

404
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,580
You should get here too!

405
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,420
Okay.

406
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,500
Have you two ever played a game

407
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,340
called "Spin Around"?

408
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,180
One, two, go!

409
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,170
Spinning!

410
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,410
- Ziyuan.
- Spinning!

411
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,340
Ziyuan, get down!

412
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,650
Come here!

413
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,820
Feeling dizzy?

414
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,300
This is dangerous, you know?

415
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,860
Don't play like this again.

416
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,560
Qin?

417
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,040
Is this your son?

418
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,660
Slow down.

419
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,540
So, you're Jiaojiao's parent?

420
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,660
Her mom called me

421
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,060
to pick her up.

422
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,940
She said she feels guilty
about missing her birthday.

423
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,710
Normally, she doesn't even
need me to pick her up.

424
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,810
I'm swinging higher than you!

425
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Normally,

426
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,540
you're always off work on time.

427
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,420
Why can't you
pick up the child yourself?

428
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,540
Director Qin,

429
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,180
I've wanted

430
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,220
to meet Jiaojiao's family.

431
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,180
Even though she's still young,

432
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,420
she's forming memories now.

433
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,740
If she feels hurt,

434
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,940
those memories could last a lifetime.

435
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
That's a bit much.

436
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,900
Director Qin,

437
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,740
I know being a father at your age

438
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,460
is a little early,

439
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,860
but since you're already a parent,

440
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,180
- you should...
- You've misunderstood.

441
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,700
Uncle!

442
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,380
Look at me swing so high!

443
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,700
Be careful!

444
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,380
I'm swinging higher!

445
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,860
Sorry about that.

446
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,340
I really misunderstood.

447
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,820
You see, I'm swinging higher!

448
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,220
I was just complimenting you,

449
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,420
saying you look young.

450
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,340
At your age, being a father

451
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,220
is really quite young.

452
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,340
- It's a compliment.
- Yue.

453
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,660
I've been meaning to ask you.

454
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,110
Why did you stay at Zhongzhi?

455
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,270
To earn a billion, maybe?

456
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,060
Given your family background

457
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,260
and abilities,

458
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,620
you don't need
to start from such a basic position.

459
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,580
I went through some things before.

460
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,820
If you're talking about
that online storm,

461
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,700
you could wait for things to calm down

462
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,540
before returning to work.

463
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,460
I don't want to wait.

464
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,980
Why not?

465
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,390
- The longer I wait,
- See? I could swing higher!

466
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,300
the fewer opportunities I'll have.

467
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,940
I'm doing better than you.

468
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,180
- Yue.
- And higher than you.

469
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,460
We're not at the office now.

470
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,180
I hope you can tell me the truth.

471
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,740
What I'm telling you is the truth.

472
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,290
Like 10,000 times

473
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,330
- Jiaojiao.
- higher than you.

474
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,420
Let's go home.

475
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,740
Go.

476
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,820
Goodbye, Qin Jiaojiao.

477
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,780
Goodbye, Uncle.

478
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,660
Bye-bye!

479
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,000
Goodbye, Auntie!

480
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,220
Goodbye, Hu Ziyuan!

481
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,180
Goodbye!

482
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,540
Mommy,

483
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,100
why didn't Uncle say goodbye?

484
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,940
Because he

485
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,100
has bad manners.

486
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,660
Let's go.

487
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,140
(Baiyao Rude Co., Ltd.)

488
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,740
Honey,

489
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,380
is your department leader

490
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,140
giving you a hard time?

491
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,620
Why are you asking that?

492
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,060
I didn't expect

493
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,820
the world to be so small.

494
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,460
Your leader,

495
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,100
his last name is Qin, right?

496
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,100
Yeah.

497
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,660
He used to work as a proxy lawyer
for one of my subordinates.

498
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,540
He even had the audacity to sue me!

499
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,700
Of course,

500
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,260
he lost the case.

501
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,980
But who knew?

502
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,700
This guy is petty and small-minded.

503
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,220
He's probably still bitter about it.

504
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,660
Qin isn't that kind
of vindictive person.

505
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,060
How would you know that?

506
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,860
He used to work as my assistant.

507
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,140
When was this?

508
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,260
When I was working at the law firm.

509
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
How interesting.

510
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,140
The little junior from five years ago
is now your boss.

511
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
Honey,

512
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,460
I don't see why

513
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,140
you need to endure
this kind of humiliation.

514
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,820
I'm working on a project
with Zhongzhi right now,

515
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,660
and he's been holding up
my contract relentlessly,

516
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,260
refusing to approve it.

517
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,820
What does this even mean?

518
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,860
This is blatant revenge.

519
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,740
Of course, I went to talk to him.

520
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,460
I told him,

521
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,260
"Do whatever you want to me,

522
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,580
but don't make things
difficult for my wife."

523
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,540
Honey,

524
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,860
why don't you just quit and come home?

525
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,780
Why give him the chance
to retaliate against you?

526
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,540
No matter what, even if I leave,

527
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,900
I want it to be

528
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,100
because I was let go,

529
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,450
not because

530
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,020
I resigned on my own.

531
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,780
Alright, alright.

532
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,060
Fine.

533
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,940
Whatever you decide, I'll support you.

534
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,380
Come in.

535
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,700
Director Qin,

536
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
yesterday you asked me
why I came to Zhongzhi.

537
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,420
Whether you believe it or not,

538
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,060
I want to tell you

539
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,340
this job is very important to me.

540
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,420
Why is it important?

541
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,220
I want to prove myself.

542
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,660
I want to have my own place
in the world.

543
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,260
You could do legal aid work.

544
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,620
That would also fulfill your goals.

545
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,980
Besides,

546
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,580
it's not like you need the salary.

547
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,540
Director Qin,

548
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,860
if you remember anything
from our time

549
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,300
working together five years ago,

550
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,980
I hope you can trust me.

551
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,420
I'm still the same person.

552
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,140
I haven't changed.

553
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,980
Please stick to your own judgment

554
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,540
and don't let anyone else influence you.

555
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,300
Hello? Boss.

556
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,340
Tian,

557
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,740
I have a dinner meeting
with Yaofeng Tech tonight.

558
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,100
Join us.

559
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,340
Alright, Boss, I'll be there.

560
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,300
Not sure what tricks he's been up to.

561
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,140
Mr. Zhou.

562
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
Manager Tian, you are here!

563
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
Manager Tian.

564
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,700
Good evening.

565
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,060
Let me take you to your seat first.

566
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,900
Alright, thank you.

567
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,180
I'll just take this lovely lady with me.

568
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,020
Leaving your old friend alone now?

569
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,020
Catch you in a bit.

570
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,060
- This way, please.
- It's rare.

571
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,700
Mr. Hu is late today?

572
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,260
He had something come up.

573
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,100
He can't make it.

574
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,100
Does he have something urgent?

575
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,620
It's nothing major,

576
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
just family matters.

577
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
Please have a seat.

578
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,500
Manager Tian, you might not know.

579
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,500
Mr. Hu's a family-oriented person.

580
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,260
He often says that

581
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,700
only when the home front is secure

582
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,460
can the battle
at the front lines be won.

583
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,540
If there's ever a conflict
between family and other matters,

584
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,500
he would always choose family
without hesitation,

585
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,940
just like today.

586
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,860
I can see that.

587
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,820
Let me join them for a quick chat.

588
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,740
You can sit and relax.

589
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,820
Okay.

590
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,940
(Shangshi Center)

591
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,860
(Zhongzhi Group)

592
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,180
Director Qin,

593
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,300
let's wait a little longer, alright?

594
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,780
Who else are we waiting for?

595
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,260
I also invited

596
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,820
the project manager
from Ruixin Investment Bank.

597
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,740
Which project manager?

598
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,020
Manager Tian.

599
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
You've met her before.

600
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Why didn't you mention earlier
that she'd be coming?

601
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,660
This project

602
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,420
has already gone through meetings

603
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,580
with the other partner companies.

604
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,780
The contracts are finalized.

605
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,300
Now we just need to finalize ours.

606
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,340
Manager Tian is here

607
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,690
to ensure all the details are in place.

608
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,180
- And then...
- Mr. Chen, Director Qin,

609
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,460
sorry I'm late.

610
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,500
No problem, please have a seat.

611
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,620
Mrs. Hu,

612
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,780
long time no see.

613
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,900
Or should I call you Lawyer Ning now?

614
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,940
Miss Tian,

615
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,820
it's been a while.

616
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,300
You two know each other?

617
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,260
From Yaofeng Tech's
appreciation banquet,

618
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,140
remember?

619
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,340
Oh, right, right, I remember now.

620
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,540
Your words that day

621
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,180
really moved us.

622
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,140
You said you gave up your career

623
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,920
to stay home and take care
of your family for five years,

624
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,780
and now you're back in the workforce

625
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,860
to lighten your husband's burden.

626
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,180
It's truly admirable.

627
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,900
Miss Tian, I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

628
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,020
I returned to work

629
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,230
for myself.

630
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,180
Either way, it's a good thing.

631
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,380
Let's get started.

632
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,420
Okay.

633
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,740
I'll go over the plan first.

634
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,700
Let's wrap up here

635
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,860
for today.

636
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,500
Everything's ready now,

637
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,860
all we need is the final push.

638
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
So, Director Qin,

639
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,820
I hope

640
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,060
we can finalize the contract soon.

641
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,420
Once it's signed,

642
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,460
we can move forward
with the next steps,

643
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,420
- right?
- Yes.

644
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,460
Manager Tian will also

645
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
oversee the follow-up for this project.

646
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,540
If there are any issues
with the contract,

647
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,460
you can reach out
to Director Qin directly.

648
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,100
Got it, Mr. Chen. Thank you.

649
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,580
I have another meeting

650
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,540
to attend,

651
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,260
so I'll leave you to it.

652
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,980
Alright, Mr. Chen, take care.

653
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,780
I also have a few questions

654
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,300
I'd like to ask both of you.

655
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,060
Sure, you guys talk.

656
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

657
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,420
Manager Tian,
is there anything else unclear?

658
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,060
It's getting late,

659
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,380
almost time to clock out.

660
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,980
How about we discuss it over dinner?

661
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,220
There's a tea restaurant downstairs,

662
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,060
my treat.

663
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,660
I have a lot of work to handle tonight,

664
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,620
so I'll pass.

665
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,180
What about you,

666
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,020
Lawyer Ning?

667
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
I'm fine with it.

668
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,260
Alright,

669
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,170
let's go.

670
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,180
You didn't have to agree
to her invitation.

671
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,860
I need to eat anyway.

672
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,860
Come in.

673
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,580
Mr. Hu,

674
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,660
these are the photos from the banquet.

675
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,340
We've already done an initial selection.

676
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,380
All of them are original photos.

677
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,660
Let us know
which ones you're happy with,

678
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,780
and we'll proceed with post-editing.

679
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,020
(Yaofeng Tech Appreciation Banquet)

680
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,540
Thank you.

681
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,180
Lawyer Ning,

682
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,180
I see you haven't visited

683
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,180
the hair salon I recommended yet.

684
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,540
I haven't had time.

685
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,740
Work has been busy.

686
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,380
That's understandable, especially since
you just started your job.

687
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,100
Miss Tian,

688
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,260
what do you think

689
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,100
about Mr. Chen's project?

690
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,100
I think it's worth

691
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,340
taking a risk.

692
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,420
Really?

693
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,600
I believe we should be cautious.

694
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,780
So you're

695
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,420
the conservative type.

696
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,100
I wouldn't have guessed.

697
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,740
What do you mean?

698
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,780
From what I know about Mr. Hu,

699
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,740
he prefers taking big risks
for big wins

700
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,860
over settling for smaller,

701
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,820
stable gains.

702
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,260
I assumed you two would be alike.

703
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,060
Hu Cheng

704
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,260
himself is already a risk.

705
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,380
Someone has to keep him in check.

706
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,220
If a family has two risk-takers,

707
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,980
it'd be far too dangerous.

708
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,140
You're managing risks too?

709
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,990
Please, leave some work for us.

710
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,700
Miss Tian,

711
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,020
you're truly brave

712
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,020
and have a unique perspective.

713
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,860
In the past,

714
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,460
quite a few investment companies

715
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,340
had high hopes for Yaofeng Tech.

716
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,180
But in the end,

717
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,820
they all backed out.

718
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,620
Because they believed

719
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,980
they could manage the risks,

720
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,700
but in reality,

721
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,580
they couldn't.

722
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,020
It ended up backfiring.

723
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,060
The worst-case scenario?

724
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,020
They could lose everything,

725
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,500
and any losses from their investment

726
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,420
would have to be fully borne
by themselves.

727
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,260
But you're different, Miss Tian.

728
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,300
You're the only one

729
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,820
who sees the future
and potential of Yaofeng.

730
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,860
That's why I say

731
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,620
you're brave

732
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,980
and insightful.

733
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,260
I truly admire you.

734
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,740
It's not about bravery.

735
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,180
It's my job,

736
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,860
and I trust my own judgment.

737
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,060
Then you certainly won't regret it.

738
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,620
Check into this person's
background for me.

739
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,940
Got it, Mr. Hu.

740
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,900
I'll get on it right away.

741
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,700
(Honey, let me introduce a new friend.
I'll send you the address.)

742
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,180
Miss Tian, do you have a boyfriend?

743
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,220
Yes, I do.

744
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,100
My boyfriend

745
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,380
is also an entrepreneur,

746
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,820
just like Mr. Hu.

747
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,900
An entrepreneur?

748
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,620
That must be tough.

749
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,020
We met through work.

750
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,060
I'm an important partner
in his business,

751
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,780
and we're also well-matched
in other aspects.

752
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,970
But

753
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,620
there's one big problem

754
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,780
we need to resolve between us.

755
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,580
What's that?

756
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,500
It's a bit embarrassing to say.

757
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,780
His ex-girlfriend

758
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,740
won't stop clinging to him.

759
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,140
That's a tricky

760
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,020
situation.

761
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,100
But honestly,

762
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,060
I do feel sorry for her.

763
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,820
She's completely dependent
on my boyfriend to survive.

764
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,580
There are still people like that?

765
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,420
She's nothing like you, Lawyer Ning.

766
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Even though
you've been at home for years,

767
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,780
you're able to return to work
whenever you want.

768
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,340
But she's different.

769
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,580
She acts all high and mighty,

770
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,860
but deep down, she knows

771
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,860
without my boyfriend,

772
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,220
she's nothing.

773
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,420
She has nothing.

774
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,540
That's why

775
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,700
she doesn't dare to leave him.

776
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,460
That's easy to fix.

777
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,620
Once you two get married,

778
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,300
she'll give up.

779
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,460
She wouldn't stoop

780
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,900
to being a third wheel, right?
