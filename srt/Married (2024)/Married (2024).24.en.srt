3
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,880
I'm embarrassing.

4
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,990
It should have been me
treating the client to a meal,

5
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,830
letting him help me with the contract,

6
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,800
but now he's ended up

7
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,350
working at my place.

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,160
Can the client easily let you bribe him?

9
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,880
The dishes look great.

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,990
Stop playing, it's time to eat.

11
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,990
Come, Ziyuan, time to eat.

12
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,830
Jiaojiao.

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,670
I need to take a photo.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
This is too nice.

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
- Someone's being rude.
- Ziyuan.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,950
Why do I see you've already started?

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,010
- The adults haven't started yet.
- Has Mom announced it yet?

18
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,720
Wait a moment.

19
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,910
- Okay.
- Come on.

20
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,040
- OK.
- OK.

21
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,280
Let Mom announce it.

22
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,310
- It's time to eat now.
- OK.

23
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,350
Time to eat.

24
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,350
- Eat.
- Come on.

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,770
Uncle.

26
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,740
Uncle.

27
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,270
You haven't taken me out
to play in a while.

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,320
- OK.
- Uncle Qin,

29
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
I want to learn how to fish.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,880
How about we go

31
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,790
for a picnic this weekend?

32
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,030
Good.

33
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,910
Try to finish all your food, okay?

34
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,750
- OK.
- Drink up.

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,430
- I'll take you fishing this weekend.
- I just want to eat.

Daddy's over there.

43

Go on.

44
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,610
Go.

45
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,600

Daddy.

00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,400
Daddy.

48
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,280
I missed you, Daddy.

49
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,350
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,110
I missed you so much.

51
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,110
Daddy.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,160
Why did you come so late?

53
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,350
I came late.

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,200
Daddy.

55
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
Good boy.

56
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,470
I missed you too.

57
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,390
Mom said that

58
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,990
today, I can stay with you.

59
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,680
Great.

60
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,180
Today,

61
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,640
you can stay with me.

62
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,390
Be good.

63
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Good boy.

64
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,840
Get in the car

65
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,110
and wait for Daddy, okay?

66
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,420
OK.

67
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,100
Thank you.

68
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,470
Bring him back on Sunday.

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,310
Don't delay his classes on Monday.

70
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
I

71
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,340
rented a place.

72
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,960
Don't worry.

73
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,910
I won't let Ziyuan see anyone else.

74
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,890
Ziyuan,

75
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,030
go to Daddy's place.

76
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't play too rough.

77
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,070
Be good.

78
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,270
We're leaving now.

79
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,870
Ziyuan,

80
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,280
Daddy bought you so many toys,

81
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,280
but you still

82
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,280
love to play with this one.

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,470
Because I haven't played
with Daddy in so long,

84
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,230
so I'll play with this first.

85
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,860
When Daddy's not around,

86
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,310
does Mommy play with you?

87
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,200
But

88
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,080
she doesn't allow me
to play on the floor

89
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,140
or walk barefoot.

90
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,070
Look.

91
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,870
You little troublemaker.

92
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,430
Naughty boy.

93
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,040
Look what you've done

94
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,310
to this rocket.

95
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,070
What now?

96
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,110
Daddy can't clean it up.

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,520
I'll rest a bit too.

98
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,240
Daddy's so clumsy.

99
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,550
You're the clumsy one!

100
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,710
You can't even catch it.

101
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,790
Ziyuan,

102
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,640
you're already a big boy.

103
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,040
You should start
brushing your own teeth.

104
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,430
Daddy, I can brush my teeth,

105
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,670
you just don't know.

106
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,520
Daddy, you're a big dinosaur.

107
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Don't take it from me.

108
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,280
I haven't put on the pillowcase.

109
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,950
Daddy, now you're a big dinosaur.

110
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Big dinosaur is coming!

111
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,790
- The big dinosaur will eat you now!
- Come on.

112
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,390
Daddy,

113
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,520
it's so late,

114
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
do you still have time to sleep with me?

115
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,830
Daddy's not

116
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
as busy with work now,

117
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,910
so I can spend more time with you.

118
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,160
Are you happy?

119
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Yes.

120
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,550
Daddy,

121
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,760
can you

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,670
stop working

123
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,190
and just play with me?

124
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,310
I haven't seen you in a long time.

125
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,710
I've missed you.

126
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,550
Daddy.

127
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,330
Are you happy

128
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,950
playing with me?

129
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,710
Of course I am!

130
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,480
Why do you ask?

131
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,610
I feel like

132
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,320
when you

133
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,840
used to be with me,

134
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,830
you seemed happier working
than when you were with me.

135
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,830
Daddy,

136
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,940
Mom said

137
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,400
before,

138
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,870
you couldn't be with us

139
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,820
because you made a mistake.

140
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,310
Is that true?

141
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,400
I...

142
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,710
I did make a serious mistake.

143
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,070
I can't

144
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,240
live with you and Mom

145
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
anymore.

146
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,350
But

147
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
Daddy will always...

148
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
Daddy,

149
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,550
please don't make any more mistakes.

150
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,240
I don't want to lose you again.

151
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,950
Daddy.

152
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,790
I won't.

153
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,990
I won't make mistakes again.

154
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,740
Aren't your eyes tired?

155
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,300
Your hair's gone white.

156
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,180
Don't you sleep?

157
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,180
I will, I will sleep soon.

158
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,980
Let me finish reading this.

159
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,260
I've already prepared his schoolbag

160
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,020
and his clothes are washed.

161
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,220
Mom,

162
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,100
to be honest,

163
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,240
this year,

164
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,540
if it weren't for you,

165
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,180
I would have broken down.

166
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,300
Like you've never broken down.

167
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Yes, yes, it's my fault.

168
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,140
I tend to

169
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,710
unconsciously take my anger out

170
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,910
on the people closest to me.

171
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,940
Thinking back,

172
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,220
when Hu Cheng was busy with work,

173
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,780
no matter how stressed he was,

174
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,580
he never lost

175
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,940
his temper with me.

176
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,780
He's pitiful too.

(those days would never change.)

194
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,090
(I thought our happiness)

195
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,710
(would last forever.)

196
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,530
Honey, it's me.

197
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,300
Look, I'm here.

198
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,820
(It was Ning Yue's tolerance and love)

199
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,300
(that made us happy.)

200
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
(But)

201
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,500
(it was ruined)

202
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,740
(by my stubbornness and arrogance.)

203
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,780
(I ignored Ning Yue's feelings)

204
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,340
(and destroyed my own happiness.)

205
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,740
I want to work.

206
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,980
I won't allow it.

207
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,500
Why can't you allow it?

208
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,100
I gave up my dignity,

209
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,460
I gave up my sweat!

210
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,100
So I could earn enough money

211
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,300
to provide you with a life of ease!

212
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,820
I hate you for locking me at home,

213
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,500

You destroyed my career

217
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,020
and my dignity.

218
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,900
I won't let her leave me.

219
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,620

I just can't live like this anymore.

224
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
I can't stand this kind of life
for even one more day!

225
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,500
Honey,

226
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,300

(It's too late to regret now.)

238
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,780
Ziyuan.

239
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,420
You're back so late.

240
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,820
You still have to
wake up early tomorrow.

241
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,750
Mom,

242
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
Daddy could make my bed.

243
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,560
I didn't know that before.

244
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,410
Really?

245
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,780
Well, Daddy didn't know
you could brush your teeth.

246
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,390
I can do a lot of other things.

247
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,150
But Daddy doesn't know.

248
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,580
Alright,

249
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,820
you can show Daddy slowly in the future,

250
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,660
okay?

251
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
Next week,

252
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,120
I want to play with Daddy again.

253
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,500
Ziyuan has grown up now.

254
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,060
Now,

255
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,780
you can even be my teacher.

256
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,140
I am Teacher Ziyuan.

257
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,300
In the past,

258
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
I thought work made me the happiest.

259
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Because it allowed me

260
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,300
to provide the best conditions for you,

261
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,460
so you could live well.

262
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,100
But

263
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,740
I didn't spend enough time with you.

264
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,740
Now I know

265
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,500
the happiest and most joyful thing

266
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,300
is being with you.

267
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,270
Dad, you need to stay happy.

268
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,820
I will.

269
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,360
Alright,

270
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,860
we're heading upstairs.

271
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,540
Bye, Daddy.

272
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,420
Listen to Mom, alright?

273
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,540
Bye.

274
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,260
Did you have fun?

275
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
Yes, I did.

276
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,400
That's good.

277
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,800
This color

278
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,020
doesn't suit you at all.

279
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,040
Deep color is more suitable for you.

280
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,620
You must come tomorrow.

281
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,660
Don't be late,

282
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,780
alright?

283
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,420
I'll wait for you
to come back victoriously,

284
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,700
and we'll start over again.

285
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,100
Tomorrow, wait for me.

286
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,850
Tian Qiuzi,

287
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,940
why do you keep
haunting us like a ghost?

288
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,500
What do you want now?

289
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,340
What,

290
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,900
are you planning
to hide behind another man

291
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,380
and let him support you?

292
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,820
Miss Tian,

293
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,860
today's meeting

294
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,260
is Yaofeng's shareholders' meeting.

295
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,500
You have no right to attend.

296
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,380
If you continue like this,

297
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,820
we'll have to call security.

298
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,060
I would like to clarify that

299
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,500
my attendance today

300
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,220
is on behalf of Mr. Jiang.

301
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,500
Now do I have the right?

302
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,100
She's representing Mr. Jiang?

303
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,700
Mr. Jiang?

304
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,060
Ning Yue,

305
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,420
in the year you replaced Hu Cheng

306
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,940
as the general manager and president,

307
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,300
many long-term shareholders
withdrew their shares.

308
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Do you know the reason behind it?

309
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,700
If it weren't for Mr. Jiang

310
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,460
consistently acquiring
those scattered shares,

311
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,300
Yaofeng

312
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,700
wouldn't have survived until today.

313
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,900
You really planned everything.

314
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,580
I don't know how you managed

315
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,940
to team up with Mr. Jiang.

316
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,740
Over the past year,

317
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,500
our shares have indeed been

318
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,300
gradually acquired.

319
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,660
But whether this process is compliant

320
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,500
and legal,

321
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,220
we don't know.

322
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,060
Don't worry,

323
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,900
I will get to the bottom of it

324
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,500
and not let it slide.

325
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,580
Before worrying about that,

326
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,540
you should be concerned
about yourself first.

327
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,100
Today, I'm here

328
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,980
on behalf of Mr. Jiang

329
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,340
to remove Ning Yue from
the position of general manager.

330
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,780
Removing Ning Yue?

331
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,180
That's inappropriate.

332
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,300
First of all,

333
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,620
this topic is not

334
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,940
on today's meeting agenda.

335
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,220
Secondly,

336
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
with the limited shares Mr. Jiang holds,

337
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,300
he doesn't have enough votes

338
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,060
to remove me from my position.

339
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,660
I knew you'd say that.

340
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,260
Yes,

341
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,660
right now,

342
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,340
you hold 25.5% of the shares,

343
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,860
and with the shareholders

344
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,820
you've kept in the dark,

345
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,540
Mr. Jiang's 30%

346
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,460
indeed isn't enough.

347
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,700
But let's not forget,

348
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,220
there's been someone absent

349
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,260
this entire year.

350
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,620
If we include his votes,

351
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,540
do you think I can
remove you from your position?

352
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,980
It wouldn't be Hu Cheng, would it?

353
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,170
Is it Hu Cheng?

354
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,780
It's Hu Cheng, isn't it?

355
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
Yes,

356
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,460
it's Hu Cheng.

357
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,780
(Yaofeng Tech)

358
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,620
- Mr. Hu.
- Mr. Hu.

359
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,500
Mr. Hu.

360
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,260
Mr. Hu.

361
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,980
- Mr. Hu.
- Mr. Hu.

362
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,180
Mr. Hu.

363
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,500
Mr. Hu.

364
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,620
Hu Cheng is the one
who built Yaofeng into what it is today,

365
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,860
step by step,
bringing everyone to this point.

366
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,940
Ning Yue,

367
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,780
when Hu Cheng was at his lowest,

368
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,820
you kicked him while he was down
and filed for divorce.

369
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,980
You know exactly

370
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,220
how you got your shares,

371
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,700
don't you?

372
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,740
It's Mr. Hu.

373
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,780
It really is Mr. Hu.

374
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
Sorry, everyone.

375
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,380
I'm late.

376
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,820
Not just for today,

377
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,820
but for over a year of absence.

378
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,540
Due to my rash decisions,

379
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,020
the company
has suffered significant losses.

380
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm not here

381
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,660
to defend myself

382
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,300
or make excuses.

383
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,540
But,

384
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,540
some issues

385
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,060
must be addressed promptly

386
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,900
to prevent further risks to the company.

387
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Thank you all

388
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,140
for trusting Yaofeng.

389
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,340
During its most difficult time,

390
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,260
you chose not to leave,

391
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,620
but to support

392
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,860
and help Yaofeng

393
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,020
get out of the trough.

394
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,860
I hope you will continue

395
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,980
to support and trust Yaofeng.

396
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,260
With all of you,

397
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,420
Yaofeng will

398
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,500
go further,

399
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,780
and get even better.

400
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,300
During my absence of more than a year,

401
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,140
it was Ning Yue

402
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,380
who saved Yaofeng.

403
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,540
She has proven her ability

404
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,020
and shown that she can lead Yaofeng

405
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,140
to greater heights.

406
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,580
One of the main reasons

407
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,140
I came today is that

408
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,540
I need to announce something.

409
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,540
I will transfer

410
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,980
my 25.5% shares

411
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,140
unconditionally to Ning Yue.

412
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,740
From now on,

413
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,460
I have nothing to do

414
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,220
with Yaofeng.

415
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Thank you all.

416
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,140
Do you have to do it this way?

417
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,640
Sorry.

418
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,700
Are you even a man?

419
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,580
Loser!

420
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,860
I did all of this for you,

421
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,070
for you!

422
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,980
Sorry.

423
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,140
Is it that you

424
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,980
still have feelings for her?

425
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,100
Do you care for her, Hu Cheng?

426
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,740
It's okay, I understand.

427
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,900
I'll go find Mr. Jiang again.

428
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,780
Don't rush to make a decision yet.

429
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,520
I will make sure you wake up to reality.

430
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,180
I'll help you win Yaofeng back,

431
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,020
okay?

432
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,580
This path

433
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,260
was wrong from the start.

434
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,860
We shouldn't be together.

435
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,020
You're still young.

436
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,920
You still have a chance to start over.

437
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,340
What do you mean?

438
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,940
Now you want to be a good person?

439
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,500
I've never been a good person.

440
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,420
But I know

441
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,980
you have it harder than me.

442
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,780
I don't care.

443
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,100
I don't care what others

444
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,500
say behind my back.

445
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,860
I just want you to be well.

446
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,980
I just want you to win in the end.

447
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,660
Hu Cheng, I beg you.

448
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,340
Don't let me lose.

449
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
I beg you.

450
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,840
Winning

451
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,140
at all costs

452
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,900
is only a temporary victory.

453
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,820
What we lose

454
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,100
is our personality and dignity.

455
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,900
Perhaps even freedom.

456
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,300
One day,

457
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,660
you'll feel

458
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,040
that it was all not worth it.

459
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,960
I know it's hard for you now.

460
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,460
This

461
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,060
is my savings.

462
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
You can take it.

463
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,060
I don't need your charity!

464
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,560
This

465
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,720
is all my savings.

466
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,020
I... I don't know

467
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,900
what more I can do for you.

468
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,020
I...

469
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,300
I hope

470
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,140
you can live well.

471
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,500
Live a good life.

472
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,410
We really made a mistake.

473
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,870
I'm sorry.

474
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,900
I'm sorry.

475
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,400
I'll pour you a cup of tea.

476
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,380
Grandma.

477
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
Qiuzi.

478
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,740
I feel happy when I look at you.

479
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,940
Really?

480
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,780
I'll come and stay with you
every day, okay?

481
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,100
I'll stay here and not leave.

482
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,740
I'll be by your side every day.

483
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,300
No.

484
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,180
You have your career
that you love so much to pursue.

485
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,850
Before, your eyes were sparkling

486
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,850
when you talked to me about your work.

487
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,820
I support you in doing what you love.

488
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,620
I just want you to be happy.

489
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,060
Come visit me when you have time.

490
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,860
- Okay?
- OK.

491
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
So

492
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,740
no matter what happens to me,

493
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,540
you will always cherish me, right?

494
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,780
Yes.

495
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,660
Qiuzi is always my dearest girl.

496
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,820
You will never leave me,

497
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,660
right?

498
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,700
Never.

499
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,940
Okay.

500
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,700
I love you.

501
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,460
Ziyuan, play for a while,
then take a break.

502
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,120
Uncle Qin.

503
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,230
Quiet down.

504
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,300
It's okay, it's okay.

505
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,580
By the way, Ziyuan,

506
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,620
do you want to
go on a picnic tomorrow?

507
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,300
Let's invite Qin Jiaojiao to join us.

508
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,420
Yes.

509
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,820
Mom, do you want to join us too?

510
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Your mom has a charity event tomorrow.

511
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,660
Wouldn't it be better
if it's just the three of us?

512
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,900
Okay.

513
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,420
Mom, what do you think?

514
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,580
No problem, you guys go ahead.

515
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,940
Be safe tomorrow.

516
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,220
Okay.

517
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,100
Slow down, be careful.

518
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,180
- Okay.
- Look how beautiful it is ahead.

519
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,660
Right?

520
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,060
It is really beautiful.

521
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,460
Be careful.

522
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,540
Qin Jiaojiao.

523
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
Please be more careful next time.

524
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,380
Be careful.

525
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,100
This place is so beautiful.

526
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,500
Uncle Qin.

527
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,380
The view here is so beautiful.

528
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,300
Could you take a few pictures for me?

529
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,700
I want to show them to Mom.

530
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,540
Okay.

531
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,460
But

532
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,900
you two stay here and wait for me.

533
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,260
This place is very dangerous.

534
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,540
- I'll go.
- Alright.

535
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,020
Let me see.

536
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,500
Move down a little.

537
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,140
Uncle, be careful.

538
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,980
Don't worry.

539
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,960
- Uncle Qin!
- Uncle!

540
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,100
(Ziyuan)

541
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,860
Ziyuan, how is it?

542
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,300
Are you on your way back?

543
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,780
Mom.

544
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,660
Uncle Qin fell.

545
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,940
What happened?

546
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,980
Did he fall? Is it serious?

547
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,980
He went to the roadside
to take pictures for me

548
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,260
and then he fell.

549
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,100
Ziyuan.

550
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,580
I'm fine down here.

551
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Take care of yourself.

552
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,020
Ziyuan, don't worry yet.

553
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,900
Stay calm, stay with Jiaojiao there.

554
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,740
Mom will come soon.

555
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,900
Do you remember what I taught you?

556
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,820
- Send me the location.
- Yes.

557
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,980
Quickly send one to me.

558
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,060
I'm on my way.

559
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,580
Uncle, Uncle.

560
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,820
- Uncle Qin.
- Uncle.

561
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,340
Ziyuan, Mom is here.

562
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,380
- Mom.
- Are you okay?

563
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,380
Are you alright?

564
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,540
You're fine, right?

565
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,780
- Are you okay?
- Is Jiaojiao okay?

566
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,220
Where is Uncle Qin?

567
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,180
He's right there.

568
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,340
Don't move, don't move.

569
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,540
Don't move, you stay still.

570
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,260
You and Jiaojiao stay here, don't move.

571
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,380
Jiaojiao, you stay still.

572
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,460
Okay.

573
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,380
Mom, you need to be careful too.

574
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,980
Director Qin.

575
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,660
Yue.

576
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
I'm fine.

577
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,500
Don't worry, okay?

578
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,390
I've already called for help.

579
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,420
They'll be here soon.

580
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Don't worry, I'm fine.

581
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,340
See?

582
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,300
Alright, don't move.

583
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,180
Don't move.

584
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,980
Ziyuan.

585
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,460
You and Jiaojiao stay up there.

586
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,120
I'm going to check what he's doing.

587
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,960
Is that okay?

588
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,060
- Mom.
- Don't move.

589
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,300
Be careful too.

590
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,780
Okay, take good care of Jiaojiao.

591
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,700
Don't move at all.

592
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
Yue, be careful.

593
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,180
You've just injured your leg, right?

594
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,150
It's okay.

595
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,660
Be careful.

596
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,500
Okay.

597
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,060
What happened to your face?

598
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,500
Did you scrape it?

599
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,340
Just a scratch.

600
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,610
Is it this side?

601
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,260
You can't move at all?

602
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,920
Let's wait for
the rescue team to arrive.

603
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,900
Yue.

604
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,340
You can't pull me up.

605
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,380
It's so dangerous here.

606
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,380
Did you come down
to watch the scenery with me?

607
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,580
Don't they say

608
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,860
that the injured person

609
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,460
is the most vulnerable?

610
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,180
Then, when you're the most vulnerable,

611
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,300
someone has to be with you, right?

612
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
If I stay with you,

613
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,900
you'll be more comfortable.

614
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,620
Ziyuan and Jiaojiao are still up there.

615
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,580
They are more vulnerable than me.

616
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,220
That's hard to say.

617
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,500
Want to give it a try?

618
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,180
Ziyuan.

619
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
Jiaojiao.

620
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,380
Are you guys okay?

621
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,220
We're fine.

622
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,260
How's Uncle Qin?

623
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,140
I'm fine.

624
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,540
Did you see that?

625
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,180
Aren't they stronger than you?

626
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,620
Fine.

627
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,740
I'll be

628
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,260
the most vulnerable kid.

629
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Of course.

630
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,500
Which normal adult

631
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,780
would roll down a mountain

632
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
just to take a photo?

633
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,310
I...

634
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,220
I was playing with Ziyuan at that time.

635
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,900
Then I went to take a photo.

636
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,780
I saw a really nice spot.

637
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,630
And I accidentally

638
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,780
fell from there.

639
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,220
I was too happy playing and forgot.

640
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,100
That's great.

641
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
This means

642
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,620
you weren't just playing with Ziyuan,

643
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,300
you were enjoying it too.

644
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,860
When I was little,

645
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,860
I always liked coming
to the mountains to play.

646
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,900
My parents used to stop me

647
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,740
and didn't let me come.

648
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,740
After I grew up,
they didn't care for me anymore.

649
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,940
But because of work and other things,

650
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,660
I don't have time

651
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,060
to come and play in the mountains.

652
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,020
I never expected

653
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,460
that today, in this way,

654
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,380
I've realized my childhood dream.

655
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,020
Well, you paid a high price

656
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,900
for that childhood dream of yours.

657
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
But with you here,

658
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,860
it's not the same

659
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,780
as when I was a kid.

660
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,940
So I think

661
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,700
it's still worth it.

662
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,140
Then let this price

663
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,380
be a little heavier.

664
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,340
Yue.

665
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,920
I'm really worried about my uncle.

666
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,620
It's fine, Qin Jiaojiao.

667
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,660
My mom is taking care
of your uncle down there.

668
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,150
I'm up here taking care of you.

669
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,340
It's really beautiful.

670
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,370
I hope time

671
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,870
can stay in this moment forever.

672
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,180
Hi, we are here.

673
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,020
Right here.

674
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,460
Is there anyone down there?

675
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,900
We're the rescue team.

676
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,040
We're here.

677
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,220
Don't move! Stay there.

678
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,260
Wait for us to come down.

679
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,980
How did they get here so quickly?

680
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,020
Don't move!

681
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,060
