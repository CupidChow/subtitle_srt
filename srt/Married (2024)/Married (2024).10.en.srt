3
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,550
Don't, don't block me.

4
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,440
Don't block me.

5
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,350
Don't, don't block me.

6
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,800
Dad,

7
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,160
don't just lie down after eating.

8
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,390
It's not good for your stomach.

9
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,590
Dad.

10
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,630
You should listen to Yue.

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,040
She's doing it for your own good.

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,400
Alright then.

13
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,400
Is everything all right with the company?

14
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,190
With me around,

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,190
what can happen?

16
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,120
That's good.

17
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
Once Mr. Guo's funds are frozen,

18
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
our capital chain will break.

19
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,910
This would be a fatal blow to us.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Mr. Hu,

21
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,400
you need to think of a way quickly.

22
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll fill this hole myself.

23
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
Use my personal account.

24
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,350
I've already sent Ma to the bank.

25
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,400
Hurry over and coordinate with him.

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,950
Ok, I'll go right away.

27
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,140
How about holding a shareholders' meeting?

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,630
This matter must not

29
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,350
be known by anyone in the company.

30
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm already in contact with Xianbin Capital.

31
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,630
I heard that their president

32
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,080
is particularly difficult to deal with.

33
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,280
As long as we are willing to invest,

34
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,960
everything can be handled.

35
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,600
Mr. Hu,

36
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,870
I invited you today

37
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,350
to want

38
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,470
to ask you a question.

39
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,030
When

40
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,960
will you pay me back

41
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,200
the money I lent you?

42
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,790
Mr. Chen,

43
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,160
you must hear the rumors about Mr. Guo,

44
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,200
so you are afraid

45
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,110
of being affected.

46
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,080
The question is

47
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,430
that the money is not mine.

48
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,990
I'm afraid the company

49
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,760
will cause me trouble.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,960
Zhongzhi has started an investigation.

51
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,760
The situation is tense.

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
Didn't we agree before

53
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,430
to wait until after the listing?

54
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,990
Yaofeng is going public?

55
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,430
That will

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,990
be a long, long time.

57
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,950
Mr. Hu,

58
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,910
I'm not criticizing you.

59
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,390
You

60
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,420
don't be too arrogant.

61
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,380
Look at you now.

62
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,340
It's so difficult to raise funds.

63
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,780
Don't always be so superficial.

64
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,620
For a company like Yaofeng,

65
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,100
be realistic.

66
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,300
Why force it?

67
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,460
- Mr. Hu.
- Mr. Mo.

68
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,060
Here you are.

69
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,580
Mr. Chen, let me make an introduction.

70
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,100
This is Mr. Mo,

71
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,240
the president of Xianbin Capital.

72
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
This is Mr. Chen.

73
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,380
Nice to meet you, Mr. Mo.

74
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,740
I am Chen Pingzhang, GM

75
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,180
of the Procurement Department of Zhongzhi.

76
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,700
This is

77
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,820
my business card.

78
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,180
Nice to meet you.

79
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,500
Mr. Mo, come, have a seat quickly.

80
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,700
You just got off the plane.

81
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,180
You are still getting a jet-lag.

82
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,460
You really show respect to me.

83
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,700
Come on.

84
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,900
Let's not be polite with each other.

85
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,340
I have already asked the Legal Department

86
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,580
to draft the investment contract.

87
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,500
By the end of this month

88
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,540
at the latest,

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,260
the funds will be in place.

90
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,100
Don't worry.

91
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,620
Good.

92
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,900
Thank you.

93
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,460
May I ask a question?

94
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,820
How did

95
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,340
you know each other?

96
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,340
We

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,900
used to be comrades.

98
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,780
Ok.

99
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,340
I salute you for meeting again.

100
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,660
Wish you a pleasant cooperation.

101
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,300
Wish you success at your first attempt.

102
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,860
Come on, together.

103
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,420
Here.

104
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,980
Be careful.

105
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,620
So many contracts.

106
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,220
When will we finish?

107
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,580
Hurry up.

Mr. Hu,

113
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,420
you invited Mr. Mo today.

114
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,260
It's intentional

115
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,460
to show off to me, right?

116
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,620
You are well hidden.

117
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,580
If I had known a big shot backing you...

118
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,580
Right?

119
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,860
Please tell me

120
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,740
how you managed to win over Mr. Mo.

121
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,940
Trade secret.

122
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,500
I won't ask anymore.

123
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm getting more and more excited.

124
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,380
When Yaofeng Tech goes public in the future,

125
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,660
I will have a share of the credit too.

126
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Because

127
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,180
that money was like

128
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,180
a timely help in a snowy winter.

129
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,780
You can't

130
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,110
leave me alone.

131
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,500
Didn't you ask me

132
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,820
to repay it?

133
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,100
No rush, why the hurry?

134
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,860
I'll figure something out with Zhongzhi.

135
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,500
It's just a matter of one sentence.

136
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,020
Your outfit

137
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,980
is not the one you wore this morning.

138
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,460
Looks good, right?

139
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,500
Going on a date?

140
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,340
It's not a date.

141
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,140
But it's quite important to me.

142
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,460
- The timing is just right.
- Take care.

143
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,140
Pan Jie, you get into a relationship?

144
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,620
Who told you?

145
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,180
Can't I dress up

146
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,660
for myself?

147
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
It's a false alarm.

148
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,900
I mean

149
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,420
I'm stimulated.

150
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,540
Yue has a warm home to return to.

151
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,980
You have a candlelight dinner.

152
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,540
Only I stay in the small dark room,

153
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,820
eating instant noodles.

154
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,180
I'm really too pitiful.

155
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,340
Yue indeed returns home.

156
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,220
I really go have dinner.

157
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,460
You can just eat instant noodles.

158
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,980
I know who you're going to meet.

159
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,140
Your idol sister, right?

160
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,100
Good for you.

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,500
You guessed right.

162
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,340
Tianming,

163
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,460
Pan Jie's sister

164
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,300
isn't a star, is she?

165
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,420
No, no.

166
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,460
She really admires her sister.

167
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,660
But I feel

168
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,500
she has been brainwashed by her sister.

169
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,540
She really wants

170
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,740
to get her sister's approval.

171
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,780
Her sister must be an outstanding person,

172
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,460
- Jie.
- Mom.

173
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,500
You finally came back.

174
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,220
Hurry up, hurry up.

175
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,450
Don't keep the birthday star waiting.

176
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,100
Coming.

177
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,060
Mom!

178
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,380
- Look who's here.
- Grandpa.

179
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,340
Jie, you're here.

180
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,300
Where is Grandma?

181
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,660
Happy birthday, Grandma.

182
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,100
You're here.

183
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,980
Sis, long time no see.

184
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,450
Please have a seat.

185
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Hurry up.

186
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,740
Grandma, I bought you a cake.

187
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,780
We'll eat in a little while.

188
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,620
Ok.

189
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,980
Are you comfortable sitting here?

190
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,380
If not, I can add a cushion for you.

191
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,980
That's fine.

192
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,180
It's ok.

193
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,300
Just be happy.

194
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,220
Let's do whatever makes you happy.

195
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,660
Ok.

196
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,140
Cheng's company

197
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,460
hasn't gone public yet.

198
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,860
After it goes public,

199
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,700
let me tell you how wealthy he will be.

200
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,900
There's an American

201
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,820
named...

202
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,780
Mas...

203
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,940
- Maske.
- Ma...

204
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,860
Maske.

205
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,060
Anyway, it's Mas or something.

206
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,540
I'm telling you, when the time comes...

207
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,260
Uncle,

208
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,460
you are home.

209
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,010
Your Dad and your brothers are all here?

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,420
Why didn't anyone tell me?

211
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,780
I don't know either.

212
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,940
I just got off work.

213
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,380
They informed me then.

214
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:56,404
I tell you

215
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,428
we can take Cheng's private jet

216
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:00,452
to his private island.

217
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:02,476
- Really?
- Only when you get there

218
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
do you know what it means to eat seafood.

219
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:05,676
Directly fishing in the sea.

220
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,140
- You know what?
- We will wait.

221
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
- Cheng.
- Dad.

222
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Cheng is home.

223
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
- Uncle.
- Cheng.

224
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,040
- Hello, uncle.
- You are back.

225
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,020
Uncle.

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,620
The handsome guy is back.

227
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,860
- Hello.
- You're home.

228
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,500
Here. Sit down.

229
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,780
Cheng, pour some water for the elders.

230
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,180
Alright, alright. Sit down.

231
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,460
- No need to be polite.
- No, he just came back.

232
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,700
- Sit down, sit down.
- He is busy.

233
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
No worries. Sit down.

234
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,140
- You're welcome.
- Sit down.

235
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,700
No need.

236
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,820
When did you arrive? You've worked hard.

237
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,660
- We just arrived.
- Stay for a while.

238
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,180
That's all right.

239
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,300
So great!

240
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,460
Go ahead with your work. We'll chat.

241
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,500
Dad, please come with me for a moment.

242
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm going to chat with my Dad for a bit.

243
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,700
- Ok.
- Come here.

244
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,500
I have something to talk with Cheng.

245
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,100
Ok, you go ahead.

246
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,980
What to eat and drink tonight,

247
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,580
Cheng will be responsible.

248
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,780
- No worries.
- Ok.

249
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,220
- Take it easy.
- Ok.

250
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,900
- We're all family.
- Moutai. Moutai.

251
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,140
Please don't be polite.

252
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,220
- Ok, got it.
- Ok.

253
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,900
Feel free, feel free.

254
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
It's really...

255
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,700
Cheng.

256
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,260
I just knew it.

257
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,970
I can't help it either.

258
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,220
Rest assured.

259
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,100
I'll let them leave right after dinner.

260
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
At least,

261
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,300
let me know in advance.

262
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,980
I just knew it.

263
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Zibo's Mom is coming to see a doctor.

264
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,620
Your uncles heard

265
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,060
that they could see you here.

266
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,140
They were very happy,

267
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,020
so they came.

268
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,140
You can rest assured.

269
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,620
I will never let them disturb your work.

270
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,980
Well,

271
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,180
this is also Yue's home.

272
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,860
I know. I know.

273
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,100
How about this?

274
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,020
You pay

275
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,820
for their travel expenses

276
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,580
and hotel money.

277
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,980
This is to prevent them from gossiping.

278
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,580
Let your driver

279
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,780
stay here.

280
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,900
Just two days.

281
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,340
There is really no other way.

282
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,540
Well,

283
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,460
have you arranged

284
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,580
the hospital for Zibo's Mom?

285
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,220
I know your difficulties.

286
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,340
It's nothing.

287
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
I've been observing Yue.

288
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,300
She

289
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,820
is very good.

290
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,820
She's different from your ex.

291
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,220
- What's wrong?
- It's fine.

292
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,060
What's going on?

293
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,260
Be careful. Don't step on it.

294
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,300
It's nothing.

295
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,380
Peaceful year after year.

296
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,540
Everyone, sit down.

297
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,900
It's fine. Let your wife do it.

298
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,380
Come, come, come, sit down.

299
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,740
How abundant!

300
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,180
It's fine. Go ahead.

301
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,460
Come on, pour the wine.

302
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,780
Uncles,

303
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,300
drink well.

304
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,580
Let's have a toast first, ok?

305
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,500
- Ok.
- Let's have a drink first.

306
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,300
I also told Cheng about it.

307
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,660
Leave the car here.

308
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,500
How about visiting a few more places?

309
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,380
- Your tolerance has improved!
- No worries.

310
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Sure. Sure.

311
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,100
Alright, let's go.

312
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,340
Cheers.

313
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,300
- How's the wine?
- Good wine.

314
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,380
- Good, right?
- Strong enough.

315
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,980
Come, eat the dishes.

316
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,820
Try this.

317
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,940
This dish

318
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
is really good.

319
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,740
You've brought out the best wine, huh?

320
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,580
Of course.

321
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,140
Grandma, is that ok?

322
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,260
Very good.

323
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,060
Really comfortable.

324
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,340
Qiuzi.

325
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,300
What are you working on now?

326
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm looking for a new job, Grandma.

327
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,860
I haven't settled on anything yet.

328
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,820
Aren't you in Ruixin, sis?

329
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,100
I am no longer there.

330
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,820
Have some peanuts, Grandma.

331
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,540
You should come to see me more often.

332
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,420
It's been a long time.

333
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,340
I just came over last week.

334
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,660
You forgot again.

335
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,950
Is that so?

336
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,580
I just miss you.

337
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,860
I want to see you more.

338
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,740
I know you are busy with work.

339
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,420
Come when you have time.

340
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,140
I come here whenever I have free time.

341
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,980
Sis, when you are not around,

342
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,340
Grandma always talks about you.

343
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,940
I am talking to Grandma.

344
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,060
Grandma, you chat with sis for a while.

345
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,300
Here. Eat.

346
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,340
This dish is really nice!

347
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,540
- Very yummy.
- Put it in the fridge.

348
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,100
Cheng found a good wife

349
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,180
this time.

350
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,020
- Exactly.
- Look at her.

351
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,140
She's beautiful and capable.

352
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,380
Sure.

353
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,140
The rule of our family is that

354
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,600
women must be properly trained.

355
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
The wife of the Hu family

356
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,660
must be virtuous first.

357
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,100
- Correct.
- His ex...

358
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,700
It is not

359
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,980
that she looks down on Cheng.

360
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,820
It's Cheng who looks down on her.

361
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,900
If he likes her,

362
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,460
she would have been trained to be like this.

363
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,580
If women don't behave,

364
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,540
they need to be taught a good lesson.

365
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,460
His ex

366
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,740
is lazy.

367
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,500
She thought she is rich,

368
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,020
so she looks down on others.

369
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,340
His Mom and I

370
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,700
have stayed at home a few times.

371
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,780
With her around, we can't live well.

372
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,740
It always feels like she is driving us.

373
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,260
Can we feel comfortable with that?

374
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,980
I have to say,

375
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,060
this kind of daughter-in-law

376
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,580
must be taught a good lesson.

377
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,300
If she doesn't listen, just hit her.

378
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,220
Dad.

379
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,340
All the dishes were made by Yue.

380
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
If you're not used to it, go out to eat.

381
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,540
This way you can eat more comfortably.

382
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,900
Well,

383
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,900
I can get used to it.

384
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,220
- It's delicious
- Isn't it great?

385
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,900
Come on, come on.

386
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,700
Forget it. What delicious dishes!

387
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,740
- Let's go for it.
- Right?

388
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,620
Let's have a drink.

389
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,860
Grandma, it smells pretty good.

390
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Qiu, eat some fruit.

391
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,980
Peanuts are nice.

392
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,760
So fragrant.

393
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,220
Why don't you eat some grapes?

394
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,540
These grapes look pretty good.

395
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,620
Here. One grape.

396
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,020
- You have one, too.
- I will have one.

397
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,220
I will have one.

398
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,020
- Sweet.
- Sweet.

399
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,140
Qiu,

400
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,780
why not chat with someone over there?

401
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,380
It's good to at least say hello.

402
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,660
They are all your elders.

403
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,060
If you don't say anything,

404
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,260
it is inappropriate, right?

405
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,820
- When you were little...
- When I was little...

406
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,940
When?

407
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,060
When you all looked down on me?

408
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,860
Many years have passed by.

409
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,420
Whenever you don't come,

410
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,540
let me know in advance.

411
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,660
I will come to see you more.

412
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Is that ok?

413
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,500
Ok.

414
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,860
I'm leaving, Grandma.

415
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Take care of yourself.

416
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,110
Bye.

417
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,700
Sis,

418
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,860
are you leaving?

419
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,500
Don't worry, sis.

420
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,940
I will take good care of Grandma.

421
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,540
Didn't you say you have already joined

422
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,100
the dept directly managed by the director?

423
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,580
You don't even have two decent outfits.

424
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,500
You're not a student anymore.

425
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,100
Dressing so cute might get you bullied.

426
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,940
Do you know?

427
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,140
Come find me in a couple of days.

428
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,180
I'll buy you two decent outfits.

429
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,100
Sis.

430
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,020
Are you still at the same company?

431
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,020
What is it?

432
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,060
Zhongzhi.

433
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,780
It's Zhongzhi Group.

434
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,700
So you're at Zhongzhi, huh?

435
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,020
Which department are you in?

436
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,860
Legal Department.

437
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,060
You're under Qin Can, right?

438
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,660
You know our boss!

439
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,780
Honey,

440
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,780
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,820
I hope

442
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,820
this is the last time I say that to you.

443
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,420
Director Qin,

444
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
thank you for your hard work.

445
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,140
It's my job.

446
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,180
It's just some basic data review

447
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,620
which is both tedious and monotonous.

448
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,940
And it's easy to make mistakes.

449
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,220
I have reviewed all reports

450
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,240
that you have submitted so far.

451
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,740
You have done it very diligently.

452
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,700
My team is quite capable.

453
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,860
You are too modest.

454
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,100
Since

455
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
you came to the company,

456
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,100
a few lawsuits

457
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,740
have been handled properly.

458
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,820
Regarding your work abilities,

459
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,020
everyone in the company can see it.

460
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,020
The company is currently considering

461
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,500
the candidates for Legal Director.

462
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Work hard.

463
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,460
We look forward to your contribution

464
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,600
to the development of the company.

465
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,180
I will.

466
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,460
Come in.

467
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,940
You want me, Director?

468
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,300
Take a look at this.

469
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,620
(Qingyan Project Sales Contract)

470
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,460
Isn't this the contract

471
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,740
I just delivered this morning?

472
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,060
Open it and take a look.

473
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,140
I just got this contract back

474
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,740
from the Marketing Department.

475
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,940
This contract is not the final version.

476
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,820
The amount inside is also wrong.

477
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,020
Director,

478
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
well,

479
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,580
it is my fault this time.

480
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,540
If it weren't for you,

481
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,060
I have really embarrassed myself.

482
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,740
Qian.

483
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,940
When I first came to Zhongzhi,

484
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,900
you gave me confidence.

485
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,060
I have always been at ease with your work.

486
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,700
Look.

487
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,060
There are only a few of us in the office.

488
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,180
We are all so young

489
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,020
and careless.

490
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,380
You are an old employee.

491
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,700
We look to you to stabilize our morale.

492
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,500
Director,

493
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,700
hearing what you said,

494
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,580
I feel especially ashamed.

495
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,620
You have many things to take care of at home.

496
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,740
I understand.

497
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,020
But you cannot delay your work.

498
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,900
If this situation happens again,

499
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,500
no one can help you.

500
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,020
I understand, Director.

501
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,260
Don't worry, I promise,

502
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
this is the last time.

503
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,180
Dad, I'm back.

504
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,940
Here it comes.

505
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,740
Dad cooked.

506
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,100
I want the stir-fried eggs and tomatoes.

507
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,940
Here it is.

508
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,900
And rib soup.

509
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,140
Give me your school bag.

510
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,100
There is not only what you love to eat,

511
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,620
but also what your Mom loves to eat.

512
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,780
You are in the mood to cook today.

513
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,540
I cooked often in the past.

514
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
When you were pregnant,

515
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,340
I cooked every meal every day.

516
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,620
It's rare for me to get off work early.

517
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,860
I have to show off

518
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,460
or you might forget my skills.

519
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,250
Hurry up.

520
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,740
- Go wash your hands.
- Let's try it.

521
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
Ok.

522
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,220
So fragrant.

523
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,860
Rib soup.

524
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,740
Let me tell you,

525
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,540
Cheng

526
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,020
is really not normal now.

527
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,860
He isn't like a man of our family at all.

528
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,180
His ex

529
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,740
is so mean.

530
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,020
In the end,

531
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,940
Cheng gave her a good lesson.

532
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,460
But this wife...

533
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,660
Be quieter.

534
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,380
They have divorced. Why still be afraid?

535
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,700
Make me a cup of tea.

536
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,380
I really don't want to go out.

537
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,020
What the hell?

538
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,580
I stay at my son's house.

539
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,660
But I have to sneak around all day.

540
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,260
So ridiculous!

541
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,860
Dad.

542
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,100
Want some bitter melon?

543
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,740
Eat more.

544
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,660
Eat more vegetables.

545
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,820
Good boy.

546
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,100
Ziyuan, eat more.

547
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
Ok, Dad.

548
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,100
Honey,

549
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,460
every time I pick these for you,

550
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,500
I imagine

551
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,060
how beautiful you will look with it.

552
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,500
In the end,

553
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,100
you always surprise me.

554
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,780
After you put it on,

555
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,660
you look more beautiful than I imagined.

556
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,660
Our life

557
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,340
is like being on a boat.

558
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,340
It needs to have a set direction.

559
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,660
This boat

560
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,060
is not in a swimming pool,

561
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,100
but in a vast ocean.

562
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,020
Sailing in the sea,

563
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,780
there will be wind and waves.

564
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,500
Our boat

565
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,340
will rock.

566
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,060
Sometimes,

567
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,940
it will tilt.

568
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,380
Sometimes, it is going fast.

569
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,660
Sometimes, it is going slowly.

570
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,860
As long as the people on our boat

571
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,380
work together,

572
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,940
we will always move forward

573
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,420
towards the direction

574
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,980
we hope for.

575
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,420
Dad,

576
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,460
what am I doing on the boat?

577
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,780
You

578
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,700
don't need do anything.

579
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,420
Just be a little mascot.

580
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,260
Mom is also a mascot.

581
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,980
Mom is not.

582
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,220
Mom

583
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,540
is the one in charge.

584
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,820
Mom,

585
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,830
can I sleep with you today?

586
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,690
You...

587
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Why don't you ask my opinion?

588
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,980
Is it ok, Dad?

589
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,380
No way.

590
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,860
I think

591
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,900
it will affect our relationship.

592
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,420
I don't care.

593
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,340
I want to sleep with you.

594
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,980
Whose child is this?

595
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,100
This kid is so clingy.

596
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
My dear Yue,

597
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,220
today,

598
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,780
what would you like to eat?

599
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,340
What do you want to eat?

600
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,620
Just say it straight.

601
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,060
If everyone agrees,

602
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,940
I have no opinion.

603
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,700
You know me well.

604
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,620
Pan Jie,

605
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,580
you want to rip me off again, don't you?

606
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,940
Why would I rip you off?

607
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,180
Yue is about to become a permanent employee.

608
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,340
She has to treat us to a big meal, right?

609
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,660
Haven't you been thinking about this?

610
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,780
No, not at all.

611
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,020
Yue is about to become a permanent employee.

612
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
Congratulations in advance.

613
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,300
I've been thinking about this.

614
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,660
There's not much good food nearby.

615
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
There's no good food nearby.

616
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,180
So what do you actually want to eat?

617
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,900
Yue, please don't ask.

618
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,980
You will regret it.

619
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,140
Zhong Tianming.

620
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,330
You talk too much.

621
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,260
What's wrong?

622
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,180
Don't say that again.

623
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,740
Have you resubmitted the contract

624
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,260
from the Marketing Department?

625
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,780
I have already fixed it and sent it over.

626
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,100
Director,

627
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,460
I met with the people from Chenxing yesterday.

628
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,220
The negotiation went smoothly.

629
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,100
Not just this,

630
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,980
after the negotiation,

631
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,260
they insisted on treating me to a meal.

632
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,980
Meal? What meal?

633
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,820
Did you go?

634
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,340
No, I didn't go.

635
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,540
Qian.

636
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,660
We are the Legal Department.

637
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,660
We don't have the power

638
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,500
to negotiate terms with the clients.

639
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,370
Right.

640
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,220
So you can't make mistakes anymore.

641
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,780
I understand, Director.

642
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,180
This is a crucial period for your promotion.

643
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,540
No mistake is allowed.

644
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,460
What are you looking at me for?

645
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
It's not just me saying this,

646
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,660
everyone says so.

647
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,220
You are almost guaranteed

648
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,780
to get the director position this time.

649
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,180
The company has its arrangement.

650
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,140
Don't talk nonsense.

651
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
So ridiculous!

652
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,860
I understand, Director.

653
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,100
I will work steadily and do my job well.

654
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,380
Goodbye.

655
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,180
Director Qin.

656
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,820
Mr. Chen.

657
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,330
What's the matter?

658
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
I have something important to tell you.

659
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,950
Come here.

660
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,380
Congratulations in advance.

661
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,900
Director Qin.

662
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,160
Mr. Chen,

663
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,420
why are you also doing this?

664
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,660
I haven't been appointed yet.

665
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,460
No, you have.

666
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,900
I won't misjudge people.

667
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,340
In the whole company,

668
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,820
I have high hopes for you.

669
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,500
You must have a bright future ahead.

670
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,180
I just hope that in the future

671
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,620
you can take more care of me.

672
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,500
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

673
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,860
Let's wait for the arrangements.

674
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Alright, alright, alright.

675
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,140
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

676
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,380
Mr. Hu.

677
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,460
Mr. Hu.

678
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,380
I found the person you asked me to look into.

679
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,540
Just say it.

680
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,020
Say it.

681
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,020
(Mu Xiao)

682
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,340
(Can we meet today?)

683
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,820
(I'll come to find you after work.)

684
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,740
That person's last name is Nie.

685
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,340
He is a paralegal at a law firm.

686
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,540
He has been following a lawyer named Mu Xiao.

687
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,420
The main business is matrimonial suit.

688
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,140
Mr. Hu,

689
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,260
do I need

690
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,820
to investigate this further?

691
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,180
No need.

692
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Don't tell anyone about this matter.

693
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,300
I understand, Mr. Hu.

694
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,460
(Nie Xin)

695
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,660
(Senior Partner Mu Xiao)

696
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,980
(A divorce lawyer)

697
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,100
I know that there are still many issues

698
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,540
between him and me.

699
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,940
And the most difficult part

700
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,500
is that he and I need to rebuild trust.

701
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,260
Actually, I don't know

702
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,140
how much longer I need

703
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,500
before I can completely

704
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,180
walk out from the previous events.

705
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,820
But you know what?

706
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,660
When my son was sick

707
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,060
and we thought he had leukemia,

708
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,500
the person who was by my side

709
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,460
and empathized with me is Hu Cheng.

710
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,020
Moreover...

711
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,180
Moreover,

712
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,620
you still love him.

713
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,500
You asked me before

714
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,220
if I want to give marriage another chance.

715
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,500
Rather than saying

716
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,460
I want to give marriage another chance,

717
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,980
it's better to say that I want

718
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,180
to give the trust between Hu Cheng and I

719
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,820
one more chance.

720
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,660
I hope there is no war

721
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,940
in my family.

722
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,300
I won't see you for a long time.

723
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,820
Anyway, we definitely won't meet here.

724
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,860
You're about to become permanent.

725
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,740
Treat me.

726
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,300
Sure.

727
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,820
I have

728
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,620
to treat you to a nice meal.

729
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,860
You've helped me so much.

730
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,620
Your matters are my matters, right?

731
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,820
(Hu Cheng)

732
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,140
Answer it quickly.

733
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,940
Hello?

734
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,100
Honey,

735
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,860
where are you?

736
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,220
I just got off work.

737
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
I'm on the way.

738
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,580
I'm preparing to pick up Ziyuan.

739
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,980
Aren't you at Zhongzhi anymore?

740
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,340
No.

741
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,020
I am already near the kindergarten.

742
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,060
What's wrong?

743
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,220
It's nothing.

744
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,450
I was thinking

745
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,620
I will pick you up on the way.

746
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,910
No need, I can do it by myself.

747
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,130
Honey.

748
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,500
What's wrong again?

749
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,420
I miss you.

750
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,340
Aren't we going home soon?

751
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,020
I hope

752
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,780
we can still go back to the past.

753
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,700
I know.

754
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,220
I also hope so.

755
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,340
That's great.

756
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,180
Let's meet at home.

757
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,180
Goodbye.

758
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,780
Goodbye.

759
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,100
I hope you will never be my client.

760
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,940
I also hope

761
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,900
he is worth it.

762
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,220
Thank you.

763
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,660
Just go.

764
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,340
Ma,

765
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,900
I want to find our company's

766
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,620
best engineer.

767
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,780
Have him call me immediately.

768
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,660
Immediately.

769
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,260
(Li)

770
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,900
The software has been downloaded.

771
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,580
What should I do next?

772
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,020
Mr. Hu, please open the software.

773
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,820
Inside, there is Data Recovery.

774
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,900
Click in.

775
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,380
Click next.

776
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
Start scanning.

777
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,460
(Recovering data)

778
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,340
(Recovered data Deleted files)

779
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,460
(Files Videos Audios Images)

780
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,780
(File opening)

781
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,140
(Chat record between Ning Yue and Mu Xiao)

782
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,780
(Mu Xiao: Nie has already arrived)

783
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,820
(I'll be right there)

784
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,580
(No problem)

785
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,340
Honey,

786
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,100
I think you have changed.

787
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,900
You didn't like

788
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,540
showing off our affection in public.

789
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,500
A couple of days ago, my husband

790
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,900
also gave me a gift.

791
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,620
A hotel membership card.

792
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,900
What is it, honey?

793
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,380
I also feel

794
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,620
this place

795
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,060
means a lot to us.

796
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,500
(Nie has already arrived)

797
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
(I'll be right there)

798
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,180
Next, I would like

799
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,900
to grandly introduce

800
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,140
my wife, Ning Yue.

801
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,940
(Nie has already arrived)

802
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,220
Miss Tian, let's add each other on WeChat.

803
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,300
You scan me.

804
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,140
Honey, let's go to watch a movie.

805
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,820
I'm just about to call you for dinner.

806
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,500
Organizer.

807
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,660
That's quite fashionable.

808
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,340
Maybe I should learn well.

809
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,860
It might even help me tidy up the house.

810
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,340
Didn't you say your wife is coming to work?

811
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,980
She hasn't contacted me at all.

812
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,740
Let me tell you some good news.

813
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,580
I found a job.

814
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,860
I hope

815
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,300
we can still go back to the past.

816
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,100
I also hope so.
