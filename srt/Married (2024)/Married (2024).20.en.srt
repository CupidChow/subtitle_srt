=Episode 20=

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,600
After all, you used to be a couple.

4
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,600
Even if you are not together anymore,

5
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,040
you should part on good terms.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,440
This is better for the kid.

7
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,190
Why make such a scene now?

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,440
Why not ask like this?

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,440
Because your husband is insane.

10
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,880
You don't want to sit back and do nothing.

11
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,670
So you can only be crazier than him.

12
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,280
Yue,

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,670
everything you do

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,350
is worthwhile.

15
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,080
It will be over soon.

16
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,230
You will be able to be free soon.

17
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,630
I will support you.

18
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,860
We will all support you.

19
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
We will also protect you.

20
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,750
We won't let him hurt you again.

21
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,160
So

22
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,540
do not hurt yourself anymore.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
Ok?

(Detention Center)

27
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,280
I have investigated it thoroughly.

28
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,750
This was all designed by her.

29
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,190
That piece of glass

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
has a problem.

31
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,040
She conducted research in advance

32
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,870
to choose that room for negotiation.

33
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,230
She led you to that position,

34
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,400
and provoked you

35
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
to make you

36
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,840
push her.

37
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,710
Mr. Hu,

38
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,960
I suggest

39
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,310
suing her

40
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,840
for false accusation and framing.

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,760
Current evidence

42
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,600
is very advantageous for us.

43
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,790
How is Ning Yue injured?

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,230
Yue is not seriously injured.

45
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,310
It's just some scratches.

46
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
It's no big deal.

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,680
Besides,

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,350
Yue's lawyer

49
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,280
has already submitted the divorce petition.

50
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,600
The court has already filed the case.

51
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
Lawyer?

52
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Is it Mu Xiao?

53
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,310
Mr. Hu, it's not Mu Xiao.

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,350
Lawyer Mu Xiao is in the hospital.

55
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,360
It's Qin Can.

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,990
What brings you here?

57
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,040
Congratulations on your return.

58
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,600
If you came to take pleasure in my misfortune,

59
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,040
then please go back.

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,760
I've already blocked Mo Xianbin for you.

61
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,040
He doesn't know anything.

62
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,710
Don't worry.

63
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,270
Hu Cheng,

64
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,520
Mo is decided to invest in yours

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,040
because of your ambition and aggressiveness.

66
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,760
Do you get discouraged because of this?

67
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,800
Mr. Hu.

68
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,200
I found Zhou Wei.

69
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,860
(Inpatient)

70
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,670
Did you see clearly?

71
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,000
Is this here?

72
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,310
I saw Mr. Zhou's wife

73
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,110
always coming in and out alone.

74
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,600
She also brought a lot of daily necessities.

75
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,640
This way, Mr. Hu.

76
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,230
Excuse me.

77
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,990
Which ward does Zhou Wei live in?

78
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
Zhou Wei?

79
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,440
Male.

80
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,520
40.

81
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,080
No. 36 ward.

82
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,960
How are things with Mom and Dad?

83
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,550
I suddenly sent the kid over

84
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,430
and they should know

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,550
that something happened to you.

86
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,230
Just focus on your recovery.

87
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,160
I can handle it.

88
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,640
Don't rush to tell them.

89
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,840
I'll go see them

90
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,600
after the surgery in a couple of days.

91
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
It will also save them worry.

92
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,680
But

93
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,430
it will be hard for you.

94
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,470
What about Cheng?

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,760
He hasn't come to look for me again.

96
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,950
I feel

97
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,360
there's no need to hide from him anymore.

98
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,550
You wait in the car.

99
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,790
No need to come up anymore.

100
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,160
I'm going to get some hot water.

101
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
Cheng,

102
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,590
have a good chat with him.

103
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
Liver cancer,

104
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,070
advanced stage.

105
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,360
It might be a bit late.

106
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,160
You must be mad, Cheng?

107
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,040
You have already planned

108
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,550
how to take revenge on me, right?

109
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,750
Wei,

110
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,550
you should have told me.

111
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,470
Why didn't you tell me?

112
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,880
I remember.

113
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,830
You had hep-B in college.

114
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,590
Your liver has never been good.

115
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,830
I always made you drink with me.

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Your reaction

117
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,550
is pretty much what I expected.

118
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,360
Why didn't you tell me?

119
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,040
You could have told me.

120
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,070
I can find you the best hospital,

121
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,040
the best doctor.

122
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,550
I can stop all projects for you.

123
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,950
The whole company can wait for you.

124
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,520
Why didn't you tell me?

125
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,790
Wei,

126
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,430
you did not tell me

127
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
because you're afraid of causing me trouble?

128
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm afraid

129
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:14,910
of you.

130
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
Afraid of me?

131
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,830
Sometimes

132
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
you're really too scary.

133
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
That's true.

134
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,120
Everything I have now

135
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,430
can be said to be given by you.

136
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,750
Money,

137
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,510
car,

138
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,910
house...

139
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,640
And the school.

140
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
It's all thanks to you.

141
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,280
But sometimes I wonder

142
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,240
if I should blame you

143
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,590
for all my ailments.

144
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,710
Working with you

145
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,950
makes me under too much stress.

146
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,910
What you do outside every day,

147
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,670
what you plan in your mind every day,

148
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,760
I have no idea at all.

149
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,550
Sometimes

150
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,070
I worry about you.

151
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,280
Sometimes I worry about the company.

152
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,400
If the company really has a problem one day,

153
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
the person to take the blame

154
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,430
will definitely be me,

155
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,670
no doubt about it.

156
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,520
How can you think like that?

157
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,760
How could I let you take the blame?

158
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,550
I consider you my only friend,

159
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,390
my only buddy,

160
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,550
the person I trust the most.

161
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,400
The only person you trust?

162
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Do you believe it?

163
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,790
The only person you trust is yourself.

164
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,360
I observe your expressions and act

165
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,190
according to your mood every day.

166
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,710
You called me in the middle of the night

167
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,670
and then I couldn't sleep all night.

168
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,550
Cheng,

169
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,670
I don't want to hide it from you anymore.

170
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I can't go on

171
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,760
living even a single day like this.

172
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,310
Actually, I've wanted to leave long ago.

173
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,640
I were not unwilling to leave you.

174
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,480
I was afraid of offending you.

175
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,830
I dared not to leave.

176
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,360
All right.

177
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,400
I finally speak my mind now.

178
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,880
Wei.

179
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
I know

180
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,280
you are not feeling well.

181
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,710
That's why you're not in a good mood.

182
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,910
You have a bad temper.

183
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,360
If you have any dissatisfaction,

184
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,550
just direct it towards me.

185
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,480
It's ok.

186
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,520
As long as you can get better,

187
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,320
Wei...

188
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,320
Are you hoping I can be discharged soon

189
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,240
and then continue to work hard for you?

190
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,150
Wei...

191
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,320
I'm here, I'm here.

192
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,760
It's ok. I'm here, I'm here.

193
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,400

there are very few people

It's ok.

267
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,070

who I would be with

273
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,310
if you guys broke up.

274
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,310
I didn't say anything

275
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,960

After Zhou Wei gets sick,

Mr. Hu has completely lost his morale.

Our company won't be finished, will it?

404
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,300
That won't happen.

Just put there over there.

411
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,860
These are very urgent.

00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,540
Let them wait.

Qing,

414
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,980
did you encounter something frustrating?

00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,020
Leave it to me.

416
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,660
The matters that Zhou Wei was handling

417
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,180
were also under my management.

418
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,140
Don't worry.

419
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,780
Chen Pingzhang,

420
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,260
regarding these financial transactions

421
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,900
between your dept and the Sales Dept,

422
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,380
you better give us a reasonable explanation.

423
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,940
It's the normal collaboration.

424
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,620
How could them

425
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,220
be private financial transactions?

426
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,940
What you said is not correct.

427
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,380
You didn't even come up with a good excuse.

428
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,060
The normal exchanges between departments

429
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,540
all can be traced.

430
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,940
But what about this?

431
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,300
The funds in the above accounts

432
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,740
inexplicably transferred back and forth,

433
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,900
and eventually flowed to Licheng Anping.

434
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,860
These funds

435
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,540
are all my personal assets.

436
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,300
I lent them to Mr. Hu

437
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,420
for turnover.

438
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,620
It can be considered

439
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,300
as my personal investment activities.

440
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,820
Lawyer Ning,

441
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,580
you should know this the best.

442
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Mr. Hu and I are good friends.

443
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,950
His company ran into a funding gap

444
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,180
and was struggling with cash flow,

445
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,700
so I lent a helping hand.

446
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
It can be considered

447
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,040
as a timely assistance,

448
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,100
a genuine act of kindness.

449
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,580
Is that so?

450
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,740
Even if you offer help,

451
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,180
you shouldn't falsify accounts,

452
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,940
nor should you misappropriate company funds

453
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,380
to provide assistance.

454
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,900
I didn't falsify the accounts.

455
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,460
- When did I...
- Chen Pingzhang!

456
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,380
I'm giving you one last chance.

457
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,180
Where did this money go?

458
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,100
Ms. Luo,

459
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,540
don't always be so agitated.

460
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,460
I don't care about the cash flow.

461
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,560
I don't know where they have gone.

462
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,500
You shouldn't ask me.

463
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,260
You should ask the Finance Department.

464
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
It is already being checked.

465
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,860
The Finance Department is reporting

466
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,740
in Mr. Li's office.

467
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,420
I think it would be best for you

468
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,260
to sort out your thoughts first,

469
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,220
otherwise how can you explain clearly

470
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,380
to the economic investigation team?

471
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,140
Misappropriating company funds

472
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,780
is not a trivial matter.

473
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,380
Who do you think you are?

474
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,780
What benefits does doing this bring to you?

475
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Do you think Hu Cheng's crime will be light?

476
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,710
How can you join forces with outsiders

477
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,800
to fight against your family?

478
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,920
You are just an ungrateful person.

479
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,020
- Ungrateful!
- Chen Pingzhang!

480
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,300
Watch your mouth!

481
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,660
What does it have to do with you?

482
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,160
You think others don't know about your affairs?

483
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,660
I just don't want to expose you all.

484
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,100
Being honest now is the best choice.

485
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,500
What do I need to be honest about?

486
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,740
I haven't done anything wrong.

487
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,260
Which one is Chen Pingzhang?

488
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,900
Please come with us.

489
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,420
Ning Yue,

490
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,300
do you think that Licheng Anping

491
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,880
has nothing to do with you?

492
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,780
Every single penny you spent over the years

493
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,540
was all given by Hu Cheng.

494
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,220
You will regret it for the rest of your life.

495
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,260
Women should not be so assertive;

496
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,460
assertive women will not be happy.

497
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,620
Thank you for your advice.

498
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,500

499
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,870

500
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,780
Qian, Tian Ming, time to get off work.

501
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,860
What's the rush?

502
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,340
Didn't you say you would leave after mealtime?

503
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,420
Let's go early

504
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,640
or we'll get stuck in a long line later.

505
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,780
I actually want to leave.

506
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,500
I haven't finished this contract yet.

507
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,780
Come on.

508
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,660
I've never seen you so proactive.

509
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,380
Go.

510
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
Ok, ok, ok.

511
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,020
Wait for me at the door.

512
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,860
I'll be right there.

513
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,740
Hurry up.

514
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,740
Got it.

515
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,740
Yue,

516
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,900

517
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,220
I'm not going.

518
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,060
You all go ahead.

519
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,420
Then we'll leave first.

520
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,860
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

521
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,740

522
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,860
Ning Yue.

523
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,780
Please help me make a copy of this contract.

524
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,340
- Sure, no problem.
- Thanks a lot.

525
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,380
See you tomorrow.

526
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,300
See you tomorrow.

527
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,380
I have shipped cp so many years.

528
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,980
Never expect I read the wrong air.

529
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,820
What a surprise!

530
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,300
Which cp?

531
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,380
You don't even know it.

532
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,260
Ask something more critical.

533
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,500
What does it mean by reading the air?

534
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,140
Think about

535
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,800
who are still

536
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
in the office now.

537
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,260
The boss and Yue?

538
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,620
They?

539
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,540
Impossible, right?

540
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,060
I think it's impossible.

541
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,780
This employee has such a big issue at home.

542
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,340
As a leader, he cares about her.

543
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,260
Isn't that very normal?

544
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,540
Are you overthinking it?

545
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,220
I think so too.

546
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,740
You are just overinterpreting it.

547
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,700
I think you don't

548
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,300
have any interpretative ability at all.

549
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,220
Think about it.

550
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,340
Director Qin

551
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,380
not only has a sense of justice

552
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,660
but also a sense of responsibility

553
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,100
and a strong drive to take action.

554
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,260
You didn't tell me what reading the air means.

555
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,620
Qian,

556
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,820
reading the air means to feel,

557
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,900
judge the atmosphere, and observe

558
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,980
people's words and expressions.

559
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,740
As the old saying goes,

560
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,780
it means to be perceptive.

561
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,300
Isn't this just talking about me?

562
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,660
I'm really good at this.

563
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,940
You are amazing.

564
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,620
But some people

565
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,580
has no insight at all.

566
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,060
I understand.

567
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,580
My family is waiting for me for dinner.

568
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,620
I'll go first.

569
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,620
See you tomorrow.

570
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,800
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

571
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,620
Bye.

572
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,380
What does he understand?

573
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,060
He really does understand quite a bit.

574
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,980
I also have good insight.

575
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,780
Still busy?

576
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,900
Yue,

577
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,940
there is only a week left.

578
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,260
I want to know

579
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,340
the situation about your home.

580
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,900
Sorry about that.

581
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,940
I shouldn't pry into your personal matters.

582
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,020
But I worry that Hu Cheng...

583
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,940
Don't worry.

584
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,260
What Hu Cheng is most concerned about now

585
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,200
is not me.

586
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,500
Even the divorce lawsuit

587
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,500
shouldn't be his main concern anymore.

588
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,060
Yue.

589
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,820
You must protect yourself well.

590
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,100
If you need any help,

591
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,260
just let me know.

592
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,220
Thank you.

593
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,630
Get back to your work.

594
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,860
Is there anything I can help you with?

595
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,980
Ok.

596
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,340
This document.

597
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,370
Please help me make a copy.

598
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,360
No problem.

599
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,270
Thank you.

600
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,780
Director Qin.

601
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,020
Ms. Luo wants to meet you.

602
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,260
Ok, got it.

603
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,700
Yue, the copy is inside.

604
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,540
Someone is calling me.

605
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,500
Ok.

606
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,620
Ms. Luo.

607
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,060
Please come in, Director Qin.

608
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,460
You want to meet me?

609
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,620
It's nothing.

610
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,100
Regarding Chen Pingzhang's embezzlement,

611
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,620
the president wants a written report.

612
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,460
Give it to me quickly.

613
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,420
Ok.

614
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,300
There's one more thing.

615
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,500
I borrow Ning Yue

616
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,980
for something.

617
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,820
Ok.

618
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,700
Tell her

619
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,100
I will wait for her downstairs.

620
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,620
Ok, I'm going.

621
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,470
Thank you.

622
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,940
Ms. Luo,

623
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,070
you want to meet me?

624
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,260
(Zhongzhi Group)

625
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
I won't take up much of your time.

626
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,460
Sit down.

627
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,820
I don't know what you like to drink.

628
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,340
I ordered you a latte.

629
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,020
Thank you.

630
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,100
This time

631
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,660
I was able to find Chen Pingzhang so quickly.

632
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,700
I should thank you for taking the lead for me.

633
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,420
The investigation yields significant results.

634
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,180
It's all thanks to your efforts.

635
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,300
Our Legal Department

636
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,420
can at most help you

637
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,380
look up some information

638
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,380
and provide assistance.

639
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,380
Involving me in your war with Hu Cheng

640
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,100
was something you had planned all along.

641
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,540
You knew that my appearance

642
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,620
will be a fatal blow to Hu Cheng.

643
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,540
It can help you.

644
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,260
Isn't it?

645
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,180
Ms. Luo, your professional intuition

646
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,310
is very sharp,

647
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,780
and your imagination

648
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,380
is quite rich.

649
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,900
Bringing personal life

650
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,620
into work

651
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,900
is unprofessional for me.

652
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,620
I won't do it again in the future.

653
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,260
Ning Yue,

654
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,780
I am someone who really dislikes

655
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,500
being kept in the dark and used by others.

656
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,300
I have no interest

657
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,420
in your matters with Hu Cheng.

658
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,620
Whether now or in the future,

659
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,460
it is the same.

660
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,260
I hope you can understand.

661
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,940
I understand.

662
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,700
Then go home.

663
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,220
Don't keep your kid waiting for you.

664
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,480
Ok.

665
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,980
Ms. Luo.

666
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,090
Thank you.

667
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,550
