3
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,400
- How is the situation?
- Yue.

4
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,480
The situation has basically stabilized.

5
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Lawyer Mu had a car accident

6
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
on the way back.

7
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,600
The other party fled the scene.

8
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,560
I can't be sure right now

9
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
that it was an accident

10
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
or...

11
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Ziyuan.

12
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,240
Take it slow.

13
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,520
- Ok.
- Be careful not to hit.

14
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,680
Lawyer Mu had a car accident

15
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,800
on the way back.

16
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,760
It was an accident

17
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,480
or...

18
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
You're back.

19
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,800
Mom, you're back.

20
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,040
- Go play.
- Dad is here.

21
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,640
The environment here is quite good.

22
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Pretty warm.

23
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,320
It's a pity that the place is small.

24
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,640
It's ok for one person to live here.

25
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,760
Mom, am I right?

26
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,440
Take your hands away.

27
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Ziyuan, come here.

28
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,160
It's getting late now.

29
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,760
Grandma is tired.

30
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,080
Let's go home first.

31
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,240
Honey,

32
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,400
let's go home.

33
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
How about I show these photos

34
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,800
to Ziyuan?

35
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,640
Let him know

36
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,040
that his mom doesn't want him anymore.

37
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,960
Hu Cheng,

38
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,840
are you still a person?

39
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,200
Ziyuan has reached the age to go to school.

40
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,280
Now there are two choices.

41
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,720
First,

42
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,120
I send him to a boarding school.

43
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,720
Second,

44
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,360
you go quit that job

45
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,720
and continue to pick him up and drop him off.

46
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,400
Honey,

47
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,640
don't go against me anymore.

48
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,880
Remember this.

49
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,760
At this home,

50
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,520
the one who can decide everything

51
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,680
is only me.

52
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,800
You listen to me

53
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
and obediently take care of the kid.

54
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,160
Then you will always be Ziyuan's mom.

55
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Resign from your job tomorrow.

56
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,960
I hope from now on

57
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
when I get home every day,

58
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
I can see your smiling face.

59
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Why don't you just get a dog?

60
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm telling you,

61
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
Mu Xiao

62
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
is innocent.

63
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
What did you say?

64
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm telling you too.

65
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
Tomorrow

66
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,040
obediently quit your job.

67
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,290
Don't play tricks on me anymore.

68
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,000
Ok?

69
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,880
Ziyuan's mom.

70
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
Answer me!

71
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Ok,

72
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Ziyuan's dad.

73
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,600
Director,

74
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,240
the delivery price finally confirmed

75
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,640
includes customs clearance fees,

76
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
packing fees, logistics fees,

77
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
- and insurance fees.
- Qian.

78
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
You go out for a moment.

79
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,400
Ok.

80
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,520
I want to resign.

81
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
If it is because of the matters at home,

82
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
- I think...
- I want to resign.

83
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,500
You modified the penalty.

84
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,640
You should be very clear about that.

85
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
I know

86
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,600
I can't afford that.

87
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,680
So the company has to sue me.

88
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,480
Fine, then I will fire you.

89
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,360
Director Qin,

90
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,600
let the company sue me.

91
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
If you want to help me,

92
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,640
then please make sure to sue me.

93
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,400
Yue,

94
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,040
what happened?

95
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,640
The contract has been amended by me.

96
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,840
To ensure that the penalty can be fulfilled,

97
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm willing to mortage the house as security.

98
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,000
You can apply for enforcement directly

99
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
and ask me to compensate under the contract.

100
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,160
Ok.

101
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
I promise you.

102
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Thank you.

103
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,800
Is there really no other solution?

104
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,580
No more.

105
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Ms. Luo,

106
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
I think you should already know

107
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
I am Hu Cheng's wife.

108
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,640
I'm not interested

109
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,800
in the private lives of employees.

110
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
Whether you admit it or not,

111
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I think

112
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,200
you owe me a favor.

113
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,300
(Party A: Zhongzhi
Party B: Yaofeng Tech)

114
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,580
(Haikang Hospital)

115
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,420
(Inpatient)

116
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,920
Soon,

117
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,440
I will make him

118
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,760
pay the price.

119
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
I know

120
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,900
what you have been through

121
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,700
and why you want to help me.

122
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,220
You have to keep going.

123
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,260
Be strong.

124
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,140
Ok?

125
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,860
I resigned today.

126
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,100
But the company is going to sue me.

127
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,300
What grounds do they have to sue you?

128
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,540
(Promise to mortage the house as security.)

129
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,580
(Person assigned by Party B: Ning Yue)

130
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,300
As a lawyer,

131
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,420
why would you agree to this?

132
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,540
You even dared to mortgage the house.

133
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,660
I haven't worked in many years.

134
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,710
I've already forgotten

135
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,460
professional knowledge.

136
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,900
Are you doing this on purpose?

137
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,260
It's fine.

138
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,740
There are quite a few solutions.

139
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,660
I have already thought of them for you.

140
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,940
You can choose for yourself.

141
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,620
First,

142
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,940
divorce me

143
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,380
and completely cut ties with me.

144
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,380
Second,

145
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,820
help me pay the high compensation.

146
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,100
Third,

147
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,220
let me continue working.

148
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,020
You choose.

149
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,740
Anyway,

150
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,860
you still won't give up, huh?

151
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,180
Ok.

152
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,540
I'll accompany you to Zhongzhi

153
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,900
and completely

154
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,260
handle this matter.

155
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,580
Director Qin,

156
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,900
tomorrow,

157
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,620
I will go discuss the termination.

158
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,420
My husband will also go.

159
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,540
I've already reserved the meeting room.

160
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,420
(Director Qin)
See you tomorrow, Yue.

161
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,540
Ok.

162
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,620
See you tomorrow.

163
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,020
(Zhongzhi Group)

164
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,780
Ok.

165
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,540
Stop pretending.

166
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,660
Let's get started.

167
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,230
Mr. Hu,

168
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,260
Lawyer Ning's case

169
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,700
involves a relatively large amount of money

170
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,220
and requires our company's vice president

171
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,340
to participate in the discussion.

172
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,180
Of course,

173
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,420
we will also find

174
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,760
a solution that is mutually acceptable

175
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,620
to both parties.

176
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,180
Your analysis was right two days ago.

177
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,780
Yue's husband indeed doesn't want her to work.

178
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,700
They have a meeting today

179
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,820
to talk about this matter.

180
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,380
Why is he so male chauvinistic?

181
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,660
This is her family matter.

182
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,260
We shouldn't say too much about it either.

183
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,980
What's wrong with you?

184
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,940
Well, are you guys

185
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,980
all like this?

186
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,540
Like what?

187
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,700
My sister told me before...

188
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,260
What did your sister say?

189
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
She told me that men...

190
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,220
Forget it. What she said is not important.

191
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,980
You are doing great like this now.

192
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,970
Pretty good.

193
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,220
Director Qin,

194
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,340
my time is very precious.

195
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,020
Please hurry up.

196
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,540
I'm very busy.

197
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,460
Let go!

198
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,220
I ask you to go away.

199
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Everyone is here.

200
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,340
Let's get started.

201
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,620
According to our understanding,

202
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,100
Lawyer Ning

203
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,100
is just an assistant,

204
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
an outsourced worker.

205
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,980
The contract between you

206
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,900
obviously has many unreasonable aspects.

207
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,180
Between the employee and the employer,

208
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,620
there is no direct legal relationship.

209
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,900
I suggest conducting tripartite negotiations

210
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,700
to resolve this issue.

211
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,100
How much salary do you pay her?

212
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,300
When she resignes,

213
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,340
she has to lose the house.

214
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,940
Your way of doing things

215
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,380
is even worse than robbery.

216
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,300
Mr. Hu,

217
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,940
you run the company yourself.

218
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,260
I believe you are aware as well.

219
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
The contract is based on mutual agreement.

220
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,740
That clause was proposed by your wife.

221
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,900
Yes.

222
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,580
This is all my fault.

223
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,300
So

224
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,540
I hope to reach a reconciliation.

225
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,740
Shut up. Who asked you to apologize?

226
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
I'm telling you,

227
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,660
my wife is definitely leaving her job.

228
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,700
Don't think

229
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,700
you can get even a penny.

230
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,540
Mr. Hu, we are in the right in this matter.

231
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,620
Go.

232
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,060
I won't go...

233
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,900
Go home.

234
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,260
Let me go.

235
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,740
I can walk myself. Don't touch me.

236
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,580
Let her go.

237
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,540
Don't touch me!

238
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,660
If you dare to leave today,

239
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,780
wait for the court's notice tomorrow.

240
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,900
Luo Yating.

241
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,700
If you have the guts to sue me, then try it.

242
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,820
I don't have the guts?

243
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,820
Are you sure I don't have the guts?

244
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,620
What?

245
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,740
You say I don't dare, then I won't dare?

246
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,260
Is what you say useful?

247
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,020
Hu Cheng,

248
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,460
let me tell you,

249
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,660
between you and me,

250
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,900
it will always be me who makes the decisions.

251
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,260
It was like this before,

252
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,140
and it is still like this now. Understand?

253
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,740
What is she doing?

254
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,220
Well,

255
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,260
is she taking personal revenge?

256
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,900
Director Qin,

257
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,460
listen to what an executive said.

258
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,580
How unprofessional!

259
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,540
How poor the quality is!

260
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,020
She doesn't understand the most basic things.

261
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,620
She prioritizes personal feelings.

262
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
How can we talk?

263
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,420
You tell me, how can we talk?

264
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
At Zhongzhi,

265
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,140
is there no one else?

266
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,180
Mr. Hu,

267
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,300
as Ning Yue's direct superior,

268
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
to be fair,

269
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,820
no one wanted to see this.

270
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,020
Ning Yue is capable in work and learning.

271
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
She can also accept new things fast.

272
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,100
I am very optimistic about her

273
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,180
future development prospects.

274
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,340
Based on the principle of retaining talent,

275
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,260
the company hopes Ning Yue can stay

276
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,900
and take on more responsibilities.

277
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,980
The place where she has to take responsibility

278
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,300
is not here.

279
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
It's her home.

280
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,460
Only home

281
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,660
is worth her wholehearted dedication.

282
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,460
If you care about her,

283
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,860
then let her go home quickly.

284
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,100
If you insist on making her resign,

285
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,220
we can only fulfill the contract.

286
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,420
If we don't comply with the contract,

287
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,160
the Legal Department

288
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,740
can't explain it to the company.

289
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,940
Let me tell you,

290
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,740
first,

291
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,660
my wife is not the homeowner.

292
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,300
This mortgage is invalid.

293
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,260
Second,

294
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,220
what is this?

295
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,740
This is an unfair contract.

296
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,700
Did your department

297
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,020
not review it before?

298
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,260
This is your responsibility.

299
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,340
What does it have to do with us?

300
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,740
The company has its own rules and regulations.

301
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,700
If Ning Yue wants to resign,

302
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,100
this contract cannot be bypassed.

303
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,780
Second. Whether the contract is valid,

304
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,700
you have your viewpoint

305
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,060
and we have our perspective.

306
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,740
You and Ning Yue are a legal couple.

307
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,900
The most basic apparent agency

308
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,220
can be established.

309
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,460
This matter is not as simple as you think.

310
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,220
Fine.

311
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,500
Then we'll meet each other in court

312
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
and see if the court

313
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,740
considers this contract valid.

314
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,780
Mr. Hu,

315
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,020
as an aside,

316
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,220
Ning Yue has been taking care of the family.

317
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,320
The situation at home is stable.

318
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,260
She has the time and desire to go out and work.

319
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,260
As her husband,

320
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,900
shouldn't you support her?

321
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,140
Director Qin,

322
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,260
I want to remind you of something.

323
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,820
My wife is still not divorced.

324
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,380
Don't intervene too much

325
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,660
about our family matters.

326
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,500
Besides,

327
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,540
last time you went to a hotel with my wife.

328
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,660
I haven't held you accountable yet.

329
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,340
Lawyer Cai, can I

330
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,900
sue him for workplace sexual harassment?

331
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,740
Hu Cheng.

332
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,220
Show me some respect.

333
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,740
If you want to talk,

334
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,340
then talk properly.

335
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,140
If you don't want to talk,

336
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,100
just go back.

337
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,860
Don't make youself feel embarrassed.

338
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,100
Isn't this all because of you?

339
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
What are you laughing at?

340
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,620
I'm laughing at you.

341
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,380
The fate between people

342
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,660
is really wonderful.

343
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,380
Fate

344
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,740
will bring people together.

345
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,140
I really didn't expect

346
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,260
the feud between you and Ms. Luo

347
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,260
to be so deep.

with her, haven't you?

352
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,260
All of this was arranged by you.

353
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,700
You team up with this woman to get back at me?

354
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,820
Why?

355
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,820
Why?

356
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,460
I just want a job.

357
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,460

You ask me

364

why I teamed up with her.

365
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,740
Then let me tell you.

366
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,780
Because

367
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,460
she is your shame.

368
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,020
She proved your failure

369
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,020
and incompetence.

370
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,340
You are afraid of her.

371
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,430
What was the specific situation?

372
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,670
At that time we, saw

373
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,400
the man and the woman are arguing.

374
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,730
Then the man

375
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,730
pushed the woman.

376
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,740
Then I saw him

377
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,340
deliberately bump the woman against the glass.

378
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,900
We couldn't see clearly either.

379
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,420
Not sure about the specific situation.

380
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,740
Clearly, clearly.

381
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,910
Sir,

382
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,090
he was doing it on purpose.

383
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,940
He doesn't want Yue to work.

384
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,220
He wants her to look after the kid at home.

385
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,300
Yue didn't agree

386
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,340
and then he hit her.

387
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,840
We can all testify that.

388
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,470
He looks like an abusive man.

389
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,500
Stop it, Pan Jie.

390
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,380
What abusive man?

391
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,620
Did you see it?

392
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,300
Did it happen at home?

393
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,820
Didn't it happen in a public place?

394
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,540
Sir,

395
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,980
regardless of being at home

396
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
or in a public place,

397
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,100
men shouldn't hit women.

398
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,180
Am I right?

399
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,740
Exactly, it's very dangerous.

400
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,060
He must be caught quickly.

401
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,380
Sir,

402
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,660
I witnessed the whole process.

403
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,980
This is just an accident.

404
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,780
The man clearly wanted

405
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,460
to reach out and pull the woman.

406
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,180
Let's leave it at that for today.

407
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,140
We'll talk again once the results come out.

408
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,100
Thank you for the hard work, sir.

409
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,700
(Haikang Hospital)

410
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,780
Yue, you're awake.

411
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,460
Director Qin,

412
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,070
I'm fine.

413
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,620
It's just some minor scratches.

414
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,990
You can go back now.

415
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,780
Don't think too much.

416
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,260
Sleep a little longer.

417
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,020
I mean it.

418
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,300
I'm fine.

419
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,540
You don't have to be worried.

420
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,700
Hurry back.

421
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Go back.

422
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,700
How could this happen?

423
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,300
What's wrong with me?

424
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,540
How did we get to this point?

425
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,540
That scene was really too frightening.

426
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,300
What has Yue experienced?

427
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,300
I don't know if this confession is acceptable.

428
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,300
The boss is here. Ask him.

429
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,540
- Boss.
- Director.

430
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,060
How is Yue?

431
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,700
Just some superficial injuries.

432
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,260
She has already gone home to rest.

433
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,220
What about the face?

434
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,340
The face is fine.

435
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,660
After going through this,

436
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,820
Yue must have been really scared.

437
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,260
Let alone her,

438
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,560
we are all terrified just watching that.

439
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,940
Yue looks troubled

440
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,140
every day,

441
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,220
which is definitely not right.

442
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,260
That guy dared to act

443
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,900
like this in front of so many people.

444
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,980
He must be more aggressive at home.

445
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,500
Yue is so pitiful.

446
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,220
All right.

447
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,940
As long as Ning Yue is fine,

448
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,180
that's good.

449
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,300
Hurry up and get to work.

450
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,420

00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,400
Thank you.

475
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,900
What's the problem?

476
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,980
I got married without knowing him well.

477
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,940
That's normal.

478
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,020
After the marriage,

479
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,980
you can slowly know him.

480
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,500
I got divorced after knowing him well.

481
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,100
It's normal too.

482
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,100
After realizing that you are not suitable,

483
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,980
then break up.

484
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,420
It's been seven years.

485
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,060
I saw him today.

486
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,860
When we were together,

487
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,300
from toothpaste

488
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,190
to what to eat for breakfast,

489
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
lunch, and dinner,

490
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,740
I prepared everything for him.

491
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,620
Where he is going,

492
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,500
what clothes he will wear,

493
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,100
what color of suit matches

494
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,500
what kind of shoes,

495
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,820
what color tie and socks,

496
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,900
and even underwear,

497
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,300
I have arranged everything for him.

498
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,900
But...

499
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,140
But he didn't need it.

500
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,140
He didn't like.

501
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,300
Mo.

502
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,460
If I hadn't divorced back then,

503
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,020
let me tell you,

504
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,420
the woman lying in a pool of blood today

505
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,020
might be me.

506
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,620
Someone has said,

507
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,300
a good marriage will help you

508
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,700
become a better version of yourself,

509
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,140
while a bad marriage

510
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,020
will reveal the worst in you.

511
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,940
I have been wondering

512
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,860
if I made him

513
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,740
become the worse version

514
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,460
of himself.

515
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,420
I seriously tell you,

516
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,180
it's not you.

517
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Alright, alright, alright.

518
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,020
(Diaoyutai)

519
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,140
Be careful. Don't hurt your feet.

520
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,820
Take it slow.

521
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,740
Don't break it.

522
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,940
Be careful, be careful.

523
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,100
Come on, let's do it together.

524
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,180
Let's work hard together.

525
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,260
One, two, three, go.

526
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,540
Ok.

527
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,260
Make sure to clean it up.

528
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,460
What the hell!

529
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,580
- Be careful.
- Excuse me.

530
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,900
I'm the director of the Legal Department.

531
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
This matter has nothing to do with us.

532
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,580
No worries. I'm not causing you trouble.

533
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,100
I have clearly emphasized this to her.

534
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,260
This glass wall already has cracks.

535
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,300
It's very unsafe.

536
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,580
She still insisted

537
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,780
on using this meeting room.

538
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,500
There are so many rooms available.

539
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,100
But she insisted on using this one.

540
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Who did you talk to?

541
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,580
That's...

542
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,860
The injured female lawyer.

543
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,780
That day, she saw

544
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,250
we are replacing the door and the glass.

545
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,310
This is the last piece left.

546
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,420
What was she in such a hurry for?

547
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,860
I modified this contract myself.

548
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,100
If possible,

549
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,540
I hope to sign immediately.

550
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,820
Even if you don't work at Zhongzhi,

551
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,700
you can still find a good job.

552
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,100
Just staying like this,

553
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,500
don't you really feel wronged?

554
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,340
Not wronged.

555
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,860
No matter how embarrassing it is,

556
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,940
I can still stay here.

557
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,060
What exactly is Li Cheng Anping?

558
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,220
You went through so much effort

559
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,260
and endured so many grievances

560
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,300
to stay at Zhongzhi.

561
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,740
Why?

562
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,380
I came today to apply for remote work.

563
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,580
Trust me.

564
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,100
Give me a week.

565
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,380
One week later,

566
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,140
everything will return to normal.

567
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,220
I want to resign.

568
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,180
The penalty was modified by you.

569
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,360
You should be very clear about that.

570
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,100
I know.

571
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,660
So the company has to sue me.

572
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,460
If you want to help me,

573
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,300
please make sure to sue me.

574
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,780
Didn't you just ask me

575
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,500
why I team up with her?

576
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,540
Because

577
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,300
she is your shame.

578
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,860
She proved your failure

579
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,700
and incompetence.

580
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
You are afraid of her.

581
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,220
(Ning Yue)

582
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,180
(We are at the family restaurant.)

583
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,180
(Almost there. Thanks for picking up Ziyuan.)

584
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,260
Mr. Qin.

585
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Why

586
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,100
do you look worried?

587
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,900
Are you unhappy?

588
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,780
No.

589
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,460
My uncle is an adult.

590
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,460
Adults are all like this.

591
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,500
My mom is not like that.

592
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,780
My mom smiles at me every day.

593
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,540
I love my mom the most.

594
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,100
Your mom

595
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,500
is laughing at how silly you are.

596
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,220
Definitely not.

597
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
Ziyuan.

598
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,420
Do you like your dad?

599
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,220
Of course I like my dad.

600
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,260
Mom!

601
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,540
Mom!

602
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,060
Mom! Mom!

603
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,500
Mom.

604
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,780
Ziyuan.

605
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,140
Be good.

606
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,020
I'll be good.

607
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,860
I'll go inside to find you.

608
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,980
Hu Cheng was detained for seven days

609
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,540
for disturbing social order.

610
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,140
Only by making him neglect one or the other

611
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,140
can you have the time

612
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,420
and space to maneuver.

613
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,660
What else?

614
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,180
During this time,

615
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,220
you will submit the evidence,

616
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,860
appeal

617
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,260
and file a case.

618
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,700
That's enough.

619
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,020
After all, you used to be a couple.

620
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,060
Even if you are not together anymore,

621
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,500
you should part on good terms.

622
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,900
This is better for the kid.

623
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,660
Why make such a fuss now?

624
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,900
Why not ask like this?

625
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,900
Because your husband is insane.

626
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,260
You don't want to sit back and do nothing.

627
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,140
So you can only be crazier than him.
