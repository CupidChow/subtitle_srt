=Episode 18=

3
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,390
Hurry up.

4
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,190
Is it easy to move?

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,560
No problem.

6
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,270
Sis, what brings you here?

7
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm just about to leave.

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,390
Where to put it?

9
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,550
What is it?

10
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,800
Put it at the door.

11
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,910
Miss,

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
hello.

13
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,770
Grandma can't stand the air conditioning.

14
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,910
I bought her a bladeless fan

15
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,840
and asked him for help.

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
He is my colleague,

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Zhong Tianming.

18
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,880
Thank you for your hard work.

19
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,950
Nothing, not hard.

20
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,880
I didn't take advantage of him.

21
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
I treated him to a meal.

22
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,720
That's right. Let me move it inside.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,560
It's quite heavy.

24
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,190
Ok, here.

25
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,670
Sis, can you stay a bit longer?

26
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,160
- I'm not.
- Come on, just stay for a while.

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,220
Let's have a chat for a bit longer.

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,190
Come in, sis.

29
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,440
Grandma.

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Is it cool?

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,630
Cool.

32
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,750
It's fine as long as it's cool.

33
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,040
I see him adjusting it for half a day.

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,350
I'm afraid you can't use it today.

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,750
You

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,790
didn't do anything,

37
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,600
just to direct others.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
Grandma,

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
if you need anything

40
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,560
in the future,

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,600
just let me know,

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,440
- I'll buy it for you.
- Ok.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,600
Don't worry, sis.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,040
I will take good care of grandma.

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Jie,

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,350
bring this colleague home more often.

47
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,320
Why should I bring him home?

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,790
He just came to help today.

49
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,470
I like him.

50
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,440
Grandma,

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,190
he really is just my colleague.

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Grandma,

53
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,670
I'm going back to work now.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,910
You

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,190
take a good rest

56
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,190
and take care of your health.

57
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,630
Ok.

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,470
You pay attention to rest too.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Sis,

60
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,350
wait for me.

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,190
Aren't you staying a bit longer?

62
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,190
I was already planning to leave.

63
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,750
Didn't you notice?

64
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,000
That guy likes you.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,880
But it's ok.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
You did the right thing.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,790
Keep pretending that you don't know.

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,000
Boys like him

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,280
are obviously not promising.

70
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,350
Sis,

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,560
you don't even know him.

72
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
Why do you say that?

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,470
You're protecting him, huh?

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
No.

75
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,550
I just feel like you don't know him,

76
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,080
and it's strange for you to say that.

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,280
After all, he is my colleague.

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Fine.

79
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,350
Anyway, you is not promising too.

80
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,790
You two are quite a match, huh?

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,630
Keep it on.

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,910
I'm about to sign a contract with Mr. Mo.

83
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,160
Wait a little longer.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,960
How could I possibly not pay you back?

85
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,310
By then,

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,310
the principal and the dividends,

87
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,150
I'll give you all.

88
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,200
Please stop urging me.

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,040
It's so such money.

90
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,790
You have to give me some time, right?

91
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,130
I'll talk to you about it later.

92
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Is something wrong?

93
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,270
Nothing.

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,550
Cheng, let me ask you a question.

95
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,430
You and Mr. Chen from Zhongzhi

96
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,280
has no other contact, right?

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,350
I heard he is being investigated.

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Got it.

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,670
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

100
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm going to choose

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,870
the appliances with my wife today.

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,270
Wei.

103
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,230
How about I go to see your new house?

104
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,160
There's nothing there at all.

105
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,040
It's still empty.

106
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
Nothing to see.

107
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,550
I'm going to learn your taste.

108
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,080
Are you kidding me?

109
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,870
Alright, let's go.

110
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,870
Are you really going?

111
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,710
Let's go.

112
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,910
Move over here.

113
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,910
Just put it under the cabinet.

114
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,200
- Ok.
- Be gentle.

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,080
- Don't worry.
- Ok.

116
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,350
Thank you for your hard work.

117
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
Well...

118
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,960
What's going on, honey?

119
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,720
I want to ask you too.

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,640
Where did these come from?

121
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,870
You bought them but didn't even tell me.

122
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,350
No. Didn't we agree

123
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,720
to choose the appliances in the evening?

124
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,720
Did you guys get this wrong?

125
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,830
Mrs. Zhou,

126
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,430
these are all given by me.

127
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,050
Cheng...

128
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,550
Wei has been with me for so many years.

129
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,790
You're about to move into a new house.

130
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,430
How can I not express my feelings?

131
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,280
Well...

132
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,990
Cheng,

133
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,470
this is just too much.

134
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,080
You doing this makes me feel bad.

135
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,550
Just don't dislike it.

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,870
They are some classic styles I picked out.

137
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,670
Quite versatile.

138
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,990
You really do dislike it, huh?

139
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,990
Cheng, he's just not good with words.

140
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,160
I thank you on his behalf.

141
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,600
Mrs. Zhou, please don't say that.

142
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,470
Thanks to his help all these years.

143
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,990
We are a family. No need for formality.

144
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,430
This is what I should do.

145
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,370
Well,

146
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,470
it's too much.

147
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,670
Let's sit on the sofa.

148
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,350
I have nothing to offer you.

149
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,230
That's great.

150
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,990
After everything is done,

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
you have

152
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,590
- to treat me to a big meal.
- Sure.

153
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,200
At that time, welcome you and Yue.

154
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,350
- Sir, place it over there.
- Ok.

155
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,760
- Against the wall, thank you.
- Ok.

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,670
How much are there?

157
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,900
(Shangshi Center)

158
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,550
Why do you keep looking at me today?

159
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,590
Who look at you?

160
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
You really flatter yourself.

161
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,590
We're all the same.

162
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,000
Come on, for Mr. Gao's words,

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,190
let's have a drink.

164
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,100
Here, let's toast to you.

165
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,000
- Here.
- Let's toast to you.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
Here, Mr. Hu.

167
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,980
Let's drink together.

168
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's drink together. Come on!

169
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,190
Come on.

170
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,000
So touched.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Mr. Gao, come on.

172
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,790
Here, Mr. Hu.

173
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,950
Young people are so ambitious.

174
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,160
Let's learn from each other.

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,710
Come on, let's toast to Mr. Hu.

176
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,760
Zibo, come here.

177
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,750
Who is this?

178
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Come over, come over.

179
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,000
Let me introduce to you.

180
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,790
This is Hu Zibo.

181
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,760
He is

182
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
my nephew.

183
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,310
He is the one in the family

184
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,240
who is most like me.

185
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,790
I can tell it.

186
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,550
From now on, you should interact more.

187
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,280
Please take good care of him.

188
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,400
- Thank you in advance.
- Absolutely.

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,070
You are too welcome, Mr. Hu.

190
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,710
Come on, make a toast to everyone.

191
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,710
Ok, ok, ok.

192
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,760
Here. Nice to meet you.

193
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,670
Young Mr. Hu.

194
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,120
- Here, young Mr. Hu.
- Young Mr. Hu.

195
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,790
I am flattered. Nice to meet you.

196
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,630
Nice to meet you.

197
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,950
Thank you, Uncle.

198
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,040
It's not our time anymore.

199
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,760
The new overthrow the old.

200
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,640
That's so right.

201
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,120
Add everyone on WeChat.

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,470
- Sure.
- Ok.

203
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,430
Add friends on WeChat.

204
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,670
This is a golden opportunity. Hurry up!

205
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,550
Please take good care of him.

206
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,190
Please don't say that.

207
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,550
- Sure.
- We're all on the same side.

208
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,760
Thank you.

209
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,670
Ok.

210
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,460
(Sunkin Center)

211
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,550
Qing,

212
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
have you seen Mr. Zhou?

213
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,430
I haven't.

214
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,430
I haven't seen him

215
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,590
all day.

216
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
All day?

217
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,070
It's about to get off work.

218
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,280
It's time to come back.

219
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,950
I've already prepared the proposal

220
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,190
to wait for his approval.

221
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,240
Mr. Hu is in the office.

222
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,270
Or

223
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,240
you can go find Mr. Hu.

224
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,080
Come in.

225
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,390
Mr. Hu.

226
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,510
This...

227
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,620
(Mr. Chen)

228
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,670
Mr. Hu,

229
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,120
Mr. Zhou is absent today.

230
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,950
There are several bid projects here.

231
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,240
I have already organized them.

232
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,220
You...

233
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,480
Mr. Hu.

234
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,480
It's not right for you

235
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,400
to keep dodging me like this.

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,880
Who has been dodging you?

237
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,910
I misappropriated that money from the company

238
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,430
to invested in you.

239
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,790
Now Zhongzhi has already traced it back to me.

240
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,430
I worry about being discovered by the company.

241
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,310
After Mr. Mo's funds are in place,

242
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,520
I will give you dividends immediately.

243
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,480
Why don't you understand?

244
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,910
Is it a matter of me lacking money?

245
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm worried about being checked by the company.

246
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,950
Didn't you say before

247
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,480
they don't have any evidence?

248
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,430
They won't find anything on you.

249
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,670
I have a bad feeling about this.

250
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,400
A few days ago,

251
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,480
that vice president

252
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,190
called me to her office

253
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,670
and asked me three times.

254
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,400
Moreover, the Sales Department

255
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,070
urged me urgently.

256
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,310
The investigation is still ongoing.

257
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,830
The financial records were checked thoroughly.

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,190
At this critical moment,

259
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I just hope

260
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,360
I can get through smoothly

261
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,710
without any issues.

262
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
Mr. Chen,

263
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,640
stay calm.

264
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,240
Maybe it's just

265
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,710
a routine investigation.

266
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,160
Could it be Qin Can

267
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,830
who is deliberately messing with you?

268
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,430
It's not Qin Can.

269
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,640
It's that female vice president

270
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,670
who just came.

271
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,120
She is eager to achieve results.

272
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,360
And ever since last time

273
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,640
Ning Yue was dismissed,

274
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,400
she has set her sights on me.

275
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,360
She is anxious.

276
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,000
What are you anxious?

277
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,070
You're not anxious, huh?

278
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,400
I can tell

279
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,430
that you are not anxious.

280
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,400
I can't sleep well every night now.

281
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,430
I often wake up at night.

282
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,710
You told me you are not anxious.

283
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,070
Then let me tell you.

284
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,910
If they investigate it thoroughly,

285
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,000
the consequences

286
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,360
will be much more serious than you can imagine.

287
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,550
The guilt that you have to take

288
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,480
is much heavier than mine.

289
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,240
What they are checking now

290
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,480
are the contracts of my department.

291
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,240
But these contracts

292
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,120
and Licheng Anping

293
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,310
are related.

294
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,590
This company,

295
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,190
you can't deny it, right?

296
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,240
It's ok to deny it.

297
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,950
I

298
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,160
have records of it.

299
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,120
If they find out

300
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
Licheng Anping,

301
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,190
both of us

302
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
must go to jail.

303
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,150
Mr. Hu,

304
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,760
both of us

305
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,400
are in the same boat now.

306
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,000
If this boat,

307
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,280
splashes, turns over,

308
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,520
it won't be good

309
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,310
for anyone.

310
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,880
This amount of money,

311
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,640
I need some time.

312
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,270
Be quick.

313
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,400
Hello? It's me.

314
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,670
I need some money.

315
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,670
Hello?

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,640
I found a significant portion of the shares

317
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,160
has been transferred to Mingdu Club.

318
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,120
Let's talk specifics when we meet.

319
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,600
Ok.

320
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,550
Now it is only necessary to prove

321
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,600
that the mastermind behind Mingdu Club

322
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,080
is Hu Cheng.

323
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Zhou Wei said

324
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,360
Hu Cheng previously used his own money

325
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,360
to fill the company's gap.

326
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,910
After the company's issues were resolved,

327
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,830
he put the returned money

328
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,160
back into this account.

329
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,520
We misunderstood him before.

330
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,710
But the fact proves

331
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,310
we didn't wrong him either.

332
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,480
He didn't want

333
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,000
to get this money back at all.

334
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,430
So he's doing this on purpose.

335
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,950
In the end,

336
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,640
once the trust between two people is gone,

337
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,240
they are getting farther apart.

338
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Tomorrow, I will formally file for divorce.

339
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,040
He will definitely not agree.

340
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,880
By then,

341
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,550
I will first take Ziyuan to move out.

Everything is ready.

347
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,590
Have you seen Mr. Zhou?

348
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,630
No.

349
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,390
I couldn't reach him all day yesterday.

350
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,390
Wei,

351
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,590
why haven't I seen you at the company?

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,520
Where have you been?

353
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,190
You...

354
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,720
Why don't you reply to my WeChat?

355
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,560
Wei.

356
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,320
Come in.

357
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,280
Mr. Hu.

358
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,720
This one...

359
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,550
Could you please take a look?

360
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
What is it?

361
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,350
Mr. Zhou's resignation letter.

362
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,790
It was just sent this morning.

363
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,150
Resignation?

364
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,880
Where is he?

365
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,630
I didn't see Mr. Zhou in person.

366
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,790
Resignation Letter

367
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,760
was sent directly by Mr. Zhou

368
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,240
to the email address of the HR department.

369
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
He didn't mention

370
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,550
the specific reason either.

371
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,310
He just said there is an urgent matter at home

372
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,960
and he can't manage to work.

373
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,390
An urgent matter at home?

374
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,550
What urgent matter is it?

375
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,520
Didn't he just buy a new house and move?

376
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
That's very good.

377
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,630
What's wrong with you?

378
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,960
Did you ask him clearly?

379
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,520
Mr. Hu, I came to you
after receiving the email.

380
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,740
(Resignation Letter by Zhou Wei)

381
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
(Wei)

382
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I really feel a bit tired.

383
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,000
Maybe I am getting old.

384
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,310
Powerless.

385
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,720
I really want to take a break.

386
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,070
Hello?

387
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,630
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily...

388
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,280
Zhou Wei!

389
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,470
Zhou Wei!

390
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,280
Zhou Wei!

391
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,390
Come out!

392
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,390
What are you doing?

393
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,560
Looking for someone.

394
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,310
No one lives here. Who are you looking for?

395
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,320
You must be crazy.

396
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,590
How could there be no one?

397
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,440
Isn't this house under renovation?

398
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,960
The renovation team left long ago.

399
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,320
What's the matter?

400
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,310
You were deceived?

401
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Zhou Wei,

402
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,960
you have already found another job, right?

403
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,310
Let me tell you,

404
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,760
you want to change jobs,

405
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,000
absolutely impossible.

406
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,440
How have I treated you?

407
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,760
How have you treated me?

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,280
You want to betray me?

409
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,070
I tell you that you will get nothing,

410
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,310
nothing at all.

411
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,230
Listen up.

412
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,480
Stop all the work in your hands.

413
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,000
Immediately

414
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,680
stop all projects

415
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
related to Zhou Wei.

416
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Check

417
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,630
Zhou Wei's past chat records with clients

418
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,550
and his previous correspondence with clients.

419
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,110
Check them carefully.

420
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,870
Not a single punctuation mark can be missed.

421
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,960
I want to see who exactly dug him out.

422
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,280
And...

423
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,470
And

424
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,310
integrate all of Zhou Wei's client resources

425
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,040
to me.

426
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,310
Did you hear? Hurry up and do it.

427
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,360
Mr. Hu,

428
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,560
you call me.

429
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,280
From now on, Zhou Wei's projects

430
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,790
will be handed to you.

431
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,040
Work hard.

432
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,150
Don't let me down.

433
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,350
Don't worry, Mr. Hu.

434
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,470
And you.

435
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,960
Go to Zhou Wei's house right now

436
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,350
and stay there.

437
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,720
As soon as he appears, tell me immediately.

438
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,280
I don't believe he doesn't leave the house

439
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,120
nor go home.

440
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,310
I will go right away.

441
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,800
Mr. Hu,

442
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,550
did Mr. Zhou really resign?

443
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,500
No way.

444
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,830
He can't leave.

445
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,790
Well,

446
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,630
what about the position and salary?

447
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,590
His position will be reserved first.

448
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,550
Stop the salary.

449
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,000
Wait for him to come back and beg me.

450
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,500
(Divorce Agreement)

451
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
Mom.

452
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,040
Can you play with me?

453
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,440
What's wrong, baby?

454
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,700
Dad ignored me.

455
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,200
He didn't play with me.

456
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,390
He asked me go out to find you.

457
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,960
I go to talk to Dad about something.

458
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,760
I play with you later, ok?

459
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,550
Ziyuan is the best boy.

460
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,200
Play by yourself for a while.

461
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,440
Do you think it's funny?

462
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,460
(Divorce Agreement)

463
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,440
After all these years of relationship,

464
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,350
it actually ends like this.

465
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,420
(Divorce Agreement)

466
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,760
Who are you talking about?

467
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,440
Why did he betray me?

468
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,790
I always thought of him in every way.

469
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,590
He turned his face away

470
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,760
and actually left without saying a word.

471
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,480
He is my only friend.

472
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,440
Is it Zhou Wei?

473
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,760
I don't know what happened between you.

474
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,720
But I want to say

475
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,440
you've been friends for over ten years.

476
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,760
He is not that kind of person.

477
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,760
The deeper the feelings,

478
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,550
the more it hurts.

479
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,630
So he is fearless.

480
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,740
(Divorce Agreement)

481
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,020
(No more notices)

482
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,300
Technical bottlenecks

483
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,500
encountered during the process

484
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,740
which cause delays in R&D progress

485
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,060
have been basically resolved

486
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,860
last week.

487
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,980
We also improved the intelligent algorithms.

488
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,860
We will continue the optimization

489
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,180
to enhance user experience

490
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,680
and strengthen our marketing efforts

491
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,020
- Wait.
- to enhance the Yaofeng brand.

492
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,580
(Ma)

493
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,180
Hello?

494
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,700
Found him?

495
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
It's ok to find his wife.

496
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,100
Follow her

497
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,500
and see where she will go.

498
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,460
Send me the address.

499
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
I'll come over shortly.

500
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,660
Listen up.

501
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,620
The meeting will be paused.

502
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,780
Let's talk when I come back.

503
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,460
Zibo,

504
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,620
explain the bidding situation to everyone.

505
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,460
Ok, Mr. Hu.

506
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,980
Mr. Hu is making things difficult for Mr. Zhou.

507
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,900
Why do they have to do this to each other?

508
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,460
Neither of them leaves a way out.

509
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,020
Do you still remember Song?

510
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,220
I thought Mr. Zhou

511
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,590
had a special relationship with Mr. Hu

512
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,570
and Mr. Hu would show some mercy.

513
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,500
But what's the result?

514
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,180
Artificial intelligence in healthcare...

515
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,620
If anyone wants to resign in the future,

516
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,020
he really has to think it through.

517
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,900
(Huating Real Estate Agency)

518
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,780
Where is she?

519
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,100
Mrs. Zhou just left.

520
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,020
- Well...
- Say it.

521
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,020
Mr. Zhou is going to sell his house.

522
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,820
Good lord,

523
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
he plans to escape with embezzled funds.

524
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,980
Zhou Wei,

525
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,620
is it really necessary for you to hide from me?

526
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,860
(Diaoyutai)

527
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,740
Mr. Chen.

528
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,220
What's the matter?

529
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,620
I found it out, Mr. Chen.

530
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,100
Recently, there is a person

531
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,800
who has been investigating our past contracts

532
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,020
under the guise of the investigation

533
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,420
in the archives.

534
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,580
Who is it?

535
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,620
Mr. Chen,

536
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,880
what can I do for you?

537
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,420
I come to see

538
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,460
how the feng shui of your department is.

539
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,580
There is a problem with it.

540
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,790
I need to adjust it for you guys.

541
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,660
(Mr. Chen)

542
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,260
What's wrong, Mr. Chen?

543
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,420
Why did it take you so long to answer my call?

544
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,420
Didn't I just pay you back?

545
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,060
Want the second one so soon?

546
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,820
Mr. Hu,

547
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,020
listen to me.

548
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,110
Do you know

549
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,140
who is plotting against me behind my back?

550
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,180
How would I know?

551
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,060
After you get home,

552
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,780
ask your loved wife properly.

553
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,420
What do you mean by this?

554
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,420
Your loved wife Ning Yue

555
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,900
gets the job back

556
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,500
right now

557
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,260
as an outsourced worker.

558
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,180
You don't know

559
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,260
this thing, right?

560
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,380
Ning Yue tried

561
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,540
every means to stay in the Legal Dept.

562
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,940
Guess what she's up to?

563
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,260
She has been checking on you

564
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,860
every day in the archives.

565
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,260
I was still pondering at that time

566
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,940
who insists

567
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,860
on reporting me.

568
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,540
It's impossible for one of our own

569
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,380
to hurt another, right?

570
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,260
I understand it now.

571
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,500
She found out

572
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,020
we have an interest relationship.

573
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,980
She targets me just to deal with you.

574
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,820
Your wife

575
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,260
is quite something.

576
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,200
You deal with her

577
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,990
and she messes with you.

578
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,580
You two really are a family.

579
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,020
And one more thing.

580
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,020
She is now

581
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,860
checking your Licheng Anping.

582
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,940
You need to be more careful.

583
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,940
Calm down and quickly handle this matter.

584
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,780
Otherwise, we are

585
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,620
both doomed.

586
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,020
Your wife and that Director Qin

587
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,660
are really impressive.

588
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,460
Between them,

589
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,980
what's going on?

590
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,280
After knowing your wife was dismissed,

591
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,780
he begged everyone

592
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,860
and tried to keep her here.

593
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,740
I really don't know what's going on.

594
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,500
Is there really

595
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,740
something between them?

596
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,220
Didn't you feel something

597
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,340
that you were eager

598
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,460
for your wife

599
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
to go home?

600
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,140
Director Qin, if there is nothing else,

601
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,020
I'll head back now.

602
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,860
Ok.

603
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,060
Pan Jie.

604
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,900
Where are Zhong and Qian?

605
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,300
They went to eat.

606
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,020
It's just the right time to use them.

607
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,980
But they are not here.

608
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,740
What do you want to do, boss?

609
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,540
Ask them to do the hard work, of course.

610
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,740
Then I can't help you.

611
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,180
I'll do it myself.

612
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,780
What hard work?

613
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,340
After experiencing what happened last time,

614
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,580
I feel especially good.

615
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,010
It's fine.

616
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,800
I usually carry my kid.

617
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,180
This weight

618
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,460
is nothing for me.

619
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,620
Well...

620
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,580
Go home with me.

621
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,380
What are you doing?

622
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,860
Go back with me.

623
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,300
Go back.

624
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,340
Hu Cheng, let go.

625
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,340
- What are you doing?
- Let her go.

626
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,180
Go away.

627
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,940
Hu Cheng.

628
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,740
I can walk by myself.

629
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,340
What happened?

630
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,190
He just came over

631
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,460
and took Yue away.

632
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,780
Boss, nothing will go wrong, right?

633
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,380
What are you doing?

634
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,620
Are you sick or what?

635
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,460
Are you crazy?

636
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,140
You actually checked my assets behind my back.

637
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,580
Yeah.

638
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,900
I checked.

639
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,860
Where did your money go?

640
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,180
My company has encountered issues.

641
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,740
I used my own money for emergency.

642
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,780
What problem do I have?

643
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,860
The issues have long been resolved.

644
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,620
The money has already been transferred back.

645
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,340
Your account is now empty.

646
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,380
I earned this money.

647
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,340
I can put it wherever I want. I will decide!

648
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,860
Everything is up to you.

649
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,340
Hu Cheng,

650
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,740
do you know

651
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,140
marriage is a matter between two people.

652
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,420
It depends on whether you want to be with me.

653
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,740
I don't want to go on anymore.

654
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,380
I just don't want to live well right now.

655
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,260
I can't go on living like this for even a day.

656
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,940
What have I done wrong?

657
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,300
I gave you everything.

658
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,580
While you were doing charity,

659
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,060
I was rolling and crawling in the mud.

660
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,540
I sacrificed my dignity.

661
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,780
I have put in my sweat.

662
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,620
I earned so much money

663
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,500
so that you can have a decent life.

664
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,140
So do I have to compromise?

665
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,780
Do I have to listen to you for everything?

666
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,020
Do I have to forgive your betrayal

667
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,660
one time after another?

668
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,740
Do I have to tolerate your control

669
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,700
over me one time after another?

670
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,140
Hu Cheng,

671
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,260
you have never

672
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,540
treated me as an equal wife.

673
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Let's get a divorce.

674
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,420
(Divorce Agreement)

675
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,980
(The wife: Ning Yue)

676
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,740
Let me tell you,

677
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,740
I hate it the most when others betray me,

678
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,980
especially my wife.

679
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,340
Resign.

680
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,060
This is your last choice.

681
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,140
...to choose to let go,

682
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,980
and rebuild trust,

683
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,460
how difficult it is.

684
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,260
We have already lost trust.

685
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,340
We can rebuild trust.

686
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,220
There have been cracks long ago.

687
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
It's impossible to fix it no matter what.

688
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,340
I don't want to go on anymore.

689
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,980
I just don't want to live well right now.

690
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,180
I can't stand living like this for even a day.

691
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,900
Let's get a divorce.

692
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,980
She tried every means

693
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,140
to stay in the Legal Department.

694
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,660
Guess what she's up to?

695
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,380
She's checking on you every day.

696
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,540
I don't want to be the boss's wife.

697
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,460
I want to be the boss.

698
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,220
She is now

699
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,020
checking your Licheng Anping.

700
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,340
Ziyuan,

701
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,340
let's go to Grandma's house

702
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,220
- to stay for a while, ok?
- Ok.

703
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,820
Let's go see Grandma.

704
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,660
Ok.

705
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,900
Hello, Ms.

706
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,750
Hello.

707
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,720
I am very sorry

708
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,530
to trouble you like this.

709
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,250
Ms. Xia told me

710
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,020
you are also a very experienced lawyer.

711
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,580
And I think you are a nice person.

712
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,840
Maybe you can help me.

713
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,940
I...

714
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,260
I really have no other way out.

715
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,180
You go back to the service station first.

716
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,180
I'll contact you tomorrow, ok?

717
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,500
Ok.

718
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,980
Are you going on a long trip?

719
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,220
We are going to see Grandma.

720
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,860
He is really good.

721
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,100
Then we'll leaving.

722
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,940
Ok.

723
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Goodbye, Ms.

724
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,460
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

725
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,540
Mom.

726
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,420
Kindergarten,

727
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,700
we can take him there tomorrow.

728
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,820
I will go with you in the morning.

729
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,580
I can pick him up and drop him off.

730
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,380
(Civil Complaint
Plaintiff: Ning Yue)

731
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,420
(Defendant: Hu Cheng)

732
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,260
(Yue)

733
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,940
Hello?

734
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,020
The complaint and copies of evidence

735
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,470
are ready.

736
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,290
You can submit them to the court now.

737
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,820
The legal person of Licheng Anping

738
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,820
and Mingdu Club, Feng Yaping,

739
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,580
I have already seen him this person.

740
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,660
He knows nothing.

741
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,740
He is just a puppet of Hu Cheng.

742
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,660
I can quickly find out the relationship

743
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,540
between he and Hu Cheng.

744
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,140
This is the most important evidence.

745
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,260
As for the specific content,

746
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,340
let's talk more when we meet.

747
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,300
I am already on my way back.

748
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,740
I will definitely arrive before dinner.

749
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,300
You wait for me at the law firm.

750
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,540
Ok.

751
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,700
