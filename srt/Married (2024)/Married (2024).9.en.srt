Director Qin, Director Qin.

4
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,720
Director Qin.

5
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,670
Director Qin.

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,720
Mr. Lei and Jiang are very professional.

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,750
This case could be resolved quickly.

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,920
Director Qin,

9
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,190
please pay more attention to this case.

10
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,040
Of course.

11
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,440
- Director Qin.
- Yue.

12
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,350
After this month,

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
you can become a permanent employee.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
Director Qin,

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,880
actually

16
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,350
when my kid was sick,

17
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
I felt quite guilty.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,670
I was afraid it would affect colleagues.

19
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,950
It also delayed some progress at work.

20
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,560
When I returned to the company today,

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,670
I found that everyone is full of energy.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,670
They are very motivated

23
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,950
in their work.

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,750
All at once,

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,510
I found

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,350
the original purpose of coming here.

27
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,350
So what exactly

28
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,470
was your original purpose?

29
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,440
My original purpose

30
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,880
was to get back to this kind of life.

31
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,790
It smells so good.

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,630
Oh, my sweetheart.

33
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,000
You finally come back.

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
I have been waiting for you.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Come, come, come.

36
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,180
Is it because Mom picked you up late?

37
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,260
No, Grandpa.

38
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,740
Mom worked hard.

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
She picked me up as soon as she got off work.

40
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,180
She was still late.

41
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,020
In the future,

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,020
don't let my grandson wait.

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,380
Dad, I'm going to help in the kitchen.

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,820
Look.

45
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,580
Today's meals are all made by Grandma.

46
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,780
It's all the food you love to eat.

47
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,940
- I take this out first.
- Smell this.

48
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,780
Want it or not?

49
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,580
I want it.

50
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,580
I want to help Mom.

51
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,380
No, no, no. Come here.

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,460
Let's just play here.

53
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,100
Just sit here and watch TV.

54
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,780
We are men.

55
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,940
A real man

56
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,180
can't go into the kitchen.

57
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,900
The kitchen is a place

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,180
where Grandma and Mom cook.

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,100
Remember?

60
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,500
Remember.

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,580
Alright, you can go inside and play.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,780
I'll call you when it's time to eat.

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,900
Dad,

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,540
I've been working these two days.

65
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,300
Hu Cheng's cooking skills have improved.

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,420
Another day,

67
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,780
let him cook two dishes for you.

68
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm not criticizing you, Yue.

69
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
From now on, don't think

70
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,140
about asking Hu Cheng go to the kitchen.

71
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,820
How can men cook?

72
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,580
He always thinks about cooking.

73
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,500
Do you think he can do his job well?

74
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,260
What if no one is by his side anymore?

75
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,460
He has to learn

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,620
to cook for himself.

77
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,660
What does this mean?

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,460
No one is by his side?

79
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,420
Are you cursing him?

80
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,020
Dad, you misunderstood me.

81
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,060
I didn't mean that.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,620
My son is so rich.

83
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,700
He can eat anywhere.

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,740
Mom, haven't vegetables been washed yet?

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,780
- You don't have to.
- Let me wash it.

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,700
You go ahead.

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,940
- It's ok.
- Go ahead.

88
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,780
It's all right.

89
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,180
- It's ok.
- Leave it to me.

90
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,780
Wipe your hands. Leave it to me.

91
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,340
The dinner is ready soon.

92
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,780
Fine.

93
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,340
Go ahead.

94
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,780
Dad.

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
You are home.

96
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,740
Hurry up. Is the dinner ready?

97
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,580
In a minute.

98
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,380
Why are you so slow?

99
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,780
Look, your son is back now.

100
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,300
You're back.

101
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,660
Honey.

102
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,220
Why didn't you help Mom?

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,780
Mom said she doesn't need my help.

104
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
See? She is just destined to work.

105
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,900
What happened to your neck?

106
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,620
Feeling a bit unwell.

107
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,940
I don't know what's wrong.

108
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,020
Maybe I didn't sleep well.

109
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,190
Don't touch me.

110
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,660
I feel like I can't even lift my arm.

111
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,180
I'll put on a medicated plaster later.

112
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,620
I'll lie down for a while, ok?

113
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,900
Ok.

114
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,100
Cheng.

115
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,700
I remember it was placed right here.

116
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,180
What's it?

117
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,620
Mom, I will go out for a moment.

118
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,460
The meal is ready.

119
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,060
Why are you going out?

120
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm going to buy some medicine.

121
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,780
Well.

122
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,660
Let's wait for him to come back,

123
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,660
ok?

124
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,380
Mom.

125
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,380
Mom.

126
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,420
Have you seen the plasters

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,700
that I put in here? A box.

128
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,100
Plasters?

129
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,540
Hello?

130
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,060
Hello? Is this the family of Hu Cheng?

131
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,380
I am.

132
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,940
I am his wife.

133
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,860
What's the matter?

134
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,260
Your husband has been in a car accident.

135
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,060
Honey,

136
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,700
after this,

137
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,180
I finally understand

138
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,220
what is the most important thing to me.

139
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,380
You and the kid are safe and healthy.

140
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,700
We can return home together.

141
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,260
For me,

142
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,420
it is more important than anything else.

143
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,780
Honey!

144
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,140
Honey!

145
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,100
It's me.

146
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,940
Look at me.

147
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,780
I'm right here.

148
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,500
I'm fine.

149
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,340
It's me.

150
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,760
It's me.

151
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,940
Honey,

152
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,300
sorry.

153
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,100
Don't worry.

154
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,100
Don't worry.

155
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,180
Ziyuan, be careful.

156
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,620
Don't get your Mom's hair stuck.

157
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,700
Does it still hurt, Mom?

158
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,420
It doesn't hurt.

159
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,300
Here.

160
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,940
Stick it here.

161
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,660
Dad, you do it.

162
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,620
I'm afraid of getting Mom's hair stuck.

163
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,740
Are you a little fool?

164
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,700
I'm not a little fool.

165
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,820
I am your little baby.

166
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,180
I have checked a few pharmacies nearby.

167
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,540
The brand you used to use

168
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,660
is out of stock.

169
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Well,

170
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,700
I had a car accident.

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,220
In the hospital,

172
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,900
I got a few boxes from the doctor.

173
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,900
Do you know

174
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,520
what I am thinking in my heart just now

175
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,500
when I thought

176
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,180
that person in bed

177
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,300
is you?

178
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,620
I was thinking

179
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,860
the two of us

180
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,020
is just over like this?

181
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,020
Is it really over just like this?

182
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,900
I still don't know

183
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,420
what's your true self like.

184
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,300
I didn't hear

185
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,620
a single word of truth to me.

186
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,060
I even

187
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,820
don't know what's real

188
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,860
and what is fake

189
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,260
during these five years

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,100
when we get together.

191
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,660
Honey.

192
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
I have been reflecting on myself.

193
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,900
About your work,

194
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,900
posting Congcong's pictures

195
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,340
online

196
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,460
and

197
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,380
the matters between Manager Tian and I.

198
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,020
I was totally wrong.

199
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,740
I regret it very much.

200
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,500
Actually, I

201
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,860
am not as powerful as I look.

202
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,100
I'm not an optimistic person either.

203
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,580
I had

204
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,100
an unhappy college life.

205
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,260
I also had a failed marriage.

206
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,900
Actually, I have been

207
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,540
living in a very oppressive situation.

208
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,700
Until I met you.

209
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,420
Actually, I want to cherish you well,

210
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,860
cherish this home.

211
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,780
But...

212
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,140
Sometimes,

213
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,660
I would feel particularly weak.

214
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,780
Sometimes, I could overcome it.

215
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,060
Sometimes,

216
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,100
I completely failed.

217
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,300
I know

218
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,300
I shouldn't make excuses for myself.

219
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,140
Wrong is wrong.

220
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,940
I also know

221
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,500
you won't trust me like before.

222
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,060
But

223
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,420
I will change myself.

224
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,260
I also hope

225
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,420
you can

226
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
accept me again.

227
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,580
Honey,

228
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,700
you ask me what is true and what is fake.

229
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,220
I have never lied to you about one thing.

230
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,620
I really, really love you.

231
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,020
Zibo

232
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,300
is really good.

233
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
He's smart,

234
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,700
willing to endure hardship

235
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,660
and has ideas.

236
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,220
These past few days,

237
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
he stayed up late and collected data,

238
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,380
and helped to solve the issues.

239
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,540
Working hard is right.

240
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,820
Obviously,

241
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,660
he just tried hard to get your applause.

242
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,660
He just arrives at the company now,

243
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,460
so he has a sense of freshness.

244
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,140
The key is whether he can keep it up.

245
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,580
Whether he can make it

246
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,420
still depends on him.

247
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,700
Alright then.

248
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,700
You have your own educational methods.

249
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,940
I won't interfere with that.

250
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,980
Just do what you think is best.

251
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,460
Hello? Ms. Li,

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,300
where is the proposal

253
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,940
of that artificial intelligence?

254
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,500
I didn't see it.

255
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm right here.

256
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,370
Oh, it's down there.

257
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,620
Ok, thank you, thank you.

258
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,660
Goodbye.

259
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,100
I just finished one.

260
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,380
Don't peel it anymore.

261
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,580
One more please.

262
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,060
Mom.

263
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,140
What brings you here?

264
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,980
Grandma.

265
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,220
I miss you.

266
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,500
I called you, but...

267
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,700
I miss you, too.

268
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,580
Let me take a look.

269
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,820
Why not wash your hands?

270
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,860
- Hurry up.
- Put down the backpack.

271
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,900
- Go wash your hands.
- Go now.

272
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,220
Mom got a review today.

273
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,060
The doctor said her legs have recovered well.

274
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,220
She could be fully recovered weeks later.

275
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,340
I thought

276
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,340
about bringing her to live with us.

277
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,900
How troublesome.

278
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,180
Sorry to disturb you.

279
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,540
Mom, Yue and I have been wanting

280
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,300
to bring you back.

281
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,940
What about the nursing home?

282
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I cancelled it.

283
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,610
You didn't wash hands.

284
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,420
You manage me as soon as you arrive.

285
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Greetings.

286
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,460
Welcome.

287
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,340
I'm really sorry.

288
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,420
I'm here to trouble you again.

289
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,300
- Have some tea.
-Thank you.

290
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,140
My pleasure.

291
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,660
I'll make the bed for you in a moment.

292
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,260
I can do it myself.

293
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,500
- It's ok.
- Come in.

294
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,420
Sit down.

295
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,900
Why do you pour tea for her?

296
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,300
Are you her housekeeper?

297
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,080
Come on.

298
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,820
I didn't know what Cheng was thinking.

299
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,220
I asked him to let Zibo stay at home.

300
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,420
He said, for the sake of fairness,

301
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,860
Zibo should live in the staff dormitory.

302
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,100
As a result,

303
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,820
Yue brought her Mom home.

304
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,900
What the hell!

305
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,140
And

306
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,860
Zibo's position.

307
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,660
He assigned him

308
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,300
a job of serving tea and water.

309
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,380
When I meet Zibo's Dad later,

310
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,780
how should I explain this?

311
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,180
Cheng said an assistant helps the manager.

312
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,380
He's very useful.

313
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,460
Assistant! Assistant!

314
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,140
It means helping others serve tea.

315
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,500
Besides, Zibo doesn't work by his side.

316
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,980
What does he want to do?

317
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,700
Could it be that Cheng and Yue

318
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,580
dislike us

319
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,980
and want to drive us away?

320
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Cheng won't.

321
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,700
Yes.

322
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,940
I think so too.

323
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,060
Could it be Yue?

324
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,260
No way.

325
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,860
Mom, we have a dishwasher at home now.

326
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,980
No need to wash with hands.

327
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,620
It's almost done.

328
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,340
I don't mean to rush you.

329
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,700
I mean this dishwasher is convenient.

330
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
- I...
- I am idle, anyway.

331
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,380
It can conserve water and electricity.

332
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,060
You go ahead.

333
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,660
Mom,

334
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,260
do your legs still hurt recently?

335
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,020
I feel much better.

336
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,180
Really?

337
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,180
The doctor said yesterday

338
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,140
you need to get out and exercise more.

339
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,460
These are the fitness facilities.

340
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,180
After your legs get better,

341
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,780
let Ziyuan accompany you to exercise.

342
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,820
Dad,

343
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,380
play this with me.

344
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,380
- Hurry up and play with him.
- Ok.

345
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,420
Do you want to swing?

346
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,820
Come on, let me push you.

347
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,420
A boy should play with his dad.

348
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,980
- Look.
- You are the pirate captain.

349
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,620
Is it high?

350
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,930
Yeah, high.

351
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,140
Ziyuan is really clingy to his Dad.

352
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
A little higher.

353
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,300
Ok.

354
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,020
I'm good in that nursing home.

355
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,740
Why bring me home?

356
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,180
I can't help you now.

357
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,180
Staying here

358
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,740
is the biggest help you can give me.

359
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,780
I just hope

360
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,420
you all live well.

361
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,140
(The familiar scene,)

362
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,020
(the familiar people.)

363
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,340
(The beautiful scenes in memory)

364
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,940
(seem to perfectly overlap)

365
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,980
(with the present.)

366
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,580
(But can we really)

367
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,980
(go back to the past?)

368
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,260
We've almost finished shopping. Let's go back.

369
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,940
This clothing store is pretty good.

370
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,260
Let's go in and take a look.

371
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,020
No need. Let's go.

372
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,180
I know

373
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,740
you don't like wearing cheongsams.

374
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,740
Let's go in

375
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,340
and pick one that you like.

376
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,470
Son, I'm giving you an important task.

377
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,630
How about we pick

378
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,740
a piece of clothing she likes?

379
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,580
Ok.

380
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,780
Let's take a look.

381
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,340
Mommy! Mommy!

382
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,700
I want to see you in a dress.

383
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,300
My son has great taste.

384
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,780
I also like this one.

385
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,590
- Excuse me.
- Hello, Sir.

386
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,100
Help me find a small size.

387
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,080
My wife will give it a try.

388
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,380
Sure. This way please.

389
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,450
Ma'am, this way please.

390
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,330
- Mom.
- Come.

391
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,730
Come in.

392
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,500
Where is the fitting room?

393
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,870
This way.

394
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,740
Look. They're wearing

395
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,900
strange clothes.

396
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,200
How much is this purse?

397
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,980
How much is this purse?

398
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,740
What are you looking at?

399
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,540
It's nothing.

400
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,680
I recognized the wrong person.

401
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,780
I thought it is a former colleague.

402
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,940
Honey, you look gorgeous in this dress.

403
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,180
Take a look.

404
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,390
Doesn't Mom look like a fairy?

405
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,420
Mom is a fairy.

406
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,100
Mom is the most beautiful.

407
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,580
Really?

408
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,500
Excuse me.

409
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,580
I want this outfit.

410
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,780
- Ok.
- Please wrap it up for me.

411
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,340
Honey,

412
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,860
no matter what you like,

413
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,380
I bought it all for you.

414
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,020
This is what he likes.

415
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,660
You can choose a few more.

416
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,340
Wait a moment.

417
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,380
We still want to choose more.

418
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,100
- Ok.
- Choose what you like.

419
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,620
Let's go.

420
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,060
I will be officially employed soon.

421
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,620
I want to continue working.

422
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,460
Isn't Qin Can always picking on you?

423
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,500
You should be clear about that.

424
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,140
The person who picks on

425
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,780
has never been me.

426
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,060
Sure.

427
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,180
As long as he doesn't target you,

428
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,260
you can work as you wish.

429
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,940
I support you.

430
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,060
I hope this time

431
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,780
it comes from the heart.

432
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,260
Honey,

433
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,860
I will show you.

434
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,100
From now on,

435
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,340
you can not

436
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
lie to me

437
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,300
nor control me.

438
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,100
Actually,

439
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,870
I just want to protect you.

440
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,970
I can protect myself.

441
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,330
Ok.

442
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,500
From now on, I won't do anything

443
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,020
you don't want me to do.

444
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,180
Come and sleep here.

445
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,940
Honey,

446
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,940
I still need some time.

447
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,780
I'll wait for you.

448
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,700
No matter how long,

449
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I will always wait.

450
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,860
Go to sleep.

451
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,020
How is it?

452
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,300
I take you to kindergarten.

453
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,580
Is that good?

454
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,060
Good.

455
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,460
Do you prefer to be taken

456
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,900
by Mom or by Grandpa?

457
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,740
Mom.

458
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,820
Mom will be very busy with work.

459
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,700
From now on, I will send you.

460
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,260
- Is it ok?
- Ok.

461
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,420
Mom.

462
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,820
Where is Ziyuan, Mom?

463
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,140
Grandpa took him to kindergarten.

464
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,020
The food just got heated up.

465
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,700
Eat quickly.

466
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,420
You wear this to work, right?

467
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,580
Right.

468
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,900
It is ironed.

469
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,540
Mom, I can handle it myself.

470
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,380
Have your breakfast.

471
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Eat quickly.

472
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,940
You eat together.

473
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,740
We all have already eaten,

474
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,820
except you.

475
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,180
Why didn't you go to work?

476
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,740
Today the company has nothing going on.

477
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,380
I plan to go later.

478
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,540
So I take Mom out for a walk.

479
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,780
Alright, don't chat anymore.

480
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,340
It will be too late if you talk more.

481
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,980
You're different from Cheng.

482
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,700
You work for someone else.

483
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,380
Then I'll leave first.

484
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,780
Take your time.

485
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,660
Ok.

486
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,060
Mom, let's go over there.

487
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,660
Ok.

488
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,580
The former business manager

489
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,460
was accused of accepting bribes.

490
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,660
This case

491
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,420
has now entered the court trial stage.

492
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,080
The group takes this very seriously.

493
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,020
This is not the first time

494
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,980
Zhongzhi has faced such accusations.

495
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,220
The group has decided

496
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,020
to conduct an internal investigation.

497
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,380
All departments need to cooperate.

498
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,740
Director Qin,

499
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,500
your department will be in charge.

500
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,620
You report it directly to me.

501
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,540
All right.

502
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,500
This is a thankless job.

503
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,380
Pulling out the radish brings out the mud.

504
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,740
By then,

505
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,220
there will be a major change in personnel.

506
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,180
Who knows who will get involved?

507
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Maybe not.

508
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,220
Mr. Qin was assigned with such a heavy task.

509
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,980
It clearly shows that he is valued.

510
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
He may be promoted.

511
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,260
Let me tell you,

512
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,400
you are right this time.

513
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,130
The group arranged our dept

514
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,220
to be responsible for it.

515
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,980
In the future, our department

516
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,100
will be tied up with this matter

517
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,580
for a long time in the future.

518
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,060
Let's not even think

519
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,740
about other lucrative jobs.

520
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,140
For our department,

521
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,940
there won't be any good days.

522
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,920
Please come in.

523
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,900
Director Qin

524
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,460
I apply to join the investigation.

525
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,300
I know

526
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,180
it's not within my responsibilities.

527
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,420
But I took a look

528
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,100
at the investigation schedule.

529
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,460
With our average working efficiency,

530
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,620
it cannot be completed.

531
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,220
And Qian currently has other cases.

532
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,380
He's too busy to handle everything.

533
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,460
The investigation work is nothing more

534
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,660
than document review.

535
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,740
As long as I am serious and patient,

536
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,500
I am fully capable of handling it.

537
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,500
You first talk to Zhong and the others

538
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,260
to check the timeline against the archives,

539
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,340
verify the archives of several depts,

540
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,820
and then you can start the work

541
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,820
according

542
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,340
to the previously established plan.

543
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,700
Yue,

544
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,220
even if you don't apply,

545
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,180
I still plan to have you join it.

546
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,020
You've been back for a while now.

547
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,140
It's time.

548
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,020
With your abilities,

549
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,580
this is not a big deal.

550
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,020
Thank you.

551
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,500
Mr. Hu.

552
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,380
Mr. Hu.

553
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,380
The person you asked me to look into...

554
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,100
I mean the one

555
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,820
who you suspected was stalking you.

556
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,660
I remember.

557
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,620
How is it?

558
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,660
We identified this person.

559
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,730
He wasn't on the guest list.

560
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,560
But don't worry, Mr. Hu.

561
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:17,140
I found a very reliable channel.

562
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,220
I estimate that there will be news soon.

563
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,380
As soon as you find out, let me know.

564
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,900
Qian.

565
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,380
This isn't correct, is it?

566
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,940
However, it is written as 75%.

567
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,780
Ning Yue.

568
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,260
We have a record of this contract.

569
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,380
Mainly check this set of data.

570
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,420
Ok.

571
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,780
I found it.

572
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,580
(Project Contract)

573
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,100
These are the ones I just checked.

574
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,940
Ok.

575
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
Well, push down a bit.

576
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,300
Honey.

577
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,340
What brings you here?

578
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,740
Is your foot ok?

579
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,140
It's fine.

580
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,180
I'm here to pick you up.

581
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,820
I saw you leaving

582
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,860
in those shoes this morning.

583
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,220
I just knew there would be a problem.

584
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,220
You got blisters last time.

585
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,500
I don't even remember that.

586
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,780
You remember so clearly, huh?

587
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,420
I definitely didn't monitor you.

588
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,620
It's just that my memory is too good.

589
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,980
I know.

590
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,700
Show me your foot.

591
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,140
It's done.

592
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,980
Do you want me to carry you?

593
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
No need.

594
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,940
Come on.

595
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,130
So cheesy!

596
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,580
Honey,

597
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,980
you ask me what is true and what is fake.

598
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,220
I have never lied to you about one thing.

599
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,660
I really, really love you.

600
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,740
(Watching him put a band-aid on for me,)

601
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,980
(I'm thinking)

602
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,060
(our wounds)

603
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,700
(can slowly heal.)

604
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,020
Mom, I will bring it out.

605
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,060
It's almost dinner time.

606
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,180
Come.

607
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,380
Mom, let me.

608
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,300
Let me.

609
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,660
Ziyuan, time for dinner.

610
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,900
It's time to eat.

611
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,220
Honey, time for dinner.

612
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,420
Is this ok?

613
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,580
So sorry that I can't help.

614
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,580
Ziyuan, have more today, ok?

615
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,740
- Eat a little more.
- Dad, time to eat.

616
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,300
Grandpa, time for dinner.

617
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,140
Ok.

618
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,430
Where are the chopsticks?

619
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,860
You want me to eat with my fingers?

620
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,580
Ziyuan.

621
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,900
Look at how funny your grandma is.

622
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,990
She didn't give me chopsticks.

623
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,520
Do I have to eat with my fingers?

624
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,260
Here.

625
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,460
Here.

626
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,420
Eat meat.

627
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,500
Mom, sit down and eat.

628
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,420
Where is the wine?

629
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,300
Silly me!

630
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,300
I'm so busy and confused.

631
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,780
Try to eat more meat.

632
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,620
All right.

633
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,100
Mom, you eat.

634
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,940
Let's

635
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,620
make a toast, ok?

636
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,980
For the happiness of the family.

637
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,020
Dad, I have to handle something.

638
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,220
You go ahead.

639
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,140
Alright, alright, alright.

640
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,820
Here. Let's make a toast.

641
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,100
For the happiness of the family.

642
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,340
Come on.

643
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,940
Hello? Wei,

644
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,820
is it really Mr. Guo?

645
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,820
I have already found out clearly.

646
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,020
It's Mr. Guo.

647
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,340
When did this happen?

648
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,140
He was taken away this afternoon.

649
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,980
He's suspected of money laundering.

650
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,740
As soon as Mr. Guo was arrested,

651
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,460
the money he prepared to invest

652
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,820
must be frozen.

653
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,660
This is quite a big hole.

654
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,660
And Mr. Chen from Zhongzhi.

655
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,700
You need to think about how to explain.

656
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,500
Got it.

657
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,300
Ziyuan.

658
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,740
How are your academic results?

659
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,900
It's ok.

660
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,740
- Remember.
- Eat meat.

661
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,900
You must study hard.

662
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,660
When you grow up,

663
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,580
you can be better than your Dad

664
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,500
and me, ok?

665
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,700
Grandpa,

666
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,700
how was your study?

667
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,340
Good question.

668
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,420
Let mt tell you.

669
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,100
Back in the day,

670
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,980
I was just a few points less

671
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,380
that the top student.

672
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,340
Your Dad is so outstanding now.

673
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,660
That's not just because of good genes.

674
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,620
He was well taught by me.

675
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,460
Do you think if I am amazing?

676
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,100
Don't talk nonsense.

677
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,740
Hurry up and eat.

678
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,420
- You know nothing.
- Eat quickly.

679
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,780
What I'm saying is all true.

680
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,500
Mom.

681
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,140
Today my teacher told us

682
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,500
the story of Feng Fu and the tiger.

683
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,460
What kind of story is that?

684
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,690
It tells

685
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
there is a person named Feng Fu

686
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,860
who is especially strong

687
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,420
and can kill tigers.

688
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,540
Really impressive!

689
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,380
Mom.

690
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,300
Is Feng Fu a man or a woman?

691
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,180
The teacher said she doesn't know.

692
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,020
The teacher doesn't even know.

693
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,460
I definitely doesn't know either.

694
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,940
Silly boy!

695
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,420
The one who can kill a tiger

696
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,740
must be a man.

697
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,860
Right?

698
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,220
Do you think he is a man or a woman?

699
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,460
Qin Jiaojiao is particularly strong.

700
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,140
I think,

701
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,700
after she grows up,

702
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,300
she can kill tigers.

703
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,140
Qin Jiaojiao is so impressive!

704
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,180
Then you should eat more.

705
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,260
You can also kill tigers, ok?

706
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,020
Ziyuan, remember this.

707
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,180
For kids at your age,

708
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,860
girls develop faster than boys.

709
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,580
She is stronger than you.

710
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,460
That's for sure.

711
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,660
Eat quickly.

712
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,540
It's all cold now.

713
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,740
Eat quickly.

714
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,780
Look at you.

715
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,540
There are so many dishes on the table.

716
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,180
Do I only deserve to eat potatoes?

717
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,900
Meat, meat, meat.

718
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,940
Alright, alright, alright.

719
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,700
I just eat this.

720
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,020
- Alright, you eat.
- Mom.

721
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
I have this.

722
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,100
How senseless you are!

723
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,940
Grandpa.

724
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,060
What does it mean?

725
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,380
It means

726
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,060
you need to read others' expressions.

727
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,980
You don't need to ask this right now.

728
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,140
Just focus on your studies, understand?

729
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,780
When you grow up,

730
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,060
just like your Dad,

731
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,300
you need to reach a certain height.

732
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,780
Be a big shot.

733
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Like me,

734
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,020
I also reach a height.

735
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,260
I am also somebody.

736
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,700
At that time,

737
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,460
others have to look at your expressions.

738
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,580
Remember it?

739
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,780
You just need to study hard.

740
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,980
Eat.

741
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,940
Mom, can you use the dishwasher...

742
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,980
It's fine.

743
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,100
It's ok, forget it.

744
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,340
Tea.

745
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,500
Mom, let me do it.

746
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,220
I'll go. It's fine.

747
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,180
Hurry up.

748
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,220
Coming, Dad.

749
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,060
What are you doing?

750
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,940
Washing dishes.

751
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,660
His grandparents

752
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,340
have been living like this these years?

753
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,620
What a life!

754
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,060
It's so disrespectful.

755
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,580
Look at his Grandma.

756
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,180
She started getting busy

757
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,740
as soon as she woke up in the morning.

758
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,340
Except for using the restroom,

759
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,340
she has been busy all the time.

760
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,340
Look at Grandpa.

761
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,920
Except for using the restroom,

762
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,940
he has been sitting on the sofa

763
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,580
for the rest time.

764
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,620
Is he a disabled person?

765
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,340
Eating and drinking all rely on others.

766
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,700
He's even inferior to me in a wheelchair.

767
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,860
Mom, actually I also feel

768
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,700
Ziyuan's Grandma

769
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,300
lives a bad life.

770
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,300
There must be something hateful.

771
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,540
What's wrong with her?

772
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,340
Why can't she resist?

773
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,820
Why can't she argue with him?

774
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,740
You can't say it this way.

775
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,180
What if it were you?

776
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,700
If you are oppressed like this for years

777
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,540
and nitpicked and criticized every day,

778
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,740
can you take it?

779
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,380
Like boiling a frog in warm water.

780
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,300
If one person is always criticized,

781
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,880
no matter how tough the temper,

782
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,220
it is all gone.

783
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,060
You are wrong.

784
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,260
Thank goodness.

785
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,660
He's not like that person.

786
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,300
Got it.

787
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,300
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

788
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,020
I have a question for you.

789
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,730
Are you familiar with your wife?

790
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,540
Don't block me.

791
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,420
Don't block me.

792
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,340
Don't block me. Here.

793
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
Dad,

794
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,140
don't just lie down after eating.

795
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,380
It's not good for your stomach.
