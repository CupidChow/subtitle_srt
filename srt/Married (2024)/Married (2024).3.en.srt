=Episode 3=

3
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,830
The algae are very powerful.

4
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,040
Those small fish

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
and small shrimp

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,990
are all afraid of it.

7
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,110
But we are not afraid of it,

8
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,470
because

9
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,990
we won't be small fish or small shrimp.

10
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,350
We want to be lions,

11
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,400
and tigers.

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,950
I used to work here.

14
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm here to find something.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Okay.

16
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,230
What exactly are you looking for?

17
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,840
I have some important documents.

18
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,070
They're in this computer.

19
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,920
I want to retrieve them.

20
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,880
Your colleagues

21
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
have formatted the computers.

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,000
Everything is gone.

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,950
It's been formatted?

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,050
Thank you for your hard work.

25
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,310
Take care.

26
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
Hello.

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,000
Hello, how can I help you?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,470
Could you have this hard drive repaired?

29
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,910
Let me take a look.

30
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,230
I can try to help you with that.

31
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,280
However, I may not

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,400
restore 100%

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
of the data.

34
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,560
How about this?

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,120
Please leave a phone number.

36
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,600
I'll notify you once it's restored.

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,560
Alright.

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,350
Please do it as soon as possible.

39
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,750
- Okay.
- Thank you.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,950
Alright, bye.

41
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,190
Mom,

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,630
I just asked the nurse.

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,600
She said your condition

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,470
is basically stable now.

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,000
If you are willing,

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
you can be discharged and live with us.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,000
I think I'm quite fine here alone,

48
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,320
free and easy,

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,280
and there's someone taking care of me.

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
You don't need to worry about me.

51
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,630
You, Cheng, and Zi Yuan

52
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,280
should live well.

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,510
That would make me happy.

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,070
When I'm in a good mood,

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,630
recovery will be faster.

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
It's Cheng.

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,310
Hello, Cheng.

58
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Mom,

59
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,640
when I'm not busy,

60
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
I'll take Zi Yuan to visit you.

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

62
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,270
Yue,

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,960
take good care of Mom.

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
I have to attend a meeting here.

65
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,280
Alright, go ahead with your work.

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,280
By the way, tonight

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll have dinner here with Mom.

68
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Alright.

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,350
Okay, bye-bye.

70
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,270
By the way, Mom,

71
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,790
are you taking a medical checkup later?

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,910
I'll go with you.

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
Sure.

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,520
There's driving restriction next week.

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,670
On Thursday afternoon,

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,960
I have a regular meeting.

77
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,480
I won't be able to drive you.

78
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,510
No problem.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,550
The movie you want to see

80
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,870
is releasing tomorrow.

81
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,230
Let's go watch it together.

82
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,190
Really?

83
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,070
Good.

84
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,330
Today,

85
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,550
can I walk you downstairs?

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,220
I want to spend more time with you.

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,430
Isn't she not at home today?

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Honey.

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,950
Honey.

90
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,280
Aren't you having dinner with your Mom?

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,520
They arranged a medical checkup.

92
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,960
I had to leave.

93
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,160
Let me introduce.

94
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,230
This is

95
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,640
Manager Tian,

96
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,160
project manager from Ruixin Bank.

97
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,520
They're following up on our project.

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,520
Today, I went to the company,

99
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,910
and she gave me a ride back.

100
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,840
This is my wife,

101
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
Ning Yue.

102
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,550
Hello, Mrs. Hu.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,760
I am Tian Qiuzi.

104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,190
Hello.

105
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,220
Miss Tian's hairstyle looks really nice.

106
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
Thank you.

107
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,400
Honey, don't you think so?

108
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,160
We…

109
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,790
Men can't tell the difference.

110
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Honey.

111
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
The hairstylist

112
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
that Niuniu's Mom introduced

113
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,670
no longer works there.

114
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,240
Miss Tian,

115
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,430
let's friend each other on WeChat.

116
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,080
You scan mine, okay?

117
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,270
Alright.

118
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,870
Alright, done.

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,990
Remember to recommend it to me.

120
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,950
Okay.

121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,110
Throwing out the trash, huh?

122
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,110
Let me help you.

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Goodbye, Manager Tian.

124
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,990
The big dinosaur is going to eat you!

125
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,870
What if you haven't opened your mouth?

126
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,400
Just hungry.

127
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,280
Is it so easy to be Party A?

128
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,400
It's all about

129
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,760
female colleagues giving you a ride.

130
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,000
Do you think everyone gets a ride?

131
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,360
Very snobbish.

132
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,760
How's Mom doing lately?

133
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,640
Not well.

134
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,910
She looks very unpleasant.

135
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,480
She's tired of seeing me every day.

136
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,150
Ziyuan,

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,670
will you visit grandma next week?

138
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
Okay.

139
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Ziyuan,

140
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,240
look at your Dad.

141
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
Very obedient.

142
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,000
We all listen to Mom.

143
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,360
So well-behaved.

144
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
Hello.

145
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Hello.

146
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,100
I would like to ask if there was

147
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
a medical checkup for the elderly

148
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,240
this afternoon.

149
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,630
That's right, sir.

150
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,640
We had a medical checkup this afternoon.

151
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
Then,

152
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
was it a temporary arrangement?

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,070
They are scheduled for specific times.

154
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,430
But, due to the doctor's reason,

155
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,890
the time was changed for this week.

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,550
Alright, thank you.

157
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,540
(Tian Qiuzi)

158
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,380
(Do not contact for now.)

159
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,270
Honey,

160
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,260
I was just about to call you for dinner.

161
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,320
What's wrong?

162
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,520
Did something happen?

163
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,270
Why do you look so upset?

164
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,000
Nothing serious.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,120
Just some trouble

166
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,120
with work.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,240
Let's eat.

168
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,060
(Forever)

169
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,120
Honey,

170
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,400
I want to watch a movie.

171
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,590
Let's go to the cinema.

172
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,310
Can't we watch it at home?

173
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,430
It's the same.

174
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,550
No, it's not the same.

175
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,160
The atmosphere is different.

176
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,710
Hu Ziyuan loves

177
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,880
going to the cinema the most.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,310
He says it's very lively.

179
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
Look,

180
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,240
this one

181
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,280
seems to have a very good reputation.

182
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,430
That Manager Tian who drove you back

183
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,430
watched the movie.

184
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,040
I'd like to as well.

185
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,760
What's interesting about romance movies?

186
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's schedule for this time tomorrow.

187
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,390
Is that okay?

188
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,400
If you want to watch it, just do it.

189
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,400
Okay, honey.

190
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,130
I'll book the tickets now.

191
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
When does the regular meeting start?

192
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,830
Be sure to pay attention to details.

193
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,840
- Okay, okay.
- Make sure there are no mistakes.

194
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,430
Sorry,

195
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,690
I couldn't accompany you to the movie.

196
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,880
It's okay,

197
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,370
as long as you are here.

198
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,670
I've been searching it for a long time.

199
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,160
It's for you.

200
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,980
(When the melody plays, I'm by your side HC.)
As long as the melody plays,

201
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm by your side.

202
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,750
Thank you.

203
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,660
(When the melody plays,
I'm by your side HC)

204
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
Later?

205
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,590
The white dog and black dog

206
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,550
stuck together every day,

207
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,040
having much fun.

208
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,550
The black dog said,

209
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,520
you are my best friend.

210
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
The white dog said,

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,910
that's great.

212
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
Then the two of us

213
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
should shake hands.

214
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,310
Just at that Moment,

215
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,550
a big tasty bone

216
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,480
suddenly fell in front of them.

217
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,360
Both of them

218
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,310
rushed forward

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,670
to fight over this bone.

220
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
They fought fiercely.

221
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,150
Dog hair

222
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,880
was flying everywhere.

223
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,880
Dog hair was flying around?

224
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,520
They were really fighting fiercely.

225
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,240
After that,

226
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,430
they were no longer friends.

227
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,550
Go to sleep quickly.

228
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,480
Alright.

229
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,510
Senior brother,

230
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,950
it'll be my fifth wedding anniversary

231
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,590
in a couple of days.

232
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,400
I plan to organize it well.

233
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,430
In the past few days,

234
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,790
she's been hinting at me,

235
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,910
afraid that I might forget it.

236
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,880
How could I possibly forget?

237
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,680
After all, she is a young woman.

238
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,640
Exactly.

239
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,090
Cheng,

240
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,910
Yue has had a tough time,

241
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,520
through such a major setback.

242
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,280
You must treat her well.

243
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,040
Of course, I do.

244
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,790
I am so good to her.

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,710
Whatever she wants, I give it to her.

246
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,790
Yes, you are indeed very good to her.

247
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,000
What I meant is,

248
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,590
considering her temperament,

249
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,940
if she finds out your affairs,

250
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,240
she won't just turn a blind eye.

251
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,000
I know this.

252
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,950
She mentioned it before we got married.

253
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,640
If I were to cheat,

254
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,710
she would immediately divorce and leave.

255
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,670
Exactly.

256
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,550
So…

257
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,120
So I'll not let her divorce me.

258
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,670
Absolutely not.

259
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,590
What you're saying?

260
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,740
What ddi you mean by "absolutely not"?

261
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,040
Just because you say not?

262
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,400
If you really push her to that point,

263
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
what can you do about it?

264
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,040
I have my own ways.

265
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
So…

266
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,790
You're just like that.

267
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,950
Annoying.

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,470
You're forcing me to speak plainly.

269
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,430
As for

270
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,760
you and Manager Tian,

271
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,390
it's being rumored in the company.

272
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,390
I know,

273
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,960
you've succeeded, getting carried away,

274
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,390
and you want more now.

275
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,520
Desire keeps you ambitious.

276
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,390
That's great.

277
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,480
I don't oppose it.

278
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,550
But don't ever forget

279
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,760
some things cannot be hidden forever.

280
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,000
Heard the recent news?

281
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,870
Many celebrities

282
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,110
have fallen because of this.

283
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,480
It's not worth the loss.

284
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
It's not worthwhile.

285
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,320
It's not worth it.

286
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,520
For the sake of family,

287
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,800
for the sake of the company,

288
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,710
let me put it another way,

289
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,750
for the sake of the company,

290
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,560
for the sake of family,

291
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,590
you…

292
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,520
Senior brother, rest assured.

293
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,240
Yue and I are doing very well.

294
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,240
As for Manager Tian and me,

295
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,350
it's just a work relationship.

296
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,110
It's that simple.

297
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,700
(Accompany you with original intention
on the longest journey)

298
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,950
What's wrong with you today?

299
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,200
Mysterious and secretive.

300
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,960
What's going on?

301
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,110
Mr. Hu,

302
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,310
Ms. Ning,

303
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,000
happy wedding anniversary.

304
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,630
Honey,

305
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
happy fifth anniversary.

306
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,360
Thank you, honey.

307
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,310
Give a kiss. Give a kiss.

308
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,000
Give a kiss.

309
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,630
Great.

310
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,960
Happy wedding anniversary!

311
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,780
(When the melody plays
I'm by your side HC)

312
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,720
Your company's cooperation project

313
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,520
still needs to our company.

314
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,550
Who…

315
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,400
Who'd like to play a song?

316
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,350
Waiter, get someone who can play.

317
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,190
- Qiuzi.
- Hurry.

318
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
I heard

319
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,790
you're very good at piano.

320
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,040
You must be mistaken, I'm not.

321
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

322
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,000
I heard it.

323
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,920
I heard it.

324
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,760
Manager Tian,

325
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,390
you are truly multi-talented.

326
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,390
Come on, Manager Tian.

327
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,960
Why don't you show us?

328
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,070
- Come on.
- Show us.

329
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,360
Mr. Guo, I really don't know how.

330
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,430
- Don't be shy.
- I really can't.

331
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,440
Come on, play one.

332
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,350
Don't be modest.

333
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,320
Sit properly.

334
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,670
Applause!

335
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,240
You don't understand music anyway.

336
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,070
Is it just to bully the young girl?

337
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,960
Mr. Hu,

338
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,070
as you are here,

339
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,560
showing compassion for the ladies.

340
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,760
No wonder you're so popular with ladies.

341
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,790
Exactly.

342
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,600
This kind of behavior from you guys,

343
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,830
I'll record it,

344
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,920
and post it online,

345
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
so you can receive further education.

346
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Hero saves the beauty.

347
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,350
Alright, just do it.

348
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,190
Come on.

349
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,670
Don't make it difficult for her.

350
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,630
Leave here.

351
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,080
Thank you.

352
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,830
How about this?

353
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,630
I will play a piece for everyone,

354
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,070
to liven things up.

355
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,280
This piece of music

356
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,760
sounds so familiar?

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,840
Is it

358
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,350
from some classical masterpiece?

359
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,870
Yes, a world-famous piece,

360
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,000
Tom and Jerry.

361
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Dear colleagues,

362
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,150
thank you all for coming today

363
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,950
to celebrate with Ning Yue and me

364
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,870
for our fifth wedding anniversary.

365
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,920
So,

366
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,110
I have a few words to say to my wife.

367
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,630
Great!

368
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,390
Honey,

369
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,310
every day when I wake up,

370
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,920
I can see

371
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,480
your and Ziyuan's sleeping faces,

372
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,630
and I feel

373
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,720
that is my everything.

374
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,390
Are you the first one to get up?

375
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,760
You don't even make breakfast.

376
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,650
I am making a heartfelt confession.

377
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,190
Please don't interrupt my emotions.

378
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,590
Alright, continue.

379
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,150
I am grateful to my wife

380
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,240
for appearing in my life.

381
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
To me,

382
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,350
you are irreplaceable by anyone.

383
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,720
We have lived together for five years.

384
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,590
There will be another five years.

385
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,720
And another five years after that.

386
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I will always,

387
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,720
always be by your side.

388
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,900
- Great!
- Great!

389
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,390
I will forever

390
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,870
protect and take good care of

391
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,240
my wife

392
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,520
and Ziyuan

393
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,920
- Great!
- Great!

394
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,790
May you be happy together forever.

395
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,390
Thank you.

396
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
Thank you, everyone.

397
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,820
(The boss's five-year marriage made me
believe in love once again.)

398
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,280
You are irreplaceable by anyone.

399
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,520
We have lived together for five years.

400
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,240
There will be another five years.

401
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,590
And another five years after that.

402
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,350
I will always,

403
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,440
always be by your side.

404
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,990
(Tian Qiuzi: You said you're always there,
and I thought…)

405
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,010
(You said you're always there,
and I thought we're connected in spirit.)

406
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,880
(I was wrong, your happiness doesn't
belong to me at all, let's just end it.)

407
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,990
Honey,

408
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,640
shall we just call it a day today.

409
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,600
Leave early.

410
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,710
Sure.

411
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,560
Then

412
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,920
I'll drive you home.

413
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,990
And then, there's something

414
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,830
to handle in the company.

415
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,550
Alright, no need to drive me home.

416
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,870
I'll just take a taxi myself.

417
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Okay.

418
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,520
Everyone,

419
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,830
I especially thank you all

420
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,440
for taking the time today

421
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,920
to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

422
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,680
We will be leaving shortly,

423
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,960
please continue to enjoy your time.

424
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,360
Thank you all, a toast to you.

425
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,520
Alright, thank you, Mr. Hu.

426
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,070
Let me know when you get home.

427
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,480
Okay, don't worry.

428
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,910
Go back to work.

429
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,670
I'm leaving.

430
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,760
Bye.

431
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,600
Bye.

432
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,800
Sir,

433
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,800
please drive me to another place.

434
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
Okay.

435
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,040
Honey,

436
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,870
is breakfast ready?

437
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,550
What time is it?

438
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,680
I have something to ask you.

439
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,080
It's so late.

440
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,790
Why didn't you wake me up?

441
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,840
There is an important meeting today.

442
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,110
It's so late.

443
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,860
(For the following cases, if mediation
fails, divorce should be granted.)

444
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,600
(Bigamy, domestic violence, gambling,
drug abuse, separation for two years)

445
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,790
(For the following cases, if mediation fails,
divorce should be granted.)

446
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,470
Hello.

447
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,560
Hello.

448
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,750
It's been repaired nicely.

449
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,790
Installed a box for it

450
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,720
for your convenience to view.

451
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,230
Thank you.

452
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,390
You're welcome.

453
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,860
(Evidence  for Ms. He's divorce case)

454
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,310
Lawyer Ning,

455
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,550
you must keep these evidence safe.

456
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,240
Make sure no one else sees it.

457
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,960
Why did you post those photos online?

458
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,920
Didn't you promise me

459
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,030
to keep those photos safe?

460
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,290
(Dear, what are you doing?)
But I didn't post them.

461
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,610
(Then I'll buy this set.)
It wasn't me who posted them.

462
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,200
(Thank you for the flowers.)
But these photos are only with me.

463
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,640
(My wife is not at home today.)
I don't know what's going on.

464
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,490
Yue,

465
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
your computer has been repaired.

466
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,960
There's no major issue.

467
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,320
That's great.

468
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,480
Thank you, Zhu.

469
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,700
(Bindao Airport Service Desk)

470
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,190
Yue.

471
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,680
Take the seat, Zhu.

472
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,630
Xia told me you are leaving today.

473
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,390
So I thought I'd come to see you off.

474
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,390
Is everything arranged?

475
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,710
This

476
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,910
is for you.

477
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,150
You like to drink.

478
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,310
And your schedule isn't regular.

479
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,150
There'll be social engagements.

480
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,280
Just prepare first.

481
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:08,890
Yue…

482
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,630
Actually, you don't need to avoid me.

483
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,440
I already know.

484
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Yue,

485
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,280
I didn't expect things out of hand.

486
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,600
I'm sorry.

487
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,710
It's okay.

488
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,280
Hu Cheng has already told me.

489
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,720
He asked you to take care of me.

490
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,720
This has nothing to do with you.

491
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,430
Besides,

492
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,150
those things online

493
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,310
are just like that.

494
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,630
Once they are uploaded,

495
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,150
they cause a huge commotion,

496
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,760
but later on,

497
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,920
no one cares anymore.

498
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:45,710
Yes.

499
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,150
My husband, you see,

500
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,830
worries too much,

501
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,040
meddling in everything.

502
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,600
He's very considerate in every aspect.

503
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,190
Sometimes I find him annoying,

504
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,480
too fond of getting involved.

505
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,310
But you have to know,

506
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,310
after all, we are a couple.

507
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,870
When a couple is together,

508
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,800
no matter how they act or fuss,

509
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,630
in the end,

510
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,510
they will eventually reconcile.

511
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,710
But it dragged you into it,

512
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,000
making you awkward.

513
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,510
Actually,

514
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,230
Mr. Hu regretted it quite a bit later.

515
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
If he had known the kid was so extreme,

516
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,920
he'd not have let me release the photos.

517
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,880
You've been wronged,

518
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,880
Zhu.

519
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,550
Don't say that, Yue.

520
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,670
Caused you so much harm,

521
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,680
I

522
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,070
have always felt quite guilty.

523
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,480
But Mr. Hu really cares about you.

524
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,430
He doesn't want you to be so exhausted.

525
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,920
He has mentioned many times

526
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,070
that he hopes you can return home.

527
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,270
But

528
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,840
you are too dedicated to your work.

529
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,070
He has no choice

530
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,720
but

531
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,670
want you

532
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,510
to make a small mistake

533
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,440
at work,

534
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
and then…

535
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,510
Right.

536
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,640
Going home

537
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,070
is quite nice.

538
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,800
Going home…

539
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,270
I have to board the plane now.

540
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Then hurry up and go.

541
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,550
Wish you

542
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,840
a safe journey.

543
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,030
May your future be bright.

544
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,270
Thank you, Yue.

545
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,430
By the way, Zhu,

546
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
when did Manager Tian

547
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,630
start collaborating with Yaofeng?

548
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
Half a year ago.

549
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,760
Yue,

550
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,840
Mr. Hu values family greatly.

551
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,920
What he cares about the most is

552
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
only you.

553
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,230
Mr. Hu really cares about you.

554
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,280
He doesn't want you to be so exhausted.

555
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,800
He has mentioned many times

556
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,670
that he hopes you can return home.

557
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,440
Mr. Hu regretted it quite a bit later.

558
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,750
If he had known the kid was so extreme,

559
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,590
he'd not have let me release the photos.

560
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,230
Slow down.

561
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,630
Senior brother.

562
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
- Senior brother.
- Alright.

563
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,630
- Speak with your conscience.
- Here, slow down.

564
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,360
- I…
- How do I treat Song?

565
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,670
That's absolutely beyond question.

566
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,840
That's really considerate.

567
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,920
He sent me a message today to thank you.

568
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,760
Really.

569
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,110
Come here, sit on the sofa.

570
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,720
- Senior brother.
- Song…

571
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,070
Yue, sorry about that.

572
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,040
He signed a big order today.

573
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,400
He got so happy that he drank too much.

574
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,360
You know,

575
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,070
I really can't stop him.

576
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,360
- I'll go get a towel.
- Alright.

577
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,800
Song,

578
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,640
is

579
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,880
just like a dog.

580
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,440
If it weren't for my promotion,

581
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,590
could he have reached where he is today,

582
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,520
taking this position?

583
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,390
Yet he

584
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,630
still wants to sue me.

585
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,550
He is simply a viper.

586
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,960
A viper worse than a dog.

587
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,710
Alright, that's enough.

588
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,630
Stop messing around.

589
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,480
Yue is waiting here for you.

590
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,400
If you keep this up, she'll get angry.

591
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,670
I call the shots in this house.

592
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,750
Yes, yes.

593
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,070
Senior brother.

594
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,720
So,

595
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,670
you must never betray me.

596
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
Do you understand?

597
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,040
You know how they ended up.

598
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,070
As long as we are on the same front,

599
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,320
what is mine is yours.

600
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,590
If you betray me,

601
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,230
what is mine is mine,

602
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
and yours

603
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,360
is also mine.

604
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,550
He drank too much and talked nonsense.

605
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,710
Don't take it to heart.

606
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,990
I know.

607
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,110
It's all drunken talk.

608
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,800
Don't betray me.

609
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,550
Who dares to betray me?

610
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,150
It's all mine.

611
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,020
(Deep Blue Apartment)

612
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,590
Got up?

613
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,680
Honey.

614
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,070
You're dressed like this.

615
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,360
Where are you going?

616
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,000
I'm going to the supermarket.

617
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,950
Honey water.

618
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,840
Honey,

619
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,360
yesterday morning,

620
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,820
what were you going to tell me?

621
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,150
I wasn't going to tell you anything.

622
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,270
Did you drink too much and get confused?

623
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,840
I'll be back soon.

624
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Some time ago,

625
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,070
I saw the news about that child online.

626
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,840
It mentioned a public interest lawyer.

627
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,550
I was wondering

628
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,590
could it be you?

629
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,670
I really didn't expect it.

630
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,880
The child's mother's experience,

631
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,400
would happen to me so soon.

632
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,440
You just said

633
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,550
you want a divorce,

634
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,040
are you serious?

635
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,630
Although many men have been cheating,

636
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,360
they do not want a divorce.

637
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,440
I have said the exact same words

638
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
to the person involved as well.

639
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,550
The photos of that child's father

640
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,670
were posted online by my husband.

641
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,070
Therefore, what I am facing

642
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,150
is not just cheating.

643
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,320
Mom just finished trimming the plants,

644
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,840
and they sprouted again so quickly.

645
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,670
The vitality is really strong.

646
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,960
We should be like this as well.

647
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,800
We need to become strong.

648
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,320
We need to become competitive.

649
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,710
Only then

650
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,400
can we have a place in society.

651
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,110
However,

652
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,000
Mom said

653
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,270
when there are too many algae,

654
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,440
you can't see anything.

655
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,920
Do you know why we need aquatic plants

656
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,520
though they are so difficult to manage?

657
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,590
Because this fish tank

658
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,740
cannot do without that touch of

659
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,800
green.

660
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,720
Dad,

661
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,630
when will Mom be back?

662
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah,

663
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,040
what time is it already?

664
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,360
Let's

665
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,320
give Mom a surprise, shall we?

666
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,800
Okay.

667
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,760
